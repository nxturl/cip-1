it hi CH McDonald can you hear me good morning yes I can great I'm gonna put the volume up a little higher thanks Abby for getting us absolutely oops where' I go I'm gonna do a a slide test just to make sure you all can see my computer Jenny thanks for joining us thanks for having us can you hear us all right uh we can Jenny how do you pronounce your last name it's ker ker there we go thank oops commissioner Bowski I'm just checking if you can see the slides yes great yes look I'll be right Abby can you check with uh Mary morins to see if she's representing Northwest Natural today and then if so um Elevate her yeah absolutely um let me see if I can unmute here Mary are you uh presenting Northwest Natural today and if so I can go ahead and make you a panelist maybe she's away from her desk oh looks like she put it in the chat perfect I'll go ahead and promote great we'll give folks a few more to sign Dr rasmason are you there with the with Jenny yes I am excellent thank you welcome thanks sorry we had a struggle finding the mute button that chair McDonald it also looks like we have a couple phone uh callers and wondering if um maybe before we get started folks can identify in case we need to promote anyone um that sounds right to me Zach thank you okay uh it looks like there's a uh one phone caller with a 503 area code if you could just let us know uh if you're a panelist that'd be great good morning uh this is H Julie FES from Oregon Health Authority great awesome and I I think Julie uh you're uh sitting in for Oregon Health authorities um uh seat on the on the commission here so we'll uh make sure to watch your your number in case you have questions or want to input great thank you yeah thank you for joining us today and I apologize I missed your last name uh C quentes because do you want me to spell it sure sure okay it's s and Sam I F and Frank u Tes great sentus thank you well thanks and it looks like we have two other callers so uh there's a caller with a 971 area code if you want to let us know if you're uh representing an agency or a commission seat he Zach it's Jessica Rikers from the organ Department of energy hey that's awesome hey Jessica thanks for joining all right and then the last one is a 541 area code Zach this is can you hear me Zach this is rep ly and it's 54151 5557 is mine okay awesome we've got you thank you thanks for okay well thank you to everyone who is uh was able to join us today I'd like to um open the October 9th meeting of the Oregon global warming commission um and I'd like to call it to order um today we uh observe indigenous people's day and I am joining the meeting today from Portland and Portland rests on the traditional Village sites of the MoMA Cathlamet Clackamus fans of the shinook twon kalapuya Malala and many other tribes who made their home along the Columbia and Lam River uh I hope that Commissioners and members of the public joining us were able to take some time earlier today to reflect on and honor the contributions Native Americans have made and um their res resilience uh in the face of quite a bit of adversity um over Generations so I um just wanted to acknowledge that today uh and um encourage people to take time to to reflect and honor um people uh thank you um as I said in August I really appreciate the new resources and responsibilities the legislature assigned the commission and Odo on our behalf and um and we're uh excited to start um to get that work going and and um to step up to those responsibilities uh today uh next slide please today we're going to um oh sorry I wanted to go thank you um today we're going to uh hear from staff uh who will provide provide an update on kind of the status of our commission membership uh the status of work being done to advance the new areas of responsibility we are taking on as part of uh House Bill 349 as well as an overview of comments that we received on the draft work plan and some early staff responses to those comments in addition we'll be hearing from colleagues uh from the Oregon climate change Research Institute the Oregon coordinating Council on ocean acidification and hypoxia and uh the Public Utility Commission uh so we appreciate and we have some special guests here with us today to make these um some of these presentations after a few more uh introductory remarks we'll take roll call and then after roll call I'll invite commission members uh to provide additional updates if if there are are any um for the good of the order uh regarding public comment we will have time for public comment in today's meeting estimated to occur around 2:30 uh could be a little sooner or a little later um Abby and Zach will you remind people how they can let us know what they that they want to testify and um how they go about doing that absolutely there's a couple of options um if you do if you would like to make a comment or ask a question um down at the bottom of your screens there should be like a little smiley face and then a hand next to it if you click on that hand it'll raise your hand um and then we can if that'll notify us that you're wanting to make a comment um there's also a little chat feature it's like a little speech bubble and you can type it into the chat if you're more comfortable doing that as well thank you I'm just taking stock on who may have joined us since the opening remarks and then um I'll do roll call so so um in terms of voting members I'll start with the voting members of and then go to the non-voting members here uh commissioner Ford here commissioner Sharon present uh Mary morins representing uh commissioner Anderson we'll come back um and then on the the non voting members commissioner here director Benner here director baitman I'm um Julie sentes repr representing uh the Oregon Authority uh Colin MCC representing DEQ Colin mccon yeah yes I'm here I'm trying to unmute myself are you able to hear me thank you yeah Suzanne Carlson representing the Department of Transportation um Garrett Martin representing the Pu I'm here excellent thank you and Judith kins representing Oregon Department of Agriculture hello I'm here thank you did I miss anyone I don't think we heard Mary Morin but we we talked to her earlier so oh there there she is we will acknowledge you are here thank you so much uh and with that I'll turn things over or I open things up if anybody has any comments that you'd like to make commissioner bener hi thank you um I'm happy to provide an update I know that uh the Odo team will be talking a lot about the work we will be undertaking as part of the global warming commission modernization Bill and natural and working lands um I just wanted to flag a couple more things that we're working on that might be of interest to folks on this call um we are about to launch the uh devel velopment of an uh energy security plan as required by the legislature in 2022 as well as by some some of our federal funding and we're working closely with the Oregon pu on that I think there will be an official launch on Monday next Monday um we are also going to be launching next month I believe um a kickoff of our energy strategy so another bill that passed in the 2023 session was um a bill to require the Oregon Department of energy to put together an energy strategy to look at how we're going to meet our long-term goals and how to um sort of think about and weigh the trade-offs between various Pathways uh so we will be likely coming back to this group when we get that underway to talk about um your thoughts on the energy strategy um we're also uh going to be putting together a building performance standards program um and then if you're curious about Federal funding lots of that coming in lots of programs um getting launched slowly but surely and I can put in a link to our website our federal funding page we try to keep that updated with um information on both what are the federal funds available for energy and climate for oregonians and then also what is the Oregon Department of energy um doing to bring funding to our agency and the state for energy and climate Solutions happy to answer any questions on chat um if you like thanks thanks director Benner um I assume both of these um projects that you're that you mentioned the energy security planning and the strategy are those running along the same timelines and I assume they'll be kind of um intersecting uh work or they will inform each other is that correct absolutely they will be informing each other um the time timelines are slightly different related to the deadlines in in bills and in federal funding but um yes they will be informing each other that's great those I think will be in incredibly helpful um in making sure that we stay on track and and make really good decisions as we move forward on how to how to best meet our energy needs so thank you for letting us know that any other questions for director any other updates that people want to share commission members yes this is commissioner rman I I was just wanting to respond to the commentary about how Pro possibly uh we're not able to meet our goals and and I just want to speak for the natural and and working land sector uh it's just there's a lot of metrics that that really we haven't addressed we haven't measured what we're doing but I just know from observation that we've made a lot of progress that that is not accounted for I think that we need to remember that that that there's a lot of change happening that's not been measured and so uh don't give up hope absolutely no I I am very hopeful on on both fronts just um recognizing that um it's great to have these additional eort efforts to help us make the best decisions we can make so agree you any other updates or questions comments um yes this is Brenda baitman um director at dlcd I just wanted to follow on those",

        "text": " both in europe and it's not explicitly included in the current set of briefs primarily it's primarily through the we we identified the quote hot topics through stakeholder outreach and that topic was included but it was ranked fairly low at the current time when we were doing that outreach um so it's included in the sense that we're and gathering all the literature from it and we plan to investigate how to best implement any research recommendations coming out of type of work but it's not a current part of the the synthesis effort that we have a educational research brief about i would add that as part of the work that we're initiating now which is generate is understanding the data gaps and generating research recommendations is this is a really nice place to information like the wind shadow effect and how that may um coincide with upwelling or other nutrient distribution patterns offshore and if that's an item that is of interest for additional research recommendations whether it's just doing desktop review of past work or actually doing field work or lab work it's something that i think is worthwhile including so um karen i i'll browse through our invitation list for the pacific coast workshop to make sure you're included and if you're not if you wouldn't mind sending me an email marks every pnnl.gov um just to make sure we can connect between our teams and get you involved in some of that work if possible thank you thanks for the question karen i think if you hit star 3 it'll lower your hand again um there's another question in the chat from dave i think it's to andy the gld goes out to 500 fathoms 914 meters and the boem call area go out to 1300 meters can you describe how federal consistency would be handled for a development that occurs between 914 meters and 1300 meters yeah dave thanks for that question um when we were developing our gld we didn't envision offshore wind potentially going out to the depths that the planning area actually included so if an application or at least falls outside of our gld location then we would be required to ask noah for the ability to review that project consistent with reasonably foreseeable effects that the state identified so we would have to uh request in in writing for that to occur but then we would have the the ability to apply federal consistency once noah uh and if noah grants that request which i would expect it to do can i add an additional point in that um within bones regulations that there is not to the gld but in current regulations boom requires federal consistency review at particular points as well so there um even if it didn't come from the state side through the request with with noaa and approved program it is within um bones regulations to have federal consistency review i'm not seeing any other questions in the chat yet but i'll kind of pause to see if others are thinking um just checking to see if there's any raised hands from our host and if not that's okay we have a few more slides from jason on the themes that have been synthesized from the comments received so far on this topic okay not seeing any raised hands there in the chat so i think that we're good to go ahead and then we'll pause again after jason slides for more discussion on this permitting exciting and permitting topic go ahead jason thank you all a little sunny here sorry too sunny you never heard a portlander or somebody from oregon say okay uh turning to um the feedback we received so a refresher on the key topics um the numbers on the slide here correlate to the numbering system that was used for um the entire set of those prompting questions we asked for feedback on so if people wanted to you know follow along if it's helpful guidance to kind of like correlate that that's what those numbers are and you'll see those on the slides for the rest of the topics today too and so in the questions we asked um you know questions about key topics related to citing and permitting so gaps in citing and programming processes potentially that could prevent an adequate assessment of potential impacts we were interested in hearing information on that and these other gaps in data that could prevent an adequate assessment for any potential effects of flooding offshore wind projects whether people have particular concerns they that may not be adequately addressed in these processes we asked for information about best practices that floating offshore wind could use to avoid minimize mitigate monitor potential effects and we asked about specific recommendations that could be useful in addressing potential um so there are many references to the potential for cumulative effects on the ocean ecosystem and ocean users stakeholders with a variety of interests are interested in cumulative development scale of any potential offshore wind development is an important consideration for assessing the potential cumulative effects as well as potential effects oh potential effects to you know there's a lot of different ways these could play out um ecosystems and marine species for example um as well as potential effects for fishing industries and other industries tied to tourism and recreation um and also the effects economies of scale could have for offshore one of the supply chains too so there's lots of different facets of cumulative effects the graphic to the right shows an example of the east coast lease areas and their potential for build out based on state offshore wind goals are known as projects um the potential chemical effects that offshore wind could have is important and more energy forecasting and modeling will help give a picture of the potential scale that offshore wind could help achieve um to me could help that would um cumulative effects um you know we'll get a better picture of that um once there's more modeling and analysis in the energy sector to kind of see how offshore wind could help achieve clean energy commitments of various states we also received references to data gaps so references to the wildlife impact data being particularly data and analysis on the economic value fishery activities and industries including seafood and fishery-related tourism information was raised about a noaa study looking into the full economic value of fisheries across the west coast to support conversations and processes with offshore wind data on sensitive habitats and subsidy geology is incomplete there was comments on that also comments on social economic data and effects on jobs tied to floating offshore wind and potentially negative effects to other industries like fishing depths considered in the bone process so far have been mostly constrained to within 1300 meters and there's interest in learning more about the viability of offshore wind in deeper waters so we heard the depths greater than 1300 meters could also help avoid frequented fishery areas several portions of feedback received raised particular concerns for losses that could be incurred from ocean areas that could have could be excluded from access as a result of offshore wind concern for losses in the form of economic losses for existing industries concern for lost food security and decreases in supplies of seafood and concern for lost recreational opportunities were all examples concerns were raised about the potential for ecosystem effects like impacts to sensitive coastal habitats and seafloor habitats that could be affected by mooring lands and export cables there were height concerns raised heights of new structures could have effects for air traffic for example both civilian and military airways and these could happen both at sea with tall offshore wind blade tip heights and potentially onshore transmission upgrades were to require taller tile taller towers for example um we had that question about best practices so um one of them one of the feedback we rece one of the portions of feedback we received actually several identified this first one extensive cooperative data sharing that data sharing could help fill in data gaps and ensure the best available science is being used there was feedback on fisheries mitigation fund the idea for that i think that has been explored and implemented in other parts of the country or the world um comprehensive permanent permitting to help identify the key jurisdictions processes phases and timelines and to give a good overview of of kind of those those aspects and processes that could be used as a starting point for something like there's also lots to learn from europe and east coast states who are working through many of the same issues that the west coast could face especially around engagement efforts multi-state collaboration and data sharing and best practices for balancing ocean uses lots of atlantic states working on offshore wind the link to the right is an example of the work new york has done an offshore wind with respect to road map and master planning and includes a report about how it assessed cumulative effects we also received positive feedback on the engagement efforts related to the pac wave energy research projects off the coast of newport and wallport and this was pointed to as another opportunity to gain insight and rate and use of the model for engagement with coastal communities on offshore wind there was some common themes around the recommendations that we heard um some of the feedback we received came down on different perspectives there was some feedback about the idea for allowing more time in the in the leasing and citing process to potentially allow for time for you know additional research and data gaps to be filled there was also kind of a different view of that of that same topic more along the lines of acknowledging the data gaps and developing measures for additional data gathering and monitoring around those gaps you know measures that would help ensure future flexibility to develop practices that would help avoid mitigate and adaptively manage potential unknown impacts and then funding to fill data gaps was was was common feedback avoiding rocky habitat i think that has been raised in the bone process as well the bone morgan task force work pursuing floating offshore went to deeper depths i mentioned that and more community engagement consistent feedback the importance and significance of doing community engagement down the coast in other parts of oregon that might be affected from floating offshore wind so i'll turn it to ruchi um i'm going to use user help for um kind of these you'll see other slides like this that are kind of the signal that this would be the time to raise your hand if you haven't already or indicated in chat that you may have a question or some additional feedback you'd like to provide here so i'll turn it over to richie she's great at this thanks jason um we did see a hand raised from mike uh mike if you still have your hand raised about this topic um you can press star six or actually you're on their computer so um we can un unmute you and you can ask your question it looks like you're admitted now mike if you'd like to go ahead okay um thank you for the opportunity to comment want to go back to karen's statement for just a moment or two i",

just want to make sure that uh you know your time is important I recognize that and I want you guys having to sit around any longer than you need to can everybody hear that yep is that okay test test mic check mic check check okay we're good okay folks I think we're gonna get started now all right good afternoon everybody um Nancy you got the slideshow up thank you well thank you everybody for coming I want to want to Echo what my what Todd Cornett said we really appreciate everyone coming here for the record my name is Chase McVay Walker I'm a senior siting analyst with the Oregon Department of energy and I'm also joined uh my colleagues here Jenny kalas our communications director is over there at the uh big monitor screen we have Nancy Hatcher division administrative assistant in the back and she's going to be helping go through the slides and if you have any comment cards please get them to Nancy and she'll bring him up here to us for Q a after the Todd Cornett uh assistant director of sighting for the Oregon Department of energy and I'm also joined by Wally Adams behind me operations and policy analyst in the siding division So today we're here to kick off uh the public information meeting for the Muddy Creek energy Park proposed um today this info meeting it's not a contested case hearing but it is an opportunity to explain the notice of intent process and provide a general overview of the citing process as well as a general overview of the Muddy Creek of the proposed facility Muddy Creek energy Park um next slide please Nancy so an overall agenda for today we're going to uh go over an energy facility citing process overview where the Oregon Department of energy with the then we'll move on to uh the proposed facility overview where the applicant will provide an overview of the proposed and we'll conclude with a q a session this is where the public will have an opportunity to ask questions about the proposed facility and and also about the review process next slide please Nancy on May 19th of this year the Oregon Department of energy received a notice of intent let's see I think if you if you want uh if you want a comment card there over yeah they're over to the at the beginning so on May 19th of this year the Oregon Department of energy received a notice of intent to file an application for a site certificate for the Muddy Creek energy Park which is being proposed as a 199 megawatt solar PV and battery storage project the submission of the notice of intent is the very first step in the process of of obtaining a site certificate from the Oregon Department of energies facility citing Council the notice of intent was submitted by the applicant Muddy Creek energy Park LLC a wholly owned subsidiary of onwa Q cells use core who are also here tonight I already mentioned I do want to reiterate that or request that please hold the presidency material they want to get through they want to make sure that we have time for comments at the end of the uh at the end of the meeting next slide okay so what is and who are the Oregon energy facility citing program the sighting division at the Oregon Department of energy serves as technical staff in support of the energy facility citing Council review of both applications and amendments for site as long as the founder energy facility citing Council jurisdiction the energy facility citing Council process is set forth organ administrative rules and Oregon revised statutes and has a set of 16 General standards for review citing division staff assist in the review and evaluation of all applicable energy facility siding Council standards that must be met in order for an applicant to obtain a site certificate next slide please before a jurisdictional facility is built in Oregon the developer must apply for a site certificate from and facility citing Council the types of energy facilities subject to council jurisdiction are defined in Oregon revised statute 469-300 the definition of energy facility located within the Oregon revised statute on the screen here is what establishes for solar facilities and focused on high value farmland and is greater than a hundred and 160 Acres it's to energy facilities for supplies the state's citing process is a standards-based process There are 16 generals standards that every project has to meet and then some additional standards related to a specific type to specific types of projects in order to be approved the process is is uh it's it's a burden of proof it's the applicant's burden of proof to provide evidence on the record to prove that they meet meet each of these standards it's the Department's role to evaluate the evidence provided in addition to any from State agencies and local governments to determine whether or not the applicant has met the burden of proof for each standard we then make our recommendation to the energy facility citing Council who evaluates all the information in the record to then come to their uh decision because we're we're here at the notice of intense stage we seek any type of comment from anyone that wants that they won't they would that they would would like to provide when we get to the next stage of our focusing comments on the standards is more important since the energy facility citing council's Authority is limited to those standards and by focusing the comments at the next stage in our process they're able it's easier to value those comments as they relate to a standard and can be folded into uh the F6 to approve or deny the project next slide please all right we're gonna do a little switch over to me so again I want to thank everybody for coming tonight um so you know we do a fair number of projects early on in the process we don't know if there's going to be any um or interest and quickly we didn't get it right this time um so my apologies for that my apologies also for getting uh stop during Harvest I wish that we got on as well was not intentional certainly um so we basically we learn along the way we haven't had a project here before um so we would appreciate any uh any ideas on a better bigger location for the next time there will be some addition lines outside where we have public information meetings where we have public hearing where we will be in close proximity to the facility if anybody has a better this room because clearly there's a lot of interesting opportunity for people to show up learn about the project participate in it um but again apologies we we didn't get this right and um just bear with us and we'll we'll try to get through this today and give you all the information that we're trying to get to you and hopefully you can give us all the information that you want to give us as well I also want to point out um Chase did uh introduction um Cindy Condon who is an energy facility citing council member is somewhere in the room was some well there she is so Chase talked about it so we Chase and I um and the others within the department of energy we're staff I'm the Council secretary so I'm the lead staff to the energy facility citing Council we're not the decision makers the energy facility citing Council are the decision makers um and Cindy's here we may have another council member or two on the line as well I'm not sure at this point um so getting into this slide um we use the slide to show the major steps in our process there are seven major steps in our process and I think um the biggest thing that I want you to take away from today is we're at the very beginning um there's we don't have an application we don't have a decision there is we are at the very very very beginning of the process and so that's why we have this in red um we're at What's called the notice of so think about it as a pre-application the applicant has not yet submitted their application to us the notice of intent is just a high level desktop level kind of evaluation of project location in the site it allows us the department of energy to determine you know what are the issues what are the concerns that process allows us to provide public notice to see public comment like we're doing tonight and the comment period ends in two weeks so you still have more opportunity if you don't want to comment tonight you can comment later on allows us to get that information from you from the local government from State agencies from tribal governments so it allows us to seek a lot of information which we don't know right now and we recognize that we don't live here we don't know all the details of this particular location that's what our process is about okay so with that again the notice of intent stage and so what that means is the applicant submits their notice of intent we provided a public notice hopefully you got that we have an opportunity to submit or to sign up to receive email notices if you received a paper notice you will continue to get paper notices because you're within a certain distance of the pro project location you can sign up to receive email notices as well if that's your preference we've got that signed up or set up there and we do have at least one we have Department of Agriculture here today so natural resource agencies seeking their input throughout this process so that's what we're to do today um like I said the next step is the project order it's the next Chevron on here that is the laundry list of us saying to the applicant or this project in this location these are all the requirements that you have to meet meaning you have to submit all of this within your application we will review that we'll give you an opportunity to review that the next stage is the preliminary application so you can see up there there's a preliminary application for site certificate and an application for site certificate that's what the pasc and the ASC preliminary means that when they submit that to us we evaluated to determine whether or not it's complete did they submit everything that we had requested now that's not a public comment time frame when the application is deemed complete once we say you have submitted everything that we need you to submit that doesn't mean it's ready for approval a lot of times people equate one with the other it's not that it just means that we have enough information to evaluate at that point once it's complete we will do another full notice like we we will have another public information meeting like this in a bigger location and not during Harvest time so we will do that better but that'll be an",

        "text": " where the site certificate holder could come back to you without having you go into an amendment and say we got an amendment that had you know three separate as aspects that we were going to build and we only ended up building one or two of those and being able to reconcile those differences in the site certificate without going through an amendment process or working with you guys to do that so that we're not being held for compliance issues on things we haven't developed do that make sense yeah I mean that's I don't I don't have I don't have the answers right this second but that's definitely something that I uh that we're thinking about and to the extent you care about this issue you should think about as well um so yeah I I agree that's that's something that we're looking at um so yeah that's that's going to be some of these are definitely a lot more complicated than others um that's one that's definitely one of the more uh complex issues I think at this point I do think there's a a way forward but it's not necessarily um we're not going to just get there without thinking about it um so uh there's probably needs to be some additional Clarity on what informations must submit in the preliminary request for Amendment as well as whe when they want to submit a request DET terminated a size certificate right right now the current description of what has to be submitted is isn't very specific so um just to kind of Aid in the process and make sure we do a good job uh it probably makes sense to provide some additional guidance on what actually has to be in those um documents um to uh yeah adequately process them in a timely fashion um so oh and I'm just clicking next slide but yeah as people have been raising your hands that's great feel free to just raise your hand or or um if you have any uh thoughts but about any of the things we're talking about here so uh probably needs to we probably need to address some issues around incorporation of evidence by the applicant right now it just basically it says that you can and so obviously you know logically rationally uh applicants do they say you know we meet this requirement because we met it before we're not really changing anything see see the previous thing and uh see the application which is perfectly allowable by the rules but the pro the problem that it it does is it sort of Forces Staff to go back and say like well do it does it is this accurate you know we don't just rubber stamp you know things that are submitted we we verify uh so it makes the verification process challenging um and then the p and then the public who's already sort of like you know this is this is already very challenging and difficult for for the public to sort of get their heads around um to the extent they want to participate and identify that maybe wen't you know the prior evidence doesn't support that the amendment meets the standard so we definitely feel like you know you can control C control V like you could you can grab what you had before but but we do feel like maybe there should be some additional rule language that says that you need to specifically identify what it is you're relying on in the prior record to support your claim that the amendment also meets the standards of the original application um so you know how do we efficient again this is one of the major reasons why we have an amendment process a lot of work was previously done that could apply to the existing to the amendment um and and if it if it does apply then you should be able to grab it or rely on it but from a practical standpoint how do we how do we create rules that that make that so that people who are reviewing the amendment application don't have to figure out where all that stuff is to see if they agree so hopefully that's that's clear but that's you know I think that's maybe this one's that one's less complicated but it is I do I do think a significant one um so we feel like there should be some additional role language relating or or some updated Ro language around the notice requirements uh again this sort of related to the application submission issue we have more flexibility because it's an amendment so you know does it make sense to maybe simplify this process given the reality of how information is shared in 2024 um you know is is email sufficient for the initial notice um should all reviewing agencies be required to be not this is the complete sort of separate issue should all reviewing agencies be required to be notified throughout the process so it sort of currently lays out that they are but does that make sense should um staff be allowed to sort of identify well only this is only relevant to two agencies so we're only going to notify these two there's pros and cons to both approaches um but this that's another thing we wanted to look at um and then we want to consider potentially giving Council Greater flexibility regarding iners meetings currently the rules basically stay that it has to be in person which is also true of of uh regular application but and that is the goal you know we we like you know it's a lot of work but we do like having the sort of local the meetings that are tied you know in the area of the project to provide people an opportunity to show up to to speak to Council in person but you know what if there's an ice storm or something like and we feel like a specific meeting isn't super duper important so should we have give C Council Greater flexibility in the rules to allow for uh remote uh meetings um so that's just a question I you know propose to the rack to consider uh we can talk about that some more future meeting um so so there's going to be some discussion I'm sure around the contested case trigger the contested case process um the fact that it's not mandatory what is what are the implications of that um should it be mandatory there's I mean there there are re there are pros and cons to it being mandatory from uh I I think from both from a developer side and from a um side of the public public so I'm that's this is a rhetorical question at this point I I want you to think about that but um yeah sort of think about questions related to the contested case process and how the how it's described in the in the amendment rules and should we should we change it so there and I should say you know I've had I've had discussions with the staff um the sighting staff on a lot of these and there are differences of opinion so the people who are sort of tasked with admin with administering this process uh themselves you know who don't have a a horse in the race as it were uh have differences of opinion on these so I I imagine there's going to be even bigger differences of opinion amongst the members of the rack but um just just as an FYI um consider adding language around construction completion deadlines currently there isn't any um there are construction there are deadlines for beginning the construction but there's nothing about about actually completing it this is sort of related to the other issue about phasing um so that's certainly something we would want to keep in mind um you know I'm just throwing this out there we could have something like you know when you do the amendment you you you say like we're going to do this in three phases so you'd have three deadlines so it's we can be flexible it doesn't have to necessarily you know be uh you know super simple or Draconian um and then um so there's some issues the the rules are currently there's 's a rule in there about requests um by persons for amendment to apply later adopted laws um because tradition you know the way it's laid out the side certificate is subject to the laws that were in existence at the time the uh certificate was granted for the most part with some exceptions um there's a process for sort of Shifting the window um like who P who pays how's that paid for um um is sort of a tricky situation in the in the rules right now so uh maybe considering looking at that and and figuring out how to apply that fairly um yeah so that was a lot that was me just that that was like I think 30 minutes or so of of me just saying them and not even really that that thoroughly I mean I I sort of Zoom through this so you can imagine that we could have that's a future point we could have entire racks where we discuss what H you know what language should trigger an amendment you know what's an appropriate you know what's appropriate for an amendment uh you know that could be literally that could be the whole rack so I'm I'm gonna be we're going to be very flexible uh in terms of how we go about this um I'm I'm probably going to make some mistakes here uh when we're all done I I'm sure I'll look back and say well we probably could have made that two meetings or or whatever but I'm going to do my very best and I'm and if you guys have thoughts or feelings or like hey I feel like we should have a meeting on just this topic or or we should um you know stop talking about this other topic that we wasted a bunch of time on um this is uh it's not a democracy but I am I am looking to to the rack members to kind of hear your feed back in terms of what you feel like is is valuable and useful or whether you feel like you know we're wasting time or we should sort of move on um so please give me that feedback uh and uh yeah um so in in the email I sent about this direct meeting I I I requested that people sort of raise any additional or sort of look at bringing up additional thoughts or feelings of this meeting if you're not ready for that yet um that's totally fine um but if and and you'll see in terms of next steps what I you know what my thoughts are in terms of like how we should approach this the issue of rack issues um with the amendment rules um but I did want to provide some opportunity now for anybody to sort of add to the list I mean I I gave a bunch of stuff but if anybody has any sort of additional issues other than the ones that I raised or um maybe nuanced takes on on some of the issues that I brought up not necessarily Solutions per se but like framing of the issue or some additional thoughts that that you want people to consider when thinking about how to you know analyze these issues and figuring out a way forward so I'm sort of opening",

        "text": " right on track there the expenditures are at 40% again they should be at 50% less the capital fund we're at 30% of Revenue um which you know much of that was due to the the U battery electric buses in the first quarter so the quarter 2 numbers are year-to-date numbers the expenses are at 44% and in this last quarter some of our expenditures were for the battery electric bus infrastructure the contactless fair payment system the for expansion buses the transit signal priority work technology equipment and South Salem Transit Center so we've had a lot going on uh in Q2 and as far as the Strategic plan we heard tonight about all of the wonderful work that is being done um but this is this is where we're at as far as what we have spent on it so far this year the uh climate action plan the procurement will begin in quarter 3 so we have nothing for that yet as of quarter 2 um the battery electric buses the total that we have spent for buses and infrastructure through quarter two are $1.5 million the surveys that we also saw tonight um obviously those expenses will come through in quarter three the efair implementation um that project is now complete and the expenses total year-to date that we paid for that were $182,000 the Chariots intelligent transportation system we have not yet um had any expenditures for that but the project has begun I believe that the first invoice just came in um recently so nothing in Q2 the clean and safe passenger amenities so the additional facilities maintenance staff that were hired through this last budget process year-to date we have spent $45,000 on that additional labor to keep those those um amenities uh clean for our passengers and then of course the employee engagement survey is scheduled Q4 are there any questions that I could answer any questions for chief Laro I have one question and maybe one request um for the if I heard you correctly the fraud and non-compliance the annual review um with that now being completed in Q3 as opposed to Q2 did we miss any de lines with that no we filed an extension excellent perfect um and then my one request is um and and feel free to if you if I obviously I don't expect you to have these these answers now but as we have you know talked about property taxes and the impact that they've had on our district I I would love a better understanding of what that impact is and so in my mind um um the delta or the difference between what the real market value is within our Urban growth boundary of properties versus what the assessed value is um I can make some guesses on what that is but I I'd love a number um I I would hope that the individual County Assessor offices could readily provide that information and then um compression that's the other piece here especially on the east side of the river that I'm wondering how much we're losing out to compression there um so that's just a request that for my better understanding since we're so dependent on property taxes right now absolutely great thank you other questions okay thank you very much thank you we'll go ahead and proceed to the general manager's report yes thank you I do have a a couple items so first you should have in your spaces to your uh talking points and notes uh uh for District activities and I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the survey results uh that you heard earlier tonight um and I'll use the I use the the Kansas City example um as our presenter was from Kansas City and the Chiefs have went back to back and are looking for three peats uh I would suggest that chariots has already three peated uh by uh the three waves you know anyone could have a good day or a bad day but the having three waves of survey results that show generally consistent uh results shows it's not a fluke it's it's how we do things at chariots and uh uh we should all be proud proud of that um and rightfully so we recognize the the Frontline workers the the transit operators and customer service folks uh but it really takes a total team effort to make those kinds of things happen uh for example um and rightfully they they are the front line and they get the direct impact uh but for example uh the rest of the team can have a huge impact on on those scores and we don't do any of this for a good score the score is the the reward for what we do every day but uh just to give you an idea because uh I want to make sure we we recognize the whole team and and we're doing that so next month we're recognizing Transit operators and maintenance folks on Transit operator maintenance appreciation day and then the next month we're having organization wide uh Employee Appreciation Day CU because of that team effort so I always think for example the operator who may have a sick family member who's having trouble with their health insurance and they come to HR and they uh work with the benefits administrator to help get all that sorted out well that has a direct impact on the impact they make on the customer because they walk away feel feeling good that their organization's taking care of them and they're passing that be that feeling into their customer interaction vice versa if it's a bad experience they could have a bad one so I would suggest everything that every person does in the organization has that has that indirect impact on those results and so uh we want we'll be making sure we do a total team recognition for that uh and addition to that so uh a couple weeks ago I did attend the special addition districts association annual meeting uh which uh I've gone to from time to time it's important because we are a special district in the state of Oregon and it's know well first it's interesting to see all the Special Districts that they have here in Oregon uh but uh uh uh had some some good sessions uh uh on on some HR and legal and and a great one on artificial intelligence and the impact it has on governments uh and so that that's something we need to take a look at uh I also want to remind everyone that is attending that the cogs annual meeting is next week uh so look forward to seeing many of you there and uh earlier tonight uh The Joint Committee on Transportation met uh and held a work session on Senate Bill 1572 which is the uh uh the West advisory committee and I can tell you that uh was uh passed out of committee unanimous and now has been referred to Ways and Means so it's moved on to the next step so so that is good and that concludes my report thank you general manager poock um director holmstrom would you like to start us off with board member committee reports certainly thank you uh vice president Davidson so uh earlier this week on Tuesday I had the opportunity to meet with the community advisory committee at their regular meeting uh it was kind of a time of transition ition for them they had um some folks who had been on that committee for a long time had just transitioned off uh the board recently appointed two folks to join this was was their first time joining that meeting so it was a little bit new chair a little bit new uh different faces in the group so um good to see that uh CFO laroo came to provide the uh committee with a kind of a overview kind of abbreviated version of what we saw tonight um to the uh committee and committee had some questions for her about uh different pieces of that so appreciate her time and it was it was a presentation and then uh I didn't say the bulk of the committee meeting was really about uh talking or starting to get a handle on so what's what do we want to do as a committee right what what does the committee want or what does the board want out of the committee um and so I think they're they're starting to think about that and you know um I think that's something my understanding the board is going to take this up at a work session in the next couple months here um so I think it'll be useful to to kind of revisit that and think about what might be um giving them some good tasks to work on um something that would be valuable for them and then think about the the structure of how that's going to work and work best for the community and uh and the district and the board thank you director dun thank you so much um so we had Dei subcommittee uh meeting and we met on February 2nd with uh president hos Enos prey and director Lord K and we talked about a couple of things that kind of have already been mentioned this evening uh but we were excited to learn that John matys from Shan Community College will be attending the board work session on March 14th and we will get like a a condensed version of the six week Dei certificate course that shme is offering so you all can look forward to that I know you're on the edge of your seats like I am so I I'm kind of a nerd about these things so I'm going to force you all to be excited about it um so we're very excited about that um and then uh so the full version of the course is going to be provided to the staff Dei committee Champions um so they're going to get access to the full course that we're going to get the little mini preview of um the course aims to equip employees with necessary skills to lead an internal Dei committee so we're doing what we can to give them the skills to be successful which I just I didn't come up with this we're just helping with it and I just really appreciate the team being so thoughtful in how to make this effective and actually work and I really appreciate that um after the course training the initial focus of the committee is going to be to establish a charter and that will serve as their guiding document going forward um we want to do as much as we can to provide the right resources and space for staff to create Community Connection through honor honoring diversity equity and inclusion um so I'm just personally very excited about this program and I can't wait to see how staff respond to it and to see what they come up with internally and we're just uh going to be here as you know resources for when if when and if they need us but quite frankly I think think that we're going to give them the tools to succeed and I think they're going to impress us",

        "text": " only. Brand new manufactured homes. 13 above, we agreed, certainly not old ones that we're going to bring from other places. We're going to keep it. Very prestige. I think we will probably offer carports for the tenants, if they would like to. The tenants will own the home, but will own the land and lease it to them. We will control the whole process. So we'll choose and offer models, but we'll construct and we set them up. We're going to add landscaping and as we promised, amenities. Clubhouse, maybe dog park. We look into the swimming pool as well. So I want to comfort all the neighbors that this is going to be a very well maintained community. We're going to do all the best we have we can in our ability to make it very well maintained and so people can be proud of their home. So, Mister Perry, will there be lighting on your streets? Yes, certainly there'll be street lighting. Any sidewalks? Depends on the requirements of the zoning. We're not sure yet. In other communities we do like 30ft long, wide road. So it's only used for the. By the tenants. We can discuss that. Okay. And again, they will purchase their home through you, so you'll have control over the aesthetics of what that home will look like on the property. But they lease the property, correct. We already engaged the manufacturer here in Ocala, even skyline. And we're going to offer like two, three models where the home buyer can choose from. And they're not going to be able to bring their own home or something like that. Will they be through tie down situation or will they sit on a concrete slab? Um, that'd be a tie down situation. Tie down. Okay. And then, of course, skirting and landscaping around there? Yes, certainly. Okay. And again, because it's just a concept, any decking, anything like that. I'm just trying to visualize what that would be. Something. That would be something that'd be personalized by the owner. Okay. We tend to have porches and very wide homes. Okay. Again, 55 plus community. Yes. Any other questions from the board to the applicant? At the moment, our golf carts permitted. Golf carts within the community. Most probably we didn't think it through, but if it's, you know, there's demand for that, I'm sure we'll look into it. We didn't consider. We didn't even consider that. I don't. I don't know if that's, you know, if it's something that would be accessible through the other communities. There is a golf cart path that runs through this region all the way over towards the villages. We would have to look and see if it's even connected. So I'm not sure that it is or not. I mean, that would only be allowed if it's something that's legally allowed across the country. This concept has been an issue from a standpoint of, as land has become more valuable, the owners of the land come in and move the owners out in order to. I mean, this is not that large of a parcel, but what's the length of time that people have? What kind of lease or agreement do they have? It's a typical, like, common in the manufactured housing sector. I think it's annually renewable, but we won't limit them. We won't move them out. If they want to stay, they can stay forever as long as they pay the lease. But we don't have intention to replace owners of homes. So it can be for a very, very long time. And this is vacant right now, so we're not moving anyone out. So the lease term would be a 99 year but annually reviewed. Help me understand. I don't have the legal answers for that, but I know it's from what I'm seeing in other communities. It's renewed annually, but there's not like condition for the tenant to stay or not. Okay. Okay, very good. Do you have any other communities that you operate today like this? We are in the process of building one in Bellevue. Pretty similar, smaller parcel like only six acres. And we believe in this concept and we want to bring more to Marion county. Very good. But there is no other community elsewhere that you have with those type of land leases. So personally I've been dealing in other parks, other, sorry, communities for many years. I know how that works. And this time we wanted to own our own land. Okay, this is the first time that you'll retain ownership of the land and just lease the land? Correct. Okay, very good. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mister Perry, Mister Tillman. We're going to open it up for public comment and I do have three people who have signed up to speak, the first being Jim Holtz and then Katherine Metellus. If both of you would like to come forward, we have two podiums. Anybody still here by those names? Okay, Mister Houtz is gone, so. Mister. I'm sorry, misses or Miss Mattellis? Catherine. Hello. Billy. No comment. Okay. Waving. Daniel. Ditto. Mister Ditto. And do we. Do we have anyone else who is here to speak on behalf of this particular item? I'll invite you to the second podium, mister. Ditto. Thanks. Okay, that's wrong, but that's all right. When she was Daniel Ditono. I live at 12620 Southeast 91st Terrace Road in summerfield, Florida 34491. And I do live in the Del Webb community. Several years ago, I was a voting member of the planning and zoning board of the Port St. Lucie. That's on Florida's east coast. My membership included comprehensive reviews of various residential and non residential projects within the county. Much of my peer responsibility was to ensure that developers adhered to environmental construction and community adherence responsibilities. During my tenure with the board, our panel had to review zone ordinances as well as planning proposals to ensure that developmental transition of each intended project would meet and exceed or possibly exceed county codes. Our primary role was to ensure a transition which would not upset the current status quo of intended developmental communities and was the heart of our professional commitment. It is my understanding that Little Lake OEA LLC is seeking a zoning change from all four mixed residential classifications to PMH Mobile Home park as a proposed development project of 49 concrete pads for inclusion of multiple modular homes adjacent to the Del Webb Spruce Creek Country Club property. As commonly known, when a new construction project next to an existing community is proposed, there needs to be certain assessments as to the modification of existing and joint properties in the case of. In this case, Del Webb community. Consequently, there needs to be a thorough review of potential disruptive traffic patterns, environmental concerns, including additional demands of the current water aquifer, sewage discharge, and a multitude of other environmental and non environmental concerns. I understand residential development is of utmost importance in our ever growing Florida economy, but is imperative that the growth does not impair those communities that are currently in place. I would humbly request that the Marion County Board of County Commissioners thoroughly view the zoning change application and subsequently deny the change request. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Do we have anyone else in the audience to speak to this item? If so, I invite you to the empty podium. Yes, ma'am. Your name and address? Hi. My name is Lori Robleski. I'm at one one. Oh, gosh. One one. I just moved here in July. Yeah, 11342. I'm sorry. 92nd Court Road in Summerfield. I live in the Del Webb community. Just moved there. I like the aesthetics of it. I do have a question for the developer, being how is he going to access his manufactured home park? Is he going to come through the Del Webb entrance? Is he going to use the emergency room entrance? Or is he going to build his own individual one? I can't imagine having 49 manufactured homes, whether they be single or double wide, along with a carport and a patio, on ten acres, in addition to a pool and a community center and whatever else they have, that's ten acres. If we wanted to have that many there, they should go to the village. Being that close together, you know, you could reach out and get your cup of coffee. But there is a land for sale right across 441. Why did he choose our area and not across the street? Having this development will interfere with our aquifer. We are a big community, as you know. As the aquifer fills and then empties, it creates that sinkhole. Well, I don't want my 400,000 plus house going down in a sinkhole because they're soaking up more of the aquifer. So that's one of my concerns as well. Let's see. Okay, he did say it was a retirement community, 55 plus. And it's rentals. So is the lot paid on a yearly basis, and they buy the house, so is that how it works? And then they have to sell the house through a realtor in order to get out. Is that my understanding? We'll get those questions answered for you. Okay. Well, regardless, I am against the development of this manufactured home park. As it butts up to the Spruce Creek development. And only a small portion of it is the storage of our motorhomes and cars and whatnot. But the rest of it is up against the residents. And I would appreciate and hope you deny the application to build. Thank you, madam chair. Yes, go ahead. Just because I know we're going to have other speakers that come up here. And I just want to make sure. And I'm not saying that",

        "text": " if any of the limited parties have anything just checking myself here so the time is now 2 14 p.m and we would like to uh well let me stop myself jesse so what order does it just open up and or does one party have to go before the uh there are a number of limited parties um i don't know that we need to that there's any particular order as far as they go i think um uh what i'd suggest is that they have an opportunity first and then if the department staff has anything um and then finally the and then do we have to have any time limits or is that just based off of how many people want to speak uh yeah there's no particular uh requirements as far as time um go and so yeah it's probably just dependent on the number of speakers we have okay thank you all right so the time is now 2 15 p.m and we would like to offer an opportunity for a limited party those with limited party status and the applicants to respond to the material that we've made so we're going to open up a hearing at this time i'm going to defer to nancy and wally or whomever is running things to see if there are any participants willing to take advantage of this time right now hello chair grill um this is wally adams hey wally hi we've tried to make all of the parties analysts have control over their video and button i think there might be one left and then back in i ours know if we won't i'm not catching all everything you're saying and so probably a little far from the mic i was suggesting maybe we just um go through them one by one to see if they comments that they would like to make so in alphabetical order i think the first one is derek green okay so i'm just going to sit back and ask you to control that part of this competition so can i jump in i think you know uh mr green represents the applicant i think it's probably more appropriate to let the applicant go last in case there are other comments that other limited parties make and and they have an opportunity to respond to those as well so um i think you know if there's anybody who um the either attorney's representing the limited parties or the limited parties themselves um please identify yourself either if you're in a attendee um by unmuting yourself and and showing your screen or if you are simply on the attendees raise your hand or some other way identify that you would like to provide a comment good call thanks for the help todd keeping an eye on the attendee list i'm not seeing any hands not seeing anything among the panelists jesse i'll defer to you in terms of when you feel it's appropriate to move on to the department but i'm not seeing from the limited parties the only attorney for uh that i'm seeing on the list that was julian mars he is from the uh office of the attorneys that represented the limited parties so you may want to specifically ask if julian mars has any thanks patrick wally adams again mr mars um you should have control over your mic if you would like to make a comment you should be able to unmute yourself jesse looks like you're talking but you're on mute got to happen yeah so since it looks like we don't have any uh comments from the limited parties i don't know if the department would like to comment at this time or the department doesn't have any comments all the material changes that have been discussed the department uh is on board with him thank you patrick and moving on to the applicant hi good afternoon my name is elaine albridge i'm permitting council for obsidian renewables and obsidian solar with me today is derek green my co-counsel along with representatives from the applicant michelle slater and lori hutchinson on the line we'll keep this brief thank you very much for your time today and your diligence in reviewing this project we are very excited to be before you today it's been a long a long haul um through covet and all um so today is a really um we're very happy to be here um we are satisfied with the final order as proposed before you um we do not have concerns about the proposed revisions to the fire management plan or that language we think that actually helps clarify for the record um how we're going to navigate those conversations through pre-construction compliance so so thank you for that and with that unless there's any questions we'll just go ahead and close the day and say thank you very much for your consideration and approval of this thank you for your comments and it's good to see you as well does anyone from council have any comments questions well hearing none then jesse i'm kicking back to you for where we are next okay thank you chair grail and i believe where we are next is um coming to emotion um so um we there's motion language uh i think that um it should be before you um that is drafted as a sample we um have a couple loose ends to tie up here there is the draft final order that's been presented to you but we'll also need to incorporate the scrivener's error corrections and the new language concerning the fire districts i think the motion in general should be um uh you know if based on what i've heard and the lack of objection to um uh proposed contested case order dispositions of the issues um and uh acceptance of uh kalantardi weather's presentation on the proposed order if there is a motion to approve the site certificate i would recommend that it goes beyond that to then adopt the draft final order scrivener's error corrections um that were discussed today and with the changes to the fire district language and i'm sorry i don't i can't remember exactly where that would go in the draft final order um so there may be a more precise way of saying that but that's what i would suggest for motion all right thank you did anyone catch all i made some notes but i can't make the emotions so i made some notes and i'll make a stab at it all right ready to go vice chair i'll be welcome to uh receive anyone's amendments that if i miss something are needed so madam chair i move that the council approved the proposed order and the proposed contested case with the scrivener's error corrections and the new language concerning fire protection as the final order as recommended and issue a site certificate approving the obsidian solar center request and adopt the final order with the scrivener error changes and the language concerning the fire protection do we need this is handling do we need the language for the fire district and where it goes jesse patrick um sarah if you pull up the version of the language that we have i'll agree don here um so um kent how about us about um amending your motion to include as on the screen and i'll second that okay yeah i can amend that let me ask this would it be uh in order to also specify the page number and the line number that the change starts at or any getting that specific or is it as shown on the page adequate i think as shown on the page is adequate in part because as we start to clear let red line et cetera the uh um the page number and line numbers will change yeah yeah okay good so i'll am in my motion to the language concerning the fire protection district is um as shown on the page that we're looking at on screen now i'll second that we have a motion we have a second uh unless jesse or todd have anything to say about that then i'll ask are there any additional comments or questions on the motion i would just say that i i captured the thank you other questions comments hearing none mr secretary sorry sorry uh this is cindy i'm wondering if since we're not mentioning the page number if we should mention the section that it this is included in because the page that we're looking at isn't going to be familiar to trackable to anyone its section ibm public services the evaluation of fire protection service so can you say that again sarah section public services under the evaluation of fire service protectors fire service providers just preceding the public services condition number four so i included the location parenthetically in the motion if that thank you thank you okay so we have a motion we have a we know where it is any additional comments questions well i guess this is hanley my only comment is i hope the applicants hear us when we say that we think the exceptions process needs more work on these applications i understand this application was before we've kind of encouraged applicants to do that i think it's important that they understand that we believe that if you're going to take an exception to goal 3 it needs needs to be information provided for reasons why thank you for that reminder yeah and this is kent uh i agree they need exceptions to the goals need to be robust in their preparation that to establish the findings that we need in order to give approval so my presumption is that staff when they are working with the applicants will help relay that message uh very clearly as this happens in the so we have a motion we have a second any additional questions or comments on the for the question i'm sorry call for the question okay just checking mr secretary please call the roll ken howe hanley jenkins yes jordan truitt yes cindy condon marcy grill yes motion carries madam chair thank you i would just like to say thank you to everyone that was involved that was a lot of dialogue and i hope that that developers and the public hear the work that not only staff puts into these issues but counsel and to making sure we're upholding our obligations so thank you to everyone next on the agenda as public comment this time is reserved for the public to address the council regarding any item within council jurisdiction that is not otherwise closed for comment which includes the boardman the hemingway transmission line proposed order and the obsidian solar center proposed order i'm going to look to nancy and wally to uh work through and see if anyone in the public wishes to make any comments at this time uh madam chair if i may yes sir there was uh in the either the chat or the q a early on the meeting a kind of a question that was raised that i thought might be helpful to answer um as well um so the question was",

going to wait until 905 to start just to give folks a chance to join not on this friday morning all right john it looks like we've got a good a good group of people going here if you're ready to get started great thanks christine um well good morning everyone and uh welcome to the kickoff meeting for the uh hb 2021 study on small-scale community-based renewable energy projects um i just want to take the opportunity up front here to thank you all very much for joining us today um and for your time and commitment to serving on the work group for this study um my name is john cornwell and i'm a senior policy energy policy analyst with the department um and i'm the department lead for the and uh i'll also be leading today's and uh i'll have been i'll have some support from our government relations coordinator christy split and linda ross um i just want to know for everybody on the call that uh today's meeting is is open to the public and it is being recorded um so uh you know folks who could join us today can can uh review the meeting and i'll just uh uh now go over our agenda for today so the purpose of the meeting today is to formally kick off the hb 2021 study on small-scale community-based renewable energy projects um that's a bit of a mouthful to say especially if i'm going to be saying it pretty frequently so you may hear me or others referring to the study at times as a small scale study or the uh the ssrep study so uh and just uh just fair warning fair warning of that um but over the coming months we will have ample opportunity to in the substantive issues of the study but the purpose of our meeting today is really to kick off the study by meeting our fellow members of the work group and then reviewing the study objectives and uh the study so uh so briefly our agenda this morning director benner will give a few uh welcome remarks to kick us off in a moment and then after some uh housekeeping points on meeting logistics and how the meeting will operate um we'll uh allow some time to uh let work group members uh who are present today introduce themselves um that might take a little bit of time but one of our key goals for the study is really for it to be as participatory and collaborative as um which i think as you'll know can be somewhat challenging sometimes in our in this virtual virtual settings so we'd just like to take this opportunity to hear your voices at the outset um then after introductions i'll review the key elements of uh of the um hb 2021 section outlining the study on small-scale renewable energy projects and then i'll review the study plan and timeline in a bit more depth and then lastly um time permitting we'll do a brief dive into the state of small-scale renewable energy projects in oregon today and then uh some of the topics we'll be discussing over the course of this study and then we'll have a period for open discussion and public comment just i'll say it in advance that uh you know due to the nature of this meeting kickoff meeting it'll it will be a lot of us talking to you today but in general uh our aim is for these uh meetings and and workshops that we engage in to be um structured in a way that will have uh enable more participation and and interactivity um so uh well we'll be talking a lot today um in the future it'll it'll be a lot more us talking together um regarding questions or comments as we go through after each agenda item there will be a pause for questions but if you have any questions in the interim feel free to enter them in the chat or raise your hand and we'll address them as they come in um but uh now i would like to uh turn it over to director bennett for some welcome remarks are you there's me yes thanks john and hi everyone um for those of you i haven't met although i think i know many of the folks on the work group i'm janine benner director of the oregon department of energy and i'll echo john's thanks to both the work group members and members of the public who've joined us this morning for a really important conversation about small scale and community renewables and how they can help support the state's climate and energy goals and i get the privilege of sharing with you this slide which has our new mission and what we do um which hopefully is familiar to many of you who've been in conversations with us recently um but we really help make help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable energy system and small-scale community renewables are an important part of that energy system in this study really i think hits a lot of those points under what we do as gathering together information and analysis helping to be that venue for problem solving and advancing these issues to inform regulation um and energy programs and activities so um we're really excited about the study look forward to hearing from all of you today and in future meetings and i'll just close by saying again thank you so much for being here and i think i'm turning it over to so my job today will be to be sort of your hostess uh in the webex platform monitoring chats and all of those good things today although many of you know me as our government relations coordinator for the agency i wanted to start off with just a quick orientation on webex and you should see a lot of the buttons on the screen in front of you which depending on the side of your screen my size of your screen might be a little bit small but i just wanted to make sure folks know how to raise their hand because that's a great way to kind of get in on the conversation when the time comes for that we really do want to hear from you today so we also want to make sure you know about the chat so that way if you have any thoughts while someone's presenting you can also capture them there and i'll be monitoring that and make sure to get those out to the group and make sure that they're recorded for posterity in the end you'll see there's two ways to raise your hand there's an option um if you were to uh pull down the participants tab and find yourself you'll also see that the tab with the little smiley face and the plus sign at the bottom is an option and then um there's also we also just want you to know you can turn your camera on and off and mute yourself and unmute yourself also at the bottom so if you have any technical issues with webex today you can chat linda ross uh you can just pull down on the chat to everyone it says normally but you can pull down and find linda and let her know you can also just ping me you could also just put it in the chat and we'll find you and figure out if we can help or you can just speak out and we'll figure out how to help you if that's all not working so i just want to make webex a platform that you're familiar with and at that we can move on to the next slide and then how this meeting will be facilitated the panelists the people who can mute and unmute themselves sort of at any point are the people who are appointed to the small scale renewable energy projects study workgroup members so members only and then some other staff are also panelists and then there's also i've noticed about 10 people and a lot of really awesome people by the way that are here watching today and so you if you want to speak up at any point we will have public comment period reserved although you're also welcome to chat and get in touch with me at any point if you need to uh and then also we just want to share um several of us attended a statewide equity training probably about two months ago and there was a set of community agreements that we all really kind of latched on to with a basic sort of bottom line of that our conversations today should be designed to foster inclusive and respectful um communications between us in order to have a meeting that goes well and people feel good about being a part of just really short things like being present being respectful having the attitude of the learner being flexible when technology doesn't go our way that's something we work at every day at the oregon department of energy and i'm sure you do too in this often virtual setting we live in and then as a reminder if you need something just feel free to reach out to me or to linda ross in the chat and we'll we'll be happy to help you out and the next slide please we're gonna go into um introducing the worker members like we talked about today when you look at this list you'll see it's a really big list um the legislature gave us direction of who should sit and be part of these conversations and they didn't limit the number in a particular way and so we wanted to get the right people in the room and or virtual room in this case so it's a pretty big group so as we go through introductions i hope you'll consider being extremely concise in your and i'll do my best to give um give an example but my example would probably be smaller than small-scale community-based renewal renewable energy projects often are so just bear with me but my name is christy split i'm the government relations director for the oregon department of energy and when i think about my favorite small-scale community-based renewable energy project i always envision a coos bay fire department that has solar panels on the roof because it provides resilience benefits and it's in a community that i really care a lot about so i will leave it at that and then i think we can just to the extent possible i will just call on the people alphabetically from this list to make things go a little bit smoothly you can just come right out turn your camera on if you know you're next and go and that'd be awesome too and i haven't checked to make sure that um to see who's who precisely is on right now so um hopefully we won't have too many awkward moments where i call on someone and they're not there i'll try to keep tabs on that but with that i hope ali is okay with being in the hot seat and being first",

        "text": " related rules uh statutes um rules of civil procedure yet I I have made every effort to do that so that you'll know where I'm coming from on this hey thank you and and you do know that we extended the deadline you know so you have some time it's not going to be today that the oh yes you know know that or I would have yes done something entirely different today thank you for being here and your comments thank you Miss Gilbert um uh just to clarify Miss goldber did as she mentioned provide a written comment of the rules those will be made available to the council in your packet before you consider um permanent rules there were also some I think questions or comments directed uh towards procedural issues that I think Tom would be best to address so I'll make sure I point those out for him to to respond to at a future Council um great uh so next we have uh Mr John Luciani and sorry about the pronunciation um before you give your uh testimony please just state your name with spelling and um if you represent an organization but organization yes John Lani j o h n l u c i a ni I I'm at uh 27633 Butter Creek Road Echo Oregon 9782682788 rules or upgrading rules is correct that that is correct and I have some um Mrs Condon I asked her this morning I every time I sit here I have questions and we cannot ask questions so we never get any answers um so I have a few questions um those are the beginning of of my questions are I understand first off last night was was a wonderful meeting um I love windmills um I am I have a uh I'm under I I like next Tera and and uh they have leased my place and I can't wait uh for windmills on the other hand uh as a Christian man uh I like to keep things very nice but the old Johnny comes out once in a while and I got to say I hate idah hell power it's been a 20y year struggle with idah power Corporation Mr my place please do keep this to the the tested case rules that's what I'm doing so I understand that they should shouldn't Idaho Power stayed in the Energy Corridor by law yeah so I'm going to reiterate that this is unrelated to the contested case Ru making understand so please refrain from bringing up the Idaho Power um or the Orman Hemingway project and you know keep your please keep your comments related to the proposed rules the reason I bring it up is I was kicked out early of the uh contested case I was one of the first ones to go so I am here to today to state that a normal person I guess you could say I was a normal a dirt farmer we have no we have no chance in this process none whatsoever um did you make the rules I guess you did I have no no chance whatsoever a p a normal person so I got kicked out early I have probably more than anybody else uh reasoning to be there and to State my case and I was kicked out early I have no chance so when you change your rules I think that everybody that was kicked out should be allowed to come back and start over in this process and if and if not then what good it so I would I would ask that we start over again with all the contested case hearings on the B2 and give us normal people a chance to State our what we want to State and to be heard and not kicked out I understand uh well okay I I can't say anymore because I have a lot to say about different things but that's my statement I would wish that you would uh consider that because how many people have been kicked out I think there were 50 30 50 started down to one or two left um it's a stack deck if I was a poker player and uh I sat around a table and uh one guy won all the hands eventually I'd have to say that something isn't right here and you guys have rubber stamped and guys and gals you've rubber stamped everything from the beginning so please reconsider contested cases and let us redo them with with new rul making and rules and that's that's all I have thank you thank you before you go are there any uh questions or quations from the council all right thank you so much for your comments Mr thank you right um is there anyone else in the room not seeing any uh I do see that uh miss Ann Marsh has her hand raised and Fuji crer so I will take um Miss Marsh first you can um and you should be unmuted or you you should be unmuted now yeah can you hear me yes okay great thank you um yeah I'm an March I'm at 206 Main Avenue in L Grand and um I was granted limited party status in the B2 contested case along with my husband um so before I start it would help me to know if council members have a copy of the rules uh the draft of the rules in front of them now or should I be referencing places do you have a copy in front of you is what I need to know I guess Marsh I will say uh some members are uh nodding their heads in the affirmative um I would suggest that you be as specific with your comments so as you can okay um so uh in the process that I went through my husband and I went through we learned a lot um it was frustrating because we're not lawyers um honestly I Echo what was just said if the goal of the process was to intimidate citizens it definitely achieved that so anything you can do to make it smoother clearer uh more Equitable for people is a good thing um and that's why I'm here today um so so here are my comments um there's a section on page five number one um it well the section called um filing and services service it ends in ' 0410 um this section deals with how we can file um documents I just want to say emailing documents is a problem we had a large mailing list emails bounced back there were spam blockers our email uh box was clogged we received many emails that weren't related to our case making it harder to Wade through we often wondered if our emails made it to the right people my suggestion is we need a different system some kind of docket system that we can file and easily access um in an organized way that would be great finding also I just want to add finding information within the documents within and within the application and the Odo website was a nightmare because there were thousands and thousands of pages um I also want to add um the administrative law judge um denied a request I put in to change the deadline for filing from 500 PMS on Fridays to I wanted to do it Sundays um it was contested by Idaho Power lawyers uh maybe I don't know who else saying no they want to stick to the 5:00 p.m. deadline well that worked for people working on this uh professionally but for those of us who had other jobs um I'm a teacher uh 5:00 pm Friday was a really tough deadline for me to make we did it we made it work um there was in my mind no reason why we couldn't do a a Sunday evening deadline everyone who wanted to get it done on Friday sure could but you know the rest of us needed a little more time sometimes um so then in the section uh ending in 0415 the requests for party status um that's on page six um this this uh is a big issue for us and many others that we know um the department and then later the alj using their exact wording wrote Our issue statement after we submitted a letter now our letter was a little more broad than our issue statement we did not know at the time how important that issue statement that we were given was and that we could um even object to what it was we didn't even know that at the time um this impacted us greatly because our letter it mentioned concerns about fish habitat uh disruption it was reduced to one single issue fish pass message consequently we were very limited uh regarding what we could actually talk about and argue and by the time we realized it it was too late to change anything now this was very convenient for the department and for the applicant um the department and the alj should not be writing the issue statement unless the party wants that to happen um I think it could be a collaborative process instead of the those entities writing it and handing it out because you have people who don't know that an issue statement is so important at that time um the section needs clearer language about notifying parties um regarding their ability to object to an issue so um you know like page seven b um does not indicate how important the the statement is and I think it really needs to be hammered uh that it that it is extremely important to have an issue statement that is correct for you and your issue we just did not realize that it was so small um that it had been reduced so um it was the section ending in 0430 prehearing conference and pre hearing order um kind of indicates to me that we as parties do not have the necessarily the the alj may have a hearing but we don't necessarily have the right to clarify our issues for alj um I know we can do we had the right to hand in uh those issues in writing but at a hearing we we didn't I mean we weren't I we weren't given ability to our issues before the issue statement was was made um page nine number four um there is is therefore a huge problem if decisions are final and parties didn't know they could object to the language that the department and the alj which were one and the same in our case chose uh and that that section says that know basically the the decisions the order is final um so again we didn't know that by being G granted limited party status we would be able to only discuss that one issue and not the broader issue of habitat that we raised in our original letter um just felt as a citizen that it since it was very convenient in the end for the applicant and the Department it felt like the alj was there to do their bidding and not not ours uh it made the whole process seem unfair so I can't say it enough there must be a way to let people know they can appeal that issue statement before it's too late okay so I",

significant Gap but you're confident I'm confident we'll get there it's a it's a how what's the slope of the curve you know can we can we bruy remember how quickly we intended to get to the 600 um I don't I know that that we expect a hundred to come from the added feed stocks and the rest will be from population growth so um yeah we actually have a person on our staff who has a PHD uh and she wrote her thesis on feed stocks for digestors so very very apt to have this person working for us now and Northwest Natural is willing to participate if there's additional cost to take in feed stock Northwest Natural is also interested it's it's a partnership in the sense that they're willing to participate in the cost to bring in some of the extra feed stocks so we have the capability to bring some in now but if we grow it to a certain nice high level and we we're getting tipping fees then they will they will share in the capital for making that happen okay back to Bruce so um we did want to let you know about some of the challenges we faced in the negotiation process for this and it remember remember it's a 20-year contract a lot can happen in 20 years so we we've thought about a lot of what ifs and I just wanted to give you a sample of what some of these are what happens if the character of the biogas changes uh during the 20-year contract uh this could be something where you know maybe we get a new industry in our service it's giving us different Wastewater the gas itself is is kind of a function of what the Wastewater is so if you change the Wastewater you may be changing the gas um that's something that uh that we've uh talked about and uh I think we have a partnership uh approach to dealing with if it requires more capital or increased expenses to deal with we we want to deal deal deal with it with a cost share arrangement with with our partner um what if we want to purchase the project um we may want to do that somewhere uh down the line and so we're negotiating a provision now where uh after 10 years uh we can reopen the contract and we can talk about purchasing uh the project from them what if somebody else wants to purchase it uh we've got a write a first refusal that we've negotiated that's going to be in the contract that would give us the right to buy the project for the same offer that someone else made um what if we need to stop producing biogas because of regulatory changes uh maybe we need to re-engineer our treatment plan and we won't have digestors anymore um well we've uh made it so that we have the right to terminate the contract if that happens uh what if there's a huge change in the technology of wastewater treatment and we want to jump on the bandwagon and save our rate payers some money by incorporating this technology and as a result we are not producing biogas anymore we have the right to terminate the contract if if that happens um what if Northwest Natural wants to sell the RNG and other markets as I mentioned uh the the current uh plan is to sell this gas to their existing rate payers you know you and I uh and just at the normal fossil fuel gas prices but what if they want to sell it to someone and this you know ends up being a windfall for them we have a provision in the contract where we reopen it and we talk about changing the price in response to uh their increase in Revenue so U those are things that we've uh we've been talking about and and have a pretty good handle on I think another thing that uh that's been that was a sticking point I think we've got it resolved now is what is the quality that our biogas has to meet uh uh when they take it off our hands and treat it their treatment system is is built to to treat gas that's of a certain quality coming into it and if our gas is not that quality then their treatment system may fail to treat it to the standard needed for the pipeline which as we said is really stringent so um we've talked a lot about this this and we've made changes to the requirements and I think we're at a point now where we we're pretty much in agreement on on what uh what what kind of um specific we need to meet um another issue that came up was we needed to test our gas in order to know if it was going to meet their specifications and so forth and so we found that testing was really difficult um testing involves taking samples sending them to an outof State lab and having them tested our own lab can't do these tests so we needed to have a contract lab do it what we found was that the the samples themselves were being contaminated with atmospheric air so um we were getting bad resultss from the the the the test uh the test lab so we did this several times and we tried different approaches to taking the samples we worked with Northwest Natural closely on this and we finally came up with an approach that we think we can believe in that's giving us um results that that we can we can trust so but but that did take a so uh next steps um let's see I thought we were going to take the dates down because we're not quite there yet um on some of this um we were hoping to meet this week and and and really get some things wrapped up but they're chief negotiators on vacation so that's going to have to wait until next week we think um at any rate uh we hope to come back soon and present you with the negotiated terms uh at least the major ones that matter and then uh follow that up with uh board approval of the so Commissioners directors go ahead commissioner T I'm this is exciting there's there's no question and um my my hats off to the creative Innovative side that uh you know presents this and looks at how do we take this this process and bring it to the the the best use possible uh I'm also trying so that's off on I'm also trying to understand this from the customer perspective just and I'm just thinking a little bit ahead about how we how we communicate this type of thing and I'm and I'm wondering if there's been a look at what Northwest Natural Gas customer rates have been doing and what what change might be you know as a result of this type of process going into rate base and at the same time our rates and what's happening there because we're linking our to some degree we're linking ourselves together and I just I'm just thinking about uh how how we communicate nuu customers about this project well one thing I can tell you about their purchases of RNG Senate Bill 98 limits them to what what's called 5% of their revenue requirements being spent on RNG so they can't go Hog Wild this will be very incremental um and uh the other thing is when they sell gas except for well except for the RNG which is an exception um they have to sell it at the wholesale rate at which they purchase it they can't mark up the gas so you know the wholesale Market goes up and down you know throughout the year there are different Peaks and valleys um and so uh you know when you see increases in rates often times that's also due to all the the overhead costs that they have I understand so yeah and the only point I'm making here is just thinking down the road about what the what the public perception is about a project like this and how we communicate what the value is and not necess as we all watch Energy prices dramatically increase uh how are we insulating ourselves from being connected to that and there your your point is well made and uh we will um connect with Northwestern naos so we have better communication materials when the question actually come to us from public at our um pre our last meeting um just a few days ago really right yeah we talked specifically about that having a joint public relations and communication plan about this project that was important to them and it was important to us so um that specific question will we'll work through that with them and we'll share that public relations and communication plan with our boards that's great but like I said this is it's very exciting it's it's really exciting and all all new ideas on the energy front are so important and um like I said congratulations anything else Commissioners one I would Echo the comments you've been working on this a long time it's that you come to the point that you have and just one more example of good work in regards to the 12 million roughly that I guess that most those natural would be investing I think I heard did I hear 12 million no there was that is the right number I at least they've told us at this point they haven't designed it yet of course but that's their ballpark number yeah it' be interesting what the contract's going to say in terms of their recovery nobody's going to put 12 million in and allow you to walk at any time you want just because don't like their issue they got to get some recovery so I it'll be interesting when you come back to see that and then the final issue I'd be really remiss if I didn't raise it and I raised it with you Jack the other day by email is this is a prime example of a ubit tax issue I mean it's under the tax code and you you need to look at that really really well because uh you're you're not a general purpose government you're not and the ubit it's this is it I mean if you flare the gas you got no issue because or if you did it yourself you got no issue but when you're selling product",

hearing and testimony on the record of the DPO first the C certificate holder then members of the public then members of the council and finally the certificate holder will be allowed to respond to any comments if attendees wish to submit written comments at the hearing to staff they may do so prior to the end of the hearing I will call on each person interested in providing oral testimony starting with a certificate holder then members of the public here in person and then on the webinar then on the phone next slide there we go uh for any individuals wishing to provide oral testimony during tonight's hearing for the record please State the following with your testimony full name with spelling name of organization or group if you are representing one physical mail or email address so uh first of all Let's uh find out how many people are testifying oh I got it right here thank you three okay so I've got three here do we know how many are on the webinar and on the phone so that's five so um shall we limit the public testimony to say what three or five minutes what what does the council say five okay so with that I'll um is the certificate holder here tonight and do they wish to provide okay so before I open the hearing up to public testimony I want to remind the public that prior to the close of the record you may submit written testimony in a variety of ways the comment portal email and handing in your written tonight and uh we just I want to emphasize that the the written comments that come in uh we read and uh I know that we're putting a limit on the amount of time you have tonight of five minutes um use that time to highlight what you submit in writing and um that'll make good use of your time so um I'd like to get us well we've done that uh Nancy what's we got that okay um okay I'm GNA call on John Luchi I'm I'm no Lani Luciani okay great thank you this is not a yeah this is a one way to us for us to learn as opposed to us this is always the way it is look somebody answer some question for us how the years is this going to go on before you guys answer our question you can um submit questions into the staff and they will respond to you okay second person Irene Gilbert thing that John gives me his five minutes or you allow me extra time because I'm relying on this time is establish comments that are not that that were not uh provided in writing and I do want to be sure that I meet your standard of establishing that if I were to choose to request the tested case I would meet that standard so I am going to start by saying if I run out of time I'm hoping that I can send in more written material or uh however you want to deal with it like um I think you have an obligation to hear everything I have to say since it's not a repeat of what you got in writing okay anyway um the uh setting up the the basis for competive case request that we are doing here my name is Irene Gilbert and I reside at 2310 Adams Avenue the Grand Oregon I I am co-chair of stop B2 the nonprofit and I'm appearing today as a representative of the public interests as well as myself as an individual I do want to say that um I had intended on putting my name on the material that fie krider sent in late uh she was planning on being here today also but didn't get the stop B2 comments done in time so given that I am co-chair of that organization I am adopting by reference the all of the material that came under Fuji and stop B2 as organization um okay on to some other things I wanted to talk about blasting because blasting is a an issue that people had a lot of concern with uh and I had a lot of concern when the site certificant condition was changed to remove the requirement that that fsac and counties reviewed the blasting plan and uh at the time we were told that there wasn't going to be any blasting so it wasn't an issue so I dropped the issue um after that uh Kellen told or sry weather told uh Wendy King that uh there was not going to be any blasting at for B2 and that was in writing I have a copy of that also Mr SLE told uh Joanne who's that back here that there wasn't going to be any blasting so what I'm here to say is that because there supposedly is not going to be any blasting I'm asking that the information about the blasting plan be either removed from the uh proposed order or that the condition be replaced to have County review because for one thing it was kind of demeaning I thought when the Oregan Department of energy removed that review saying they didn't have the expertise to review glasting plan and so they assumed that the counties didn't either so that's number one um another thing is they remove the requirement that that changes in roads when there's a road name to include the name of the road so what we've ended up with is um there's over 30 pages of roads and instead of having the names uh on the roads that are being changed they're numbered between 1 and over 600 50 so um it's over it's like 33 Pages um now there's a state law that says that computer is supposed to be presented by agencies in an understandable way for the public to see it and uh so I would just like to say that removing Road names when they're available um makes it pretty impossible for the public to tell what you're doing and where you're doing it so um I'm just asking you put that back um the um the other thing is you know sometimes what we say and how it really looks can be different and I know I guess I'm going to be wet here um I know one of the things that was said in the gra post order is it was stated that this really wasn't going to change things the the surveys and that were going to just be exactly the same as they were so we didn't have to worry well this is a map of roads that going through Union County and it is true that the survey areas are going to remain the same there's a heavy black lines that go through here the only difference is the fact that they've added all this information all this land to like found and they haven't expended the requirements new surveys in any of this yellow areas now that's a big de because for one thing the EPO talks about the fact that that developers can ask for a review if they want to make changes within the side foundary okay okay they can a developer can ask to add all kinds of sighting corridors within the site boundary and Oregon Department of energy can say yes sure you can do that because it's within the site boundary and know you don't have to have a public hearing well that really conflicts with the standard that says there will be a public process and the public will have a chance to comment when they change things like for historic and cultural properties and say um well we're still going to only do this site boundary uh we're still only going to do the sighting uh route the the area that is what 500 ft across or whatever but we're extending all this extra area and if they come back then and say the developer and says well we're going to we're now going to put more more roads out in this area that's part of the site boundary um there's been no public process there's been no information there's been no opportunity for anybody in the public to disagree with that and when you look at things like historic Properties or like wetlands and things like that and I encourage you to take a really careful look at these Maps because whereas the route may have been you know a th000 ft from a wetland now the route may end up being 2 feet from a wetland and at least in Union County it means that the route can come right up next to um lad Marsh Wildlife Area it can come right right up next to some uh protected areas that are mitigation sites for the Columbia River dams it can come right up next to Morgan Lake Park um and the public is not going to have a chance to be to be a participant in deciding if that really is okay um Miss Gilbert thank you for your testimony I gave you a couple of minutes extra we've got other people that want to testify tonight and another hearing tonight does this mean I get to send in the rest of my there were several speak ises that I did not do written comments because your rulle say that I can",

        "text": " of what's been submitted as part of preconstruction compliance that's not something that was attached to the DPO but we will be attaching it to the proposed order um in addition to any uh further conditions um that that we find to be necessary councilor HS I just want to reiterate that um with the language presented here today um that the department is stating that the risk of wild widespread fire in agricultural areas is low I disagree with that I just want to make sure that's clear on the record thank you first cond um Cindy Condon um like um councelor Imes I too was surprised by the low and I Dar it me is what is the um is the modeling based on is it a wildfire assessment you know 20 years ago or is it a wildfire assessment looking forward giving given what we know about drought climate change um where does the low come from and I I understand what you said that agricultural land are considered but I can't answer that question with a lot of specificity but I'll do my best and so it is a model based on historic data that my understanding is uses a lot of statistical uh regression to predict vulnerability um the way that and this is where I I have a hard time answering is the way that risk is categorized low medium high extremely high unburnable um is kind of a batching of the propensity for fire so it's based on I think quintiles of like is this in the 0o to 20th percentile for fire risk or for a fire risk in this Square pixel uh if a fire starts there How likely is that fire to get out of control um it's not saying um how damaging is a fire that occurs in that square um it's more how is it is it likely to affect things around it um if that makes sense so it's not uh yeah the the it's taking a lot of very complex um and somewhat subjective uh evaluations and and condensing it into something that's Quantified which is always uh weaves a lot of the human element uh out of it uh so so I I mean we we're noting noting the the uh discomfort with the categorization um we're using that because that's what's in the model uh if there's other language we can look at um we could say that um but but yeah we're just kind of repeating what the model says as far as those labels uh chair Hal I could um secretary esterson if I could just add a bit um and correct me if I'm wrong but whether the risk is low or high isn't substantively being used to inform the adequacy of the plan the plan assumes what's the respon how do you prevent the situations that are high risk or any risk and then how are you going to respond once you have an issue it's a high risk so you know I mean we don't have a plan that is appropriate for low medium high it really is a plan for all risk um so I just wanted off for that yeah and the standard requires them to find areas of heighten risk um or Hazard and those words have different meanings but are used often interchangeably um so we do think that as far as will you how will you respond to protect sensitive resources or people's property or um people themselves uh is is a little bit of different question of um how dangerous is it to put a transmission line on that pixel or um a a dor thank you and I appreciate the use of modeling but I think we have a tendency to use modeling and not understand what is underneath it and that's what I'm concerned about is that we go forward without questioning the underlying data so I thank you I I liked your this Kent uh and I like I understand something better now than I did before I believe with your explanation of it's uh the the rating is more based upon how it's likely to spread as opposed to the fuel loading comparing comparing a forested area which is highly fuel loaded to an agricultural field it's way less and so really it's the health and safety aspect is how fast is it going to spread and that's what it's measuring it see sounds like to me um it may be an agricultural field but it can take off if you've got the wind and those kind of things and that's the issue that we're wanting to address chair how that that is correct when we say the risk of widespread fire in agricultural areas is low we mean if a fire were to start in a field the risk of that becoming an uncontrollable or significantly damaging fire is low compared to to other areas and other areas of the site yeah um doesn't mean that if the fire is there it's not bad or doesn't cause damage right yeah councelor Byer I just want to make it clear for the record what Council secretary esterson pointed out that just because it's low risk doesn't mean that an applicant is off the hook the risk level has nothing to do with the conditions we the council can impose and our expectations for managing a fire on site or offsite so risk is informative but not at all determinative of the conditions we can impose so um and again if we can get somebody from Department of Forestry to explain their their magic sort of crystal ball thing that would be very helpful but but know that the council can impose conditions regardless of the risk level and that's something I just hadn't put together so thank you councelor thank you um I think that that discussion that you just mentioned is helpful um in understanding the word low right that we're putting in here I think then that means that it's also um con you know that that means that you would also take into consideration uh the local resources to fight a fire that does break out whether it's low or high and you're in a very rural area with very limited resources so is that being Factor factored into your you know low through high analysis and that's why I understand again that this is a work in progress that we're just kind of sorting through this now as we go but um I think that's a that there a concern you know of what the capacity is for First Responders and firefighters to um and and what they you know this is all a new well it's not new but a wild fire in a public utility area is pretty new for uh wind towers especially um in there in that in this region so just wanted to point that out with the local response or capacity sure we're gonna talk about this a little more as we go on through presentation coun memor yes and that's correct and I was just going to say um we do have more discussion particular on the Public Services impacts and and what exactly um the requirements should be for coordination with the local fire service providers and how you want that process to look and and at what level um you want us to do that review or whether you want to do that review yourself um so that is all open to discussion um and and I do have slides on it more in a minute so guess I'll look to you all to say if you want to come back to that or I can skip ahead now if it's timely I think you can move on forward right Nancy can I get the next slide um so in addition to fire um and we'll maybe be out of the frying pan and into the Weeds now um uh I think the other really significant I mean there were a lot of significant issues raised on the comment but um there were a lot of comments raised about weeds and the adequacy of the noxious weed control plan um race on the record both by um uh adjacent land owners and by the county um uh also participating land owners who um commented on this issue as well um uh uh so the proposed site and the new areas are mostly in um grassland and shrub step habitat it's really a lot of uh what's classified as native perennial habitat grassland um the qualities of the grassland how much of it's native and how much of it is um invasive or Exotics does vary but because most of the areas within ODFW uh Pig game winter range it's be categorized as Category 2 habitat um which is uh as the name suggest the second to highest category of habitat um there is um we are recommending the council um in conditions to uh incorporate revisions to the habitat mitigation plan revegetation plan and the week control plan um to address temporary and permanent disturbances in the area um I we went over what's in those plans a little bit at the last meeting um uh we didn't get comments on the habitat mitigation or revegetation plan directly but we did get several comments um on the rec control plan um specifically related to its uh Provisions for implementation um and uh whether or not there was adequate resources to ensure that um we control measures were adequately uh uh put into place at the site during construction um if I could get the next slide please uh so yeah the map just shows the site um the uh and the the habitat types in the site boundary um and I'm going to uh yeah it's it's helpful to think about the site as kind of three different parts the part north of butter Creek which is really what's extending North into Umatilla County um the part that's south of butter Creek and uh east of little Butter Creek which is what's represented in mostly green on the lower um right hand side of the screen if you're looking at it from my perspective um that area is mostly currently I think undeveloped and is mostly habitat area the portion of the site that's to the west of little Butter Creek is more of a mosaic of crop land and Disturbed areas um and has uh slightly more prevalence of access roads and um for public roads and um developed areas with within it um you could go to the next slide please um we got the uh results of the certificate holders Botanical surveys including noxious weed surveys as part of rfa1 um there was mapping associated with that that also showed the locations of Lawrence milkvetch populations um so that wasn't included in the public record uh of the DPO but we did ask the certificate holder to give us a non-controversial or non uh confidential version of that um uh so that was included in the comment packet um for you all just just uh as illustration really um uh most noxious weeds well noxious weeds are considered noxious um at typically if they're classified as Class A or Class B weeds by the state or by a county",

again we just want to make sure that we're doing a good job of communicating our concerns before we get to those processes so with that I really appreciate your time thank you for your comment can I just ask a quick question um for you as you know um you know we get both side the the developer and certainly the people they're working with that want the project and others might not so um is the efu issue overriding if we had condition if there were condition suitable conditions to speak to the land use land use water not so much land use I guess uh but the water contamination the end of life of the solar panels those issues conditions were applied that recognize that and possible possible solutions the fact that it's efu conversion is that biggest that's the biggest and the foremost concern of of our community yes we just can't keep taking Farmland away it it is it is what makes Oregon what it is the beauty of the Farmland the beauty of the Timber the beauty of the beaches and that's our largest and most foremost concern of continuing to take this and set precedent uh for the entire wamit Valley would be along that same line of thought um once this is allowed where does it stop and is that up to this committee to make that determination where does it stop 1600 Acres today could be from it could Our concern and I I don't want to come across as as a conspiracy theorist but this could this could continue on up the valley and and take away that that that beauty and our farmlands and a followup um so the and I I'm not sure which group when you said you're representing a group is it the community just community community at large yes um so does the group recognize um a solar facility that may have an end of life and council's requirement that it be returned to usable condition um versus a building versus a you know distribution warehouse does the group kind of consider that aspect of it Vice chair Condon we've taken that into consideration it's a 35e uh lease if you will and our concern there is that that land will not be it'll take a long period of time to bring that and renew that land back to a farmable state if if there is such a word um there's a lot of theory that's going into this proposal and we'll have to I don't want to get too far down in the Weeds on that but we don't see the practicality of what they're proposing this is not a public okay s so to answer your question really quick is yes we're taking that into consideration but we don't see that as a reasonable uh return to where it once was 35 years is that's my my I I live rural because I want my grandson to live rural I'm gonna stop stop and I probably went too far with my question because it's specific yeah I will we'll continue the discussion when it's time when it's proper timing thank you and thank you for your question Vice cond thank time again thanks anybody else in the room to comment doesn't look like it so um Nancy about the webinar and the phone I do see that we have a a hand raised at this time actually a couple but let me go ahead and just remind everybody first of all how to raise your hands so if you are on the webinar um at the bottom of the main window is a set of icons click on the participants and at the bottom of right of the participant window is a hand icon if you click on that hand that will raise your hand if you want to comment and when you're finished you can click it again to lower your hand if you're participating on the phone press star three on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and when you have completed your comments go ahead and press star three again on the keypad to lower your hand so at this time I see that Fuji Cryder has her hand raised so I will go ahead and unmute your mic Fuji you are open and ready to comment H good morning can you hear me okay yes okay great um I just have a I have a couple comments on two different topical areas here public comment period and there is another person sitting next to me that will go after me but we only have one computer hand raised just so you know Miss CER CER could we get your address as well oh yes gotcha um my name is G Fuji k r EI d r 60366 Marvin Road M Grand Oregon thank you so um okay you're welcome um the first one is more just a comment or an inquiry I guess um it's just a followup from last month's hearing on contested case rulle making at that hearing I shared a few experiences going through a large cont case and um at that hearing um I told you at that point I I explained experiences and then I told you that stop B2 Coalition would be submitting much more detailed comments as soon as we had them ready knowing how complex the rules were and the sooner you had the substantive comments the better so I submitted these comments to you a week ago I asked Tom and Todd to forward them to you um I also put them in the portal so I'm wondering if any of you have received them yet um my you know if you haven't that's that's not really the point the point is that my fear is that you'll only get them as an attachment to the staff's analysis and Report maybe like a week or two weeks before your next meeting and like Justin was saying earlier when he was like saying goodbye the the complexity and the in the volume is pretty substantial so I wanted you to know that these are in the portal if staff do not forward them to you they're there and um I have them very outlined by the rules and with examples hopefully clarify and I hope you have time to consider them fully before your May meeting thank you on that one my second um is actually really an inquiry that I would like to know what to do um last night uh earlier Sarah's report she told you that the DPO um public comment period has opened for RFA to for the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line last night I sent a an email to Todd with a formal letter from the stop be2 H Coalition um asking for more for full 60 days for this period and um I had a little Email exchange just now with Todd because you know I realize you guys probably don't have this letter and it's less than seven days but if I wait till seven days um to make make a motion to ask for a Time extension I'm not really sure the process um however if we wait till your next meeting your next meeting is actually the deadline so uh the request is formal in a letter I also sent it to Patrick Ro just a few minutes ago is trying to get it somehow into this meeting to ask you to take a look at this letter um it's just one page we're asking for some more time given the complexities of this DPO how long the staff has taken to revieww it another four months gone by um the developer it's all in the letter how long and all and the problems we've been having with mapping and things that are still not resolved and um I would like to know if you do not take action on this request for extension of time today is there a legal process what do we do um because seven days is Tuesday not today so I don't know what really yet to do to ask for a decision on um so that I guess concludes um what I have to say today I'm hoping I get a little bit of a response here I know it's just public comment period but I'm a little bit at a loss okay thanks for your comments uh Miss kryder uh as far as responses you could take the time to consider it today I haven't read the letter so I don't know your standard for requests for extensions of deadlines as you you've done it a couple times in the past you know one to two years is is there a good cause so you have to look at it and assess is there a good cause to to uh to Grant an extension to a deadline uh so you could try to take that up today or you could take it up at your next meeting keep the current deadline and let them know that the current deadline stands and at the next meeting you would possibly extend it or You' make a decision as to whether or not to extend it now I understand that the deadline is at the next meeting so that they would still have to treat the next meeting as the deadline but if you at that meeting decided to extend it then you would be giving them I think an an additional 15 days so it's this decision is a you know it should be done at a public meeting um May I would you like to read to you councelor Grail uh for the record this is Marcy Grail and I just want to remind everyone that I am refused myself from all things related to bdh due to my former employment pacificor so um I'm going to sit here and say nothing unless uh uh secretary serson would like me to move during this okay so I'm just going to sit here quietly okay thank you for that um so councelor grer or yeah okay I know who sorry this is um councelor fire just um before we take up this matter if we could get some advice from Council on how we consider these kind of requests for extension I have not seen one of these before and I don't know what our rules are so is it possible for us to take this up later on the agenda so again the standard is good cause there isn't a rule it's just a general standard that would be applied in this instance you've done it twice in last 18 months I would say once it was uh on B2 RFA 1 request for Amendment one there was a request to extend the deadline for comment and you denied that request as not as there not being good cause and I'm trying to think I think it might have been Nolan Hills okay uh and that was in July it doesn't",

        "text": " application make several assumptions um to to do the evaluation under public services um and one of them is the construction duration which they say may be up to two years but um in the general standard overview the department recommends a condition there that is very typical for other energy facilities allotting three years for the applicant to begin construction and then three years after construction begins to finish construction however this is the assumption that's applied to the public services standard uh the facility may be built out in phases so maybe by facility component or by area or a section um and then under public services like in a lot of i think public services more so than well same as other standards as we look at some at the maximum in impacts what are the maximum amount of people that are going to be on site working and the applicant represents that the maximum amount of people could be 500 people on site at one time um or in one one period usually during peak construction which is during the summer um they also estimate that about 30 percent of those uh of the workers would be hired locally and so then with that maximum number that would be approximately 150 workers would be uh hired locally and then during operation they estimate about 10 to 15 operational personnel would be working on the site so this is a list of the uh public and private service providers that is are evaluated underneath the standard this is a list of ones that i'm not going to talk about today the ones i'm focusing on the presentation is i'm going to talk public and private providers of traffic which includes automobiles and air traffic and i'm going to talk about fire service providers which are like fire districts so i'm not gonna talk about these but if you have any questions we can talk about them there is overlap in between i'm gonna go over water rights section and there's overlap with the water service providers same thing with the waste minimization section that i'll do um there's overlap with the solid waste management so um not totally skipping everything so the applicant estimates estimates that of those maximum workers um that there uh could be um well that of with the workers and delivery trucks and other equipment that would be uh that would visit the site that approximately just over 2 000 one-way trips would occur during this peak construction um part of the evaluation of traffic safety uh the applicant and the department evaluated the umatilla county transportation system plan or tsp um and then we also worked with the county and we did verify that it was last updated it updated in 2002 so it's it's a little out of date but what the tsp does provide is it talks about road designations of like bigger highways going down into arterial highways county roads um and it provides it talks about the conditions of those roads anticipated construction projects for those roads and also it gives you estimates of like the traffic counts on those roads um and so that was uh part of that and i'll touch later because we're you know that information is useful and it's from the county however the applicant and the department also referenced used and updated the data and the evaluation for traffic uh predominantly based on oregon department of transportation or odot um so it was kind of uh the traffic analysis is kind of a combination of this figure here um i think most of us are familiar with this area the applicant you know predominantly for the major highways is going to use i-84 um but and so those are those are larger roads generally in good repairable condition um managed by odot receives federal funding etc um a lot of the evaluation in the draft proposed order focuses on these it says cr and it has a number that's a county road and so these are the county roads and this is from the application that the applicant is representing that these are going to be the prelim are the primary hall routes um used inside you know for delivery to the facility particularly this 1350. so this route going from uh 395 over here to the site boundary um is going to be one of the primary hall so in the application the applicant talks about um makes representations of measures that it will do to you know avoid reduce um or mitigate potential impacts to public and private providers of traffic services which we look at which is like the county's road use department um we could also look at like odot people that manage roads um there's a little bit of overlap with some you know police police services um and the potential for police vehicles to need help navigating certain traffic but the department compiled um all of these the discussions um into a traffic management plan that's attached to the track proposed order so it's a department compiled document of applicant representations um and those an aspect of the traffic management plan is the applicant's representation that it will execute a road use agreement with the county um and road use agreements are very typical for fsa projects um and really the road use agreement mechanism is functionally what kind of reconciles the outdated transportation system plan because part of the rhodius agreement is that the applicant in the county are going to do a pre-construction inventory where the roads the primary hall routes they're going to be used are identified the condition is identified if any of the roads need to be improved to facilitate the construction of the with the construction vehicles they would need to be improved prior to construction and then the roads are monitored during construction and then after it's done there's a reconciliation and the roads would be any damage would be um repaired to the existing or better condition and those are just some of the components of the road use agreement which is a component of the traffic management plan um i'm going to move on to air traffic um all sorts of public services we look at air traffic service providers um who is that predominantly we look at airports and people that use navigable airspace so when we're talking about air traffic um this is a wind facility and so a lot of what we're looking at are the tall things so um the wind turbines are at 496 feet we have some met towers at 266 feet and there's also various proposed transmission lines and alternative routes um that vary from about 100 to 140 feet this is a table from the draft proposed order um that identifies the airports in the analysis area and the distance um from the proposed facility as we all kind of have been visualizing this facility all day it is you know has an odd shape and it's very big and the airports are kind of peppered around so actually chris clark um helped generate this table and just as a note if we were looking at a map the uh the direction provided is the direction from the site boundary uh to the airport location so of note here this west butter creek is obviously the closest airport it is a private airport it's like a um like a runway runway strip but it is not a public uh part of the application review and one of our reviewing agencies is the oregon department of aviation who we also call oda um which the oregon department of agriculture is also oda but oh in this context oda is aviation um and uh and there's also um a an aspect that an applicant when we have these tall facility components is required to engage with the faa the federal aviation but uh council's reviewing agency is oda um but we did a pretty significant preliminary review of giving um and again chris clark helped help with that review as well but engaging with oda to do a preliminary assessment of potential impacts to navigable airspace um so that you know preliminary assessment um was done um so i have a couple conditions here but the interesting thing is really kind of the faa guidelines are what dominates here and they have two criteria of when this uh this form the 7461 the notice of proposed construction or alteration this evaluation of when that's triggered and it's either triggered by the proximity of a facility or facility component to a military or public airport um and that in this context for this facility is 3.8 miles so that's one one trigger of this review the other one is if you have any facility components that are taller than 200 feet so as we saw in this slide there is an airport at 3.4 miles but it's a private airport it's not a public or a military so the first the first criteria is not triggered this 7460 review is is triggered um because we have tall facility components so um the conditions in the dpo are that um essentially the applicant is going to um resubmit and submit this form to the faa oda and the results of it which would likely be a no hazard determination because also the tallest facility component is still lower than 500 feet um and yeah those results would be submitted to to the department um under public services we look at fire protection service providers which predominantly we look at fire departments so there are several fire departments within the bigger analysis area but the two fire departments that would actually serve the facility site boundary is the echo rural fire protection district and the umatilla county fire district number one um the applicant provided correspondence from both of those fire districts in its um and and the fire districts do indicate that this facility is located in a high risk zone for wildland fires similar to the traffic management plan the applicant provided and represented a breadth of measures of best management practice practices um to uh to implement during construction to avoid or minimize risk of fires associated with construction activities um and then so the department took those representations and compiled it into what we call a fire prevention suppression and emergency management plan which is attached to the dpo so part of that plan has a construction component and then there's uh also the operational component because as we are aware this is a big complex facility there are facility components generally that have an electrical component so we have transformers transmission lines um the battery storage components um the the wind turbines all of these have some electrical component and there are fire risks associated with them so in this plan we basically break out and talk about the potential fire risk from certain facility components and then measures the applicant would do to reduce those risks um the applicant also uh provides um oh it's like a table of contents from an fire management plan uh and that includes those and so that basically a finalization of this final plan would include all of the details from the application and then a more a bigger build out of that table of contents that they provided which has a hazard",

        "text": " talk about consider um community benefits which again goes back to section two of hospital 2021 around prioritizing benefits for communities and then define out what benefits are and it could include economic development resilience some of these other other pieces so just some some thoughts there about how to maybe add a little bit of nuance to those uh to that list there but i think generally it looks pretty good thank you and it looks like nikita agrees with you orianna all right rep owens thanks stephanie and it's probably ingrained in all these but uh some emphasis on you know local ownership community-based ownership uh when we talk about equitable outcomes i think the ownership of some of these uh projects is going to be very important to small governments or community-based organizations i like to look at that and also like to just agree with uh ariana on the resilience what is resilience and what are the metrics and how we're defining that for different communities because i think it'll be different thank you uh james i think you're next in my list yeah thanks and definitely agree with everything that uh has been said uh just in the last couple of minutes i also just had a question on the consider perspectives of other stakeholders i i feel like maybe we want to define i guess i'm not sure what the other means in this case like do we mean stakeholders outside of this particular group or um if there's some better way to kind of i guess define whose perspectives are being centered or or considered um i don't necessarily have a recommendation there but it just kind of stood out to me a little bit like whether the other stakeholders i think that was more at like you have your viewpoint think of the other stakeholders within the group and maybe what their viewpoints would be okay that helps just in defining what what that means yes yes that's a good all right i'm gonna button with just one thing that i think would be helpful for folks to know that um we're planning on having as our approach for the recommendations um i keep talking about it like spaghetti i think our plan is to have a recommendations list that is sort of all the spaghetti that we get from all of you and then there'll be decisions made by others legislators you all advocates etc about what sticks to the wall for next steps and we'll provide some information about like level of support um to some extent but i think that we want to make sure everybody's voice is heard since it's this worker study and not ours so we're not interested in having it be uh consensus based recommendations that are required to be included in the report because we think that there might disagreement between work group members i mean i think it's evident that that's the case from working on these issues through the years for some of our experts so just kind of a heads up that the principles the reason we mentioned the perspective of other stakeholders is we're hoping that the ideas that come forward from this group won't include something that's just like obviously not gonna happen for some reason but if we still want that idea to be listed we can include it of course but we're just hoping people will sort of consider that um and what they decide to move forward i hope that's helpful to share and give a little bit of context on like our approach and it looks like we have rep onesie and angela both up maybe again maybe not um you're welcome to either speak up or pick your hand up mine is back up again just one comment on the the last thing you said christy um i'm a i like the all the spaghetti on the wall approach i would rather us not limit ourselves by what is feasible i think it's really important for legislators to know what should happen even if it can't um that's you know that's kind of what studies are for so i um i know we've talked about this in the past but i think it's a good idea to put all the ideas out there for legislators that's one thing and then the the second thing i wanted to say is i think um i'm not quite sure how to word it but i think one principle that's important is the special benefit that smaller projects can provide as opposed to larger projects when it comes to balancing community needs and stakeholder needs so for example small projects are well solar projects are great for things like dual use or agro voltaics and that is a way to balance agricultural needs water needs renewable energy needs economic development and because smaller projects are just a little bit more they can really help balance some of the competing needs that larger projects have a harder time balancing i'm not quite sure how to concisely say that but i think that's that's a good overarching principle i understand so like highlight the benefits um unique to small projects how's that yes i like that okay i'm gonna go ahead and start typing on the screen as you guys are talking so um just excuse that and um rep owens did you have um a or did you you put your hand on okay uh jimmy lindsay thanks this um as jimmy at pge and it's just going to share that i think the sort of list here as written um you know i think looks pretty good i think some of the suggestions sort of offered over the last little bit i think would be worthwhile to sort of discuss in this afternoon but i do think it makes sense to sort of reinforce what's you know that contribute to maintaining affordable energy for um and perhaps we can say that a bit more precisely i mean given that we're talking about how we have been talking about through these workshops principally about renewable energy projects i think we can be a bit more narrow to sort of discussing you know maintaining affordable electricity rates for oregonians you know energy is a bit more just a bigger catch-all um and i think it might make sense to be sort of precise that one of the guiding principles of our efforts would be to maintain affordable electricity rates for so change from energy to electricity rates and just maintain affordable electricity rates is that what you're suggesting yeah i think that would be i think that would be a helpful clarification all right any thoughts on that from all right silence um nikita um actually can you hear me yes um i raced again i'm not sure you could see that but um yeah this is the pure show man from pacific core i want to agree with what um jimmy just i think it you know we we have heard through these workshops the value that these projects provide to the state as a larger communities and so we are supportive of in any way utilities can help but see that the the larger statewide economic benefit sort of supports state funding as opposed to utility funding which would direct costs more at a smaller group um where these projects are benefit to to all oregonians okay thank you again yeah the the idea that you know we we want to make energy hold affordable for all oregonians in the most um you know reliable and sustainable life so really appreciate it thank you very nice to have you today um did we get to know you nikita you ready yeah thank you um i was wondering for supporting project transparency were you all thinking like transparency around project was developed um what really like where funding came from or like um yeah just just wanted to to learn more about what you all were thinking about well i as an economist will always say if you give me data that is transparent i'm very happy about that um that's my judgment on that but i just think transparency like knowing what's going on what's going into these um uh just just greater transparency so that other people can follow similar models if something worked well um just knowing what's going on in both the policy um and project and christie jump in if you have uh no i was i i was on vacation when you all developed this yeah sorry i forgot that's fine um which is great but um but i think one thing i was just thinking about that relates i think to project transparency although it's bigger and i'm wondering if james might wanna be focusing on me for a sec um is that james had brought up and it's something that i think kind of like was either i don't know what we've done with it since then but james brought up early on like it'd be nice to be able to see all the information that we could possibly gather on small-scale projects in the state in order to kind of figure out where we are and where we're going so i'm wondering if like support project transparency might include embody that concept too of like that information is not necessarily collected by anyone right now in one place um that is easy to find so anyway just throwing that out that i know james brought that up and i'm bringing it up for him now he has his hand up so i hope orianna will forgive if he wants to comment on what i'm saying um and then we'll go to orianna yeah thanks um and yeah this is a kind of internal request that i made as chris chris was mentioning earlier um to understand more about the ownership of projects throughout the state and this also gets to something that rep owens uh just mentioned as well about it's good to know the policies that we're putting forward is actually leading to diverse ownership of projects and so i think having that baseline of what are the entities that are in the market now and you know whether those a combination of llc's or municipal entities or tribal governments or you know to the level of detail that we do have information in some of the state databases as well as as well as federal databases about the ownership and operation of existing small-scale renewables i think would be great to know that landscape because you know ownership is one major benefit and economic driver of the reality that we'll see in this space so and the policies that might change as as a result of this report you know in in my mind at least should seek to new entities getting into ownership um or different models of ownership so so yeah i think that's kind of the broad narrative of data and transparency about where we are now and then what policies would adjust kind of that reality in the future i feel like i just heard about a conversation stephanie and adam on our team had with minnesota where they found out that minnesota has this kind of really robust community solar program you hear about it at every conference you go to um for state energy folks and we found out that the vast majority of ownership of those projects",

        "text": " been hearings officers who have said well you didn't talk about that that part that how that influences this issue therefore you can't uh include it in your arguments so I think we need to look at that I guess that's probably enough for me right now um maybe more than enough for you but okay let somebody else talk sure and just uh on that note thanks so so much Irene for all of your suggestions uh and thoughts uh um well I'll look at you in a little bit so uh when everyone's finished Renewables uh Northwest if you have any we'd love to hear them thank you um yeah I I think I'd like to start with some context and I won't have quite the same list of specifics with some of the folks who have commented so far um so we kind of come into this rulemaking against the backdrop of having worked on passing and now trying to implement House Bill 2021 from the 2021 legislative session which uh requires Oregon's largest utilities to move to 100 clean electricity by 2040 and also included in that that bill that passed a couple years ago was a general policy statement um saying that the legislature um you know wanted this transition to 100 clean energy to be carried out to the maximum extent practicable in a way that brings direct benefits to Oregon um so there is definitely a hope and and I spoke to this hope in some of my legislative testimony at the time that a significant number of projects uh supporting this clean energy transition would be built into Oregon uh if you look at the first clean energy plans that have come out from both Pacific square and PGE the scale of the need to build and develop new facilities to make sure that we can achieve that 100 clean electricity uh mandate it's really significant uh it is likely that fsec is going to be very busy uh in the coming years in particular you know there's there's not only a 20 40 100 mandate but also a mandate that those utilities reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 80 by 2030. um and getting there which is you know seven seven years away six years away depending on how you look at it calendar wise um that means a lot of work not just over the coming decade but really in the next few years because in order to achieve those Mission reductions by 2030 you're going to be going through permitting processes essentially now that allow the um you know the the project to get permitted and then build and then actually operate in a way that allows the utility to be displacing emitting um all that's to say um there's going to be a lot of work happening at fsec um meanwhile from the perspective of an organization that works with a lot of renewable energy developers has a lot of developers in our membership uh fsec is generally considered one of if not the most onerous permitting processes in the um I have heard not just anecdotally but you know concretely from some of our developer members that they will not build projects here because the process is so lengthy and cumbersome compared to you know the opportunities that exist in other states and I don't bring that up today actually to criticize that SEC but rather to praise you for undertaking this rulemaking and centering uh efficiency in that first bullet point I think that's going to be the watchword that that we bring to this rulemaking process and encourage other participants to do so as well efficiency doesn't have to mean you know it doesn't have to be in direct conflict with robust public engagement uh but it we're going to be looking for ways that the process can become less lengthy and less costly um while still ideally preserving or even potentially um you know ensuring that there are more robust opportunities for public engagement and I think some of the things that we've heard from other rack members so far and that are in the staff memo are probably a good way to do that adding Clarity and specificity to the rules so that people know what uh meaningful engagement in an fset contested case process looks like um so yeah we definitely support the idea of trying to ensure that the rules provide uh more information to potential um you know interested parties as to how to raise issues with adequate specificity to preserve them in the hope both that the sort of arguments that project proponents are going to want to understand and address can get raised clearly and that some of the stuff that's you know maybe less well developed or less clear or less well supported by the evidence on the application gets cold out early because there's no need to spend time on stuff that is kind of a hope as opposed to a real point of contention there are other points in the rules I'm sure where uh connect Clarity that will benefit project proponents and uh intervening parties we'll be kind of looking for those that don't have a list right now um but and I'm sure there are also other places in the process where we can potentially bring more efficiency to um so that's just sort of the lens that that we intend to bring to this and it's again as an organization that does not directly participate in contested case processes I'm not going to have a laundry list um but sort of look forward to reviewing the the ideas that come from some of the folks who do directly engage and trying to help find Solutions um and I did also have one I don't know if this is the right time but question stemming from the staff memo that gave rise to this rack which I think you've kind of alluded to earlier but the bullet that was included in the memo on clarifying what can be appealed to council and what cannot um was not sure exactly what that was referring to um so if at some point in the process um you can maybe share a little additional light on what Steph was thinking there I at least would appreciate it uh that's all from me thank you yeah so I'm happy to just hit that point real quick because we do have time um and also I would like to kind of speak to your broader Point as well because I think it's worth repeating and just keeping in mind throughout this process uh with respect to that bullet um I don't know if Patrick uh is on uh he's the uh staff attorney who represents Council in in these contested case hearings um but oh there he is uh my my take and actually I'd love you for you to correct me if I'm wrong or confirm that I'm right Patrick is that uh essentially certain certain issues uh parties can take straight to council to get resolution and other issues they have to wait until essentially a final order before they can can raise that issue Patrick can you can you speak to that yeah the way it has been uh set up is that there aren't inter it's called interlocutory appeal there are no interlocutory appeals unless the hearing officer has made a decision that would terminate your involvement in the contested case so let's say you have to raise three issues in the contested case and the hearing officer believes that none of those issues should be should go to contested a case for whatever reason you didn't raise it with sufficient specificity it's not within council's jurisdiction if you wanted to bring three and the hearing officer rejects all three the result of that is now you're not able to participate in a contested case so because your participation is completely cut off you can appeal that to council if you raise three issues and the hearing officer just says no one of these we're not going to engage in for whatever reason you're still participating in the contested case on your other two issues so you would not be allowed to appeal that the dismissal of that one issue to the hearing officer that's how we have it has been handled in the past uh and that will certainly be subject to discussion during the course of this rack thank you appreciate the additional clarification there thank you Patrick uh to the broader point I just want to make it clear I don't uh we do have some rule makings that are coming down the pipeline that I think are going to be very uh heavily subscribed to and attended that are going to make it easier or harder for um applicants to get a site certificate in the state of Oregon this rulemaking is not necessarily designed to do that from a standards perspective to basically lower the bar that an applicant has to meet to get a site certificate however the goal would be to make it less expensive and more and more efficient for this I mean there's no reason unless you just you know I suppose there could be there could be constituents who just don't want to build anything and so they benefit from this process being as convoluted and as complex and as as expensive as possible um staff's opinion and and uh Sarah is on the call can correct me if if uh she disagrees but is that you know the legislature essentially determines what uh the council has to consider and uh protect as part of uh you know granting these site certificates and these applicants they either meet these standards or they don't and if they do they should get a size certificate and as part of getting that site certificate and establishing that they've met those standards we should be making that process as efficient and cheap and quick as possible uh whilst maintaining you know the quality that we can we can be confident that that they are in fact Meeting those standards so as part of the process that's going to happen almost every time uh you know on some level it does happen on every time we don't want this contested case process to be any more expensive or onerous than it has to be it should be efficient it should be quick we should be having fights about did the applicant meet the standard or did they not we should not be having fights about I'm a party you know did I argue with this those are going to happen but we should make sure the rules are as clear as they can be to minimize the amount of time that we spend in that process on those kind of process issues so that's kind of my Approach is the rules uh coordinator on this project is you know where can we identify issues of confusion where we create or modify the existing rules in a way that will make them easier to understand for uh this the um the applicant but but also for those who are want to participate in the process so that they can preserve their rights so they know you know for example it has come up and it's going to continue to come up you know what what kind of sufficient specificity and we should maybe come up with the",

        "text": " go in to get why not yeah thank you that's a great question I can understand why it might um not seem economical but the the way we see the a r is that if you reduce the rate you're extending this program to more oregonians and creating a more stable clean energy economy that way so it's um really about uh it's what we've seen is very large rebate and incentive amounts that could actually be uh spread out to more people and last longer rather than what we've experienced when I said Cliff events this means like the money is getting is running out fast and we're all scrambling as contractors to fill these cues quickly and if the rebate amount was reduced that can slow down the cliff event reduce the impact of this instability and allow more organians to go solar and Frankie to give you a little bit of um I've been around our agency for a few years and in the time I've been here this program kind of came online and the money went almost right away and then the program closed down and we actually ended up having to lay off our workers because we ran out of the money and then we had when we did get more money we had to rehire our staff which then retrain them and get all the systems back up and running again after the program had been suspended for a bit so it created creates for an agency perspective if we run out of the money it creates this Dynamic where the program stops everything stops and then if it restarts again it's like takes longer to get it started again so if we have the program be able to be sustainable and last throughout each two-year cycle before the state puts more money into it then that's better for our contractors who can continue to offer the rebate for longer and it's good for us because then we don't have the situation where we lose staff and bring them back I will say that our two staff that we have now because the program now has a longer life than it had in the past we extended the sunset the the length of the program in legislation so they're they're really not going anywhere but that boom and bust thing um could be problematic and has been in the past so that's I think part of what people are thinking about and then um Frankie you can go ahead and respond to Laura and then I have a question in the chat next well thank you so much Laura that does make sense and in fact I could see how that would benefit someone like me uh in that I might actually have a chance to use a rebate it sounds like in the past a lot of people maybe wanted to use a rebate but because of the cliff ran out uh just to follow up on that history like in the past how many Resident non-lmi signed up uh when it just kind of I'm trying to gauge the rate at which the money was uh or the offer was taken and now that give us a kind of a complicated question so there was a set amount of money in the past I'm wondering how fast it ran out given and how many uh residential customers it served and then now with more funding what is the forecast of uh forecast the number of residential customers who are will be able to take advantage of this program how am I I'm not sure we can pull that information fast enough to answer on the webinar but I think you have to sign up with your email address to get on so we could follow up with you on that if you'd like we have information where we could like show how much money total but we'd have to like look back at like a timeline and then we it depends on how long the money will last based on what the rebate amounts are like which is something we're pondering with the rule change right right yeah I'd totally be interested in that information of course but the uh yeah and I understand that that's hard to get right now cool thank you so much yeah yeah we have like the numbers that we'd have to like crunch them to specifically answer that so um so we'll have to follow up with you and then the question in the chat was is there a required amount of storage per amount of solar installed and just to say one thing to be clear about is you are not required to have storage as part of a solar PV system under this program but if you were to add storage James um are there any minimum amounts that are required yeah so if you choose to um install storage with the solar um then the system must include a minimum of one kilowatt uh DC of solar electric capacity for every five kilowatt hours of battery storage um yeah the contract will be able to kind of figure out what that means for your system um but there is like a minimum requirement in the the program roles hopefully that answers Nancy's question and with that I don't see any other hands up or any other comments in the chat for us to take up today so we could perhaps move on to that last slide I know it's a little early but uh before we move on I would just like to mention that if people are finding they have questions come up or comments on these rules after today uh please drop me an email my emails there and we will be having another webinar in October uh on October 7th as well so and if memory serves I think our plan is that we'll incorporate any of the comments we've gotten so far into sort of our thinking that will present so if you were to come to the webinar in October you might find us having a different thing that we've now added or something we've tweaked or changed from this original one based on feedback received yeah if we're hearing a lot of strong uh information from stakeholders this isn't a good idea this is a good idea or there's maybe there's another thing that people are like this should be included in a rule change um then there may be uh kind of adding to that discussion in the next uh the next webinar thanks Christy um and so this is really just uh thank you all for attending uh today and if you have any questions about the program or wish to learn more uh you can visit the the program's website and these slides will be uh up and you'll be able to kind of click on that um URL link from the slides um or you can ask program staff and the team's email address is on the screen so this will take you uh through the team's mailbox is uh be the quickest way to get a response um and Dale and Katie uh will be looking at those responses and so unless there's any other questions or comments coming in I wish you all uh I love the rest of your day and thank you for coming yeah I'll just acknowledge Angela's Angela and Frankie's comments here at the end got it noted and I will go ahead and stick around for a couple minutes in case anybody would like to say anything else and then but folks just absolutely start peeling off and just if you have anything you didn't want to see in front of the whole group I want to mention to James because he plots our course feel free to come off you can see or to raise your hand or put something in the all right it doesn't seem like anyone has anything for us so I think we'll peel off too you know how to find us and if you're still on and hearing us chat feel free to get in touch on this anytime between now and stay the date again October 6th and this informal period in them again lots more opportunities for comment to come all right I think we can end it whenever",

        "text": " generating the electricity there would this would initiate a study and this study process would determine all of the different parameters or costs that would go into an interconnection agreement or their transmission rates here is a flow chart and i will mention that this is for large generating facilities partly the the facilities that you'll be seeing in the fsec process are these large generating facilities that will be connecting to the transmission uh versus smaller ones that could connect directly into the distribution system which doesn't necessarily fall under for jurisdiction and the point in showing this flowchart is more about there are a couple different places where projects can kind of fall off of of this interconnection process first it um these are all sorry let me just go back to my notes here for a second so interconnection requests are governed by what work we call oats or open access transmission tariffs which in this case doesn't mean but it means in how a utility interacts with and charges its rates to the customers so it's determining the relationship that it will have here between the utility the or the provider of the transmission and the customer in this case the generating facility so traditionally these transmission this process has been what they call a serial queue process which means first come first serve which has meant that there's been a backlog the queue just gets um it gets backed up and what we're seeing right now is is very true to that and that is partly because they will study each request on an individual basis to figure out what is needed to accommodate that particular facility to on the grid so this is a very time consuming process and as you move through this flowchart there are different levels of studies that are happening and at each step or stage there's the potential for these for everything to fall off as i said so if you see uh this right i'm not sure if you can see my mouse but the withdraw interconnection request that is like the first chance for a project to be removed from the queue but as it moves through these different study processes and reviews there are other opportunities for it to not progress in the queue and as it gets further in the queue the thing to note is that there are for withdrawing from the queue because they've had all these different studies they've put time into it and for the and so it could be excuse me that these projects decide at some point there's just too much uncertainty to continue in the interconnection queue meaning that their cost of remaining in as they go forward so there's actually a move right now to do what they're calling a cluster analysis so instead of reviewing uh projects on a case-by-case basis they're taking them in from geographical areas and studying them all at once to see what can be accommodated so we're hoping that this will alleviate some of the congestion in the queue right now we've heard that this process can take anywhere from one to three to complete to end up at a at a connection interconnection agreement it's slightly complicated but hopefully i captured some of the elements that can make it uh impact the timing of a project then can ask a question so where would this happen uh in the context of an application for site certificate would would this be initiated before during or only after because of the uncertainty aspect of it and that it has cost implications this would most likely happen after thank you but i don't want to say that absolute because there can be nuances are there any other questions or i will hand it over to max to start talking about um the off-take piece which is very much interconnected with this interconnection process all right thanks max i'll hand it to you yeah and that's um just what i was going to say and they can sometimes depending on a an applicant's risk tolerance um they can run in parallel and we're going to see a little bit about kind of how that might work and how the interconnection process can have interplay also with this next step of securing off take um this is a topic that's also i would say changed some um in recent years it used to be that there were relatively um you know limited paths for off-take uh of renewable projects but as renewables have become least cost least risk resources um we're seeing most procurement happen via competitive formal competitive bidding processes or rfps um the the council has seen some projects go through that um you know ended up having ppas um essentially with specific off-takers as part of a voluntary renewable program like green tariff um diane mentioned earlier but there's a move now in the most recent utility rfps to identify even those those green terra for voluntary resources via this formal rfp process so that's really what we're going to focus on here today so this formal rfp process is governed by oregon public utility commission or in the case of other states the utc has its own set of competitive procurement rules up in washington and the idaho public utility commission requires idaho power to conform to the oregon rules that's potentially in flux there's an ongoing docket at the idaho commission don't need to get into that but in any event um we do have this this pretty uh regimented approach to to competitive procurement the process can be lengthy estimate normal launch of a proposed rfp to actually accepting bids it can often be about a year and then there's additional analysis to determine um you know which bids utility selects and then after that we get into contracting which i think diane's going to talk about a little bit later also so it can be quite a lengthy process and i think what we really want to highlight and what i'm going to talk about in a couple of examples is that often just to to participate in these rfps to have a chance of being selected you have to have not just site control but also a permit so a site certificate or you know it's the equivalent at the county as well as achieving certain transmission and interconnection so in particular on that interconnection point you often need to have proceeded through that flow chart enough not necessarily to have a fully executed interconnection agreement at the time you're selected but at least have a study that says this project can interconnect and come online in time to meet the timeline of our rfp so if we have identified a need in say there needs to be a study coming out of the interconnection process that says yes this project can be online by 2024. um so that's kind of how some of these things can end up running in parallel and then there's there's even kind of a further risk for projects participating in these rfps in that you know you can have a project that's on it on its face it's just sitting by itself you know looks like the cheapest project round on on a pure like dollars per megawatt hour basis um but utilities make their selections based on portfolio modeling where they look at how all of the different resources that they have on their systems and all of the different resources that have been in will interact with one another and they choose the cheapest portfolio not the cheapest resource so it's really challenging you know when a project bids into an rfp it can look great on paper it just might not end up being the thing that fits best with uh with what the utility determines it um it you know will meet its needs best on a portfolio and really what all of this is designed to do why there is this competitive and lengthy process and why the utilities go through you know create these um sort of restrictions on uh what bids need to meet and then go through this portfolio level modeling process it's all about minimizing costs and risks to their that's another thing that is essentially outside of the control of project developers but that is kind of a central consideration in everything that happens in the regulatory process and and these formal rfps so on the next slide we'll start talking about a couple of examples um let's start with pacific corps 2021 all source rfp um which saw it was a huge rfp it sought a total of about 1800 megawatts of solar co-located with battery resources and 1900 megawatts of wind that's based on their preferred portfolio that came out of their integrated resource plan process and the preferred portfolio included uh 500 megawatts of solar co-located with battery resources in oregon so and they did this kind of abstract modeling exercise using proxy resources so not actual definitive projects and they said you know it looks like on a portfolio-wide basis across our six state territory our customers would be best served by going out and trying to get 500 megawatts of oregon solar in order to participate in the rfp there was not a firm requirement that bids already have a site certificate in place but the way they structured the rfp there was a strong incentive to have to be far along in the permit process and ideally to have permits complete including potentially a site certificate so those percentage figures that you see there on the right are the percent of the total bid score so you know you get six percent of your total bid score is having your permits in place um it would be potentially challenging then you know you would be disadvantaging your project to not have a site certificate already in place by the time you're bidding into an rfp so we kind of laid out that that there are risks you can have a project that looks you know cheap on its own but it's going to be measured on a portfolio basis and it has to already have that site certificate in place even to play and compete meaningfully in the rfp next slide in the end in this particular rfp the company received approximately 98 oregon bids that doesn't necessarily mean 98 completely separate oregon you know different bids can look like different configurations of essentially the same project and even that 98 number is sort of extrapolated from a report that was produced by what's called an independent evaluator in the regulatory process so it is fairly approximate but it gives a good idea of how many played and many were forced out even just by the interconnection process and this is also a conclusion of the independent evaluators report so the reason for that is diane referenced a move to cluster studies you know the company's irp had sent this strong signal that they wanted a bunch of oregon solar so a bunch of oregon solar projects all put in interconnection requests to be studied together in the cluster study that was ongoing in summer 202",

exhibits that are in the in the packet photos one and two showing these um front porch railing and uh front porch column as well as the uh historical photo from 1978 shows the column and those are character defining elements of the house and that and I think we can do everything we can to preserve the the core vaults and the railings and the post and so on so I think I'll direct my other questions to the applicant to clarify some some issues are there any questions for staff good question um there's a few windows that are proposed here at least was their original Windows it seems on the um Family facade um was there a window assessment um submitted with the application a winter condition assessment so the applicant can speak to this as well and I think the primary reason for the replacement is the weatherization issue so uh the the needs have double pain as opposed to single pain okay um and then just kind of talking about the condition for it to be a wooden post um just to clarify if the post is does not retain 50 structural integrity and can be replaced you know the building specification are we replacing the post with wood or the wood composite so the condition is intended to be and they're they're proposing what can positive customer trivia thank you um so this is more of a general discussion item I I've had to deal with many of these issues myself and like Julia I guess I should have said I also lived in that neighborhood so I am thrilled that the health has been rehabilitated and I've spooked around and looked at a great detail pictures too so a couple of comments I I object um to the requirement to replace it with in-kind materials simply because of the time that that house was constructed the materials available were far below the standard but quite available materials are today for example the moldings that appear on that um are actually readily available from the same Mills that know the original materials but they are made out of much more durable materials now so you know I I mean I think it makes no sense to replace them with the same materials with the original materials a poor choice they were simply the only choice at that time um and they were very very importantly they just don't hold up but the new materials are sandable paintable it's completely indistinguishable from wood um so I would remove that condition if it were up to me and I would suggest that that not be a precedent since I'm going to be doing miles of that stuff on the outside of my house and I've done tons of it on the inside as well and the results are the results match exactly so what was the original I think they just put plain you know so I think it is possible to do it with newer materials and not have to match the emission materials um but to match the look um so that's that's my only objection here from our political question for her staff these are all expenses for right now please okay so I guess the question is can we modify that requirement to make it more feasible um for the owner to restore it in a way that will last better and and longer yes of course so again these are just recommendations for you to consider and I should give a little background so part of um what I did with this particular case as I reached out to the restoration specialist who you're familiar with at the student contribution office just to see what they're recommending for decorative features like this and this is what was recommended to me but again it's it's a discretionary hearing you you can adopt these conditions as written or you can modify them into the previous case so and you can take them clarification and understanding so I did yeah that was a question I asked which is part of the reasoning behind their comment that um the windows are going to require verification of adequate egress especially at that rear but I was told that for presidential property they were required to have a are there any other questions for status all right thank you Kimberly I will now call for the applicant's testimony you state your name and address for the record or your business address if you're representing the applicant and please note that your testimony is limited 15 minutes okay residences in San Diego and then we have another medicine that's important uh either either one of everyone 1500 uh Skyline Boulevard so my wife and I um with the intention of it I'm recently retired from the practice of law I've been watching a TV show This Old House for the last 30 years you know a way to jump in and uh I don't think it doesn't really make sense for the financial standpoint is an intermittal property which is why I think it's never been a fixed up before the uh the cost of renovating the house would couldn't really be justified because it would take many years to repeat it but I have another incentive than that it's a good project so we work more of our kids um the house is in uh extremely important position I don't know how long they do that a team that has been in the house uh the prior renter owned it for 30 years or so they would uh they were active tea landlords and I spoke to their radically and they told me that you know they just had a standing order just don't spend any money on this house and this is absolutely necessary and as a result it's deteriorated over time um I heard your comment I am the most popular guy in my history right now all my late papers are very excited about after after I bought the house I needed for the first time I suddenly we went to Orlando University said oh yeah that's where my fraternity presence uh what I bought it there were there were tenants in the house they were all uh alcoholics and audience you cannot imagine what this place oh my God you know uh you know uh but we're very excited about it but they've seen that they've already been doing a lot of work on the landscaping and uh making that looked a lot better but what questions I think you had a question about the I think that was really honest yeah oh um in the in the report so I said you want to mirror the front because it's only about maybe this High we're just coming at the time that that house has been now building clothes require nothing to be higher uh so people don't fall um so what I had in mind is to have that rail that that rarely match the rest so so what you have is is railings don't look like look like what was it'll come around and then go down the so it'll look really nice and are you going to wear that the building codes are not retroactive I think if you well I'm not an expert lawyer not a builder but from watching this whole house when they address that issue uh they they had to make them notes either well there are a number of ways to to achieve a protective railing height without removing the existing historic railing and that's what I'm what I'm concerned about is the um there are very few features of that house that that haven't been messed with over time and that porch is one of the character defining front elevation features of the house and I think that it needs to be protected and um you know putting back shingles on the Dormers oh that is just wonderful these are things that was my character yeah all of that is great and um you know using modern materials for the flat work on the porches and you know steps all of that that's the Sears that's that's all just great but um but I think there needs to be a balance between preserving those few remaining character-defined features and livability uh longevity ability to render the weather here so the composite composite um horizontal surfaces steers floor material is fine or trailings because you're going to want to have a you know a safe railing but I uh I'm very concerned about keeping that original",

        "text": " put Marion county on the transportation map. That's why this client has come here, because of the things that y'all previously did that showed that Marion county is a great location for this type of facility. They've already come here, they've already built almost Dominion square foot building south of this one. But to look at this thing in a vacuum I thought was somewhat misleading. In fact, this is the culmination of decisions that y'all's predecessor, some of you were here made starting in 2009, and I think that you'all ought to get credit for that, as should the city for, you know, for broadening our economy and getting this type of project to come here. Unlike the previous one, this one doesn't require a bunch of effect, no public incentives upfro front. Now, there may be users that come along that can deal with y all like the dollar tree did, but in terms of the infrastructure for this one, it's either there or we're building it. And that's one of the present things we're going to present in this thing today. Keimley Horn has designed a PowerPoint presentation for you, and I'm going to ask you to bear with us because it is a little longer than usual. But the reason is this is a full package for you. We've got comp plan amendment. We've got a pud with a final Pud master plan. This is not one where we're coming up with a concept plan and saying, oh, we'll be back with the master plan. We're dealing with that here. We've got our traffic studies done and accepted by the county. We're not coming back with the concurrency agreement. We've got it here for you today. And we're dealing with two other important issues. They're almost like the tail wagging the dog, except that they're a really important tail. And that's the issues with the PLT vacation of the road closing, which actually have consumed quite a bit of the time on this project. But if you'all will bear with us, we're going to try not to overlap. Rick's going to talk about primarily I'm going to talk about comp plan Rick, Pud Amber then will talk about traffic. Some of what I will be talking about later on is traffic in the context the concurrency agreement. But if you all would bear with us, I think we'll be able to show you the full picture so that you'all will have everything in front of you and can make an informed decision on this project today at this time. And I'd like to start out by showing the first Rick Crystal. I push this button top buttonai forward. Steve, would you come up, identify yourself, give me your address and tell us a little about Transesterern. And the next we'go to the next slide. Can you do that? Sure. Good afternoon. Steve Cross. 33. 43 Peachtree Road, Suite 1850, Atlanta, Georgia 30326. I am the regional partner for Transesterern Development Company. Transwesterern is the largest privately owned commercial real estate service company in the country. At this point, all the other companies of our type have either joined or been bought by larger public companies. We have a family of different companies within our umbrella, one of which is the development company, which I work for. We really specialize on two product types. The part that I work with is exclusively light industrial logistics property like this. We often capitalize our projects with joint ventures with some of the largest institutional investors in the country. Oftentimes they are state pension funds which are attracted to owning this type of property because of its long term cash flow characteristics. What we were attracted to by Ocala, really two things. Logistically, we think it's in a great location to basically catch product as it comes into Florida, often from the Atlanta market, and then be stored here and then distributed out to the rest of the state. The other equally as important aspect is the labor pool in Ocala by some of the companies that had located here. OCLA is very much on the map for being a very good source of labor for these types of facilities. And really the only thing I think holding Ocala back is just the need for more available product. A lot of times companies do not give themselves a whole lot of time to build a ground up facility. So having inventory of spaces like we develop ready for those companies is a big component to attracting them. Thank you, Steve. I think the next one is. I know we'll get to that. Rick'going to show the existing building. I just want to refresh your recollection. You can y all see this? Four applications today, two agreements. Again, this is a summary of what we're doing. The comp plan amendment assigns employment center land use which what most of the property has to the parts that don't, the rural properties and the county owned Dras Pud with a master plan. Closed roads. Those roads you'll seen a little bit were created by deeds before the Platte. Other roads and lots were created by the Platte prov. A concurrency development agreement. Approve a road agreement. This is the comp plan and zoning. As you can see from the picture to your left, most of this property already has an employment center land use. The ones that don't are the RL, the rural properties that we acquired that we didn't buy those from Deltona. And then you can see the small green areas. Those are county Dras to the right, you see the property. Most of it has an m or B. Four zonings. I want to say something about this part of Marion Oaks. It was always designed for other than residential use. When they plotted this, they plotted this whole thing north of 484 as one big subdivision. And when you see the Pl, you'll see they didn't pl it into what you would think would be commercial industrial lots. But they recorded a set of declarations, a series of declarations that limited the use on this part of the property to either commercial, retail, or industrial. This has always been designed for non residential use. And so that's how you got the land use and the zonings already existing on here and now. Rick, if you'come talk about the building they've already got and then what the pud is going to be about. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, mister Chairman, Commissioners Richard Bush with Kimley Horn and associates offices, 1700 Southeast 17th Street, Ocala. So I'm just going to walk you through a little bit of the pud. I'm going to talk about the features and how they're laid out, how it relates to the existing surrounding infrastructure. I am going to talk about buffers and go through our thoughts on what we put together there for you. Just want to show you a current picture of the building that transesterern is finishing up on in the Marco Polo pud. This was taken by drone just a few weeks ago, so you get some idea of the size and quality of the product that transwesterern is bringing down to this part of Marion county today. This is now available for leasing. 934 4000 sqft. This is an image that shows how the proposed Pud master plan relates to Marco Polo and also to the existing building. So the building that's furthest to the south, that's the one that's in the ground today. So these three buildings up to the north with a 3.6 million square foot cap, is the pud master plan that we've brought forward. As you go around the property, we have a lot of different neighbors. So we have I 75 over to the east, down to the south, of course, we have Marco Polo Pud, where our client has already constructed a facility, the Ocal Sun RV resort, moving further west counterclockwise, undeveloped lands owned by Deltona. And then our west boundary is actually 29th Avenue Road. We're not directly adjacent to another property of other use, but we do have a roadway over there. And then west of that you have Marion Oaks subdivision. Some of our neighbors are actually larger uses there is a church property out there and a commercial property. And then there's some single family homes as well. Up to the north, we have a little bit on the northwest where we're against the Florida greenway. And then if you move between those two retention areas on the north side, we have some neighbors. And so these are larger parcels up there where we have residences that are living. They're right behind me. I'm sure you're going to hear from them. Jimmy and the applicant and Kimley Horn have been meeting with them to try to explain to them what we want to pre ##ose take comments from them and try to make sure that we're putting a project together that respects their properties to the best of our ability. 20th Avenue Road comes from 484 and current point to where? I'm sorry, sir. Of course I can. So 20th Avenue Road comes from 484 and wraps up around the west side of the existing transesterern building that was actually built by Transwesterern and is being completed now. When this project moves forward to the north, assuming it will extend that road further up and go over to the west and connect to 29th Avenue right at Marion Oaks Trail, provide a way for people to enter into the business park from the west. If you live up there, if you're coming from northwest Ocala and you want to get into it that way. And to clarify that 20th Avenue Road that was required by the county to build the first industrial site. Mister chair, may I ask a question? Yes. So just because I'm curious, would the way that the buildings are laid out, would they make it more conducive for the traffic coming into the commerce park to come in 20th Avenue or to go up 29th and then come in there",

um there's also a requirement from from the developer to have these monitoring plans in place in terms of and studying any type of risk for them christy are there any more questions we have one hand up we don't know if it's for public comment or for a clarifying question so it's up to you how you want to handle that and just if we get any more questions for whitney just a reminder that we're having a really hard time hearing um online when she's speaking so we really appreciate you speaking up thank you so much are there any more clarifying questions in the room otherwise um we can move to the public comment list that we have here okay christie why don't we go to um the first person in the uh that has their hand raised and then i do want to queue up we had people sign up for public comments and we did ask the question that if you traveled over 100 miles or more to provide comments so we're going to go through those votes first and so i'm going to queue up heather and lori to go after the person who is online um go ahead christine great if linda could unmute harvey harvey you're ready to go yes thank you very much uh i was just uh you're doing all this study on the ocean conditions uh i recently heard a report that off the northern uh washington coast they had a noaa marine they recorded a what they call a rogue grave i think oceanographers call it this wave was like 45 feet high are you going to be uh in your studies on the wind generator sites uh including studies on frequency of rogue waves in that area and two it's just a when you select a site are you going to have a very high resolution sonar map of the ocean floor terrain using either oceanographic ships or a remote operating vehicle to get a detailed map of the ocean terrain at the site i'll start with um just mentioning that our study is a little bit higher level as to barriers and challenges but um whitney sort of has left our table that may be something if that's a level of detail that may occur um if you know later in the process with boeing with the construction and operations plan i'm not sure um but i did want to say that kind of overarching comment and see jason if you have anything to add about this study i agree i think we're going to be at a much higher level than that and to be clear oregon would not necessarily get involved into developing the logs open as a state but we wouldn't we're not going to be building it so um that would have to be part of the environmental environment or or some micro sagging process to overweight mitigating against you know jason could you maybe start that over sorry to be a voice from on high but we can't hear you out here thank you i'm not too sure what um i said wasn't heard but we're going to keep our studies on high um heather are you still here um did you want to provide public comment and then after that lori uh i'm heather mann i wasn't sure why you asked the hundred mile like me to be prioritized but um i appreciate that uh another man with the midwater trawlers operated i guess my public comment is that as the study moves forward and as we consider what you read at the beginning of the mission of oregon department of energy i hope you really parse that out while you're providing your response to the and that you do a thorough and authentic and honest job of really representing what the challenges of offshore wind i know that people get caught up in renewable and green and think it's but i think what you're hearing and seeing from not just the fishing industry but from marine biologists all kinds of everyday people a lot of concerns about the risks of wind development particularly floating which does not exist in the form that it would be off of oregon in the conditions that we have and to risk jobs um the federal process is going to go on it sounds like regardless is sort of what i hear from wendy's responds of what oregon does so i think it's really important that um you accurately capture what those concerns are that you've been hearing through these three meetings and probably listening in another the round table here last week and others that that will happen because i think there are considerable impacts um that don't necessarily the benefits perceived benefits of you know i've asked paul to provide in i know this isn't about the call areas but i think it's important there are no instances where the levels of impacts negative impacts have resulted in bull not moving forward with the project so that i can find it i've asked for an eis where eventually that project denied and they don't exist so that's not just here that's on the east coast as well so having negative impacts is an acceptable cost of doing business and and putting with the time frame that we have and getting to 2040 or 2041 i think we really need to be focused on things that we can do onshore whether that's you know solar panels on every building whether that's making sure our existing wind farms are operating at capacity and growing those wind farms why wouldn't we do that instead of put 200 turbines twice the size of the statue of liberty and liberty 20 miles offshore where we can't see what's happening we have a lot of concerns about that and we really hope that you will incorporate the concerns that you're hearing in the report thanks thank you then um hillary would you like to go next thank you um lori steele i'm in the west coast food processors association i will just uh echo heather's comments um related to um optimization um what's currently out there in terms of our showmance solar energy and all of our sources of renewable energy i hope that the study addresses that issue um i appreciate the acknowledgement of cumulative impacts is a challenge and i hope that this study really looks at potential ways to address that boem's process does not provide an opportunity to address it in jason's presentation um he did bones in the same process as the first step in offshoring development but this step does not include or require an eis um it's not clear at all how to address the challenges associated with minimizing cumulative impacts once boem identifies within the energy areas there is only in the ea conducted for the site assessment activities um after the leasing has occurred um after the areas are auctioned off and a lot of money has been spent only once the lessees have submitted the instruction and operation plans then in the is the eises are done independently project by project not in combination with each other or not in consideration of cumulative effects and this is really the last step before um there's no in-depth environmental or social socioeconomic impact analysis until it's far too late uh so i hope the odoe study includes recommendations that require more in-depth analysis up front in terms of looking at the big picture and evaluating all possible sources of renewable energy i think we really need to think very carefully about how this energy is derived where it comes from and who it serves with the real question that i hope the odo report addresses is will there really be a net gain from offshoring oregon has a very rich history in fisheries environmental conservation and environmental stewardship the state of oregon has more at stake and we stand to lose more than most states if we advance offshore wind without avoiding and minimizing the conflicts that we're identifying and really addressing the environmental impacts i hope the odoe report is comprehensive in terms of spelling out for our oregon state legislature just how much we have at stake and what we stand to lose if we incorporate offshore wind into the matrix of clean energy in oregon fishermen provide sustainable healthy protein with the lowest carbon impact it is true that this is the case more than any other protein source in the world so we are already doing our part here in lyon it's attacking the climate crisis and this really needs to be accounted for in terms of what we actually gain with offshore development in our clean energy profile in oregon thank you thank you gloria um i'm gonna queue up bill and then jason bush from uh ocean and um who traveled apart and then i'm gonna just before you speak just check to see if there's anyone queued up online nope i don't have any hands raised right now thanks yeah thank you from uh for coming here staff d.o.e and david brock smith for having initiated bill 3375 to get these discussions going i'm bill guarano i'm a resident of brookings i've traveled here this morning to notice on the way up which is a spectacular day beautiful i'm a brain biologist i really appreciate the value of the california current studied it for years i also worked for 30 years as an environmental consultant worked on large energy projects what i wanted to do is to emphasize the changes that are happening this morning the associated press had an article that said for the fourth time in seven years ninety percent of the corals on uh grain barrier reef have bleached we have reports here that consistent since 2006 where the there are announcements or hypoxic zones off our coast here it's associated with the change in wind we critically have a problem with the um climate change ninety percent of the heat that's been trapped has gone into the ocean as a marine biologist it really affects them so i know that we have to take change we have to make that take action we have to get off fossil fuels we have to look at all the different options that we've got in addition to the to the resources we have here we have some excellent research organization we have osu university of warring diversity oregon's uh school of architecture environment has a landscape architecture program we need to take an overall view of what's going on so we have an appreciation for what's happening at the ocean on shore and all the stakeholders so there's a lot there oh and osu has a world-class research institution no one is there we have the resources that we need to be applying to now as i said i'm a climate activist and i'm concerned about the speed with which things are happening it's got to be balanced now there's a lot of concern about cumulative impacts the bone process that's that",

so um but I think that that's where her comments about the use of glass hill come from but I really wanted to note on her last just to kind of if um Susan's listening if Miss gear is um that and I kind of pulled it up here in our in our DPO she makes this closing statement of you know another 1.6 miles of Roads would be detrimental and I do want to clarify that I looked at it it's it's the table in protected areas it says the closest facility component or the closest site Foundry Edition in rfa1 is 1.6 miles away not one not a road that's 1.6 miles long um in the map of me looking at it ah there you are so here we here we are have we got one of our one of our little noodles our road noodles as I like to call them now what's interesting here right so this is the previously approved route and then see this shaded area this road segment is actually all in the previously approved site boundary this is the little tiny bump out anyhow but this road segment which is un236 is about uh uh 280 feet long or this little road segment is so and this is 1.6 miles away so I just want to make sure that Miss gear knows it's not a 1.6 mile long road that's like right next to Glass Hill okay remove this moving along doing great but he's doing great okay uh again any so you know there's a little bit of blending with mascara's comments about you know um information from the already approved Morgan Lake alternative and information from the ASC um allegations regarding piecemeal um this is that part maybe I'm gonna go over to Stop's comments so one you know and and stop and you know and reasonably so right like we're here getting ready to review the draft proposed order for roads and routes and rfa1 and the certificate holder oh there he is uh just walked in the room and then and then they submit rfa2 on us so you know like really it's hard and so I I don't blame stop b2h for talking about the upcoming rfa2 as part of their comments for rfa1 but really it's not applicable to RFA one so we just but you know so it does but they are using that as the basis for the piecemeal review so you know and I think as the certificate holder Mr stipple clarified a lot of these changes are coming out from them actually gaining access to some properties and working with landowners and it's and also going out in the field and doing final design and results of actual pre-construction surveys are necessitating moving the facility around so you know and it does make it seem um and Idaho Power wait that would not be glass Hill that is the Williams property I'm reading your comment Jim okay thank you um so uh sorry threw me off a little bit here you guys uh uh or folks anyhow um this is the the name yeah Mike sorry I lost my train of thought I'll get it back I'll get it back the piecemeal review it's just it's the nature of adding on additional areas um to select in final construction so really the thing I want to reiterate that hopefully stop hears and that Council understands and other members of the public that's applicable to rfa1 it'll be applicable to rfa2 not everything is being built out it is going to be one or the other right so but we're adding on so things are going to get real bloated and then they're going to shrink back down when Idaho Power actually cites the final design for the facility so and this is you know and it is a little bit it's a little bit difficult um because the the scope of what we're asking and what council's looking at um really is on whether or not these little pieces meet a standard um you know so it's it's just a little bit difficult because the tendency would be to look at the entire facility with that additional change but that's just not what that's reopening what we just looked at and fully vetted and so there has to be some way to narrow just the impacts associated with these uh with these additions so let me see okay let's go back here okay mapping the mapping is again and I felt like I tried to touch on this in the beginning in my presentation all right say for instance these these guys right right here and Mr Kreider provided in their comments a map that's associated that's taken from the ASC as part of attachment B5 which had a higher level of detail of the road segments then in the application there was Exhibit C which was a map set that showed you the route and the roads kind of more like pulled out a little bit and then attachment B5 was really targeted towards these Road segments and showed in detail each of the road and then what in rfa1 they kind of combined the two so their map set of the amendment also included those Road segments rather than making them two map sets so but this is the the difficult and I feel like that this is maybe what Mr Crider would want and I feel like rightfully so wouldn't it be nice to see one place where all of the roads are that have been approved but it's difficult because then for RFA one how do you pull out and highlight what we're looking at it may it would make it very it would make it very confusing so um and I but I feel like that's the the contention with the mapping all the mapping actually meets council's requirements of scale um designating um you know land markings waterways we also have other maps that for instance this is um the land owner map so it's kind of depending on what you what question you're asking what you're interested in you know this has like tax slots on it different topography so there's various but I think that you know the explanation or the response to the mapping issue is that this is done out of necessity to highlight the areas that are being added in rfa1 and that to show also the small segment or the road segment that that bump out is associated with with the approved route but really understanding that in that any of that shaded area that there's approved roads all through in there okay uh helicopter use okay all right okay so this one is gonna be interesting interesting so let me pull up pull this up I may have my esteemed colleague sit here to see if she has any feedback um I'm gonna pull in Miss estherson on a couple of these because a couple of these edits came from certificate holder proposals but also Department um recommended revisions um and as I've mentioned several times miss estherson's the one that really is leading the pre-construction efforts and when you're looking at things of actually implementing a condition you see things different like she's learning things and we're trying to take it an opportunity to not lose the the substance or the intent of a condition but is there some way we can make it more implemented um so and then but with the helicopter use one um basically stop b2h saying you know don't don't remove that 30-day advance notice to landowners about helicopter use and then um Miss esterson and I looked at and were like oh yeah I don't think we intended to take that out yes we should leave that in however what Idaho Power says in their response which I think that might be good for Council to consider because when you're actually on the ground going into construction things happen pretty quickly Idaho may not really know which areas they may be using helicopters 30 days you know I don't know the value of doing that advanced notice because the actual knowing where they're going to use it is might be in a shorter time frame so that I um so that in this I'm going to pull up this last statement from Idaho Power uh Idaho Power proposed these modifications to allow flexibility if Council would prefer to include a defined period for notice Idaho Power proposes that a three-day landowner notice is sufficient to preserve the flexibility of the construction process this will create a more adaptable approach for the construction team to work with adjacent landowners on a schedule that is adaptable to the needs of everyone including impacted landowners for example with a shorter notice period Idaho Power may be able to accommodate landowner requests for modifications to scheduling helicopter activity however with a longer notice period Idaho Power would not be able to make such accommodations um I'm going to pull up the condition on the uh in our amended site certificate and I don't know if you want to add anything but I think we're going to put what do you want to do Council let me find the condition here put something on the table my expectation would be that in the construction of a transmission line it would be availability of the materials when that was available um when the actual helicopters with lift capability were available what the weather conditions are that that might you wouldn't want to take a helicopter under load in weather conditions yeah yeah sure so knowing 30 days in advance what all those would be would be kind of extremely difficult particularly with the route of this transmission line so I think some flexibility is warranted I think councilmember Devlin those are those are good I hadn't I hadn't thought of those considerations but that's a really good point oh oh but with what three oh well no well so what oh oh um well right now yeah oh sorry yes wait what do we want are we recommending something well so basically you have a um so we removed the 30 days and then Sarah and I were prepared to um you know resend or like reverse that and then Idaho Power and their responses provided this context that Mr uh that council member Devlin just kind of supplemented I don't so basically you have an applicant proposal of changing this to three days right now um so I would say that that is what is um that's what we would change it to or that's that's what we would like responsiveness on can if I might get the applicant to nod or something even though you'd only provide three days notice I mean it's going to be pretty obvious where the transmission line is actually under construction and there'll probably be some notice to landowners in the area that construction is occurring and it may involve the use of helicopters",

        "text": " whether the council wants to have a conversation about it maybe you want to just talk to each other but that feels to me like the approach here given where we are with lots of different pieces of paper with different redlining around yeah this is hanley i wanna i wanna talk about what your concepts are that are different than what the hearings officer has already suggested um in her draft proposed order i don't want to go word by word here i want to know what do you feel is not captured in the hearings officer's proposed condition okay yeah and this is uh kent and i agree with that i think we have the proposed contested case order on the screen which this is right right that's the final document that we're wanting to know do we need to change or add mr anuta can tell us paragraph by paragraph if that has the language that they're hoping to have and then allow lisa to respond correct does that work okay so if we start with this paragraph that we're looking at on the screen do you have suggestions that you would like to see made to that paragraph carl anuta yes stopwood proposed that this paragraph be expanded to cover not just the 41 nsr's listed but all potential nsrs within one mile of the and that there be there be a written notice that includes the parameters of the mitigation what are the options and what's the complaint process that will ultimately exist there and we felt that the generic the language that the hearings officer used in her first paragraph there did not capture that level of detail okay miss rachner what would be your response to that so this gets to a point where i was saying we think your concern is covered in a different condition this particular condition is specific to those landowners for whom we do predict a an exceedance and requires us to mitigate and to work on a mitigation plan with them so it wouldn't be appropriate to all the folks going all the nsrs in the area for whom no exceedance is um is expected but in i believe it's condition three is it um come here and i can pull up all i have so many documents pulled up on my little tiny screen here let me see what i can find right here okay so it is condition two so in condition two and maybe you could look at that carl and see if that satisfies your concern that requires us to create a new version of x7 which is the list in the that includes all land owners up to one mile and to send notices to those and inform the recipient that they are the owner of an nsr and tell them about the requirements of the conditions which include the complaint and mitigation conditions and and also let them know that prior to construction the certificate holder will develop and submit to the department an noise complaint response plan so that's the place where we propose language i think that gets carl to your concern can i respond i'm happy to do so yes okay um i didn't want to take up extra time if i um does get some of the issue that does not in our view get all of the issue because that we added that in addition to notifying everyone within one mile we added a specific paragraph that proposed the specifics of the the notice and what it would cover i think the language that the hearings officer covered was not quite as detailed or and it was more of a broad brush and so we were trying could you maybe thank you that's the first time in many years someone's told me to speak up hold mike closer to you it's usually the and carl could you and by the way i i guess i would ask the council's permission do you mind hearing a conversation between us just to try to so carl would you mind pointing out what what you think is missing from what the hearing officer adopted let me find that section um that i did not see and perhaps i missed it in condition two a list of what the notice to the within one mile would include like the list that we included uh in our sub b of our proposed condition one well you can point me to that yeah just look at a 2a the certificate holder will send notices to all land owners listed in the updated attachment x5 which notice shall inform the recipient that the recipient is the owner of an and the requirements of noise control conditions one and two and by the way there are stray numbers in the proposed contested case order but i believe this means noise control conditions one and two as adopted by the the noise conditions one and two talk about mitigation obligations and also talk about the complaint process trying to find so this is counselor buyer it seems as if the list that b2h is proposing of what's in the notice is a little bit more as to spelling out what idaho power has agreed to in terms of mitigation and and i think it's it's i think as stated the information is there it's just not as specific as what b2h is for notice language to the expanded list of oh help me on the acronym but nsr so it's whether or not i think the council the department feel like we need that next granule level of information in this condition the only thing that i don't see aligning the details of the mitigation information that would be required in in the condition i think the complaint process is clearly outlined in condition so that information is there uh though not necessarily in the particulars of a notice requirement excuse me if i'm misinterpreting no i i don't think you're misinterpreting but i i would like just to direct your attention um council member buyer to uh subsection c of amended noise control condition one which talks about which which talks about um idaho power will propose and also is specific to any folks again this was in response to something stop b2h brought up was that if there is someone who has a health condition that they believe would be exacerbated by sound levels then they can request a much more robu even a much more robust set of so i think it's in there because i think it's everything that we that that we were ordered to do and required to do and we offered to do i believe it's all in there i and i do i do wonder if maybe one of the ways to address mr anus concerns is that if the full set of conditions just gets provided to the landowners so every landowner can just look through and say this is everything idaho power's required to do you have rights you can take advantage of them i might make a suggestion i've got an idea there but go ahead for the record i'm comfortable with that approach i think that um we implement the conditions and need to enforce them and the public know what those conditions are should be helpful before you respond i just want to say one more thing which is that given where we are in the process particularly where we're thinking about making changes to wording on the fly as a lawyer that makes me a little nervous and so i i think the best way to make sure everybody knows exactly what their rights are is to give them the full set of robust conditions as opposed to us now trying to revise the conditions themselves to try to provide some different notice i do have one other alternative that i think we have out which is that if the council is not comfortable with just providing the full list of conditions to each land owner we could have an agreement that we will work with odo as to a different notice again i just feel like we're safer though just going with those conditions council ratcliffe yeah so one thing i just want to point out here is that we if memory serves um i think helen maybe perhaps you could correct me if i'm wrong but i think we have one change to a condition that has already been um accepted by the council through the straw poll we have another one that is on the table still that we're planning to do you know at the end of this process related to the blasting notice and my recommendation again is that changes to conditions constitute material changes that require a material change hearing before we get to final order on this if that alleviates any concerns here about you know having a chance to conditions and make sure that the you know department staff and and i have not made errors in trying to translate uh there will be an opportunity to comment on um uh the changes to conditions that get made before this gets to a final order thank you and since i've been sitting here trying to bite my lip if i don't if you don't mind um i have a number of different thoughts on the process issue my suggestion would be you listen to stops the reasons for wanting a change to the existing order what we're suggesting and you can go work with the department or suggest that the department look at our changes or ms rachner's suggested change now of uh providing all the conditions um and then come up with a proposed final order that will then go out to hearing or a change hearing if as mr ratcliffe calls it from a substantive standpoint the difference what we proposed and what ms rachner is proposing is that most people when they get in the mail a list of conditions that's written in legalese are going to go what what does that mean so what we were proposing was a notice to people that there was they had some rights here's the outline of what those rights are and here's the processes that are and that was the intent of our changes to condition one uh which we were trying to get at the entirety of the folks and as i read condition two it doesn't necessarily require that kind of notice to everybody in the that kind of notice being the kind we proposed of here's your rights outline in a simplistic form and here's where you can find more information that does not appear as i saw it in condition two instead it focuses in on the process and the plan and that's great and sets out those things but it didn't provide the notice and that's why we proposed the language at the beginning of condition one i think we've heard from patrick good idea we have filed condition two that way i'm sorry you don't read condition two in what way condition two does require that you go back to condition one that's the way i read it i mean i i this condition was as ms rachner pointed out put in in response to concerns raised by stop i read the condition as if the plain language of it says certificate holder not the department the department does",

        "text": " we'll bring it back to this board. Anybody would like to discuss it, or someone would like to just jump in and make a motion. We don't need to discuss, we know it. I agree with staff's findings and recommendations and here I hereby recommend approval of the requested zoning based on the following facts will not adversely affect the public interest, is consistent with the Marion county comprehensive plan, and is compatible with the surrounding land uses. Do I have a second? Aye. Andy Bonner, second the motion for approval. Motion a second. All in favor? Aye. Anyone opposed? None. Motion carries. Yeah. Make sure that you attend the county commissioner's meeting in this auditorium on October 17 at 02:00. It will be heard there. Good evening. Kathleen Brignoli, growth services. This is item 231-0060 DC. This is a rezoning from single family residential to multiple family residential. Asian on this was Maria Avendano. This is 6.5 acres in total. So a couple of the parcel characteristics. So this parcel has high density residential land use. Again, that's going to allow four to eight dwelling units perennial acre. Currently it is zoned single family residential. It's not a plotted or recorded subdivision of any sort. There is a home constructed on the property, built in 1935. So there is presently a home there. They are located within the primary springs protection and also the urban growth boundary. So one of the things that we definitely want to focus on is the existing uses. Perennial property appraiser so everything that you see in yellow surrounding this parcel, those are single family homes. The orange up here in the northeast corner, those are mobile homes. So still single family homes. And then over in the northwest corner, you'll see some of those brown parcels. Those are technically multifamily, they're duplexes. So there are just a couple of duplexes in the area. And you can see the aerial here. The yellow points are the address points. As far as impacts, there's not going to be any adverse impacts to things like the transportation storm water that would have to be mitigated for connection to water and sewer would be a requirement for this. I would say based on the fact that there wanting to do a multifamily. If they are within that connection distance, and especially because they are in the primary springs protection zone, they would want to be connecting to water. So as far as the comprehensive plan, they did meet a lot of the elements of our future land use that we would be looking for. But we did have some concerns with a number of the items, namely that this is a zoning that is not compatible with the zonings in the surrounding area. This would be asking for, you know, r three zoning with this land use would have the potential of adding 52 dwellings to that property, which is a rather long and narrow property. So as far as the comprehensive plan, we did have some issues with the consistency with the zoning and then also the compatibility of the current uses of those properties in the surrounding area. This is kind of a big jump to go from that single family to the multifamily in such a small area, which then goes into our next point of the comprehensive plan that is not being met, which is policy one. 1.6, the buffering of uses. This isn't really a step down. This is going from multifamily in very close proximity to the single family. So we did do a site visit and I wanted to show kind of some of those homes in the proximity. So in the center here is that existing home that's on the property. This is looking to the north of the property. And then this is kind of looking towards the back. So you'll see it is just a very long, narrow property. But you can see those homes are directly next door. And again, this is looking to the south of the property. Those homes are right there next to it. This does have a half circle driveway. So there are two points. You're seeing those driveways on either side there. Another thing that would be of concern is the width of this parcel and having access for that many homes if they were to develop to their multifamily potential. So as far as staff, we were recommending denial on this one based on the fact that it could potentially adversely affect public interest. That remains to be seen. It is consistent with some, but not all of the comprehensive plan elements that we looked at. And while it is compatible with the land use as far as that high density residential, we don't believe it to be consistent with the use of land in the area. So staff was recommending you have your alternate conditions to go against. Staff approve it, table it, whatever you may choose to do. So I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Anyone have any questions up here for staff at this point? If I understood correctly, the only access to this property is off of Gainesville Road. Correct. Okay, if we can hear from the applicant. Is the applicant present? Right up there. You can go right here. Right here? Right. Well, have you state your name and address and have you sign in. Good evening. My name is Maria Avenzano. I'm a real estate agent here for 20 years in Merrion county. Your address? Your address? My address is 4881 Southwest First Avenue, Ocala, Florida, 34471. When we got this property with that small home that she showed right there, we bought it with the intention to have like a family subdivision. Because I would like to have the map. I don't know if you. Yeah, you will see it right there. This property has a small house at the entrance and as you notice, is a long piece of land with 6.5 acres. When we went to the county asking to see if it's possible that we can have. Because one tiny house for 6.5 acres, it doesn't make any sense when it's surrounded by single families and three reals. You guys will see right there, three reals, single families, three reals in front of the property, some three reals at the back of the property and single families in the south. The county told us the only way that you can do more than one home there will be applying for a reason. So we follow the advice that the county gave to us. We have no intention to do 52. I don't know where you get that number? I have no clue. We don't want any intention to do 52 individual units. We just want to use that lot in a smart way to have five homes, six homes, anything that will allow to have at least ten homes with half acre or five homes with one acre, something that we can use that land properly with something nice. And it is right there. It's surrounded by single families, as you see, that have square acres. So how come we are going to have a single family in 6.5 acres when it's surrounded by single family homes with quarter acre lots and multifamily? We don't want 52 units. No way. That's not our intention. We just want to have a smart use of this land. And as she said, it's not affecting in any way. No the structure, no the utilities, nothing. It's already there. So that's all I want to say, because it's very plain and clear right there. And as the, as the size of the lot we have already. I'm an architect in my country. I'm from Colombia as well, from elder guy, but I live in Ocala, and I used to work with an engineer, Miles Sanderson, engineer for many years. And that's what I did. I did site plans. I do architectural. So we can have something smart right there with, I don't know, five homes, six homes, anything with a nice row that goes all around, have some nice green areas. We just want to have a good use of that land. Question. Go ahead. Go ahead. My question is for staff. Has there been a mistake here? Because everything. It's actually r one that surrounds it. R1. And you have currently r one zoning, right, which would allow one home per acre, correct? Maybe more. A little bit more than that, but yeah. R1 allows for single family homes. So I don't understand. The current zoning allows you to do areas, what you just told us you wanted to do at the podium so that. Yeah. Thank you. The r one allows you to do, ma'am. R one allows you to do what you're saying that you want to do. Five or six homes, three reals is the higher density, but when we went to county, it's in your favor. Listen, you're okay right now because you can answer. But you told us you wanted five or six homes. Your current zoning would allow that and more to change it and a little bit more to change it to. R three would then technically allow you to put many more homes on that property. So I'm not. I'm just not quite sure. Do you want five or six homes or are you looking to zoning that in the future you could have any more? We don't want our three. What happened is that we went to the county to see how we can subdivide these to have these homes. And they asked us to have the rezoning application. So with. Also, I think this is some type of miscommunication from the county. Because if this is not necessary to do it, then we just can, you know, start the process to sell it as that. We can build, I don't know, four homes per acre, three homes per acre.",

introduce Andrew Compton uh our new development manager the new China thank you very much welcome good afternoon Jay Harrington and Commissioners so I'm coming caliber housing director and with me is um I'm Andrew Crampton development manager all right so we are here to discuss the Metro affordable housing Bond and so this slide is just trying to see where we are now we've spent about 89 percent of the 116 million we were allocated and so we are course to meet or exceed all the go all the the goals we have just about two units to go on the overall seven units to go on the two and the 14 for the extremely low income the extremely low income is obviously the hardest and uh and we are talking with our partners and we have no concern that will meet all the goals and we then go borrow some of Oklahoma County's money if they haven't been there we suddenly and Andrew we shared this later on in the program we have 48 million in applications for the 13 million we have left so yes willing to move wow we are happy to uh please let Metro yes well we got lucky because we jumped in early interest rates were low we decided you know this was the right environment to go aggressive and with the support of community County Administration we did our first notified was big and the prices are going up you'll be amazed what it's costing nowadays to build this apartment oh a smaller bouquet but more expensive flowers more expensive flower exactly I'd like to correct you though I you said we got lucky and I don't believe that that's the case I think it was you were intentional absolutely so thank you for that already we had big discussions one of the questions is may I ask a question if you go back to that slide um what does it look like with the with the governor's statement about 36.6 000 of all types yeah I'm just curious how you know in relationship to how hard it was to get here right that's that's I just wanted to be thinking about the future you don't have to answer that question right now but we should be aware right so they have corrected that they are hoping the private sector will do half of that okay so 18 000. it's going to be about yes um 36 000 a year but still 18 000 a year or the whole state on the public oh for the whole state so the private sector would take 18 000. yeah but even what approximately what increase do you think that is over what we've done here um well I'm trying not to speculate but this was 653 million the goal was 3 900 units so if you use the same math you're going to be needing a good two and a half billion five times more at least yeah you could do the eighteen thousand and uh that's just in gap financing the total cost will be you know a year correct in one year yeah thank you do the math before the governor announced that I just wanted to gain perspective on that so I appreciate it well no we have a big audacious goal because there's a big audacious need right that's it's based on need uh achieving it is a mistake can borrow money from themselves like we're gonna do this we're going to further investigate I'm always looking at options that's right thank you for helping us learn along the way cool people so uh Andrew you want to good afternoon my name is Andrew Crampton development manager with Washington County I'm here today to talk about the process uh for the 2020 metro housing bond nofa this was the remaining 13 million dollars in bond funds just a couple date components to establish timeline the the nofo was released in late summer of 2022. couple things that the milfa called for based on the analysis that was done in the previous slide as far as available units and unit type the first was looking at a higher percentage of deeply affordable units and then also in conjunction with that looking at a higher percentage of two or more bedroom units really focusing on three or four bedroom units and then finally looking for projects that included permanent Supportive Housing units these were some of the goals to establish competitive criteria for scoring for the applications and applications were due in October to set the context for the review process when applications were received is Staff performed a threshold review to make sure each application submitted uh materials that were required for analysis including Financial pro forma programming mix and development team then an underwriting review was performed by a third party Financial Consultant on each application to make sure that the application is fulfilled in this industry standard underwriting the Review Committee which was composed of housing advisory committee volunteers or Washington County staff all who whom had affordable housing expertise was convened to review the applications the Review Committee met to discuss questions and share perceptions after they reviewed all of the applications in third party financial analysis underwriting criteria after the the discussion on on questions and perceptions Review Committee members then individually provided a provided rankings of each application staff tabulated the scores to create and create an average score for each the scoring criteria to determine the the scoring is above as you can see in in the chart items like Financial feasibility Target population advancing racial equity developer capacity and Readiness to proceed these scoring let me find me real quickly the advancing racial Equity two years ago the score was 10 points and the County Auditor through his audit recommended that we beef up that area so we doubled it for this particular one and if you recall there he said we didn't we were not specific enough in the narrative and we argued back that we had doubled the score and that was complying with his anyway that's that's that a step in active double that scoring in your mind the advancing research agreement was 10 points in 2020 and then for this one we were 20 because the auditor said we we didn't sufficiently emphasize that category okay of course rally based community-based culturally specific so where did you take the extra 10 away from uh we took it from all the other categories kind of a reallocation reallocation here by Five Points each or something okay well you may have only had 10 points when you did the contracts but the way that I've heard at least the community engagement with things like the Somali circle with uh viewfinder and others you certainly delivered uh we had extensive Community engagement we had Vienna stories in doing one project in Cornelius um and many others and then the we have a minority jail contract on Goldcrest yep so we are out there talking to people getting them involved so yeah good work I wanted to mention that we are being responsive to the audit yeah thank you five applications were received in in October in the chart above shows uh the the project names generally project sponsor developer units metro housing Bond funding request and then the overall total project project cost I guess we're at least two or three of those are can you tell me generally where they're Woodland Hearth is in Tigard Dartmouth Crossing also in Tiger Hawks Landing a proposal is from Tualatin 72nd East Wellington and then just compassion is also in Tiger yeah three and tiger 2 and 12. three and two yeah three out of the five three and what's it yeah and one thing I will add as I will walk through each project with some of the details next well I was going to ask you a question when I heard that earlier I'm sorry I forgot that but it doesn't seem like we have a very good dispersion of units throughout the county that's what we do well the first round we got very good Geographic dispersal this round well 13 million was not yeah yeah for justice around I'm not talking about earlier yeah it just seems like I'm not complaining I'm just saying it didn't seem fair when you have I know big needs of Beaverton I'm not sure yeah well South County has needs too it does but I don't want to be Piggies you're not it's it's a whole portfolio and remember they told us even though there was more be in the northern part north and west and then Central we're now with these covering more to the South so you think it will be balanced okay yeah I was looking at this one and I knew that we had earlier I didn't remember all the numbers at all we're being Piggies here yeah okay all right we like to be home we'll take it in each slide moving forward will walk through quickly the the project uh project applications with pertinent the first project that scored the scored highest was Woodland horse which was sponsored by Community Partners for affordable housing projects located in Tigard and 63 units some of the components that you'll see in in Black were items identified by the revaluation Review Committee as project strengths and items in red were project either weaknesses or considerations components with scoring criteria the Woodland Hearth application had the highest percentage of family size units deeply affordable had many financing resources secured had a experienced development team and quality narratives as well some of the components for consideration is it was the third largest number of units and not necessarily the largest project it is located in Tigard Tualatin did have a location preference to look at South County as as a provider for affordable housing and so I had a little bit lower location preference that location preference was informed by the the local implementation strategy for disbursement for housing across the the the next project which is unanimously rated second uh by Review Committee members so each Review Committee Member uh evaluated Woodland Hearth as the first scoring application and Dartmouth Crossing is the second scoring application this project had second large number of High percentages of permanent Supportive Housing including a developer with experience with permit Supportive Housing projects and a quality pro forma that performed well with financial underwriting some of the components that were disadvantages is it did have the third and highest percentage of family size units less three to four bedrooms and still had a need to secure a lot of the competitive funding sources and then as well was located in Tigard the third the third ranked project is Hawks Landing that had 90 units it was the largest project had",

        "text": " of that administrative burden I think has really taken a toll on some of those projects but again I'm just not I'm just not close to those projects because it's not something I work on I understand that everyone and I'm sorry to keep asking you questions about the thing that you're not really involved in but you're the only one here who might be able to answer one of the things I wondered about is the degree to which those applications involved in a cooperation a high level of cooperation in partnership with the actual utility serving here um my understanding is that those projects will have I don't know if you would call it cooperation but certainly coordination with the utility and that's been one of the hurdles is getting what they call an interconnection agreement and so not like permitting is a prolonged and administrative and burdensome process and more so for these Community solo projects where they had to do part about a new category of of these qualifying facilities and work out some of the in many cases the utilities happen very Cooperative but within that framework there's been a lot administrative burden diseases the observation you seem to be cutting out in your sound maybe I'll try shutting off my video sometimes yeah other comments or questions can you hear me yes okay good my question is is more procedural how can how can the Plan help with this these projects meeting these goals do you envision and remove role for us that's a good question and there there are some programs and I will bring up the community of renewable energy grant program that that Odin runs would probably work um known as the C rep in fact Salem has already been a successful applicant um with PGE for one of those projects but I think that with when you can get a municipal entity a Planning Commission um looking at renewable energy projects you can start unlocking some of those things that we identified in the study like potential sites that um that might be appropriate for development sites where maybe there was a an old um you know an old Industrial Development that maybe is no longer there and so it's served with a an electrical service that is ready to go for um something like a solar project the other thing is just you know understanding the grant programs that are out there and working with community members to get Grant applications flowing um and this relates to the first question which this the second part of that question was how Reliant are these projects on the grants that we find that at the small scale they are still reliant on grants and especially when you bring in that energy resilience component because batteries are still very and one thing that I noticed when I was reviewing the community solar projects when I looked at it probably oh maybe four months ago zero percent of those projects had any energy storage which means that when the grid goes down they are not able to provide power to the local community um and so we we haven't found the community solar is addressing the resilience component that well yet now they have time to to get that going and and the Technologies are coming along but that's really an important one with our grant program seeing if you can tie um a project to you know there's a project in Eugene where a rooftop filler facility on a school is tied to a municipal water well and a battery storage system and if the power goes out for two weeks the solar on the roof charges the batteries and the batteries run a well pump and you have the ability to bring potable water to the community members and those types of benefits are something that you all could think as you you know work through some not only the renewable energy of storage part but where is it most appropriate to cite one of these you know what are the most vulnerable communities within Salem where a project like that might bring the maximum benefit um so you know just keeping your eye open for opportunities I think is a a great thing to get out of out of planning commissions thank you rob other questions later uh thank you and thank you rob for joining us tonight to do a couple questions uh one of the resources that I see in Salem is rooftops and empty parking lots um we have a lot of rooftops uh I spent some time just looking at rooftop areas which is a very exciting thing to do late in the evening and found that just like in the McGill Crest area there are 28 Acres of roofs just in that one space now of course not every piece of roof is going to be useful for solar but when I looked at the chart on page what our Pages 18 it takes about six acres to generate a megawatt of solar energy so even if 50 of that space were used just in the buildcrest alone could generate two megawatts of electricity for the City of Salem and I know in that case actually one of the facilities going in there is a commercial battery storage facility which is kind of interesting so there's starts there seems to be a market now for um a commercial electrical storage so one of the questions I have in this is you know if I were to if I owned a building in the go Crest that had a two um roof and I wanted to put and I want to put a solar array on there that that Solar Ray would not get to the size of what we're talking about in this conversation is that correct it doesn't is it is community scale solar is it one and up and anything below that isn't part of this this conversation um no there's an upper band and that's 20 megawatts defined in the statute but on the small scale um you you could go down to the hundreds of kilowatt range and rooftops are a really Prime opportunity one you don't see them and so you're an area that has no local opposition from a from an aesthetic standpoint but it's also not disturbing any farmland or the place where I used to run my dog or any of those types of sites um a second advantage to Rooftop solar is that most of the time you're interconnecting those projects on the customer's side of the utility meter and those projects get net metered offset local loads you can do that up to two megawatts a net metered project unless it's part of sale of electric territory in which case the the net metering limit is only 25 kilowatts but in PGE territory you can net meter two and the interconnection is much simpler because you're essentially tying it into a an electric service panel at an industrial site or perhaps at a Transformer rather than on the Utility side where some additional gear might be required and the other thing that we saw as a little side benefit that might come out in the future to Rooftop development is when you're looking at the commercial Trucking industry if you want to see where the box trucks are and the the transport industry in a city you look for the big Warehouse and as we go into electrification of that's going to be an area where we're trying to serve um charging stations with you know new significant electrical loads and so solar on rooftops is going to be a perfect match for potential Transportation loads in the future Lisa would you like to know that I have a lot to say about um generally we allow it we don't have all any standards that are prohibited a few of our zones we require um to Shield any rooftop equipment so you can't see it from the ground you know from a certain distance in a few of our zones um I only really experience with a solar project the school district um as part of their bond they added a lot of solar panels and a field behind their schools and it was just a building permit because we don't you know we just check setbacks and height um and then whatever they need from The Building Division and we got so many complaints when they started building it the neighbors were very mad that they didn't get a comment that it didn't go out for notice but it was gonna you know ruin their living experience because the sun was going to bounce off the panels and there were so many of them um and that they used to walk their dog you know it's a field at the school it's part of the school that they used to walk their dogs there um they called the city council they emailed the city council complaining the neighbors who actually lived in the county so they started calling their County Commissioners and I mean just like so many phone calls to the planning division about this building permit we um and then I started telling the staff to tell them well the school district has their own elected officials so you can go home School District staff and they had set aside a certain percentage of the bond to for Renewables and they had made the decision to concentrate that in some larger projects instead of doing smaller projects at each school for various reasons and this was one of the schools that was then getting a big kind of field of solar panels which they still felt like was a good decision for the school district but um and it you know it got built in the last summer but I think there was also complaints to the school board about it so it you know it is interesting because it's you know generally people want it but then it's um the other thing I wanted to say uh because Rob mentioned the the Salem project and commissioner you just asked me and I was like I know I read about I had to Google it um so the City of Salem is doing a micro grid project and partnership with PGE over by in Southeast Salem as part of writing Public Works building and we got a million dollar Grant from the Department of energy renewable energy grant program to do that it is a resilience project because it says that although it's connected to the grade that can store energy during emergencies it said it'll be able to supply our Department's building six apartment buildings 34 homes four government buildings and one business this will be calculated so that's underway right now so do you see a time maybe that we can use a carrot as an incentive for some of these commercial developments to consider a rooftops because it just seems like an idea that people can get their heads around pretty easily yeah absolutely I think I mean we have a climate action plan and just um calling for this and and so far the city hasn't we don't have any money right but towards it which I think goes back to your question about grants and and um and commissioner Slater is being appointed to the climate action committee as a kind of commission representative will be the only non-city counselor on the",

        "text": " at the study area and then came up with the proposal on the next slide so next slide please here we are with our current Urban growth boundary expansion proposal or the areas in the purple so the project advisory committee said okay we we got our studies now we see what we need to do in terms of growth and then they started identifying the areas that made the most sense to grow so um one area though that did not really hit that that list is an area to grow was the proposed exclusion area but that area is comprised of the the air acres and sunset Orchard Estates subdivisions uh there's also an Airfield uh running uh kind of north south diagonally through that uh area there's very restrictive ccnrs for future Redevelopment of those lands all those lands are developed with existing single-family dwellings and so it was determined that that had very little Redevelopment potential and should not be considered for the urban growth boundary expansion and was therefore excluded from uh consideration uh next slide please in addition to identifying the area to grow the um the pack also identified where some of the uses should be located um unlike Urban growth boundary expansion in the metro area where they concurrently identify the boundary to to grow into as well as the future zoning and so forth North Plains being outside of Metro has the opportunity to identify the expansion area first and then come back once that's acknowledged to do the the concept planning for that area however as uh Todd had mentioned this process has been going on for a while so we also have been working with the various stakeholders irrigation districts Clean Water Services school districts fire departments and so forth to make sure that they could accommodate our future growth and we have received comments from all those folks indicating that they have capacity to accommodate the future growth in North plains so that was encouraging and and once we get our boundary um identified and acknowledged and we'll come back to that constant planning process to identify where uh future streets will go in terms of the major Street corridors uh where the land use activities will occur within these areas and right now as you can see the the blue areas are identified as our economic lands so that could be uh commercial light industrial or Industrial in the blue areas the gold or yellow areas are what we're identifying as our residential land need so we're hoping to get some res a high density residential some single-family residential as well as parks and Open Spaces into the gold areas as well uh next slide please so uh throughout this whole process um the city like I said worked with the various uh infrastructure and utility companies in the region to make sure that we have the ability to grow and that they could accommodate our needs we have received their uh feedback and so that's encouraging to know that we can um grow and they can accommodate our needs for the future um one thing that you've heard a lot of or we'll be hearing a lot of is the loss of farmland and high quality soil um as you notice this whole region is comprised of farmland and high quality soils so we're kind of in a situation where we don't have many options and that's really why the land around North plains that 1500 Acres was undesignated so we would have an opportunity to grow and again you know this was part of the um the grand bargain so again various stakeholders were there uh understanding that these would be the lands that North Plains would have to look uh outward to for future growth um and believe me if we had less a lower value soils or marginal lands that we could go to we certainly would have looked at those as well as far as the consideration of Senate Bill 4 for the urban growth boundary expansion is it's really not a factor for our Urban growth boundary expansion it came in towards the end of the process it's a completely separate process that uh the governor uh has authority to to utilize uh should uh he or she choose so in the future they can come into a jurisdiction and identify lands that they would like to be brought in it's a completely separate process but as Todd mentioned when we were doing our economic opportunities analysis we did look at Target Industries and we utilized the target industries that are currently surrounding us right now so a semiconductor type facility we don't believe that would happen but we had to consider it we also believe what's more likely though is something like the business park that you see on the north side of highway 26 uh east of helvetia something similar to that with supportive type businesses for the existing semiconductors could be a Target industry that could come to the city of North Plains and then lastly we did receive some feedback from the Irrigation District to Walton Valley Irrigation District regarding some of the easements that they have on the west side of our Urban growth boundary proposal and I've worked extensively with irrigation districts over my time in Central Oregon at the city of Bend and the easements that the Irrigation District has can be uh piped they could be relocated in new easements just provided that we can continue the extension of services that they currently have so this will be something that gets hashed out through the private development world and the Irrigation District as development proposals come forward but we have addressed that with our legal counsel and and they concur that these easements can be worked with and they can be adjusted as necessary to accommodate the the future development uh next slide please um this is my last slide and this uh really kind of wraps it up in terms of we did all the necessary work to show that the city's proposed expansion complies with this applicable State uh planning goals administrative rules and city code requirements um we also have our acknowledged economic opportunities in ours our housing needs analysis and our staff report findings to demonstrate compliance with those rules and um as a result of all that work the city of North plain staff recommended approval of the proposed ugb expansion uh to the Planning Commission who held a meeting on August 19th and decided to recommend approval of the ugb expansion to the city council the city council held their meeting um earlier in September and had the second reading on the ordinance um September 18th and that second reading passed unanimously for the adoption of the ugb expansion and with that I will turn it back over to time thank you Steve next slide please so um County Action is needed to expand the North Plains ugb the city North Plains in Washington County must each adopt an identical egb alignment through ordinance uh if the board rejects the County's trapped ordinance on ugb expansion the expansion cannot move so the County's ordinance was filed just last week county has not yet received much Community input on the expansion but based on attention that this action has received in North plains the county anticipates that to change all written testimony to the Planning Commission received on this ordinance will be shared with the Planning Commission prior to the first public at the County ordinance on North Plains UTV expansion proposes minor amendments to the rural natural resources plan and comprehensive framework plan to the urban area to reflect the proposed UTP and it does not propose any land use designation changes at this time next slide please so the County's ordinance is ordinance number 899 please note that the upcoming hearing dates listed here um and that uh consideration by dlcd will uh will follow any County adoption local and state action on the proposed ggb expansion uh can also be appealed once the state acknowledges that the ugb expansion and an appeals are resolved the county will Begin work on two future ordinances one will update the Washington County North Plains urban planning area agreement to reflect the expansion uh and the second would be to transfer the ugp expansion area from the rural area from the rural area to the urban area including the application of the fd-10 land use designation in accordance with Comprehensive plan policies next slide please uh and that concludes our presentation we have these two policy questions for the Planning Commission uh whether you have any questions or North Plains regarding their process or for County staff and advanced the public hearings and I want to thank you and also want to note that uh uh we also have Andy Varner with North Plains he's a city manager at our Clans and Bill Reed who's the finance director at the city of North Plains also available to answer thank you thank you thank you thank you all for your presentation I see uh commissioner Havener that's his hand up uh thank you uh I have a couple of questions and whether this is city or county staff you can decide that a couple of things that I noticed on slide number nine the areas that you were looking at also included way down in the bottom left corner Gaston and the banks piece and I wondered uh if that was also being supported by those City councils or those planning departments uh for their ugb expansion as well this map um is actually a metro map that shows all of the um all of the reserves in the whole region North Plains is only addressing the area around North Plains so the only changes they're looking at are within the kind of dashed area so nothing nothing is proposed for any other areas okay thank you and then is there any concern from County staff uh that this creates another Island if you will of ugb area that isn't contiguous with current ugb areas uh so the North Plains expansion is continuous with the current North Plains ugb it's separate from the metro ugb and um not intended to be contiguous with the Metro UTV so does that cause any management problems with land use and organization it's it it's really it this is done per state rules um I don't know if it really causes any problems with land use it's just kind of the the system that we have where maybe my question would be better is there any concerns with infrastructure Supportive um we we have consulted a little bit with um the Metro uh area uh the regional government there to discuss you know Transportation things of that um but and as far as our Urban growth boundary expansion goes and the the infrastructure to service that that um it'll essentially be um North Plains working with the development Community to assure that those facilities are brought in with uh each development proposal um and in terms of identifying what that need will be in terms of streets uh sewer water the capacity for those that'll be addressed during the concept planning phase of this process um so we will be updating our sewer and water and transportation Master plans as a result of that to show where um those those facilities",

same sort of metrics lower costs up for just getting through 24 hours um larger costs the longer you want to stay off grid or your assumption for how long to stay off grid the you know the primary driver of the additional cost is the kilowatt hours or megawatt hours of storage necessary to make it through that outage um super practical information thought might be useful to to move the to understand um what resiliency might mean i'll do i'll go through the redwood coast because that is a multi-customer and then i'll cut the other stuff out um so next slide redwood coast it was talked about that is a multi-customer uh microgrid at the end of a circuit which is really nice it serves 18 or so customers one of them is a small airport and a coast guard helicopter station it's got a number of different aspects to it a bunch of private generation or small scale generation a relatively significant battery next slide please so the cost of that project uh estimated cost was 11 million dollars a little over 11 million dollars to to be able to isolate that section you know they're they're definitely creating some uh megawatt hours of power you know on the benefit side it does create about 356 thousand dollars worth of sort of energy benefits to the to the owners of those facilities of those generating there were 37 fte with about 1.5 million dollars in earnings in during constructing this project so there is definitely that local job but it does take a bit at 356 000 a year to cover that 11 million dollar cost so these projects are hard to pencil from a straight economic perspective but they do uh work and they probably need support to get off the ground uh last slides and i won't even get dig into the stuff um basically we're trying to get better at understanding what small-scale stuff costs in the integrated resource plan and the clean energy plan that we are going to be working on in oregon we don't have there's not a lot of good um i was hoping to get small scale information for this presentation but it's being developed as we speak mostly focused on small scale solar energy opportunities next slide so our resource planners basically said you know if you're trying to understand the cost differential lizard is pretty good it shows utility scale stuff below the line and customer scale stuff above the line and just some of the different cost differential between those types of projects so in the hopes of speeding things up i'll call it quits there and answer any thanks eric appreciate you and we'll all wait i'll also have you for the rest of our time together so if there's questions that come up later or points you want to make we can integrate them there um grant had a question are there additional requirements other than income for the businesses you listed such as grocery convenience stores to participate in the uh well the grocery stores have to be small so it can't be walmart's and so they're sort of i don't know family owned i think it's the actual definition is less than 15 million dollars worth of or worth of sales or something like that so there are some restrictions but you know small sort of local grocery stores small sort of corner markets and the like are definitely included and realistically that that expansion comes from the fact that in in sort of frontier communities and uh and rural communities oftentimes those are the community centers by default so expanding that definition to sort of support those local assets insightful from the california public utility commission and we so we adopted that all right thanks so much eric and then we'll go ahead and move on to keisha and then we'll do our 10 minute break after her presentation and then get back for the breakout rooms yes so we have keisha coming up next if i can turn a slide um all right they're off to you stephanie just uh hold off on this slide for just a second i'll do a little intro here before i yes puzzle everyone with that data rich size slide um hi i'm keisha brockman with the oregon public utility commission thanks to odo for this workshop series this has really been so great to hear everyone's um so the just i'm going to be talking kind of about how these generators are that's the primary focus so first i'll just mention that the public utility commission provides economic regulation of the investor owned utilities and that's because they operate largely in a monopoly environment we work to ensure that the utilities provide safe reliable high quality service at just and reasonable rates um and as eric just showed on his last slide um um difference between the utility scale and small scale projects i mean the utility acquires a generation to meet customers needs through a competitive bidding process which can include both third-party and utility-owned projects and that results in the kind of prices i think that eric showed in that the small renewable energy generators have a difficult time competing in that process and we know through all of these presentations that have been made throughout this workshop series that those projects do bring additional benefits and so there may be public policy reasons to support those projects and in those cases the puc has the opportunity to set the price for those those projects and generally when the puc does that it's focused on complying with the public policy customer indifference between resources to the extent possible the long-term goal would be that the the compensation for the generation reflects the value that that generation brings to the utility system which is what the ratepayers are paying for okay so um now stephanie go ahead and flip the slide please and you can see that what i've done here is just listed a number of different mechanisms for compensating small scale projects so the first is one that we've talked about quite a bit in a previous workshop and that is through avoided cost the driver for this was the federal public utility regulatory policy act of this resulted in standard contracts which ormond mentioned as being a benefit to small developers so that they don't have to negotiate unique contract terms with um a utility and the rates that these generators are compensated for are based on the resource that the utility would otherwise have had to build to and so we call it the avoided cost what cost of the is the utility avoiding by acquiring energy from this small-scale generator versus what otherwise would have been required and it does not take into consideration additional benefits that the project might bring to the system the second i'll talk a little bit about the resource value of solar which is not currently being as a means of compensation but it was an investigation that resulted also through um public oh let's see i'm sorry i should have i should have um did i need to clarify the approach well i'll skip it for time's sake on on the avoided cost i'm sorry i skipped through that on the if you have questions we can come back to that resource value of solar effort was undertaken to look more broadly than ferpa at as i said trying to look at how to compensate resources not just based on what investments are avoided but rather what values that resource brings to the system and so it in looking at this the the commission wanted to consider elements that would directly impact the cost of service to the utility customers as i described but could also consider of course the financial cost to comply with carbon regulation on the other hand it would not consider the benefits of job impacts for example so really focusing on the value to the utility system um let's see so the um the process included added sort of 11 or included 11 different elements so energy capacity as well as others that would be considered uh utility system costs and i'm sorry uh oh yeah no specific um i thought that was an incomplete sentence i'm sorry um so the arvos was explored but has not implemented into into a actual compensation mechanism so there is also net metering which originated a ways back and that is a simple crediting approach designed for behind the meter usage where the generation directly offsets the customer's consumption and that means that the customer is being generated i'm sorry being that the customer generator in this case is being credited for that generation at the retail rate and that can roll over month to month for up to a year and that retail rate is higher than the value that that generation brings to the system because that retail rate considers uh lots of additional operating costs for the utility and so net metering is an incentive program i'm going to skip over green tariff and come to that last i should have listed that last community solar program is another incentive program this was driven specifically by legislation senate bill and the rates for that were the goal was to utilize this resource value of solar approach that was insufficient to stand up the program that the cost of building and operating the projects the value to the system and so in order to stand up that program the rate was set um very comparably to how it is with net metering it's roughly equal to the retail residential retail rates and now there are different rates for residential commercial and low-income customers that are participating in that let's see brings me to the green tariff which is a potential way place a value other benefits of the energy that's being generated and it could be local economic development it could be sustainability targets that have to do locally sited generation or locally manufactured components in any of these benefits could be valued by the customer in the price that they pay for that for that generation the customer would be able to contract directly with the generator receive that power so that so the green tariff options that are facilitated by the utilities right now we have the voluntary renewable energy tariffs for large customers under house bill 2021 there's also the pros the possibility as was mentioned by an earlier presenter of expanding this to municipalities and community green power options so that would allow the potentially would allow a small-scale renewable energy project to set the price that is necessary to make it whole and if the community is willing to pay that price that would be a way to bring that additional compensation to that project so in terms of rate impact of small-scale renewable energy generation acquisition of new energy can can cause an increase in rates but when we look at the rate impact we're kind of depends on how that compensation is being paid by the utility",

        "text": " and foremost I'd like to thank our Frontline city employees who do the outstanding work of of making Oregon's capital a wonderful place to live and do business they are the backbone of our municipal government and are essential in everything we do these employees interact daily with our community and are critical to the services we provide to our residents they answer the phones clean the parks and literally keep the water flowing since joining the city council in 2017 I've had the privilege of meeting some of the most dedicated and skilled public employees that I can think of please join me in a round of applause to thank them for their work I'd also like to what happened to the microphone oh there it goes sorry about I'd also like to thank our department directors and all of you for being here as well in addition I'd like to individually thank our city councilors for their work they do representing their constituents and the work that we do together council president Regine councilor Linda nishioka counselor Trevor Phillips counselor Deanna Gwen counselor Jose Gonzalez counselor Julie hoy councilor Vanessa Nordike councilor Mickey Varney and I'd also like to thank Keith Staley our city manager you may not be aware of this but City councilors and Salem are volunteers so in addition to working full-time and caring for their families these counselors give up nights and weekends and sometimes even holidays to address the pressing concerns of our community I thank them for their work their earnestness their passion and for their every effort to make this city a wonderful place to live our city council is also for the first time in Salem's history led by a female as women across the across the country continue to fight for equal rights I think this Milestone is worth celebrating gender discrimination pay Equity sexual harassment and Reproductive Rights are just a few of the examples of challenges that women face in today's world I am committed to being Allied an ally to these women and to do all I can to remove the senseless barriers to equality so we celebrated the end of winter and the beginning of Spring here in the Cherry City we will soon see the cherry blossoms return and our Valley will begin to bloom in nature spring brings a sense of renewal and of opportunity with our city too comes the same sense of a new season A New Beginning we have a new city manager we have several new city councilors and I'm fortunate enough to serve as the 60th mayor of Salem it's a time of fresh ideas and for an Earnest look at what we have achieved and where we have more to do I'm proud to report that Salem is a strong diverse and evolving community we continue to grow as new residents and new businesses make their way to our beautiful Valley we are making strides in all areas of our strategic priorities responding to Sheltering crisis planning for our future engaging our community and sustaining infrastructure and services last fall Salem residents approved a 300 million dollar investment in our community that will allow us to improve and build new streets sidewalks bike facilities and Parks purchase fire engines and Equipment establish an affordable housing fund construct two new fire stations purchase sites for affordable housing establish two Branch libraries construct earthquake safety upgrades to the Civic Center and enhance information technology to provide cyber security for City infrastructure I'd like to thank our residents for their support of this Bond this year our Council will continue to prioritize our response to the homeless homelessness crisis and increase the supply of affordable housing in the city like much of the United States and in every corner of Oregon Salem has seen a rise of individuals experiencing homelessness and of affordable housing needs mental illness and addiction economic imbalance and even climate change have accelerated its Collective failure Decades of under-prioritizing Behavioral Health Services and access to housing have compounded year after year and now the need is so great that we see it every day on almost every corner I am committed to advancing our capacity to address it and I know that you are as well city council will work to evolve our strategies and collaboration with State and County Partners as well as private entities until we achieve the outcome we are looking for a home for every neighbor Maya Angelou said the ache for home lives in all of us the safe place where we can go as we are and not be questioned and so we will continue this fight because it's the humanitarian thing to do and because housing is vital to the success of every individual and therefore is vital to the success of our you can't find a job or go to school care for a loved one or recover from illness if you don't have a home it's a place that we all deserve at the end of the day we all want a place to go home for too many Salem residents their home may be a tent on the side of a road a mattress and a warming shelter or the cold fear of staring into the darkness with nowhere to go people who live on our streets live in fear of being victimized of not knowing where they will sleep fear of their belongings being stolen and of declining Health we must be better stewards of each other it is in this spirit that I'm proud to report that last year our city council approved the sighting of multiple locations for micro shelter communities managed by church at the park these shelters provided provide managed temporary housing opportunities for homeless individuals combined with case management and Outreach Services designed to match participants with resources on an individualized bases but more importantly our micro shelters give people a place to feel secure because the doors lock people living in our micro shelter communities don't have to worry about their belongings being stolen when they look for work they don't have to worry about being kicked out of their resting place they don't have to worry about being victimized because the doors lock and for what is often the first time in years they can rest imagine what your life would be like if you hadn't had actual rest in years that's what people living on the streets experience these shelters have proven to be one of the most effective tools we have in transitioning people from the streets into more permanent housing during 2022 64 percent of micro micro shelter Village guests move to positive in addition to these highly successful micro shelters the city has invested funds in the safe sleep United women's shelter expansion United Way of the mid Willamette Valley is expanding their capacity to shelter women from 19 to 45 beds the city also invested in funds in Mosaic a project TurnKey facility for people fleeing domestic violence stalking or trafficking through a grant to the Center for Hope and safety and we've invested funds in the Salem warming Network to provide life safety measures to help people come out of the I'm also pleased that on May 1st our navigation Center will open its doors working in partnership with the Midway Valley Community Action Agency the navigation Center will provide 75 low barrier shelter beds it will be open 24 hours a day seven days a week and will offer intensive case management to connect people to needed housing health care and I'm sorry needed Services health care and stable housing navigation centers across the country have shown strong strong success in helping people exit homelessness traditional shelter models require sobriety upon entry segregate by gender and are often limited I have often limited space for personal possessions or pets our navigation Center will will move past all of those barriers we continue to offer the safe Park program for those who shelter in their vehicles a program I proudly introduced in 2019. while no one should have to live in their car this approach to Sheltering can help families and individuals get connected to services in a secure environment with access to toilets storage garbage removal laundry showers and security assistance last year the Salem City Council funded the Outreach Services team to respond to areas of concern help connect people to resources and remove accumulated garbage at parks and other public spaces to reduce the impacts of homelessness on businesses and Neighbors on average each month this team removes 44 000 pounds of waste from our public spaces every month the SOS team collaborates with the police officers called the homeless Services team since beginning to track data in 2022 the officers on this team have contacted 1675 individuals at 974 encampments and have made 377 referrals for service relationship building through regular communication increases the chances individuals will connect with available services and the two assigned homeless Services team officers do exactly that excuse me this team's daily work includes responding to online complaints of camping on private and city-owned property regular visits to area prone to complaints such as Cascades Gateway Park and ensuring areas around Microsoft managed micro shelter communities remain clean and safe HST coordinates their efforts and works closely with the SOS team to avoid duplication and increase their effectiveness in covering all areas of the city enforcement is not the priority for this team instead they are focused on building relationships with both the unsheltered community and the various local service providers developing relationships can build trust in the police to encourage the reporting of crimes which in turn can reduce victimizations within the encampments arrest is always a last resort and in limited situations rather the goal is connection to services and deflection from the criminal justice system in fact an officer recently contacted an individual living on the streets who is I'm sorry who wasn't an admitted methamphetamine addict that's a tongue he told the officer he was ready for help the officer knew it was critical to get the person in to help right then right when they they acknowledged that they were ready through his contacts with local service service providers they were collectively able to get him into substance abuse treatment right previous approaches would have resulted in the individual's arrest but now he's getting the intervention he needs that will hopefully help him break the cycle of addiction that's exactly why we created that team our city council has allocated 23.33 million dollars to expand Sheltering options and manage health safety and livability concerns in our community Through investment of State funds and American Rescue plan dollars unfortunately these are one-time funds that will be exhausted next year and our micro shelter communities and navigation centers could be forced to close unless we develop additional revenue or other financial support for these emergency Sheltering services we've been lobbying our state and federal elected officials for financial support so we can keep these beds available for as long as possible I ask for your support in these efforts now yeah thank you yes clapping thank now let me give you a preview of what's coming to Salem in 2023 and Beyond as you know the city is not a housing",

meeting open since he doesn't particularly need to hear all that and we can get going and um if we by the time we get to a consent calendar if he's not there then we can pause again if everybody's okay with that all right good morning the time is now 8 33 and i would like to call the january 28 2022 meeting of the energy facility citing council to order mr secretary please call the roll mercy grail ken howe hanley jenkins jordan schrute cindy condon perry chuck tube bill stenbeck not quite but i'll make note that phil is uh working on getting online hang on just a second uh phil can you can you hear us okay great all right thank you mr secretary uh promote him to a panelist i've not run into this before so he won't be able to share his video but he can see the meeting i assume and all right mr secretary are there any agenda modifications madam chair there are no modifications at this time thank you i have the following announcements please mute your phones if you are joining us by phone and receive a phone call please hang up from this call and dial back in after finishing your other for those signed onto the webinar please do not broadcast your webcam for agenda item d public comment period there are two ways to let us know you are interested in providing comments to the council for those using the webex you will need to use the raise your hand feature for those on the phone only you will need to press star 3 which will alert us that you want to speak we will go over these options again during that agenda item if you want to receive future email notifications of council meetings project milestones or rule makings through our click dimensions program you can do so by clicking on the link in the agenda for the council webpage look for the green box on the right

disrupt the council meetings are not acceptable pursuant to oregon administrative rule any person who engages in unacceptable conduct which disrupts the council meeting may be expelled we'll now move on to agenda item a which is the consent calendar and we'll start with approval of the december minutes uh madam chair if i may wally can you bring up the draft meeting minutes so once again kudos to sicily for doing such a good job on the meeting minutes um so they're substantively they were great um and then we reviewed them internally sent them out to council and then found a few i think um minor scrivener kind of errors or changes that needed to be reflected in here so we do have an updated version in track changes i will say none of it is substantive we are prepared if you'd like to go through and kind of scroll through and see where those changes are you don't have to do that but the version essentially would be approving you know with the changes as reflected here today on the screen so i'm going to defer to the uh council i was not that december meeting so i will defer to those who were present yeah this is hanley um madam chair and i went through the minutes um and made some suggested edits to sicily and as todd said those are reflected in the in the copy that's been presented to the council i think there was a copy sent out on wednesday i'm prepared to make a motion to approve the minutes uh for the december 16 2021 meeting um as presented here on the screen this is ken this is kent and i'll second that thank you kent are any objections or comments on the hearing none mr secretary please call the role still stand back might still be on mute can you hear us phil hanley jenkins cindy conan mercy grail alex stain please and then once again phil stenbeck yes if you can hear me yes we can hear you thank you okay motion carries thank you next on the agenda is the council secretary report thank you sure just give me one second two project updates uh the first is the obsidian solar center so uh just as a reminder about the project it is a proposed solar pv project with a nominal generating capacity of 400 megawatts located within a site boundary of approximately 3 900 acres or 4.2 square miles as part of the request it includes battery storage as well and the project would be located approximately eight miles northwest of christmas valley in lake county the project is currently at the end of the contested case phase um and so just a as a reminder on that um there were in addition to the applicants and the department who are by default parties in the contested case there were seven other parties uh who were given limited party status there were nine issues associated with the contested case and i would say very these nine issues related to the protective agriculture the protection of property values the protection of living condition impacts the public services water usage um but as i said that's sort of a general overview of those on december 29th the hearing officer issued his proposed contested case order this document is his conclusion on all nine issues based on the facts that were on the record prior to and during the contested case with the addition of some proposed condition the conditions the hearing officer agreed with staff's findings of facts conclusions of law and conditions of approval as written in the proposed order which is a recommendation to counsel that the applicant meets all of the council standards january 26 so two days ago was the deadline for any of the parties to file exceptions to the hearing officer's proposed contested case order meaning that they don't agree no exceptions were filed by any of the parties so the very next step in the process is for counsel to the hearing officer's proposed contested case order and you will have the opportunity to adopt modify or reject that order and we anticipate that being on the february council meeting right thank you unless there's any questions on the obsidian project i'll move on to the next one uh the next one is wagon trail solar so we are anticipating receiving the preliminary application for site certificate today or very shortly after today if not today this project is a proposed solar pv generation facility with a generating capacity of 500 megawatts the facility would be located on approximately 7 300 acres or 11.4 square miles additional kind of notable related and supporting facilities would be battery as well as an eight mile 230 kb transmission line the project is proposed in morrow county south of the boardman bombing range and as i said we should be getting that soon if not today and so we'll be reviewing that for completeness in the very near future next on my list is the wildfire yesterday afternoon we conducted a public workshop on the wildfire prevention response rulemaking the meeting started at three and more quickly than we thought chris hung around just to make sure that nobody else was interested in participating but chris did a good job providing an overview of kind of the scope of it and sought input by those participating there were 23 people council member condon was on the line um that 23 includes citing division staff oregon public utility commission staff um there are representatives of at least pacific corps and idaho power we're not sure if pge was on the line or not also there are representatives of independent power producers and and members of the public as well so we received some good input but i think we probably will get a lot more input once we have some kind of draft rules for people to evaluate at least that was our assessment so next week we have a specific meeting with the coquille tribe about this rule and then we'll be coming back to council in the near future with some um proposed ideas or proposed language so i think this one will take some time but you know we don't have any draft uh rule language yet council member condon if you had any thoughts based on the meeting please share them otherwise um i just have one more item um my only comment is uh chris um leads a great meeting i mean he",

going to pass it over to council and let her take it from here I do want to say for the record that as we work through this process we've established some timelines a council has and so she will be going over those details with you and again we appreciate everyone for being here in advance for the technical challenge that we will encounter thank you okay a couple of preliminary things of knowing before we move into this next um some of this is repetitive but I'll just go ahead um first of all the record is closed at this time um I just want to kind of emphasize that so you recognize you're not taking in new information that was the purposes purpose of the underlying contested case process and and the application and this process here that we're engaging in where the council has an opportunity to hear from the county directly regarding the nine exceptions that it has taken to the proposed contested case order is something that's a matter of practice not statute it's something so that the council uh has the opportunity to hear directly and ask questions we have worked with chair Grail a little bit to try to figure out how to make this um most productive for the council and provide a really good opportunity for the county to be heard the county has filed nine separate exceptions um and the rather than addressing them in the same sequence that they were presented in the materials that you've reviewed we have reached an arrangement that has us addressing them in three groupings um you know make a little bit of sense as far as well hopefully more than a little bit of sense hopefully they will make sense to you as far as moving through and analytically considering in those groups where they are interrelated they're all a bit interrelated so we may go back and forth a little bit but I think that the grouping structure will will be helpful um what what the council determined as far as you know would a way of going through this hearing process is that it will be important for uh each of the three parties to be heard so we'll begin um and for each grouping we'll have sort of an opportunity first for the county to present its exceptions then for the trainer or which order we have it in the the applicants and then the department of energy to provide any responses that they have um the first grouping is just one exception the second two groupings involve a collection of exceptions um in the interest of making sure that the county has a full opportunity to say everything that it wishes to say we increase the amount of time available according to the number of exceptions being considered using about three minutes per exception per party as the the kind of guideline within that the county and the other parties can use their allotted time for each grouping to either March one by one true each exception or to handle it in a more Global way that's what's been offered as far as a format for this exceptions um I I did want to invite anyone who has any adjustments to that to chime in or any questions about it this is Ms miles Tim McMahon for the record show Drew council members um given that through the cycle of nine briefs in this matter and some fairly extensive legal arguments surrounding all this and given the fact that the applicant in the Department of Justice really are fundamentally on the same page in terms of the legal issues I'm going to recommend I've checked with Council on this that I'm going to present at the very end of the process for about five minutes to economize considerably in time I think and to avoid the redundancy this inherent and both Mr Rowe and I I'm going back and forth on much of the same material so with your uh with your confirmation that's the way at least the applicant intends to handle this thank you um I think we can move forward to representing Umatilla County thank you very much for allowing me to be here really appreciate it and I'm going to I'm over here and I can hardly hear you so I'm going to be we're worried about the folks in the back if you could you speak a little louder this room the WebEx okay all right thank you got it thank you Wendy Kellington I'm representing Umatilla County here thank you very much for allowing us to present today just sort of piggybacking on what Mr McMahon said I'm wondering if the county might at the end have just a few minutes to do a responsive wrap-up if that's something so just kind of because there's a lot of this that feels a little disjointed and that feels like so um if with enthal just that we'd certainly appreciate that well we have no problem with that thank you thank you and I think it would be if the department wishes to do the same thing at that time it would be free too you can make that determination at a later time or may not yeah okay so with that I think we can turn to the what we've characterized as the first grouping to go to the next slide perfect that is the one so this uh exception presented by the county is in the materials provided by the County under uh subsection B4 I think I'll I'll read it so that we all can and you know make sure we track exactly the way the county presented this the exception is as follows relatedly the alj in their order on petitions for party status and issues for contested case order which is in parentheses here referred to as the issues order has already decided that whether Criterion 3 is an applicable substantive Criterion is not within the council's there is a specific seven day period of time for filing objections to the issues order and none were filed citing Oar 345 15 16 sub 6. that means as a matter of law the proposed contested case order misconstrues applicable law by deciding that Criterion 3 is not an applicable substantive criteria we've moved this into the initial grouping because it is sort of a quasi-procedural issue um and and sort of a threshold issue that the county is Raising about whether the issue was sort of already decided by the issues order and so with that um we oh I'm going to keep track of time so we don't have a clock up on the screen so in this one there's three minutes obviously it changes her when the Party begins speaking I will begin the clock at one minute I'll raise my finger to let you know that you have one minute left and then at the conclusion um I will let you know that you're done when Johnson representing him as well again thank you very much for allowing us to be here to talk to you to frame this issue I want to be sure that you understand that this issue is extremely important to Umatilla County so important that today we have all members of the governing body here who represent the entirety of all of the citizens of Umatilla County as well as the County Council the planning director and assistant planner and the all that Umatilla County is asking you is to please Faithfully apply the law because we believe that if you do that that you will not adopt the pcco and we'll find for the county it has already been decided that the issue of whether criteria answering is an applicable substantive criteria is not a determination that is within the jurisdiction of nepsec to decide and I have a PowerPoint that hopefully is is in front of you that you can look at follow along the alj has already decided and I quote an evaluation of whether the land use ordinances passed by the county are required by Statewide planning goals is not within the council's jurisdiction it couldn't be clear that ruling is final under an administrative rule that says that the alj's determination is final unless someone appeals within seven days nobody appealed within seven days and that means as a matter of law that determination that an evaluation of whether the land use ordinances passed by the county are required by the Statewide planning goals is simply not within the council's jurisdiction final means final the second alj who wrote the PLC or pcco improperly ignored that ruling and collaterally attacked the first alj's ruling she didn't even address this issue in her order she proceeded to do exactly what the first alj decided was beyond the scope of the proceeding to evaluate whether the identification of the applicable substantive criteria was within the planning goals Odo faults the county for not raising this issue in its request for contested case but it didn't have a crystal ball to be able to know what the first hearings officer would decide with regard to the scope of the proceedings thank you Patrick Roe Department of Justice for the Department of energy the council should reject this exception for two reasons first the issues order establishes what issues are to be addressed in the contested case it doesn't rule on the issues second the county misinterprets the rule that addresses appeals of an issue order it reads that rule far too broadly so I'm going to repeat that two reasons why you should reject this exception the issues order establishes what issues will be addressed in the case it doesn't rule on them the county far too broadly reads the rule that a governs appeals of issues the final document that the LJ issued in the contested case was the rulings on motions for summary determination and proposed contested case order in that order in the pcco the alj ruled that the county setback is not required by Statewide planning goals since it's not required by Statewide goals the setback is not one of the applicable substantive criteria that Council must require an applicant to comply with in this exception the county argues that the alj was precluded from making that ruling because of an offhand remark that the first alj had made in the issues the county is referring to the November 2nd order on petitions for party status and issues for a contested case the purpose of those orders are procedural not substantive those orders established whether people seeking to participate in the case meet the requirements for participation did they sufficiently raise their issue uh uh on the record of the DPO those orders established whether partition petitioners participate in the contested case as a limited or a full party and they established the phrasing or the framing of the issues for the contested case they don't serve as rulings on the issues the main issue in this case is whether or not this",

        "text": " terms of improving competition and reducing costs potentially think the countervailing challenge to bring forward for the legislature is that an rto is of course not a panacea it doesn't solve and in some ways it relocates some of the challenging conversations we have in the region into a new forum but it doesn't necessarily resolve those those arguments and you know where we have really struggled in the past uh around cost allocation or giving up local control i think remains a challenge and and that's where governance and and really sound transparent um proof governance becomes really critical to any solution that comes to the table and really ensuring that it will provide value for oregonians over the long term and that's a that's an issue that just has to come forward i think front and as we engage but i really look forward to learning a great deal from from other folks like nicole enjoying the comments and learning a lot so always more to unpack on this topic all right thank you thank you lisa and just one comment i want to mention i mean i have this on a later slide when we get into the into the written feedback you know i i don't really see this process as us trying to reconcile different perspectives or you know hammer out negotiated settlements and make recommendations or anything like that um we really are trying to faithfully understand and be able to reproduce for the legislature um what those perspectives are out there on some of these key issues um sort of end of statement right so we're not looking at this process as trying to reconcile and you know blaze new ground on new solutions so um just want to make that comment um you were yeah thanks adam um yeah i'll just echo a lot of the comments that i've occurred already as far as the primary issue in cubs position to be to you know optimize um you know the system and be able to accrue kind of benefits to customers to the greatest extent that we can and i think um you know the the program design uh and and the details that we eventually get into are what's gonna um you know determine the level of benefits that accrue to customers and so i think maybe starting you know starting with broad value propositions has been you know suggested and getting maybe kind of narrowed into you know more you know identifiable kind of pieces of the program design that can lead to those benefits is a good one is a good good approach to take and then in terms of what's missing i think these two are kind of linked in my opinion but um to be able to inform a program design that kind of suits our region the best i think we need to take a look at you know what kind of um processes that are out there already or are being implemented or will kind of come into the future can help inform this process and i'm thinking in terms of the northwest power pools rap process and potential expansion future expansion into um you know the edam market i know that there's there's folks out there that kind of see you know a resource adequacy program an extended day ahead market is kind of stepping stones towards potentially getting into a more regionalized approach that you know geographic and resource diversity and so maybe taking a step back and looking at what those programs can offer and if there's any you know information that we can glean from either their implementation or their program design that can set our region up best to you know form an rto that really gets the most bang for his thank you mike anyone else there i um happy to move us along a little sooner um i was also gonna throw out i saw ben just your camera came on i don't wanna put you on the spot but uh i thought yeah that's going to jump in there adam thanks um i was just going to say we've done a lot of work recently looking forward at the sort of policies coming down the road at a lot of the western states and one of the things that i think is really important to consider in this is if there's a lot of transformative sort of policies out there that are really going to change the way the system works and change the way the markets work you know what's the best way to be positioned for the state of oregon to make sure that we are hoping to mitigate any risks that might and so in particular of course california has a bunch of policies about the way that they're transforming their energy sector and it's going to have a lot of impacts on oregon and the rest of the northwest but i just i think one of the things you always have to keep in mind in any report looking at something like this is you know is this a incremental change to the current state or you know would the current state be better going forward what are the things that are going to come up as you're looking into the future um given the way that we operate today and and is that going to cause some problems we might not see today in the current operations of the system that might be dealt with if you went to something like an rto um in a very different way and and so i guess that sort of pro prospective look into the future is just one of the things i want to make sure you emphasize and highlight thank you ben anyone else adam there was one thing i was i was going to add based on the first question that you posed sure and that's you know this is this is going to the legislature and i think that may be a direct way for for me to state this would be that when it comes to real when it comes to regional policy local legislators will matter decisions you know across the region are going to have to work with local people whether that's at a state level whether it's a puc whether it's a this the system is physically and so oregon in this case is going to have to find a way to participate it's probably not a matter of of if but when and so um i think really one of the messages for me is pretty clear that oregon is going to have to participate at some point and so um how and when and we can inform the legislature as to the issues whether that be governance or resource adequacy or whatever um i think that's going to be important that's that's the realization for the legislature is that they are going to have to make policy decisions that can an rto thank you frank this is kathy and i think adding on to frank i i agree with that i think it's also i think our not just oregon legislatures but just thinking like in idaho as well as other states um there has to be some kind of consistency um among that as well especially for those those entities that work in multiple jurisdictions um we can't have rules in oregon that fight rules in idaho and pac can't have rules in one state that fight the other five um so some kind of collaboration as we move towards a regionalization um with the legislatures i think would be would be really beneficial and helpful to make this move forward and to make it for that because you know the footprint matters when you're talking an rto one single state enlisted maybe the size of california is not quite as beneficial as as this large you know state multi-state footprint and so that's really also an important thing to remember is the collaboration that needs to happen across state borders thank you kathy and adam i'll just add to what kathy just said that's a really important piece that she brought up i think you know one of the recommendations we've been making is that states need to have specific individuals that are assigned to be speaking with other states energy offices other states energy environment committees need to be you know i know the commissioners have forums where they're already speaking about things on a regional basis but it's really important in you know even in things like implementing clean energy standards that we're looking not just at the borders of our states but sort of how are we gonna you know meet the the needs of our region in terms of reliability and decarbonization and all those important things when we know that we don't rely on our own state just for resources we know that we share resources across borders so having that uh sense of you know at this time we're now talking about something that affects more than just the state of oregon is a really good perspective yep thank you nicole definitely heard that um in some of the written feedback as well for sure any other comments uh or feedback answer during the this roundtable open open forum or should i move on with the agenda and we can be a little ahead of schedule i'm happy to do that okay i think i will i think i'll move us along for now there'll be plenty of opportunity on a lot of these topics there's a lot of interrelatedness certainly so a lot of these issues will come up again throughout the afternoon so next i wanted to just very briefly review the scope of the literature review that we were asked to do by the legislature i i didn't know how to do this other a very dry showing you hear what the statute actually says right so i think there was a some some questions maybe about um the draft that we sent around um to everyone on the advisory committee uh so the the legislation asked us to review studies and reports relevant to development or expansion of an rto right to prepare a summary of those and then consider any additional studies or reports that they come out after july of this summer and then of course include all that uh in our in our uh report back to the legislature this fall so i just wanted to kind of share our interpretation of what that what that means and so kind of the charge we took from that as a department right so we really thought that uh we were charged with looking out at the technical studies that are out there certainly many people on this uh on this meeting have been involved with many of those studies whether it's the state-led that came out most recently or you know any number of others that we looked at and then we know we're out there but some important caveats we really you know the literature review that we put out there is a draft and that we intend to include in the final report to the legislature it's really intended to reflect the findings of those reports and studies right it's not intended to be um conveying any sort of endorsement by us by the department by the state or this advisory committee so it's going to make that really clear that that's our intention right",

        "text": " request some different or additional conditions be imposed, and the board has the discretion to entertain whatever request you might make in that regard. So that's the general drill on special use permits. Vice chair Stone has already indicated the order of the proceedings. Once you come up to the podium. Please direct all your comments only to the county commissioners. Don't look back to the audience to ask questions to your friends in the audience because it's the board of county commissioners that is the one that you have to give your testimony to regarding the development agreement. That's basically a legislative type activity on the board. The board has broad discretion to enter into all sorts of contractual agreements, including these types of development agreements. And if you are here to speak to the development agreement, you are free to address the board concerning any policy concerns that are on your mind concerning the proposed agreement, any particular factual issues. If you have testimony regarding what you perceive may be some impact of this project, you can address that at at least the agreement. The one thing that generally speaking is not helpful to the board is simply to have people come before the board on either one of these types of proceedings and simply say I don't like it or I don't want it. Those types of statements of opinion generally are not particularly helpful, so try to give the board as much factual detail as you can when you provide your comments. Because of the limited time period, I recommend highly that you make sure you get your most important points out first. That way you have that out of the way, and then any other points you have, you can add that too. If anyone else has already made the point you want to make, you're free to simply say you agree with that person. But it doesn't help the board if five people get up and say the same thing over and over again. So if the comments and concerns you that are relevant to you have already been expressed, you don't need to get up and repeat something that's already been stated. So with that, I'll ask everyone who's going to speak to any of these issues today, please stand up and we will place you under oath. You solemnly square or affirm the testimony you will give today will be the truth and nothing but the truth under penalty of law. All right, be seated. Thank you ma am. Thank you Mister mentor. And I'll now start with Mister Wadrock. If you'd like to take item number one please. O Kenwayrke for GR services. This is case number 23 0504 Su. It is a special use permit request for a private baseball facility. Orash park in a one general agriculture it is. The location is at 70 two northeast 17th Terrace. It's also just west of northeast Jacksonville Road on northeast 70th street, also known as highway 326. The applicant's name is Donna Kelly and the agent is Tillman and associates engineering. The property size is 15.46 acres. It is zone general agriculture, a one with a low residential future land use. If we look at the existing use map from the property appraiser, looking at the uses going on on the properties today, we have mostly single family homes to the rear and some agricultural properties. And then this white piece here is actually some sort of multifily. I'm not sure why it's coming up as white, but it's multifamily. And then you can see the subject property is listed as commercial. And that's why we're here today. Here's a arial showing the multifamily to the east and the single family homes to the north and to the west. So the applicant is requesting a baseball facility with three baseball fields, a peee field, which is this one right here, little league field, and then a standard baseball field. They have dugouts, stadium seating, which is. You'll see pictures up here in a little bit, batting cages, stadium lighting, grass, parking. And they're proposing no buffers. And we'll get back to that in a little bit as well. So here are the site photos. I went. Went out today and took some photo or these are the first site photos I forgot. There's two sets of site photos. My apologies. But here you can see the dugouts and the stadium lighting. And this is the pole barn on the property that be. That's intended to be converted to batting cages. So have. We do have concerns with staff. There are several code cases, one from building, several from building department that. That were opened in March of 2022. And then there's a zoning code case that was opened in December of 2022. And the zoning code cases is for the removal of trees without a. Without a permit or a site plan or a development order. There's. The proposed use is surrounded by residential properties, but the facility itself is not intended to be a community ballpark. So for the people who live around or if they wanted to use this facility, they have to be patrons of the applicant. So it's not really a community park. And the biggest issue of all is there's stadium lighting, which will potentially cast glare around the surrounding properties. And there's no buffering to block that lighting when noise and any other nuisance issues that may come from this property. I did a quick Google search. We found all of the public and private baseball fields within the area. Here's the subject property in yellow and 1700ft to the south is the Oak Grineer facility, which has a special use permit from 1995 to operate a recreational facility. And here's the Oak Grinder facility, in case you were curious, from 1995, where they had five baseball fields, where three of those are a little league at high school, and an adult softball, three tennis courts, four handball courts, an ampiftheater barbecue shelter, a gymnasium, which is here, a playground here and in a baseball field. And here's what it looks like today from the aiaL. As a summary, we found that granting the request, we believe will adversely affect the public interest. It is consistent with the comprehends a plan, but it's not compatible with surrounding land uses in the surrounding area. And so staff is recommending denial. We do have conditions if you decide to go against staff, I'approve this. Here are the site photos from about 10:00 this morning, where you can see the fields. And this is this picture here. We're standing in the front driveway, looking straight back to the residential neighbors. Behind this is the east roadway, which there is a tree line buffer between this and the multifamily to the east. But when you get to the back northeast corner, here's the tree line of the property with the stadium lighting to the south and residential uses to the north. There's no buffer on the property. And then this one here, I'm standing in front of the homeless to the north, directly to the north, taking a picture, looking south. And then we noticed that there are gates along the northern boundary as well. And we were unsure what that really meant, if people would be parking in the right away or the easement back there and walking into the property. So with that, staff is recommending denial. We have conditions that were original conditions. Those are the ones in white. And then we have this odd green color. Our conditions proposed by planning and zoning, who also recommended approval with conditions. And then the conditions that are in yellow are conditions from staff that came up after a meeting with the applicants'agent last week. And then we added one more today while we were out on the site, we noticed we didn't address if there was gon toa be a PA system or not. So, due to the lack of buffer, if you approve this staff would recommend no PA system, no amplified music. So. And that's right here at the end. The applicant is here. Okay, thank you very much, Mister Rayrock. Do eitheror here have any questions? Not right now. Yes, go ahead, commissioners. So when the code cases, it opened up and we went out there. I'm assuming they were building this project at some level. I don't know exactly what time we were out there, but when we asked them what are you doing? Blah blah blah blah. What's the statement for building with no permits? So I'm not sure why they were building without permits. They have submitted permits but all of those are being held up at the moment. Were they submitted when the code enforcement cases came in or when. I don't have the exact answer for that. I apologize. Ye. Can we find out from the building department? Yes. Okay. I do have a question as well. Do we know what ag related activities are taking place on that site today? As it is zag. There's no agricultural activities going on on the property today. There's an area to the northwest that says it is grazing land, which is. I didn't put the picture up here but it's just a fenced in area with grass and there is a pop up camper park there, but it's down so it's in stored mode. That's the only thing that's in the grazing area on the site. Plan commission gold, do you have any questions? No I don't. And I'll email Mister miner if I do have any questions and also to verify the vote. So mister mentor, if you'll be looking at your email and you're coming through a lot that are now commissioner gold. So thank you. Okay y. Thank you. I'll ask the applicant if you'd like to come forwardman. Tillman Associates engineering. 1720 Southeast 16th Avenue, building 100, Nocala, Florida 34471. So the site kind of give it a little bit of a background. It started as one thing and it grew and grew and grew and, and it got to where it was. Something that's pretty",

        "text": " then from Marion county it's going to be 484 on the south end of the county. It's going to be county road 25 out there and it's going to be the 92nd loop around the Bellevue area. Those are some examples of your arterials, your collectors. And when you view this map, I hope it makes sense for you. It's going to be your, a lot of your three numbered roads, your 315s, your 316s, your three hundred eighteen s, three hundred fourteen s, four hundred seventy five s show up on that. As well as 80th street is a great example of a collector road. Today you're taking a lot of other roads and you're connecting them back to your major, more major road networks, your major locals. If you begin to look, you've left kind of the arteries that you're going to drive from the city of Ocala maybe out to a major part in the county. And now you've started to thread in and thread your way out across the county. They're not necessarily what you would view as a neighborhood road because you're not going to see house after house on them. You're going to see some of our larger land showing up on them. So I hope that begins to make sense and the view makes sense for you. So again, one of the immediate steps that we do when we're planning our projects out is we want to talk about what shape is your pavement in. So your office of the county engineer implemented several years ago. It's been over ten years ago since we've implemented what we call the pavement Condition Index, PCI. You'll hear us refer to PCI for short. And the pavement condition index is a way that we score roads from a 100 down to a zero. And it's just like very similar to scoring when you're in school. You know, if you, if you have that zero, you, you clearly failed. If you've got a 100, you have a brand new road. The paver just rolled off of it so it doesn't stay at a 100 for very long. We provide these pictures over here to the right hand side that give you a visual for it and we classify our roads from that zero to 26. You can clearly see that bottom picture there. It's missing pavement segments that has failed. 26 to 55. The cracking is just rampant through the project. You can see that in this particular picture we have crack sealed where the cracks are to make them even more visual to you. That clearly is a road that is needing some attention. 55 to 80, that's where it's okay. That a lot. The majority of our road network lives at 55 to 80. That tells you where we are with our maintenance program and that's just a road that has had some life on. It is getting good use. We're not concerned about it yet. It's where it needs to be at its cycle. And then of course that 80 to 100, those are going to be your newer roads. You probably want to know how often do we inspect for our roads and update formally the pcis. So on that arterial collector major roads. If it's a good road, we're out there every two years. If it's already beginning to slip lower on the scale, we're out there every year for the minor local roads. Again, depends on where it's at in that good, fair, poor category. Reviewing it up to every three years. If it's a subdivision road, we're not routinely looking at those roads. We do coordinate with MSTU when they are evaluating what needs to happen in that road and we will go out and score it using this type of criteria to keep our scoring criteria similar. So this slide gives you a snapshot of your pavement and the PCI since 20 2012 and I'm on slide seven. If we start over in the top right table and that's the one with the percentages there, just want to stop at 2023 and what you're going to see is 37% of your roads are good, 41% are sitting in fair, 21% are poor and 1% are failed. If you drop with me to the bottom table at the bottom left, it tells you what your average pcis are again since 2012. And I'm going to go over to the far right hand side of that table and focus in again on the condition and how we've tried to hold that condition since 2012. You can see that when we started the program, we were 67. We clearly began to drop, and this is when we began to implement new programs to try to address our pavement condition. And you see we've been able to steadily gain, and we're back to a 66. Now we would like to see this PCI number increase. It is a balancing of the budget. We feel like a good number to keep us at is about a 69. So it continues to be a steady gain, but we're not displeased with the percentages and the scores that we're showing you today. It's just a constant work. When you look at the primary table at the top left, you can read that through and it tells you what your classifications are as of 2023, how many miles, centerline miles you have of good for your arterial, your collectors, your major locals, your minor locals, and your subdivision locals. And you can read that all the way down to what's failed for each of those roads. So this becomes a great tool for us in project planning. There is a lot that goes into our planning, and I touched on that at the beginning, planning for a road for if you're building a new road, if you're providing for capacity, we can start those project plannings 2030 years out in advance easily. They come at a tremendous cost, so they've got to be built into your budget. There's a lot that goes in before you can decide that you're going to put in a new road on somebody's private property. So we have to do a lot of pre engineering, a lot of what we call our preliminary engineering reports, studies. Those are often done ten plus years in advance. Then you can see that sometimes our priorities shift and we find ourselves getting still know that they're important projects. When we get back to them, those studies get updated. Again, we don't necessarily do a full blown update. It depends on how far away we got from the study and how much has continued to change in the area. So all of these items take time, they take cost, and certainly they involve your decision making and the community's decision making. I think anybody would be offended if I went to any particular property owner and said, guess what? Next year I'm going to build a brand new road across the middle of your property. So there's a lot that goes in up front. Every five years, your long range plan is updated and your staff is involved in that, your planning staff and your engineering staff and then every year, your office of the county Engineer puts out a five year implementation document of what roads we're actually working on. It's a rolling five year. Once you're in that five year tip, we try to keep you in the tip. We do sometimes shift a little bit. One year in, one year out, depending on what is actually going on with the, what costs are coming in at. Does it make sense to sometimes go ahead and move a project next to another project to get better cost or because of traffic congestion that's going on in the area, or does it make sense to slip something out because things have become so costly this year, we've had to move some projects out because of budget limitations. We also have noticed some of commissioners did not experience this. Some of you did. We had certain roads that were part of our five year tip and our long range plan that we had anticipated widening sooner than we did today. The great example I can give you is Northeast 35th street. That road is intended to be a four lane. We should have already had it accomplished by now. As we were working on that project, we all of a sudden began to grow again, and we saw astronomical changes on our west side of the county, and we needed to begin to react accordingly. So while that project is still a very important project, we had to divert some of our funding to play catch up with what was necessary on the west side. So these are the decisions that you all encounter throughout the year, and definitely when we bring you the tip each annually, and that tip comes to you about April, May, before we enter the budget. So project planning, these are the big numbers. I'm just going to hit them right out the gate and then we'll tell you how we got there. So you have heard me saying over the last year that there are $659 million worth of projects that are not funded. 218 of those projects. 218. 19 million of projects are programmed in our five year tip and funded. Those are the, those are the. Did I say that? $218.6 million worth of projects that are programmed and funded. So you've heard those numbers before, so they shouldn't surprise you. But here's where we've done some refinement, and this is what this slide shows you. So capacity needs. Capacity, again is our capitals when we're going to add lane miles, and then you'll see a few other projects that improve the function of the ability to travel on the road, as well as other capital type projects. We forecast 65.7 centerline miles coming in at 722.6 million intersection improvements there are some key intersections that you're very familiar with. For example, southeast Mary Camp Road at Baseline Road. We have to talk about that being an interchange in our near future, separating the lanes so that you can get through that intersection. It doesn't need to become a ten lane",

        "text": " at our manager people want to live here right no matter what type of offices they move here anyway so we have to overcome that and so we have to convince them well in the long run like you're saying if that is true in the long run then we need some industrial we need something else to supplement the city so it isn't overwhelming to the residents but I think that pitch is an important one to make just because there are folks Community you have that extra cost but in this community the size of Apartments they've done a study our apartments are the same cost per foot as the rest of Washington county is just that the size of departments are you know 10 to 20 larger so when you look at a two-bedroom apartment cost per foot is the same but true and so it ends up being monthly learned so that was one of our housing needs it helps us enhance yourself but anyway that's the other trailer but thank you yeah I think it's good to put it out when it gets to council when when people are watching their area and understanding why nope that's a great comment the commuting pattern here so this is Sherwood's commuting pattern for for Implement based on the U.S census data and so there's you know 824 people that live in work here in Sherwood a little over 9 000 folks from Sherwood commute out to Sherwood and um you know they're commuting to you know Portland um Hillsborough Tigard you know Beaverton and Wilsonville our surrounding communities and then we have a little over you know well a little over 5 600 people that are commuting into Sherwood to work you know what it does I think it does in our packet here it has a date but it wasn't caught on this slide I think it's very important well that's just a little it's just a mapping issue oh I think that's just the mapping issue on the and unfortunately I can't pick that spits out the census spits off this map when I put in what I want to see all right so our Target Industries hasn't they they haven't changed since our last um economic opportunities analysis we are still really focused on um Advanced manufacturing uh in Machining and clean tech and professional business services um and then service for residents as well such as you know Legal Services retail interpersonal services Bruce do you want to talk about our aspirations or our Target Industries I mean I think it's really clear from castles repeated directions that they're very interested in semiconductors and we were just talking about food before that the thought was and all that when you developed but the real reality is anything less than 24 on the south side is that sure if you can indicator that beside the wallet is placed and and lamb research for example is what the economist said Say one of the four top Chevy conductor companies in the world so they came in with 45 000 square feet on the North side which is showing the picture that they originally thought that was manufactured on 300 jobs at the time they came in in 23 2021 then they just released very recently another 280 000 on the south side which is in the city of Sherwood so they're over 300 000 square feet two and a half to three years ago two and a half years ago it was one of the four largest companies in the world um here I mean it just wasn't expected for some reason the semiconductors is very important companies that do research and development are very important that can be part of what somebody does instead of conductors of um Advanced manufacturing things include all kinds of copies called climate taxes of research adapters some really neat companies of surrounding area uh both in Tualatin about two blocks away from this from our city limits and it builds a bill that are doing some very interesting work on large-scale batteries development which is going to be huge so these are companies the future we've got already coming to the room in the airspace field here we're going to have companies that are in the space field and at least one company that those we've got uh we don't have unmanned they call and then vehicles but that's that shouldn't be something very interesting to us as a computer industry um biosciences life sciences should be should be a really good opportunity for us some of this is easy but there's a reasonable Sciences robotics makes a lot of sense we do have an automation company Fritz it took a large Pace sure with their Swedish owned company we've got a cleantech semi conductor company such as NSI that just came here their Journey based comedy software we hear the term outdoor aware a lot that's a really big industry in the Metro appointment is about 126 there are many companies we know the big ones so uh in that metal machinery that's a very big industry yeah because you can't have your face without that you and we've got some pretty neat companies doing Precision Machining to ensure that are now expanding all that trustee for example that's that's a really interesting topic uh that they they're either doing but not really our goal is not distribution we're going to get distribution as far as part of industrial economy but we don't go about seeping it um it's gonna it's gonna come but we are fortunate to be some ways four miles to the freeway so it's going to be less we find this less interesting that usually when buildings are built here properties that are otherwise probably leaving they're coming from the city of Portland from some of the interceptors because it's just not enough places in that problems so that's that's yep perfect okay so the next couple of slides here are going to talk about our employment forecasts and then our land demand forecast and um there's a lot of modeling work that kind of that goes into this information and I just want to say that we had we had a technical advisory for this process and we had uh commissioner Vance sat on our technical advisory committee for the Planning Commission we I think the mayor or maybe with Doug Scott I can't remember we had a counselor um on that technical advisory committee we had uh industrial Brokers we had uh industrial developers we had neop we had we actually had the gold nine specialist from the state of Oregon she sat on this on that committee as well so we had we Washington County so we had a lot of different folks sitting on this technical advisory you know providing us you know comments and additional details about the market here in Sherwood which um which really kind of helped formulate employment forecast so our we looked at three different scenarios for for our employment forecast and the the first forecast here is what we call the state Harbor forecast and the state of Oregon when we do these EOS like I said they're they're pretty technical in nature they have some organ administrative rules that when you do an employment forecast you can do it this way this way or that way but you need to back it up with with data so the Safe Harbor approach actually looked at um organs like employment departments number for average growth in the in the Metro region and they're saying that the average growth is you know two percent so over a 20-year period before passive growth would be you know a little over 4 000 jobs then we took a look at okay what has been that the average annual growth in Sherwood over the past you know 10 years so we took a look at that information and like I said earlier we have seen significant growth over the past 10 years for employment and it's been 3.4 um annual growth for employment and so if we extend that and look out over the 20-year period that's going to provide a little over 9 000 jobs in our forecasted period but then we we talked to our Tac you know and um about the employment forecasting and our methods and we kind of we made an adjusted employment forecast from our Sherwood Trend forecast and so we're kind of all settled on the 3.2 um average annual growth rate with a little over you know 8 000 jobs for the spending planning period complete your presentation like Circle back or now it's good I want you to provide comments along the way okay um yeah so yeah it was our fall news saw this this process to approve so um in my work I'm involved in forecasting estimation and that kind of stuff so yeah and banks these days are really heavily regulated in terms of uh model rigor and validation requirements so um I have become accustomed I think to a bit more uh documentation and evidence and and stuff in there than yeah I saw at least in some of this um there were some I just let me start with some kids on this report the goods in this report I I think that the um current Supply review the inventory of what we currently have I think that's a great discussion um I know there were some weaknesses with their model identified land and whatever but there were folks in the college just knew these properties super well and able to kind of clarify exactly so much there and all that um and I also think and we can talk about this but the overall conclusion report passes some reason illness tests um just sort of a conceptual standpoint um in terms of okay I think we have a shortage the the methodology though is a little interesting so for example unemployment rate forecast and then it goes from there okay so my world stopped now wait a minute why um why why employment levels why why is that the one variable we are using in this model where does that come from What alternative variables were discussed none there was never a meeting where the consultant sat down with us and said okay we need to forecast demand let's go around the room and ask what do you think are some drivers of this and then we will investigate building a model that accommodates and tests those drivers never happened it was it was I keep saying unemployment and employment is it and um there is very little and I'm not saying that's a bad variable I think it does there's a lot of it makes sense in a lot of ways I'm just saying it's not well documented as to why this this particular variable was selected what strength was it's explanatory power What alternative models were investigated um what are the assumptions and limitations for example if you're going to build a model off of employment that you've observed past several years and our model is designed to estimate demand of land well land is partly constrained as well as well by the um by the planning process over the last several years so how much",

        "text": " the application um and this looks like a lot but it's really not but one of one of the things that uh one of the things that we have to do as the state is um do a risk assessment and ensure that the the folks that we're going to be handing this money out to um are capable of managing award and Reporting upon it um so we're looking for um these bullet here I won't go through every single one of them um but basically ensuring that you um you have followed terms and conditions if you've ever had an award before um if uh if you've had experience with similar programs to describe a little bit of that um and then you know policies or procedures that you might have for ensuring comp compliance with the terms of the award um all of these things are uh listed in the application instructions which are also going to be on the web page um in great detail next slide please all right there's some um good stuff about justice 40 so um one thing I want to do is just give you a little bit of background in case you're not familiar what justice 40 is or if you hear us call it j40 for short um justice 40 is part of an executive order that was signed by President Biden um back on January 27th of 2021 and um it set forth some prioritizing actions to tackle the climate crisis one of those things was the justice 40 initiative and it directs that 40% of the benefits of C certain federal investments will flow to disadvantaged communities this is one of those programs so if you're wondering what a disadvantaged Community is or how it's defined the Council on Environmental Quality was tasked by the White House with defining disadvantaged communities and they Ed a number of different data sets to show the communities that are most overburdened and underserved um in the following categories fossil dependence energy burden environmental and climate hazards so socioeconomic vulnerabilities um and within those main categories there's some um several subsets of information that they were looking at um including I'll just name a few um housing and energy costs low income lack of indoor plumbing and Wildfire risk but there's many more um those communities are determined at the census track level which are going to be small units of local geography I'm sure that you're familiar with those every 10 years you probably get that call or knock on the door to fill out your census survey so the boundaries are for this uh statistical data is determined once every 10 years by the US Census Bureau and um I'll also just mention um even though though uh Federal tribes do have their own set aside for the um for the eecbg funds um just for the purposes of understanding the map lands within the boundaries of federally recognized tribes are also included in this CEST map um and I see that Sarah dropped the link for that map thank you so much so um within this program itself we're looking at um how you're how your strategy can support the goal that 40% of the benefits will flow to um communities and um one of the ways is just knowing that your community is within this map um some of your communities might be um overlapping part of your communities it depending on the census track and how it works um might be within the map and with you know not within the map um but the main thing here is that um we we'd like to see metrics that are identified that show measurable data that you can track throughout the life of your project which um is likely going to be a 2-year period of performance um and how you can collect collect um information that shows that the uh the funds are benefiting um folks in disadvantaged communities so there is a list um I'll drop a link to for potential um metrics that are ideas to think about um they're not all inclusive so if you have an idea for a metric that you'd like to track that ties directly to the type of project that you're working on feel free to um suggest something new that's not included on that list we'd love to see something unique next slide please all right so we're all done talking at you this is going to be an opportunity for um you guys if there's any questions that you have um for us regarding the process it looks like Matt raised his hand Matt it looks like you're off mute oh now you're back on there you okay um thanks for the seminar I just learned about this yesterday on the league of Oran City's page and jumped on it um most of this doesn't apply to me but I I'm am attending because I'm doing this with a direct award and Emily I've appreciated what you've offered as far as you know advice and stuff I have the one question I have is um does you you answered the question that we can't double dip basically I as a direct Federal um awarde we can't jump on this through the O through OD uh Department of energy right that's that's confirmed so I can't supplement a state uh program State offering with what I'm getting directly from the federal government that's correct right so if you're meaning um that you can't supplement it with this particular award or any other Federal award yeah you can't overlap them um however there's a cat to that um two two caveats um one is if there's any offerings that we have that are available with State funds that you can overlap such as our C rep opportunity which I think just open for the third round I may or not may not be um accurate on that but um I know that the third round is either open or getting ready to open so those are State funds and that's an allowable thing to do um and that's where these this gets to be a little bit complex and understanding just where the money is coming from in this in this case it's Federal money so you can't stack Federal money um upon each other yeah um the other thing I'll just mention Matt I'm sorry I don't know where you're coming from exactly but if your city or county received a direct award yes where I'm sorry uh from the city of Oregon City oh okay perfect so um great I'm glad that you guys are taking advantage of that opportunity um your county um was IL ineligible for the funding the county can receive funds um while whereas the city um let me rephrase it the county could potentially receive funds through this award um even if you do for your city have your own direct eecbg award from the US Department of energy one example I'll give you of that that seems really odd is um Moma County I don't know if mola county is on the on the line but they're eligible to receive a direct um excuse me a award through us through Odo because they didn't and weren't eligible for a direct award from eecbg even though Portland was Portland got their own award so that's just an example of where that might work out okay the second and more important question to me is is is O Odo requiring uh the Energy Efficiency and strategy that I'm reading about in the federal level because that seems to be my my biggest obstacle to to Hur my biggest hurdle is uh and and if you guys aren't requiring that that's fine um but I know that that strategy seems to be like the the non-negotiable starter that has to be done at some point so I'm actually considering using my Direct Federal Awards to complete the strategy and I'm working with the federal uh doe to determine that but since I'm on this call does what how is the state handling that yeah great question um we had to complete the en Energy Efficiency and conservation strategy um this is why they create acronyms right the eecs is so much quicker um we had to as the state do um a version of that for our application which was accepted we're not requiring our sub grantees to create their own version of that no but I like the idea of you guys working with doe on that because I do know that they have technical assistance available to help um cities craft that eecs so that's a good option is there is there a way to Forfeit the Federal Direct and go through the state unfortunately no I'm sorry we just drew the Short Straw by being a direct Federal awarde that's that's awesome so somewhat sarcastic but appreciate your your information today thank you sure you got it um we have a few questions in the chat um Peter I'm going to put my email in the chat if you don't mind emailing me I'm happy to connect you um or get that answer about your um email in the portal not working um the first question for the group is um why is it a first come first serve basis instead of a review great question uh Roger I'm happy to answer that unless you you want to go Emily one of the things that um Roger and I and and you know through engagement with different stakeholders um including many of you um is um understanding how we could rapidly deploy These funds and um get them out the focus is really on justice 40 communities and making sure that disadvantaged communities so the focus is on that in this first round if we have funds available after the first round we will have a second round of funding um available um but going back to the question about why first come first serve not competitive it really comes down to a timing thing with this particular program there is a federal statute that requires that we make these subg grants within 180 days of receiving the federal funds and since we received the federal funds in um in December that puts us a somewhere in June without doing the math um exactly somewhere in June that we have to have subg grants made available and the process of doing a competitive um grant program is just a little bit more time consuming and lengthier um but Roger feel free to add on that if I'm missing something yeah know I think Emily said it really well and under a lot of pressure to get this out and decided upon quickly um not exactly sure why the federal level wanted to have a 180-day requirement to get these funds out there but uh we're just uh playing the game along with them so that's uh the main reason and then the other question that's in the chat is from Meredith Howell and it says do cities have to go through an open public process with their intent to seek these funds like other cdbg programs through business Oregon Community Development block grant programs through business Oregon Emily do you got that one sure yeah um so no not formally um not not in the way that I I think that I'm reading into",

        "text": " have heard of ammonia being used as a promising hydrogen carrier um and that's due to its high hydrogen content and there's already an established distribution network um ammonia is you know easier to move around and the hydrogen can then later be released on demand from ammonia so that's also considered a storage medium for hydrogen there's also geologic storage um such as feet in geological features such as salt caverns so this is a graphic some folks promoting a an energy storage project in utah called aces or advanced clean energy storage and their goal for this project is to produce renewable hydrogen and then compress it and store it in existing salt caverns and it is being billed as largest um energy storage project in the world the only problem with this is that salt caverns aren't distributed everywhere they are just in kind of narrow areas within the world and within the us with respect to moving around hydrogen um there are kind of three main ways that it's currently distributed so the first is within pipelines and there are some pipelines in the u.s that are dedicated to hydrogen but these are limited um so there's been a push to um add hydrogen into national gas sorry natural gas pipelines so there's been numerous demonstration projects already doing this in europe um there are limiting factors to this however first it's likely only possible to blend you know maybe up to 20 hydrogen by volume into a natural gas pipeline before you start to see problems with how hydrogen might affect pipeline materials pardon me how much hydrogen might leak out or how end-use appliances and buildings might react so this is partly due to just the chemical and physical structure of hydrogen it can easily migrate into the crystal structure of most metals and therefore um steel pipes um for example that are used in transmission pipeline infrastructure can suffer from what's called embrittlement and cracking after continuous exposure to hydrogen so any sort of hydrogen transport pipeline or any metal exposed to it should be resistant to corrosion or cracking compressed hydrogen as a gas can be transported in high pressure tube trailers and these can go on the back of a truck on a rail car on a ship or on a barge this is um fairly expensive and so it's often used for shorter distances and then you can also liquefy hydrogen to those cryogenic temperatures and then distribute it in tankers again via trucks rail cars this is also expensive but it is more efficient for longer so hydrogen has been in use for many many years in a number of industries but as we discuss greatly expanding how we might use hydrogen in our economy globally or closer to home there are some common concerns that we hear raised and i'm not going to go into all of these today but i am going to highlight the first two safety and efficiency some of the other concerns are the costs around renewable hydrogen the potential of using renewable hydrogen to prolong the use of fossil fuels knox emissions from combusting renewable hydrogen in a turbine and then the water use associated with producing renewable so going into safe use of hydrogen and this is a big question that a lot of people have um and certainly no fuel is 100 safe and there are a number of ways in which hydrogen is shown to be safer than conventional fuels and so one of these is that hydrogen is not toxic unlike conventional fuels most of which are very toxic or contain toxic substances like carcinogens um hydrogen leak or spill is not going to attack pardon me contaminate the environment or threaten the health of humans or um hydrogen is also lighter than air and many times lighter than gasoline vapor so what this means is that when released it typically will rise and disperse rapidly and that greatly reduces the risk of ignition at ground level where people and buildings conversely propane and gasoline vapor are heavier than air so they like to stay down on the ground and can increase the risk of fires that could harm people or infrastructure and then finally hydrogen has a higher oxygen requirement for explosion than fossil fuels hydrogen can be explosive with oxygen concentrations that are between 18 and 59 percent um while for gasoline it's as low as one to three percent sorry um this means that gasoline has a greater risk for explosion than hydrogen for any given environment with oxygen that said there are certainly a number of safety issues with hydrogen that must be addressed for example hydrogen can ignite more than gasoline or natural gas um and so for this reason safe design of hydrogen systems requires adequate ventilation as well as specially designed leak detection sensors um and as mentioned earlier hydrogen can degrade certain metals including steel through a process called embrittlement so choosing materials used with hydrogen is of critical importance given that hydrogen has been produced and stored and transported for decades there are there is existing expertise in producing compressed hydrogen fuel tanks for example that are made of carbon fiber composites or for example carbon fiber paired with metal alloys so here's an example of kind of a typical high compression uh hydrogen storage and it has this inner lining of a polymer that serves as a barrier from hydrogen permeating it and then there's an outer layer that's made for impact and damage resistance and there are a number of codes and standards for hydrogen tank performance so when testing to ensure compliance with standards um tanks are subjected to more than i believe twice the maximum pressure that they experience under normal given that hydrogen is the smallest known molecule though it is certainly prone to leakage and hydrogen is what's called an indirect greenhouse gas and that's because it interacts with other direct greenhouse gases like methane and ozone and perturbs them in the atmosphere so thus again the importance of those sensors to detect leaks which are standard on hydrogen handling equipment and hydrogen filling stations but certainly you know as we've seen recently with a lot of the natural gas and methane leak detection um from drones and from satellites leads are a big deal and we should be worried about those but because of the growing interest in hydrogen for decarbonization scientists at national labs and universities have been working on research and development of new options for hydrogen storage and transport that are lighter that are cheaper and that better protect against leakage so that second concern about renewable hydrogen that i wanted to address is if you're using electricity to produce another fuel and then later turning that fuel back into electricity you're obviously going to be less efficient than just using that electricity for your end use in the first place as an example here is a diagram from nrel the national renewable energy lab that shows the round-trip efficiency for battery battery energy storage uh and that's at the top here and and compares it with hydrogen energy storage and even just looking at the pathways you can see that the battery pathway is way more efficient there are fewer steps there's less energy loss and in fact the end efficiency here is something like 95 and then you look at the hydrogen energy storage pathway and it's not great the round trip efficiency comes out to 35 percent and so this has costs and so you may be asking yourself with energy with efficiency losses like this why would anyone ever be interested in renewable hydrogen well there are a few reasons so first off if we want economy-wide decarbonization then we need to figure out what to do with some of what are called hearts to decarbonize sectors and there's been a recent mantra of electrify everything among um renewable energy advocates and we can electrify a lot of our economy but there are just some end uses where electricity doesn't make sense for example there are a lot of industrial processes like steel cement metal processing where electrification doesn't work these need um you know high heat a really concentrated energy source but a fuel like hydrogen could greatly reduce the greenhouse emissions um associated in these sectors another reason for the interest in hydrogen is that as we add more and more variable renewable resources to our electric grid i'm talking about those that don't always produce electricity like wind and we're having increasing problems around resource adequacy a need for resources to help balance at peak of peace times of peak demand and also a need for longer duration seasonal energy storage and that's really one of the places where hydrogen shines so if we if you remember that graphic i just showed you with nrel which showed the difference between 95 efficiency for battery energy storage versus the 35 for renewable hydrogen it's clear that batteries are a real winner but they're really only good for about four hours and so when you start getting to the need for longer duration storage which i'll get into shortly you're going to see that hydrogen can be a much more cost effective option and then finally there's certain transportation contexts where electricity just doesn't work and there are other reasons why there is interest in hydrogen but these are just four of the big ones gonna go over really quickly resource adequacy and peak demand so there's been a lot of talk in the northwest about resource adequacy lately and i pulled these two images from odo's 2020 biennial energy report which you should absolutely read cover to cover and it has a policy brief on resource adequacy and put simply resource adequacy means do we have enough resource resource capacity on the system to meet demand over a spread of years and that's going to include peak demand and then down below here we have yield duct curve and this shows an april day in california and so the light blue portion represents all of the demand for electricity being met with solar and the dark blue is the remaining demand for electricity or net demand and that has to be met with other resources and so the so-called belly of the duck is the middle of the day when there's so much solar that it's meeting almost all of the demand for electricity and then we get to 5 p.m and the sun starts going down and people at least in the before times would get off work and would come home and would turn on lots of things that consume electricity and then we have this ramp and to meet that ramp california has traditionally relied on what are called pure plants which are natural gas plants that can spin up quickly as soon as they're needed increasingly batteries are also being used to address peak demand and as i said that's where lithium-ion batteries can really shine providing those shorter bursts of energy for minutes or just a few hours but it's expensive to build enough batteries to replace all of the flexible resources we had or phasing out that could meet that peak demand and so hydrogen can play a role here in two ways first it could help replace some of those natural gas peaker plants either combusted as a fuel or via",

        "text": " buy the storage tanks but we could buy um the infrastructure to make sure it's operational in the event of a power okay perfect i just didn't want to spend all the time on something that wasn't didn't fit in the proper definition so thank you perfect yes and that's exactly i am we were pretty close to that jedi issue over the summer um as a department and um we actually are kind of looking at federal infrastructure dollars to be able to uh that that could be used for things like that so i'll um make a quick note that it's something you're interested in and if we see something going down the pipe that could work for that we'll let you know because it's definitely thank you i mean it's just looking at probably about a million dollars um before that updated system and it's just it's not in our budget anywhere and we were at least really stuck with the fire support for that yeah yeah and the same exact thing happened in southern oregon just before you two was two places over the summer with really similar issues so thanks for the flag and feeling like a little bit it's all coming full circle you were rock stars in helping us get that within three days because the fuel supply was so tight at that point so thank you yeah thank you so much for saying that um okay great i'm gonna get into the chat now um there's a there's a pretty long list here so i'm going back to jim baird um his question is gonna go to rob under power generation biogas is listed would a cogen project be considered a renewable energy and resilience project as it replaces grid power making the i'm gonna have ignorance here i don't know what wwtp stands for more resilient you know as far as a cogen cogen plant goes if it's able to operate and provide electricity and thermal energy when the grid is down then it would definitely count towards energy resilience and we do have provisions to count that thermal energy as value towards the program so as long as it's able to provide backup power when the grid is down it would count towards resilience and as long as it's running on a renewable fuel then it would count as a renewable so hopefully that answers the question um next up from alan johnston who every time i see your name i'm pretty sure you're my friend drew's uncle oh no no this is a different alan johnston it's a different one sorry uh i think you're the one that was on our committee right is construction design considered part of the construction project category and i don't know whether to direct that to james or rob so construction design considered part of construction project or would construction design be planning i guess is the question here uh so i can maybe fill that one up um you can kind of keep me right um so the design or engineering expenses related to renewable energy system components is an eligible uh cost under the construction development grants so and in terms of planning grants it's kind of looking at just general planning costs so consulting fees load analysis citing um not including property acquisition like ensuring code compliance interconnection studies transmission studies those are the kind of like planning costs we're kind of anticipating and then that kind of design or engineering expenses um related to the rebuilding systems we kind of have in the construction development grant but that's not to say if you're kind of planning it in the planning grant uh that it's like an ineligible cost if we if we're kind of considering other analysis of studies necessary for planning renewable energy kind of considered in that planning brand as that that sounds right to me james that ultimately there are some costs that could overlap between the two and that a planning grant could get you part way down the road towards design but that those costs are eligible within the construction grants all right thanks you too from carol sullivan um which project category would a vehicle charging station fall under so um this is another case of whether or not the proposed project would operate during a power outage and so you know if this is a charging station that can be charged with on-site solar during a power outage and plenty of them are configured that then it would definitely count as a resilience project and if it was just um i don't know that that's a good question i think that it would be clearly resilience if it operates during a power outage and if it may be counted as a renewable only project but i'll it just wouldn't earn those points in the resilient scoring part of the application so maybe i'll take it over to james to see if he wants to add anything to that yeah now just kind of add to the on the resilient side the resilience grants are focused on um structures and facilities essential to the public welfare as well um so that's something to factor in when we uh you're considering project eligibility it's kind of are these um charges going to be decided somewhere that's kind of essential for public welfare like municipal facility or something like this that's gonna help with that um okay so the next question we have is brandi branstadter and she's flagging that parks and rec has a community pool we need to replace our solar heating would we be renewable or resilience it already exists and needs to be replaced so solar pool heating would you know this would be a solar thermal application and that would be a renewable only application unless there was some argument you could make for the need to heat that pool during an um but really it sounds to me like a renewable only project it is interesting technically in that the pool is is storage but it's not the type of storage that counts as resilience in this program so that would be a renewable energy project right and again it just makes the difference of what category you apply in and just know that we have this need to get to that 50 for resilience but i think plenty of pure renewables projects will be approved as part of this project program um okay so that is the end of the questions that i have in the chat right so we'll give it some time for last time i said that we ended up with like six questions like two minutes later so let's give it some time in case anyone wants to raise their hand with any other questions or chat any new questions in while we wait because you just wanted to kind of flag the so little background to that first question we had on deadlines do we have a bit of flexibility in terms of how how long those extensions can be uh depending on the circumstances um we just kind of look for some sort of explanation from the the applicant and we can kind of discuss that um on a case-by-case basis yeah that was something we asked for in bill drafting and it was almost as though we knew that something like this was coming i don't think we did but we just wanted to have flexibility at first those timelines were just set in the statute like in stone so at least we have some some ability to have one-on-one discussions and decide how to proceed uh let's see alex is back hi alex um when do you anticipate performance agreements will begin to be signed um i i think we mentioned that the first round of applications will be reviewed starting june 10th right probably take us a bit to review the applications do the competitive review process so that it's fair and thorough yeah we have a an uh kind of kind of calendar uh schedule on the front of the opportunity announcements and we're hoping to kind of the grants approximately at that kind of week of last week in um that's kind of our best guess about best estimate right now um with then we have like 30 days to kind of reach an agreement on performance agreement um with applicants uh following that so that would kind of be late september early october is kind of when we'd be anticipating that happening great thank you all right another question from terence romain can two separate wastewater treatment plants apply under the same public body do we have a limit on how many applications one public body can turn in no there's no limit on kind of the number of upper zones like distinct projects um like the same app same public body or can apply for multiple different i think i would just add can you correct me if i'm wrong but we do have geographic diversity as something that we are valuing in our um competitive review right that is in the uh kind of scarring criteria uh yeah there's just one one of many components that will be included in all right next to hoping way we are currently helping a client with replacing their boiler system for a wastewater treatment plant the boiler system is intended to serve as a backup system in the event the main heating and power system a cogent engine fails for whatever reason would the boiler project in this case be eligible for grant funding um that boiler could be eligible if it was powered by wood pellets or some biomass waste stream something along those lines if it's a natural gas or oil or some other boiler that's not using renewable energy then it would not be eligible thank you she said it they said that it would be powered by biogas mainly okay yeah so a biogas boiler would be an eligible makes it a great question so generally when i start to be like okay the questions are winding down we do get get several more which is awesome but um i'll kind of start thinking about next steps a little bit um if things are kind of winding down so we'll follow up with everyone who's on the line today when the application opens so just anticipate that coming we'll also send out the slide deck and just make sure everybody has our contact information so they know how to follow up if they have further questions so we'll get some sort of follow-up email to you within the next few days or so so just keep an eye out for that and then when the application opens we'll let you all know when that happens too which um which is coming soon we're in that we're in the test phases as you just saw the application is coming right along the online application so those are sort of the next steps that we'll make sure we follow up with you i also wrote down um that i'm going to follow up on port of potella mcbay and the work that you all are doing under kind of separate separate program concepts that might be coming from the federal government and with that i don't see any other raised hands or any other chats so people want to start peeling off and getting on with their day feel free um james rob and i will just sort of stick around in case",

        "text": " she cited and we think that this under the circumstances should motivate this council to send this issue back for further analysis by the administrative law just in a further hearing on these detailed scientific issues i'm happy to answer any questions if you have any thank you carl i didn't get your last name anuta anuta any questions of mr okay thank you uh thank you again this is jocelyn pease for idaho power for the record dr foudy raised many issues in her exceptions filing and idaho power fully addressed these issues in its responsive all this focus on several of the key arguments that dr faudi had made in her exceptions filing and attempt to address in in the short time the number a number of the issues that mr anuta had also first in her exceptions filing dr fowdy argues that idaho power should have addressed additional soil properties in its analysis regarding the soil protection standard in support of this argument dr fowdy emphasized language in the standard regarding impacts to soils including but not limited to erosion and chemical factors such as salt deposition from cooling towers land application of liquid effluent and chemical spills dr faudi urges that the council should the phrase including but not limited to expansively however idaho power explained in its briefing that when applying oregon principles of statutory interpretation to discern the intent behind the regulation it is clear that the scope of the standard is limited to the common characteristic between the specific examples in the standard consequently the general term impact to soils must be interpreted considering the commonality between the specific terms of the regulation and this was a point that mr ratcliff had also pointed out in his remarks on the other hand in her analysis dr faudi had provided no legal basis for her interpretation of the soil protection standard instead it is simply to satisfy her opinion that the soil properties listed in her issue statement are necessary to satisfy the standard furthermore dr faudi's request to evaluate additional soil properties is essentially an academic exercise idaho power's expert witness addressed this issue during cross-examination explaining at length that dr faudi's requests are not consistent with industry standards and that idaho power and others are not expected to perform the academic research project level of analysis that dr fowdy demands but rather the project evaluation must conform to industry standards which rely on agency issued guidance documents and best management practices or bmps second dr faudi claims that idaho power's analysis was not sufficiently granular however there is no evidence in the record that supports dr faudi's claim that compliance with the soil protection standard requires a more granular analysis or that a more granular analysis would would result in any new or different mitigation measures or bmps to achieve compliance with the standard and in fact the level of data that idaho power provided is consistent with the other applications that have come before the council contrary to dr faudi's assertions idaho power committed to performing mitigation in connection with potential impact to soils idaho power will conduct construction activities in accordance with oregon environmental laws and permits including the erosion and settlement control plan that accompanies the odeq issued 1200 c permit and the reclamation and revegetation plan which will be reviewed by the oregon department of agriculture and the oregon department of fish and wildlife idaho power will work closely with these agencies during the preparation and implementation of these plans now in response to mr anita's assertion that the analysis had failed to address dynamic soil properties like compaction in fact the issues around compaction are addressed through the reclamation plan the reclamation plan provides an explanation of how idaho power will treat the soils following construction which will include in some cases ripping the soil and working to re-vegetate the landscape and the best determination as to whether this mitigation will be successful will be the the revegetation efforts idaho power is bound to monitor the success of those revegetation efforts and if they aren't working to perform adaptive management and so those measures that are already in place will in fact ensure that that mitigation is accomplished for the regarding mr nude's assertion about documents that were excluded the way that worked was in the contested case there's a portion that's dedicated to developing an evidentiary record and then that record closes and there's briefing and after the close of the evidentiary record no one else is allowed to put more evidence into the record it's closed and then folks can argue the merits of the evidence on and so what mr anuta is referring to or documents that doctor foughty had attempted to put into the record late in the fight late in the proceeding after the close of the evidentiary record and those documents are properly excluded thank you msps are there any questions just a few comments on behalf of the department patrick crowe the department of justice uh the thrust of dr faudi's argument seems to be that idaho power's application is not complete she argues idaho power should have conducted you know several different types of analyses that it did not uh which mr anuta listed and ms ps also council has rigorous requirements for approval of a site certificate including with regard to compliance with its soil protection but in making her arguments dr faudi is setting a bar for approval that is even higher than what is required in law and in council's rules the rules in division 21 council's rules that govern what information must be included in an application the rules about soils don't require analysis of the items that dr faudi is suggesting as has been discussed the only specific items addressed in the rule are erosion and whether there are chemical factors related to operation of the facility that could adversely impact soils idaho power conducted those analyses second council can find as we've discussed throughout the evening can find compliance with one of its standards based not just on the information in an but also on conditions that council we have mr ratcliffe and ms p's referenced couple of those conditions i'll point them out uh and i think i'm probably going to overlap at least in one or two of these with what mr ratcliffe and ms p said but would point your attention to soil protection conditions one and two those would minimize erosion and soil impacts those are on pages 97 and 99 of the proposed order and actually i'm not going to give you the page references because there are two different ways to reference the pages which i won't bore you with but at any rate soil protection conditions one and two land use condition 14 in fish and wildlife habitat conditions 1 and three would also ensure that temporary soil impacts are restored post-construction that's one that i think mr ratcliff mentioned soil protection condition three that has the erosion best management practices under the 1200 c which mr anuta referenced fish and wildlife habitat conditions 1 and 3 include very detailed pre-construction assessments landowner consultation ongoing treatment and monitoring during the first five years and also assessment for long-term obligations so in short i think the two points that i'd like you to take away are one dr faudi's asking for analyses that go beyond what the council's rules require and there are conditions that the department has recommended that will address soil impacts council member continent i'm curious um about the five year the monitoring goes for five years and then what happened what what's the what's the timing after that does the let me kick this one over to kellen or reclamation and revegetation is viewed as short-term and so it's typical to set a five-year milestone where there is more aggressive monitoring and treatment and restoration in that first five years and but then for this plan under that condition at the five-year mark then based on evaluation of the first five years they'll develop a long-term monitoring plan and it might be different for certain areas it's everything is going to be quite specific for various segments but so it will be a large long-term plan with different levels of monitoring depending on the success of the first five years so just to follow up on that so because is or as i understand it it's going to constructed in phases so will each of those phases have a five a five year monitoring time frame i guess i guess i imagined it to be that the line would become operational at one point in time while it might be phased in operation i think there's going to be one point in time when the full line goes in operation that that starts to trigger the operational monitoring now many of these plans have construction requirements as well so there'll be a different set of actions that are happening during construction that are really like treatment avoidance monitoring control but then that's different than restoration and that's during construction right right as opposed to when construction is finished right so many of these plans have a multi-temporal component where they have to do pre-construction assessment construction activities and then short and long-term monitoring thank you thank you miss esterson okay so we're ready now to is the council have a different we've got the proposed order we've got the proposed um exception wait contested case order do we have differences on those two are we ready to have todd call the rule on that so so this is well go ahead cindy yeah so um i don't have any objections to the proposed contested case order because i believe that um what was being asked of idaho power was beyond the industrial standard the goal is to meet the soil protection standard and i think with the various plans that that are required under the conditions i that they adequately address that so i don't have any problems with the proposed contest case order or the proposed order where's the rest of the any difference of opinion on that council condon right councilmember condon um i have um some concern about the um most current science being used or not being used as someone might say um and i'm sorry i don't have it up in front of me but uh is there a requirement a condition that requires survey prior to construction it seems like there there was related to this soil protection and it wasn't clear to me if if that speaks to that most current information available or best available science i would hope we're using the best available science and most current and so i'm just curious if now we're you know the project is ready there is there a survey that's sure that the standard requires that cindy i'm not sure that the standard requires that i'm not either i i'm wondering if it does",

        "text": " south side of Oregon Street shown there in red about 38 acres yeah just keep going the zoning on the site is employment industrial you can see everything in purple there that has all been annexed into the city all of that zoning is employment industrial the gray area is in our talking employment area but has not been annexed into the city so a nice little block there you can see on the corner of Oregon Street and Tonkin Road of annex property in terms of the existing conditions this is probably early summer-ish or around the summer time it looks uh site looks a lot different than this now you can see the grading activity taking place on this Square property again my laser pointer here here's the site here this would be phase one of Sherwood Commerce Center so they do have a grading permit site has been graded this would be the phase two and they do have a grading permit for this site as well so things look a little bit differently than they do here but things are moving forward pretty quickly we do have two other applications that are currently in review that are related to phase one Commerce Center that I just wanted to go over they're not being heard or decided by Planning Commission but want to give you kind of the full context the uh so this is the site plan on the left here that was approved as part of phase one um and after the land use approval we've received two different applications the first one they're both related to the same change I guess and that was to get approval for Tonkin court or Laurelwood way here it was previously approved as part of both Sherwood Commerce Center and the Oregon Street Business Park um the changes that the road we did a required a conditional use permit to process you know this additional Road connectivity sort of outside of a site plan if you're doing uh roads outside of site plan and it requires a conditional use permit so that's the process that they're going through separately so Tonkin court is actually going to come all the way down to what we call the curb property off the site I'll have a different slide in a moment and then the other road that was that is being reviewed as part of the conditional use permit is a new east east west local Street to the south of phase one so in between phase one and future phase two as part of the original site plan that this commission looked at and approved we did approve Tonkin Court just down to this property line again we didn't do the extension but this here to the south of phase one was just shown as a private access drive as part of the site plan and so the applicant proposed instead and a public Street to the South and so we needed to do notice for that and you know notify neighbors that there was a change so those are both that that's in review in addition because they're uh as a result of this road there were some changes to the site plan mainly this what you see in red here in this red box because of the change they were able to drop this building down at about ten thousand square feet of additional space so that required a minor modification to the site plan so we have the minor mod and the cup both in process don't see any issues with approval they're both on track and I think importantly they really don't impact the application in front of you tonight just kind of want to give you the full context of what's going on with the site plans and then in terms of what we have going on in terms of other activity and development in this area here you can see the entire uh Road Tonkin Court Laurelwood way coming all the way down to the curb property so we are in process of reviewing this one here we've approved Sherwood Commerce Center phase one poly shorthand for Oregon Street business park has also been approved and the curve site here has been issued a grading permit in anticipation of Industrial Development so a lot of activity in this area for new employment land and Industrial growth all in the city and again seen a lot of activity and things are moving pretty um just really briefly the background on the studies and plans that we've done focusing on Ice Age drive now first the tea concept plan showed a collector status road on the north side of tax lot 600 Sherwood Commerce Center coming through straight through the property line on the North side and then eventually coming down here we did a refinement plan what we call the implementation plan in 2015 and you can see the sort of intersection has been revised and that's where it will go with the Ice Age Drive alignment study and then the implementation plan really picked up on a lot of the constraints that are here in this sort of central tonkan employment area and so the road alignment ran parallel dropped down and ran parallel to the BPA easement that is here and so you'll see when we get into the plans that's more or less what is proposed so 90 degree intersection with Oregon Street running along the property line and then dropping down to run parallel to the BPA easement is what was shown in the implementation plan and I'm going to switch gear slightly here and talk about the Ice Age Drive feasibility study which is really a city project not something that the applicant is involved in in any type of detail so the city very interested in moving forward our employment land here in the city and a key part of that is Ice Age drive and so we're moving pretty quickly to do a feasibility study the next formal step that we have is to go to City Council I'm sorry the Ura board in February and have them actually adopt a resolution for the preferred alignment of Ice Age drive and we have a really awesome consultant on this Kittleson and Associates who's done a lot of really good analysis they're looking at cost benefit analysis timing geologic constraints all sorts of different factors to determine the best alignment and and what it's showing right now is this line here kind of blue and these all kind of overlap but it's roughly here and then the most southern alignment here is what is likely to be adopted by the Ura board as the preferred alignment so dropping all the way down here you can see the East-West road that is being reviewed right now and that would come up through here and make a new intersection with Ice Age drive and City supportive of this is going to allow additional circulation you know get these properties here Oregon Street Business Park phase two Commerce Center and kerr all able to get out to Ice Age drive without going to Oregon Street so it'll be a nice circulation plan once it's all completed and then just uh showing highlighting the actual alignment without all the other ones um here dropping down again the connection with this local Street and then back to the Willamette water supply uh portion of the road that's being constructed by them um and then getting into sort of the heart of what this application is about here are the two conditions B3 and B4 that are recommended for removal and and modification and they basically say that prior to final site plan approval and approval of the engineering plans the applicant shall obtain written approval from Kinder Morgan for the horizontal alignment of Ice Age drive and any improvements and any on-site improvements within the easement and the same exact language just related to the BPA easement instead of Kinder Morgan and the reason we put those conditions on there as you can see this is uh Ice Age Drive shown in Gray northeast corner of the site property line is here in red the Kinder Morgan existing Kinder Morgan line is shown in Orange and then the BPA easement here in blue and you know the agency Kinder Morgan they're really not willing to provide a whole lot of comment at this point until until we either the city or the applicant goes through a formal process with them to actually show where the line will be relocated and go through a formal step with them for reimbursement and Etc so this is fundamentally a timing issue where you know we're not able to get approval from Kinder Morgan before the applicant is you know really ready to move forward I think had we had the Ice Age Drive study done two years ago or three years ago you know we probably would have resolved this issue had this issue resolved with Kinder Morgan and the applicant could just move forward pretty quickly with their site plan because the applicant you know was moving forward pretty quickly the alignment was shown the alignment for Ice Age Drive was shown over the gas line which you know based on the concept plan you know that's likely where it should go the alternative to putting it putting the road over the easement would be to bring it all the way you know down here and then cross at a 90 degrees and that would really lessen the impact to the Kinder Morgan line probably much less of a review no relocation of the and so given the fact that the city is moving really aggressively on the Ice Age Drive alignment study there are other locations that the Kinder Morgan line is going to be relocated the city is really you know positioned to just work with Kinder Morgan and get this resolved and so we're willing to I think the main thing that we don't want to do is hold up occupancy of Commerce Center phase one base based on you know a delay with Kinder Morgan and the road alignment so I'll get to it in a second in terms of you know what we're thinking about revised conditions but that's that's really the the Crux of this is that a party needs to go through this process with Kinder Morgan and um we're confident that the line can be relocated it would be relocated based on this diagram the existing line is shown in yellow and the relocated easement is shown and lines shown in Orange and so it'd be run along the north side of the road get it away from the applicant's property here and you can see how you know even off-site the line is going to be relocated and so instead of having us go through a process and the applicant go through a process the city's just able to do this all together and free up the applicant to move forward um what because we're not able to get assurances from Kinder Morgan about really the the main thing is what potentially would be allowed over that 20-foot relocated gas line so what we're looking at is a um you know they're in their comments they want uh exclusive easement in kind they're saying there's a easement agreement right now we're going to relocate it to the North side but they're not willing to say and sure you",

        "text": " you have made have fed into that conversation and the final piece and one of the most challenging and I think a place where this board has not had an opportunity to have a conversation with me or with each other is around the industrial lands needs the port did present on this and they're still in the process of finalizing the report that's kind of looking at all of the potential sites that are out there but what has been um by the federal government is that large Lots just aren't possible in Oregon and therefore it seems really doubtful that we would be a good investment for a tips Hub and we know that that's not accurate but we have to address that image um and so the the reason why there is this robust look at where it is possible to create large lots of industrial lands that are set aside is that we don't how our land use system has really set up how we do these sorts of things and we don't set our industrial land standards to a particular type of industry or a lot size as we look at what our goals um what is the opportunities that are there and let's you know size our land for the next 20 years as opposed to necessarily holding on to and preserving really large lots for a potential big so what is happening right now is there is an ongoing conversation about the potential for supersiting which is never a comfortable word for local government because that means we are not in control of that process and um it means that it is not necessarily our decision about where we can put the infrastructure or how we want to do the infrastructure that leads that supersiting conversation or that that conversation when it comes to citing all of this is to say that there are ongoing negotiations to see if there is a way to not upend the land use system but also perhaps temporarily or on a very restricted scale come up with the ability to identify some potential large Lots that are within the areas where the industry that is affected by a chip so the semiconductor industry develop a large education Advanced manufacturing sort of look at having those lots available so that we can make them development ready fairly quickly so there's conversation about and this is the part where Washington county is most implicated cracking those rural reserves as part of the supersiting process which doesn't necessarily sit well with everyone that's at that table therefore the conversation is ongoing so but we don't know exactly what that's going to look like and I think one of the things that the legislature is turning to me and their through me to you to ask is where is Washington County comfortable in that um and you know from some of the conversations we've had there are obviously needs to not make us these urban service provider um to make sure that all utility providers and service providers like clean water services our land use and transportation folks are consulted early consulted often and have the resources to provide things but there is a bigger question around are we overall what helps us become more comfortable that the state isn't just going to leave us holding a bag of land that then either gets misused um can't be brought together to create one large parcel is held by a developer who then cracks it back apart and doesn't reserve it for semiconductors these are all the thought processes that are going on now so part of the reason why the chair and I thought it would be good for you to have this conversation now that I've set you up for it is to talk through where our levels of comfort are and what those boundaries and needs are but the other question that I have for you is what further information do you need because I don't expect you to come up with answers today because I've given you no more than this introduction um because my plan is to come back when we come back at the December January now the January 17th work session with the government relations team to actually have a finalized kind of this is the directions we want to provide you so with all of that I'm happy to answer or questions but then leave it to you to have your conversation about what you need as a board I I just have a clarifying question and that is uh would you give me more information around what happens in supersiting who does lead the conversation how how does that go because I'm not sure I I don't think I can answer that um it depends upon how we write um the legislation but usually what happens is the state legislature grants someone with the authority to say This Land Is Now designated as I'm having trouble understanding who that someone that would be part of sometimes they've put it to an agency my likely guess in this instance which is just rumor mongering at this point is probably it would sit with the governor um to do this and they would be you know so the governor would be the one that would be making these decisions on behalf of the state but it basically it's super exciting because it supersedes our authorities yeah and I understand that part of State yeah but I'm just trying to think about yeah so if we were in that situation what you know who would we be beholden too yeah and it would be the state in some and I recognize it's not the situation we want to be in by the so I get that um so to summarize uh Aaron is looking for a little bit more input leveraging our prior conversation uh that we had and I can't remember what month around the with the port of Portland reps and the semiconductor task force topic uh knowing what we know now trying to get a little bit more feedback about what the board might be comfortable with and it's just it's a discussion it's not Direction it's not a uh also she's asking what further information might each one of us as five but also as the sixth uh as a work group might benefit from being mindful that the topic is coming back up January 17th if I could just start some the art conversation I have two things uh one is uh we have a governor and we have a governor-elect the governor is sworn in on what date that governor-elect has sworn in on what date January 19th January 9th thank you okay remember what today is okay so um I assume that there will be a rock hand off from the current governor to the governor-elect for all of this so uh so that we've got at least some level of fluctuating consistency so thank you for the answer to that um then the other thing that I want to mention and this is for the purposes of getting something off my chest that might be related and my of the experience may be a little bit it's been years so I I doubt my own memory often um but this is around the urban Reserve in the Sherwood area around Edie Road and Roy Rogers Road and which is in your District uh when uh the core 4 and leading into core four Tom Bryan and I were meeting with the various cities of District three and forcing them to make some hard choices they couldn't have everything in order for us as corpore members to do our job to take recommendations to our four we had expected and the Metro Council had expected that that area would be targeted for Industrial and Commercial and the Sherwood city council my memory of it chose to go a slightly different route and has gone through Community planning with more neighborhoods then industrial and Urban commercial my so I just needed to express that I don't know if you heard commissioner Rogers say that's true because it's a big flat area that sure every piece of large area has challenges with Transportation infrastructure and and sewer and water I just needed to express that um much like um we were talking about how yes Intel is a large semiconductor manufacturer in Washington County but they're not the only one right Analog Devices is expanding we've got it's not Matrix out in Forest Grove yeah I can't remember it's over near and then lamb research it which is expanding outside of Tualatin into Sherwood so those are just three that whenever I hear semiconductor manufacturing I go right to those three so uh those are just that's just uh some context I wanted to as the discussion starts so back to the what's your comfort level as we've been hearing about the State of Affairs oh I should I'll I'll start that um my patience is running a little thin in terms I've asked previously going back to our December 13th our staff provided information it's my understanding that our staff provided information to the semiconductor task force and it was mentioned in the Friday facts of December 9th I ask that we be presented provided with the benefit of that on Tuesday December 13th and here we sit January 5th I have not received anything you've not received anything and you're referring to what the staff provided to exactly okay yeah exactly I want us to have the benefit of that in a timely fashion staff is doing their job don't forget about us I feel forgotten which is a very uncomfortable place for me to feel what was the communication to clarify what that meeting was if um and again I did take a vacation so a lot of things just flushed out of my brain um but in in just there were two meetings of a subcommittee of technical folks that met um conversations and Analysis of the lands that were up for consideration I don't know what our input was I was not at that meeting group was um uh Lut and or Matt and I think that they've been trying to organize their notes is where we're at on that conversation to make sure that you do have the information but I do think the holidays did interfere with some of the responsiveness there Friday December 9th Friday facts thank you in what way are you comfortable in what way do you want to see this continue to be explored and what further information might you need well I've had a lot of conversations with others city of Hillsborough and then of course they're people that have been in this game for quite some time since we had the grand land bargain what was that 2015 conceptually I think if we don't do something like this we send a pretty negative message to our existing um private sector investors in in Washington County and all around the region um so I think we have to do this I I'm I really liked what we had done back in the uh defining the 50-year urban growth boundary I mean you talk about a million dollars that you put out there from Metro Catherine I would imagine many jurisdictions spent well over a million dollars individually and then corporately coming together so it was a huge task",

        "text": " on farmland a what we call a full degree exception uh will likely be required um as i mentioned before the memorial county board of commissioners has been appointed as a special special advisory group for this project um and uh we will be working with them to determine what exactly the criteria and global ordinances that apply i won't go through the entire process in detail but i did just want to point out that we are at the very beginning of this process now so we've received the notice of intent uh and we are currently coordinating with our reviewing agencies and we're collecting and reviewing all public say the speed times but we're accepting public comments until august 5th so we have another week if you want to provide anything in writing once we have received all the comments and we've gotten all the information we need from our sister agencies we will write the project order um which will set out the full study requirements and legal requirements for the and then the application is really the the the full piece of evidence that contains kind of all the in-depth analyses that we need to make our determinations of compliance with the uh the or make our recommendations on the terminations of compliance with the standards and then we will do that in a draft proposed order and in that we will either recommend that the approve or deny the application we will have another round of public comments and agency coordination at that um it is important to note that if there are concerns about the project or the department's review there will be public periods on the draft proposed order and at that time uh any interested member of the public who wishes to uh be able to request administrative review of that project does need to participate in those periods either personal writing to maintain their standing uh to to participate in what's called the contested case so after that process is done we'll issue a proposed order and then have that and that's the case the contestant case is typically run by in independent syrian officer that could be a council member it could be staff but typically it's an administrative law judge from the oregon office of administrative hearings once that process is concluded uh we will issue the final order and assuming that the project is approved the final order would be accompanied by a site certificate i think i covered this but like i said this isn't something that we do in isolation we are working with uh the reviewing agency and the special advisory groups uh to get comments on both the proposed bills the proposed facility uh any studies that should be conducted to identify potential impacts statutes administrative rules and applicable substantive local criteria that may be applicable and then any permits that fall within the council's that should be part of the citing review i just wanted to take a moment to talk about this slide um as people in the local community often wonder what is the schedule for this project so this is a seven step process and it normally takes once we get a preliminary application at least a year to get through the process and more likely two to five years depending on the controversy so just to give you an idea of what this shed on this process now means okay so uh to kind of conclude my part of this presentation just uh like i said um there is an opportunity to comment on the notice of intent we welcome any written comments uh on the kind of items i just just issued so like i said again resources that might be impacted the appropriateness of the study areas or if there's a particular area that you think could be impacted that you think you should look at um and also uh you know to the extent that you can if there are a lot of things that you believe should be reviewed for compliance um that commentary will close next friday august 5th um we will be accepting oral comments today during the question and answer session so they don't have to be just questions you can make comments as well and then as i said at the beginning office we say again this is not a public hearing so um again your participation is not required today to establish standing in the contested case but um we certainly still welcome an e-commerce um in addition to providing comments uh in writing through email or regular mail i just want to highlight that we have a new uh online common the website is here but if you pick up we have a couple extra copies of our public notice that have this information on how to comment through the portal um so we encourage you to visit that and you can also find it on and then my information is up on the screen here i'm happy to give this to anybody afterwards as well um but if you have any questions or have any difficulty getting a comment and um you can feel free to email me at christopher.clark at energy.org um so with that i'll turn it over to the advocates um to go ahead and give your presentation and i'll go ahead and steer that's okay just tell me change the slide sure thank you uh all right well i'll start things off just wanted to say thanks for everyone who showed up here in person and uh councilman brian and other folks joining online so thank you guys for your time here and everyone's busy um we can jump to the next slide uh real quick agenda um so we'll kind of introduce the uh pioneer renewables uh my company and uh power and our relationship here try not to be too repetitive on touching some of the permitting process but and you know give our take on it and uh in a proper yoga video and it shouldn't take too long but we'll go ahead and jump in um yeah so we're based out of asheville north carolina um i have a couple offices in the southeast but um really have been working in uh on projects nationwide i've been roughly in 30 states or so specializing in developing and financing solar projects specifically really i think one asset can we bring to the table is a partnership with blue ridge power so they're the procurement and construction um company that we work with exclusively and um you know i think the nice part about that is that this project is you know in our hands from from start here to to finish all the way through the construction um so that's one really nice piece um kind of our resume so we have uh over 100 operating solar farms across the nation and making roughly one good lot of energy um but have 15 gigawatts in in development um and that includes uh 17 projects here in oregon hall um much smaller than this one but uh nonetheless you know what we're happy to be back in ordering and developing here so um next two slides are just a couple of pictures of of those sites that have been completed for um roughly two three years now um and just so you know sort of what the vegetation looks like underneath and whatnot we need to get kill next one for the next slide um so jeff fox with galvin power i'm the vp of land and community affairs we are a small development company located in bozeman montana um and uh we're relatively new company uh and we were the original developers uh behind this project um and being relatively small we knew we wanted to bring out a partner i they were kind enough to work with us on this project and i think it's a good um even though we're small we have a lot of experience uh we've worked on the development of over 13 gigawatts of power between the numbers uh at gallatin power um yeah just happy to be here in maryland county uh i have the opportunity to develop this project and bring your world-class solar energy facility to moroccan what's our goal next slide yeah so i'll just talk a little bit about the layout of the project there's some good maps back there as well that department of energy was kind enough to print for this meeting that are helpful but the project area consists of 10 900 acres uh that we have identified and are working with landowners on uh not all of that will be developed necessarily but a large chunk of it definitely will be it's maybe go ahead and flip through the next slide um there it is kind of in reference and maybe one more i just want to get to this one because as you can see almost all the land is in cultivation it's it's all in pretty much all of driving wheat farming what i'll say about it um oh the other thing i wanted to mention is just that it is bisected uh by the proposed and permitted i believe foreign way uh transmission project which runs east to west along the southern end of the project area and it cuts north uh south to north through the western portion of the um so just to give you some reference yeah and different that that project is still under a review oh i'm sorry but that's okay yeah um and there is a good map in the back on the left-hand side that kind of shows i have those this project is unaffiliated with that one yeah although it's it will be cutting through the project so this is just a bit of an overview of you know what what we've done so far um noticeable it was submitted um back in may and obviously having this meeting today um and hoping to pull together the uh application in early 2023 um hopefully q1 and and get that submitted for overview so um you know right now we have several uh surveys uh and studies underway well they're all kind of named up there uh one of the biggest ones the natural cultural resources study that's been taking place for a month or two now probably has about a month to go uh and that's sort of our our last study that we've been taking complete here uh will be completed in september 2020 but this is just some of the other diligence uh we're completing the project and uh definitional student is currently next slide um so energy period uh interconnection this is where we'll actually interconnect with the larger grid um so we're being studied for interconnection with both the umatilla electric cooperative which is where the project will actually interconnect with and with the bonneville power administration where um attila electric's uh transmission system will take us to a substation that also serves so we're being studied for interconnection there so that we can theoretically deliver anywhere in bonneville's service territory the facility will interconnect at the northern most uh northern and then westernmost portion of the project and it will interconnect to an existing umatilla electric uh 230 kv transmission line actually the line all the towers are",

        "text": " that the council adopt a new standard that requires the applicant adequately characterize wildfire risk within the analysis area um using current data from reputable the particular criteria that need to go into that analysis are based on the proposed puc criteria we're recommending that the council require a finding that the facility is not likely to result in a significant in wildfire risk at the site taking into an account both the probability and consequences of wildfire and then finally we're recommending that if the analysis area includes areas subject to heightened risk of wildfire otherwise high fire consequence areas that the proposed facility will operate in compliance with the wildfire mitigation plan approved by the council um i'm going to go through the specific elements of these recommendations kind of one by one um but that is in broad strokes uh what is included in the draft rules that we've presented to you or that we've included uh in our staff report um attachment too so uh so the first thing we looked at was um whether or not this new standard should apply to the review of all new facilities um or just applications that are submitted on or after the effective date of the rules as we kind of discussed with the protected areas rulemaking in april uh or even before april i guess if the council were to adopt a new standard by default that would have put apply to any decision on a application for site certificate or request for amendment um that the council makes after that rule becomes effective but the council could to specify that that new standard will only apply to um projects that are uh you know before a certain prior in the process so some more we could include a a uh i guess a goal post saying that the standard will only apply to projects that have not yet been determined to be complete as of the affected data of the rules we are recommending due to the public nature of these rules that the council not include a goal post and that the apply this rule to any decision that you make after you would adopt permanent rules um that would affect a few projects that are currently under review and uh based on your previous decision we anticipate there's some discussion there so um i'd like to maybe get your just preliminary input on um whether or not you would like to include goalposting language in this particular rule or not and uh if you do i do have some example draft language that we can look at thank you chris anyone have any comments on this yet um this is cindy sorry um and i for one um do not want any goalpost language so it just significant issue and not getting not getting less important getting more important so thank you this is hanley um it's always difficult to try and apply new rules retroactively and um i generally don't support that i do understand that this is a significant issue and so i kind of wrestle with whether or not i would generally come down on the side there being a goal post requirement jordan you have anything kent no for jordan kent's pondering i'll just say for myself while they can't thanks um i generally agree with hanley but this idea because of the fire it's not getting any i when you have utilities hiring meteorologists um pretty regularly trying to predict and look at i i think it's a serious issue and i think the other aspect of it is how do you tell a community basically that you know we thought you were going to be okay deal with it so i guess my question is the language that you had showed on a previous slide that said you know i think it's right there actually showing of a clear significant threat and we then we still got to define that but i i know there's just an area where they're going to be prone to public safety power shutoffs and what that looks like anyway i i feel like it's something that needs to be addressed we heard a lot about it when we did our b2h tour and um i think the public's very concerned well this is camp and i am also generally supportive of a goal post rule but in this instance i think alternative one uh is one that is appropriate with the life safety health hazards uh involved with the fires we're experiencing now how's that for you chris excellent that's good and i'm hearing i mix mixed uh conversation uh with most people learning leaning maybe towards no goal and uh i just i think it would be worth maybe revisiting this at the end of the conversation before you make your final decision and then you can decide uh finally there um i also want to make one other comment just that um with regards to retroactive applicability i just want to be be careful to clarify if you adopt a standard uh it wouldn't apply to past council decisions um unless you do go through that uh showing of significant risk or significant threats of public health and um so i i understand completely i think councilmember jenkins was saying but i just wanted to make sure that was very clear for the record that um you know as far as retroactivity is concerned um this wouldn't go back in time to previous decisions um yeah this is uh sorry um chris quick question um can you tell me how um uh extensions would be treated so i've got an application certificate and now there's an extension could you explain how that might be council member conning yes uh so when there is a facility that's approved and then they do not begin construction before uh the construction commencement deadline established another site certificate uh they need to come in for a request to extend a risk request for amendment to extend those construction deadlines and when they do basically requires the council to consider any changes in fact or law that have occurred since the site certificate was approved uh if we were adopted to a new standard that would be a change in uh law essentially and the council uh would be applying the new standard to the review of that application for uh or sorry request for so um yeah in the event of a timeline extension um the council would need to avoid the standard as as it's proposed thank you okay um well i i guess we can table this discussion um till the end i will try to remember to revisit it but i'll move on um so the second kind of question about just the general construction of the standard is what types of energy facilities you want the standard to apply to as i mentioned the puc rules only apply to electric utilities uh and those utilities electric generation and transmission assets um but the council and the puc um have jurisdiction over different types of energy facilities as well so um but specifically the council has jurisdiction over uh so the high voltage transmission lines uh and electropower generation plants as we've discussed um but also natural gas pipelines and storage facilities and then certain fuel pipelines and fuel production facilities uh so you could decide um to just have the standard be a general standard of applicability to any sort of proposed energy facilities that come before you or you could limit the scope to just certain types as examples we've stated here that you could say it's just to propose power generation facilities uh in their related and supporting facilities which would include associated transmission lines um we left out jurisdictional transmission lines just from this specific example because those would already typically be regulated by the puc's rules on the other hand since transmission lines really are the primary ignition for electric infrastructure related you could make this specific to transmission lines and that would include you know both a jurisdictional transmission line and any associated gentile line or interconnection line that is a related and supporting facility to a project we're recommending that this has become a general standard uh in division 22 and then it would apply to all types of energy facilities and i can lots of head nodding in this room great so madam chair madam chair this is so christopher what this really does is it makes the applicant prepare a wildfire protection plan is that correct and identify implementation mechanisms councilmember jenkins yes when the were to submit their noi we would want a general just characterization of wildfire risks at the site and then in their application we would want them to provide a more uh analysis of the wildfire risk at the site and and within a study area and i'll get into the specific criteria um but that analysis is the core component of the current puc wildfire protection plan um if they if they conducted that analysis and uh they found that there were there was a high risk of wildfire at the site or if a wildfire were to start at the site there would be a likelihood of high um our rule has structured that then they would have to require the the formal plan which includes all their proposed prevention and mitigation and this rule could easily be structured in any in an opposite way where we would just say rather than going through this uh kind of conditional like if there's a high risk then you have to have a plan we could just say you have to have a plan for all energy facilities um but that's not how we've we how we've written it thank you so the third uh issue we have is is about exactly what i was talking about the the analysis for wildfire risk um we haven't recommended that the council you know establish really specific criteria or specific methods but we have incorporated uh or adapted methods from the puc rules that includes that the analysis must include a characterization of baseline fire risk which is kind of the characteristics of the site um and things that are uh expected to remain stable over several we would be then asking them to tell us about the seasonal wildfire risks which kind of describes rainfall patterns at the site uh the retention of soil and fuel moisture you know winds things like that that kind of say uh in a typical year you know this this site has bad fire risk every summer or every fall the puc rules say uh that once we characterize the the sort of wildfire hazard we look at the wildfire risks and those puc rules say uh that the risks need to identify residential areas and uh subs in critical infrastructure including substations and power lines um and we've taken a slightly different tack on that which i will explain in a second uh but i did kind of want to look at this um so i will just say we've recommended a slightly more expansive characterization of risk and one that incorporates uh potential impacts to other resources protected by cancer standards that would include things like agriculture um wildfire wildlife habitat and cultural resources as well as just residences the puc rules are rightfully for their purposes focused on risk the public health and safety and really identifying areas where there might need to be a power shutoff to",

        "text": " all of that in and attract changes Redline format into a proposed order and so the proposed order is the document that reflects everything that's happening during you know these next couple days in the comment period and then when we issue the proposed order we'll issue a notice of an opportunity to request a contested case and that will have details about the items that um an individual must include um in its request for contested case to which then it goes to council um so and so when council is looking at those requests for contested case this is the questions that council is asking itself and it's um and this is this is um from the rule it says Council must find that the request raises a significant issue of fact or not or law that's reasonably likely to affect the council's determination of whether the facility With The Changes proposed by the amendment meets the applicable laws and Council standards um and this is kind of going back to that scope of scope of council's reviews what we're looking at is the council must determine whether the preponderance of evidence on the record supports that the portions of the facility meet the council standards or rules um uh secretary Cornett and our communication team have put together a nice short 10-minute PowerPoint presentation going through um the contested case process for an amendment and and how to request a contested case And discussing these thresholds it's available on it's a link to it as in the notice and then it's also available on our web page so if Council does receive requests for contested case the options for counsel um are to hold a contested case on properly raised issues kind of going back that meet those criteria before um Council can also remand the proposed order back to us the department um and um with Direction about how to address um the issues raised in the you know petition for the contested case or Council can deny the request for contested case next slide please and which I believe and so Vice chair how it's going to go through you're going to hear some of the same things that I said but it's um it's important it's part of the presiding officer but we are now moving into the hearing portion thank you I'm going to it's tardy weather not very loud there the public hearing for the b2h transmission line request for site certificate Amendment one is now open the purpose of tonight's public hearing is to provide an opportunity for the public reviewing agencies Council and the certificate holder if they wish to do so to present oral and written testimony on the amendment request and the Department's draft proposed order the 34-day public hearing comment period on the draft proposed order is scheduled to close at the conclusion of the hearing tomorrow night in Pendleton next slide please at the conclusion of the presentation I will call on each person interested in providing oral testimony starting with a certificate holder then people in person then on the webinar then on the phone tonight's hearing is being recorded the presentation's written comments in oral testimony are part of the decision record for the amendment request for the next slide please pursuant to Oar 345-027-0367 sub 5 A and B please note the following a person who intends to raise any issue that may be the basis for a contested case must raise the issue in person at the hearing or in writing a written comment submitted to the Department of energy before the July 18 2023 deadline and with sufficient specificity to afford the council the department of energy and the certificate holder an adequate opportunity to respond including a statement of facts that support the person's position on the issue in the type a review amendment process to justify a contested case issues must be determined by the energy facility citing Council to raise a significant issue of fact or law that is reasonably likely to affect Council determination of compliance with an applicable next slide to raise an issue in a contested case preceding the issue must be within the council's jurisdiction raised in writing or in person prior to the close of the close of the record of the public comment period July 18 2023 raised with sufficient specificity to afford the Council of the Department of energy and the certificate holder an adequate opportunity to respond to raise an issue with sufficient specificity a person must present facts that support the person's position on the issue next slide for any individuals wishing to provide testimony during tonight's hearing for the record please include the following with your testimony full name of spelling physical mail or email address next slide so is a certificate holder here tonight and do they wish to provide testimony okay and I guess they wouldn't be remote for the record Todd cornet um the certificate holder is in the audience just not intending to provide comment at this point in time okay thank you uh public testimony are there any individuals in the room that wish to provide public testimony please remember to fill out a registration card available on the table and submit to Sarah esterson and I have one that she's brought me and Irene Gilbert has signed up so Irene ready for your testimony um anyway I wanted to comment on just a couple General things before I get into my actual uh comment regarding testimony um my name is Irene Gilbert g-i-l-b-e-r-t and I'm here as the representative of of stop Borden into Hemingway The non-profit also I'm here appearing as a person representing the public interest as I did in the initial site certificate and also as representing myself as an individual um one comment just starting out is when the um when the council members asked for specificity it's really difficult to provide some specific examples of some of the issues when the maps don't provide enough details so that you can really tell what's going on I mean when Council rules require things like setbacks and and that sort of thing the maps that are provided uh you zoom in on them and you just get a bigger picture of something that doesn't have any details and and with the technology that's now available I would think that it would be possible to have the maps allow you to zoom in and actually see the details of where these different changes are occurring certainly with things like Road it's really important to be able to see where those roads actually are appearing the um one other thing is I'm concerned about the stated scope of the comments as it relates to changes in the site certificate conditions the it was noted that the changes or the the application the requester amendment one was basically limited to commenting on the area that's changed with the amendment but according to the rules I believe it's rule number three in the ones that Kellen was going over it says that when there is a change in the site certificate condition the public has the opportunity to comment based on the impacts to the entire facility so I am concerned that people may believe that they had to be focused on just the area of the new amendment when in fact the rules allow them to comment just generally and for one example would be the fire fire plan because of it being a change to the site certificate condition the public has allowed full access to the in to comment on the entire facility and the impacts of the entire facility so I'm not sure how to deal with that I kind of feel that people ought to have an opportunity to perhaps send in comments and writing after the close tomorrow if they weren't aware and they I don't know how they would be aware if they weren't reading the specific rules because it does not State the difference in the notice to the public I'll leave that to you folks to discuss so uh getting into my comments here as you know I have had a lot of angst about the treatment of Timber and grazing zones and the combined zones and and whether or not the site certificates are allowing for protection of those areas and actually I had hoped to get that before The Supreme Court but because I'm an idiot I uh I didn't get it in timely so but what I want to talk about now is Forest Practices Act and many of the issues that caused me concern regarding the Union County um failing to provide protection for Forest lands actually are covered under this Forest Practices Act and I know that uh council member Devlin could no doubt give you a much better statement about the sort of the politics of the current Forest Practices Act and I don't know maybe some of the rest of you also are involved but just briefly um the language of the forest Practices Act was adopted October 26 2022 and it implemented Senate bills 1501 1502 and House Bill 4055 and the private Forest Accord report dated February 2nd 2022. the um so this act is in the rules it is officially in the rules and there are some implementation dates all of them have passed with the exception of the last piece is going to be implemented January 1st 2024 so um it's five months from now the um the issue is um you know the the governor was very concerned about the fact that there were some the public was going to have initiative an initiative process to get some of these issues on before the public for a vote and so she I'm talking about Governor Brown here pulled together a whole bunch of people from from Timber and you know resources and Wildlife and and they came up with this agreement to avoid uh having the initiative process um so I wanted to go through some of the requirements of this because the forest Practices Act applies to every force in this state and I'm not going to read the rule numbers to you but I will include them when I send this in in writing prior to your deadline um tomorrow afternoon and many of the requirements of this rule apply to this amendment they also apply to every site certificate every development that's being done that's going to in any way uh involve the removal of trees so uh but I like about this rule is it provides very specific requirements for all Forest activities that involve the removal of Kimber and the definitions and the requirements are very clearly laid out in the statute and the rules and I just wanted to kind of go over what some of those are again I'll include the reference numbers when I send this in but Forest land is defined as land which is used for growing and harvesting of tree species and it says regardless of how the land is zoned or taxed or how any state or local statutes ordinance rules or regulations are applied so it basically trumps anything as far as other agencies and their decisions about dealing with Forest land and removing Timber and it also defines forceland it says any Forest land capable of annual wood",

        "text": "all right without further Ado um thank you so much to all of you for being here for what is our second webinar for the county energy resilience grant program my name is Hannah satin and I am the county energy resilience program coordinator and my co-presenter today is Maxwell woods and I'm going to let Max introduce himself well thanks Hannah um and hi everybody thanks for joining us my name is Max Woods uh I am an assistant director at the Oregon Department of energy and responsible for nuclear safety and energy security and emergency preparedness related to energy issues uh and the county grant program that we're here to talk about so thanks yes excellent yes so we'll be talking about the county energy resilience grant program today um before we get going I would like to do some introductions so we have a couple other Pho uh staff members on the call um Alice Weston is our rural energy coordinator um you might have chatted with Alice about this program if you're in Central Oregon or other Odo opportunities um but a great connection to make um as well as Lauren Rosenstein she's our community equity and inclusion analyst um really happy to have these folks on the call and either Alice or Lauren if you could help um watch the chat as we're going I think Sarah's is not with us yet so just yeah awesome thank you so much um I would love to take this opportunity to see who we have in the room with us right now so if you're comfortable if you could drop your name and your organizational affiliation in the chat um we'd love to see who we have with us thanks so much excellent I love seeing who's with us in the room um and also just one other ask if you're comfortable if you can add your organizational affiliation to your name and your teams window or share it when you come on to ask a question um just helpful context for us um so our presentation today will be about 25 minutes and then we'll save um slightly more than half for our question and answer session we will hold to the hour today um but uh we are available I'm available as a resource at any point for further questions and answers we can do phone email chat um it all works um let's see I'm trying to oh if you have a question while we're presenting um if you can drop that in the chat or use the raiseed hand function that would be really great um Lauren will be helping manage that for us um and then if you have a more substantive question we just ask that you hold that until um till our question and answer session so we can kind of dig in into the more um substantive ones then all right so I am going to move on to our first slide and pass it over to Max all right well thanks Hannah um so before we kind of dive into the program details we thought it would be helpful to give a just a little background on who the Oregon Department of energy is who we are what we do uh this is sort of a standard slide we put in most of our presentations just so folks understand and uh the work that we do uh we're a small state agency about 120 uh FTE at this point um which makes us pretty small on the state agency scale um you can kind of see there our mission and what we do um all the various uh programs and and tasks and activities that we run uh kind of fall under this um I won't Bel labor this point but that's that's who we are Hannah why don't you go to the next slide please okay so here we we have a definition energy resilience in Oregon sort of setting the stage sort of the big picture thing um and so before we kind of dive in again I thought we would maybe take a minute here to to really think about the broader context of energy issues energy resilience um in the State uh and and kind of think about how the grant program fits into those um those broader issues so just as a very starting point the the program is funded by the Oregan legislature the authorizing statute which is um HP 3630 from uh 2023 legislative session uh sort of is is the is the the grounding of what this program is all about where the funding comes from and a lot of the details are in that piece of legislation but one thing that's not in that legislation is a specific definition of energy resilience so we have a good working definition that we use around Odo and in state government and it's sort of there on the screen um but your county can certainly choose a different definition to guide your energy resilience plan development uh if you choose you can sort of use this model you know really even need aition but we think it's a good idea to come up with the starting place and sort of a guiding definition is helpful uh when I work on various programs and projects to make sure that we're sort of coming back to the the true intention of what we're trying to do here um we also have a little cutout here about the Oregon energy security plan that's a cover page from our 2023 plan um our agency and my division is working on a 2024 plan uh the energy security plan for the State uh and sort of as we look at risks and threats to Oregon system on our Statewide um Statewide plan we look at natural hazards primarily but there's other things too we look at cyber security physical security risks uh even the covid pandemic was a impact to energy issues uh in some ways um so however you look at sort of what that that shock means what that impacts to your energy system and then how an energy system can be resilient to either maybe consider like deflecting that shock sort of a shield or how quickly you can bounce back and restore door Energy Services to your communities sort of that's the the consideration around resilience and the plan that we hope you all jump into and take the money and and and put together um will include a lot of that information specific for your counties okay why we go to the next slide here I think there's one more with even more specific definition around Community energy resilience so what does that mean well kind of the same concept as energy resilience and then just brings a a community Centric idea into it uh and so you can sort of see this little graphic here um and and really sort of thinking about a community and and and government service not being a utility not being a private Energy company not being a private fuel company or electric provider natural gas company what's the role of government well the role of government in many ways is to to help put all the pieces together to help focus on public service to help uh communities that need help in the event of a power loss or a shortage of of energy in some ways and to try to help um as I see it try to help the energy companies pull the pieces back together um provide service um back to whether it's the state or the county or your local community um sort of other ways to look at sort of mitigation measures for uh how to reduce that threat reduce that impact reduce the severity of it all an example here is a is a micro grid sort of a common Concept in the energy planning World about how if there was a loss of grid power the little icon there on the screen has a break between the utility grid and the example micro grid um how else power could be provided to critical facilities typically micro grid being a small uh providing power to a small either facility and you can even see from the example here example micro grid there's a a little icon for a generator uh and then maybe some energy storage and um kind of depends on where that uh where that power might come from and then providing the service until the grid power can come back online so anyway those are just a little example of what a mitigation measure might look like at the local scale um I think with that uh sort of introduction and sort of setting the stage Hannah I'm going to pass it back over to you to dive into the program details excellent thank you so much Max yeah I think that's really helpful context for some broader energy resilience work on the state scale and then thinking about that coming down to our communities which is an important piece of that larger work and also a complement to it um so we're going to be talking about the county energy resilience grant program as Max said the legislation that this program was created out of is House Bill 3630 passed in the 2023 legislative session um in this program hopefully as you know uh provides up to $50,000 per Oregon County to develop an energy resilience plan and really the goal is to create that Community energy resilience that Max just defined for us um making sure those critical Public Service facilities have energy when there is a disruption to those larger Energy Systems and we're going to dive into um what that looks like and means a little bit more in a moment um in terms of eligibility for this program the program is open to all Oregon's 36 counties uh the only other eligibility requirement is that a county does not have an existing energy or energy resilience plan that meets the content requirements of House Bill 3630 which we will go over in a moment if your county is one of the counties that has an energy or energy resilience plan most likely you're going to be able to access uh this program and these funds to update that plan and meet the content requirements of House Bill 3630 um just give us a shout and we can have a conversation about that together um there is no match requirement for this program and it is a non-competitive program for counties our application window opened on May 22nd 2024 and will be open through February 28th 202 5 and our program deadline is August 1st 2025 so in terms of the plan requirements as Matt said um the requirements for plan content are stipulated in House Bill 3630 and we're going to go over each of them just so we can really be clear about what we're talking about when we're talking about the requirements for this plan content so the first one is that plans need to be based on and planned for short-term medium-term and long-term power outages these terms in term in terms of uh what they mean um they're not defined in the statute but our guidance for shortterm is hours medium-term is days and long-term is weeks you don't have to hold to",

        "text": " particularly the part about permanent storage the required rule and may ensure that there's concerns are addressed in future proceedings obviously you all won't always be the ones making these decisions so if you do want additional criteria or information included you can include um i do have some rule potential language that i will pull up to implement this um so this would add a new section to the carbon dioxide admissions standard that would basically say well i'll read it for people that are on the phone and can't see this but um it would say that if the facility will rely on carbon capture sequestration and uh to satisfy the requirements of section one which is the non-emitting uh not emitting electricity standard um the council must find that the certificate has demonstrated that the structure systems components and monitoring programs for the capture sequestration disorder greenhouse gases that result in the generation of electricity at the facility are reasonably likely to result in the permanent sequestration of the emissions from the atmosphere so in some ways that it's more words saying kind of the same thing i think um but i do think it is more specific about what exactly um you've been looking for so i'll let the council you all decide whether or not you need just curious for that last from the generation of about 50 of the facility are reasonably likely to result in the permanent sequestration or in the in no the standard is no increases in greenhouse gas emissions to the is it sequestration that we're seeking or no emissions into the atmosphere and sequestration of the emissions from the atmosphere that the red language from from the or from the facility uh i i believe that the emissions so they're a gas and they have to be kept away from the gas in the atmosphere and that's why it's written that way that if there's something more clear i think they definitely uh be the council could definitely change this language if there's a more queer way to say that i i really appreciate that more and more clarity how that it's just that that last piece but that is jared and i think the language from the first sentence is because we're talking about storage sequential all those elements and they all have to be permanent and i appreciate the response to the comment to make it clear that we make findings that any form of isolating those emissions is indeed permanent so i think if we keep the language from the first sentence in the last sentence to address all three of those mechanisms that's the proper term it still is we still don't have much guidance on what that finding would look like but i think at this date we don't have much guidance on what that would look like it just says it's incumbent upon the council to make a finding that it's it's permanent it's a permanent solution so do you see what i'm saying i do um i know it's a lot of words yeah would it would it be would it accomplish what you're saying in the language that the council must find that the certificate holder has demonstrated that the structure systems components and monitoring programs uh at the facility are reasonably likely to result in the permanent faster sequestration and storage of greenhouse gas emission gases that result from one generation of electricity facility yeah i think that's cool is there i will get a little stage frightening oh yeah this is uh oir 345024 500 and it would be a new section too so likely to result in the permanent cash yeah i don't think you need the four thank you yeah thank you excellent uh thank you council members is everyone satisfied with this language okay um i will just remind you when you make your final decision just know that um to be specific but um just say that we are modifying the language uh as as i've said uh secretary burnett has captured this in the decision especially women okay um excellent so uh some smokers are being solved this time okay so the next comment uh it was from staff testimony and this will be a little um awkward because definitely provided our recommendations on the record of the public foundation so i don't want to advocate too much for uh any additional positions here um but so at your meeting in april uh the council did direct stats to obtain facility uh solely specific field test uh adjust the diastole conditions to make recommendations on the appropriate carbon dioxide standard revision um and use that field test data rather than the manual manufacturer's specifications which is what the proposed pools are based on specifically we use the manufacturer specifications for the configuration used at the dania beach clean energy center uh that's located in broward county and that that just came online in june we did attempt to get fuel test data uh both from uh uh florida power and light who's the owner and operator of dana beach clean energy center reached out to general general electric company which is the manufacturer and asked for validated test data from their test stand in savannah uh i believe and uh we also we not getting either those we also reached out to the tennessee valley authority and asked them to provide data for from the uh allen biocycle plan which was kind of uh second uh reference candidate um we were not able to obtain data from any of those uh places i think uh for dania beach uh we weren't able to really connect well with anybody from florida power and light uh general electric company said that they were working on that data but at the time of the record closing it just wasn't um we're hoping that will be published sometime soon but again that would be manufacturer's test data not specific data and the tva said that they were not able to release that data this is confidential we also reach out to the u.s synergy administration authority the dia um because they collect e-rate data from power plants but they said it was confidential and they learned reduced it we could submit freedom of information to probably the the tba or the eia if we really wanted to get this data i don't know if it would be released or not but we could we could go further in that process we could also continue working on this our recommendation is that because the statute doesn't seem to strictly field tested data and does appear to uh allow some flexibility in the council how the council determines what the net the rate of those facilities are and we do have i think reasonably reliable key rate data for the configuration used at dania beach um that that we think that that is that is usable and that the we would recommend in the council those were what what is included in the proposed rules um i will say in the alternative if the council wants to use field tested data um is not it is it is definitely possible that we could just pull these changes when this will maintain and then address this later in the future you're thinking so you do have options and it's really a matter of the council's preference anyone have any thoughts yeah madam chair this is hanley uh under ideal situation i i would tend um the actual testing information but i don't think we have that opportunity and so um the company's information is probably the best we can get for now and we'll go i recommend that we go with thank you we've got a three minute here in the room the best i can tell thank you so uh finally this is already i think somewhat established in the notice of proposal making it on the rocket elsewhere but because the statute does require an affirmative finding of this bringing it up again that we recommend that the council make a finding that increasing the monetary offset rate from 2.85 cents to 4.79 supported by incredible evidence that the cost of assets is economically achievable for various types of fossil fuel power plants um i did include that analysis in your staff report but i don't have a slide for it so if you wanted to schedule a way that i can pull that out um otherwise i'll just look for writing that standing variety of things power 285 and 1.2 okay yeah if there is a typo then that's the proposed rules are correct the council's statutory authority is no more than 50 percent so um we would sense investors in our thank you so uh also so in addition to resetting the rate for the base oil power plant um the rules say that the council can uh well will i guess reset the the standard for non-based load gas plants and base oil plants that use power augmentation technology uh to an equivalent rate as the big standard for baseball plants but to do that you need to make it finding that the change would be consistent with the the principles articulated in os um there's a bunch of them i've described in your staff report why we think that either they're consistent or would have no effect um and so we do generally think that that the change would be consistent with those principles um and again just need a council funding here but i'm happy to go into this in more detail if you'd like any questions comments on this is in here so um and then finally and this was where really the bulk of the comments was uh was that there were there were fairly mixed responses about how the council should burst the issue of what constitutes a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions uh at an existing fossil fuel power plant um i will say you know most people uh our proposal kind of restated the rules around incremental increases that are allowed in the site certificate without an amendment uh were not satisfactory and i think that is uh you know virtually uh something that we expected um so the range of what the recommendations were kind of varied uh some commenters a no net increase approach so effectively allowing uh changes at a facility that may uh increase you know heat rate if the overall emissions are still going down or some commenters supported further restrictions on incremental increases uh and specifically suggested that the current rule allowing for a 10 increase in fuel use without a without an amendment be stricken from from the rules i just i will point out that that rule was not open in this film making so on that recommendation uh we can't implement it now and also that provision is is incorporated into the most of the site certificates so there would actually probably be some amendments needed to get to to implement a change to remove that um so we're not we're not recommending that but we do want to point out that some volunteers thought that there should be uh further restrictions i think another flavor of this was that uh some actually wanted to see uh decreases in emissions with amendments consistent with the clean energy targets uh and particularly so that would apply merchant plants that are selling power out of state that might not be",

solar energy facility Oregon Trail solar facility uh obsidian solar uh Center Sunset solar project Oregon Trail solar facility Sunset I already I already have Sunset so I already have Sunset so West End project cardi Generating Station um has a 50 wat 50 megawatt solar facility that's been approved but but not under construction so I'm going to move on to other facilities department has three nuclear related facilities the Trojan independent spent uh fuel storage installation the ify and that facility is near Rainer uh we have two research reactors uh Reed and um Reed and Oregon State University OSU also under other facilities is a 51.2 megawatt steam generator and that's in the middle of a um paper mill and it's in Springfield Utility so that's all we have is the just the steam generator also we have one uh ethanol plant that produces 44 million gallons of ethanol each year um and it's located in the Borman Industrial Park Port of Moral Moral County the department has one operating 500 KV transmission line that's the Eugene De Medford transmission line it's a it's it's operating it's a 46 mile 500 KV KV transmission line between uh Pacific core um meteran Pacific core um met metering sorry Pacific core uh substation near Medford and then Pacific core Spencer switching Station South of so it's that that's the two meet up in end points chair Grail yes counc quick question how do you track amendments many of the things that have been constructed especially wind you know they're putting in new um blades and things how do you track those they would have presumably new conditions and would would addtion workload even though they've already been approved so usually when we do our kind of a um our first assessment of going on site to do um inspections um we you know we find the major conditions that we want to review or any other materials we want to review and if there's anything new like they're building something new then that's when that's kind of how we go out and check on it and make sure that's everything's going fine from that stage thank you secretary cornette yeah um for the record Todd cornette um thank you council member by it's a good question and it kind of the you know the answer varies we will get an approved facility and then prior to construction they may change that yeah um and if that happens that's sort of a almost a reset because we haven't really done anything yet so that's much easier than a project that has been approved has constructed is in operation and then they add a different component now we're seeing wind adding solar or wind adding because then you get the complexity of adding new construction new Operation new pre-construction new retirement conditions not all the old conditions directly apply so it you know going to the point that Sarah was making the amount of conditions the FTE the complexity an amendment can add a significant amount of complexity to a project in terms of the conditions and then how do those get integrated and and you know we could be dealing with construction and operation conditions on a facility in the same year so it's a good question and the answer is kind of it depends and some of it's easier and some of it is quite complicated thank you and and Tom as you look at those Amendment rules this might be something to Circle back on because it just seems we'll see more Amendments of existing projects at least since I've been on we've seen quite a few and then just quite simply we track it in a sheet yeah and then also the department has two battery battery energy storage uh systems um with already within already site cited um facilities and that would be Port uh Port Westward generating project there's a 4 to six wat megawatt or 4 to 6 megawatt uh B storage facility there um and then also Wheat Ridge renewable energy facility uh three 50 megawatt battery storage battery energy storage system as the in there as well so secretary brette yeah sorry just to make it painfully clear because there's potential legislation related to battery storage FC does not have jurisdiction over Standalone battery storage so Dwayne said it kind of quickly but I wanted to make sure it was clear these battery storage components are associated with a facility that is within the jurisdiction of the council so I just want to make sure because he characterized those as as just the battery storage but early on he explained that they were part of another facility so again I just wanted to make sure that that was very clear to people thank you council member Condon quick question to that does anybody have jurisdiction that's a very good question coun um not not to get too far into the weeds on that I think that's part of what the legislation is about is um in the short answer is yes and no um we believe you know that you know clearly you know the council has jurisdiction if a battery storage um component is part of an fsec jurisdictional facility if a battery storage facility is by itself that's going to depend on the Zone whether it's an urban or a rural Zone the rural zones in particular the exclusive Farm use Zone I think everybody believes that it is a utility facil necessary for a public service but it's not explicitly articulated that way so I think that's part of the the idea of the legislation is to make sure that it is sort of reflected that it is a use that is allowed um so I think that's going to be a continuing theme um in the near future um in terms of legislative updates to make sure that gets very clearly articulated you know where it's allowed how it's allowed we're just sort of at the beginning stages of that because you know it's it's a relatively it's not a new thing there is a battery storage a standalone battery storage facility owned built owned and operated by Portland General Electric in Salem so it's certainly not a brand new thing but I think the potential volume that we're going to see in the near future um is going to be a very different thing so there'll be be a lot more conversations about that so sorry I didn't mean to Sidetrack that but I just wanted to make sure because there's there's a lot of play um related to that issue right now you next slide okay okay so I am going to go over um a little bit about the scope of the subprograms of preconstruction construction and operation and then we'll hand it back to Dwayne to talk about the fun stuff so the first um step after a site certificate is issued uh for a certificate holder is to satisfy all preconstruction requirements or all those that apply to a phase if a developer has decided to develop a project in phases um the preconstruction step is incredibly challenging for many reasons a few um just to give you a a sense are that conditions and mitigation plans are technical they're detailed they're complicated it often necessitates a familiarity with the council's final order and even the record and um that is like Odo fex speak that is not everyone's speak so it is difficult for new individuals that are stepping into the process once that site certificate is issued and that's exactly what happens it's the permitting team is not the construction team is not the operations team sometimes there is a bridge depending on how the developer entity is set up and there's a lot of movement going around so we're not you know people that have been players with certificate holders that we deal with all the time like ni SAR and Aven grid are seeing a lot of turnover so um we're having to you know kind of retrain all the time of what this really means uh so that piece of there's new different people involved is is a challenge um and even for us I mean we hand it over to people that weren't involved in permitting and it's not easy I for that translation um and then you know many site certificates have an allowance to do preconstruction in phases uh to align with how it's actually built especially as projects are getting bigger and bigger they're not and we don't want them to we don't want a solar project to go out and grade and develop 4,000 acres in 3 months we want that to be spread out spread out the impact in across the board um but that means that preconstruction compliance happens in waves um and each time it might be varying degrees of adequacy and accuracy given what we believe the conditions require um fun only fun um so our typical forecasted cost for preconstruction for any site certificate is about 400 hours which is like 4 to 6 months of full-time work um and if there's more than one project at a preconstruction phase uh that four to six months becomes like eight months because you just can't handle the volume um things are spread out and we lose efficiency uh so typically um once we're preconstruction how it starts is that a certificate holder uh cont conts the department and lets us know ideally 6 to 12 months in advance of when they think they're going to mobilize uh we assign a staff as the point of contact UM and we have been setting up um monthly phone call check-ins if not inperson meetings with them to go through conditions conditioning requirements where they're at there's a lot of work that has to be ironed out at that phase it is um and we've built into the conditions like that the department has to approve so and that's not a checkbox approval it's we're approving something substantive that wasn't figured out in the permitting process uh so it's it's quite detailed and requires a lot of coordination um typically uh We've interwoven other agencies to help in that review approval ODFW is the obvious a lot of times the local government the special Advisory Group entity um and dogami are are standard agencies that we build into that process takes time um so just a couple of examples I have more listed on the slide then I'll go into but of conditions that we're evaluating at pre-construction compliance one of our favorite and applies to every developer is the the decommissioning bond and that condition if you're familiar I mean is typically a half a long makes sense to everyone right but it doesn't uh and so we where we the council would approve um the methods for estimating that decommissioning estimate and the unit costs and so really all that is supposed to happen at preconstruction is you can adjust the number of",

        "text": " what are the least cost ways to provide that energy and there are a variety of strategies out there to to do that building out the different Supply chains of the forms of energy that um that our economy is consuming and to get to a cleaner energy system in the future this might involve things like efficiency clean electricity electrification clean fuels carbon sequestration um it includes detailed electricity sector modeling so the electricity sector is is uh somewhat in contrast to other types of fuel something that that we have to model on a short time frame to be able to capture the operating constraints and the the challenges that that system faces and so we are uh modeling that at an early level um and looking at the integration of that with other energy Supply chains optimized fuel supply as we move forward in time we start to see an increasing integration or options for integration through things like the production of hydrogen for example um we're we're not trying to answer all the questions in the energy strategy with the modeling um but we are trying to provide Direction and a framework to understand tradeoffs between different Pathways policies and strategies um this is economy-wide modeling it's it's looking at all sectors and and the types of measures that we would take in those sectors and it it kind of is is complementary to the other planning work that is happening so what the utilities are doing with their irps what state agencies are doing um with planning for different sectors of the economy um what other organizations are doing where it is often much more detailed near-term modeling but this is providing that economy-wide framework that that gives contrast and tradeoffs between strategies in different parts of the economy um and can kind of act as as a a a centerpiece pulling everything together uh what does it not do um just to set the expectations going into these working groups of of what we can and can't do with this modeling um so we're not focused on one state or single utility service territory uh we are recognizing that Oregon is part of a larger electricity sector it's part of national fuels markets and potentially new markets for things like hydrogen D fuels uh new types of biofuels and so we are we are modeling that connection and that that role of Oregon as a piece of this these larger Energy Systems um we are not modeling liquid or gaseous fuels and electrification separately and so everything is interconnected together and we may see as we move forward the lines between traditionally siloed parts of the economy somewhat blurring because we start to use clean fuels that maybe have a a renewable or electrical component to their production um it's complementary to uh these other planning processes as as I mentioned it's not repl placing the detailed planning models that are happening at the utilities um in particular it's not a loss of load probability model so we're not carrying the 60 years of of very granular historical data to be able to do those kind of calculations um we have rules of thumb but it's it's complimentary to that detailed planning process at the utility it's also not a nodal production simulation so uh we are we are running zonal pipe flow on on our transmission sector or transmission in the electricity sector um and so no no sort of DC or AC flow constraints um and transmission planning at a detailed level would be done uh at the utility level and then it's it's not a forecast so it's it's designed to help with decision making rather than forecast what what will happen in in Oregon um and so it's kind of laying out targets for what we would like to achieve in the future um recognizing that there is a a whole lot of uncertainty that's going into that and what are the decisions that we we can make right now that are going to put our best foot forward to achieving those in the future so what are the characteristics of of energy Pathways modeling um so we are running least cost Energy System optimization and it's across 11 states it's matching the the Oregon's energy demand and how that demand is is evolving over time with supplying the energy um it's looking across the whole energy sector and the economy so all forms of energy are considered in there um it's structured to meet Oregon's energy policy objectives all emissions are are accounted for so emissions from from energy emissions from other sectors um so when we're trying to meet the uh the 2004 targets then we are we're doing the accounting for that that is is going to be compliant with the um with the policy it's integrated and holistic um we're looking across large Geographic areas we're looking across um various sectors of the economy fuels uh it includes supply and demand of all forms of energy not just electricity and it's grounded ensuring reliability and looking for least cost Solutions um as a a little bit of background about evolved and and where these tools have been used in the past we work with most of the the national NOS on on doing planning for at a federal level as well as at a state level um we have worked with other state and local energy offices including in Massachusetts Maine Washington California New Jersey to to do uh State planning processes and we work with a lot of utilities around the country most most of those we it's confidential work um but in Oregon we have worked with with PGE um uh for for a number of years and then others um we we work with universities um with academics we we did the modeling work for Net Zero America and repeat with Princeton University um we worked with breakthrough breakthrough energy Ventures to do an annual decarbonization perspective every year that becomes the basis for a lot of national decarbonization work as well as a number of other um organizations within the US and internationally okay so what is our our technical approach here I will start from the high level picture there's kind of three components to it at this level and the the first is building a model of Oregon's economy so this is a a detailed bottom up picture of all of the energy consuming Technologies in the economy so it is all of the air conditioners all of the water heaters all of the um the uh boilers in Industry all of the electric vehicles IC vehicles of all various different types so everything that's consuming Energy across all of the various sectors and Subs sectors and we we build a picture of what Oregon looks like today so what are the the energy demands for VAR ious types of fuels and then as we move forward in time how are the ways that we consume energy going to change in the in the scenarios that we're running so uh when somebody is going to the dealership to replace their vehicle are they buying an electric vehicle or they buying another internal combustion engine um so those kind of assumptions are going into this this demand side model um to to work out what are the project energy demands between now and and 2050 for for a particular scenario so once we've built that model then we go to the Second Step there which is the aggregation of energy demand across the sub sectors so what are Oregon's energy needs in total um the need for electricity and an hourly demand the transportation fuel demand direct use fuels and this this serves as the the demand for energy that needs to be supplied by all of the energy Supply chains so electricity production um all of the various types of fuel natural gas liquid fuels um and the supply side model that third bucket there least cost energy Supply that is a our capacity expansion and operations model which is working out um within a set of constraints about you know complying with our clean energy goals what are the the um options for building out new resources how fast can we build out new resources what are the least cost Investments that we can make in those Supply chains such that we are meeting Oregon's energy needs between now and 2050 if we take that picture that I just described and Nest it in the data needs for um for doing this modeling that previous slide is the middle bar there the energy modeling uh bar and the demand side model we're using is the energy Pathways model and the supply side model is our regional investment operations platform Rio um looking at the data that's going into the modeling process on starting on the bottom we are looking for the best available data sets that underpin the the whole analysis so on the demand side this is this is first of all what are the sub sectors across the economy um what are the the um the service demands for for different types of of energy end use so how much heat do we need in buildings how much uh cooling demand what is our lighting need what is our vehicle miles traveled and then how are those likely to change over time based on uh forecasts about how population might change how industrial activity might change the changes in commercial activity and square footage of commercial space Etc um and then what are the types of technologies that customers can invest in what are their Capital operating and installation costs what are our current technology stocks um including both the the stocks technology types and the vintages of those stocks um and then similarly on the supply side we have a variety of of underlying data sets including what are the what does the existing energy infrastructure look like um what is the the uh the scheduled additions to that infrastructure retirements um what are the types of technologies that we can invest in on the supply side going forward how might those change over time those options change what are their their costs and and characteristics and how do those change over time um and then things like commodity costs uh delivery costs renewable resource potentials the options to expand transmission um all of those types of of inputs uh and then moving to the top of this chart scenario assumptions this is where we are defining the differences between the scenarios that we're looking at in the analysis so on the demand side this could be things like what are electric vehicle sh sales shares um in every year going forward from now and so we could imagine imagine scenarios where we're we're rapidly electrifying our vehicle fleets and then scenarios where um we're moving more slowly on that maybe it's it you know the way things play out it's hard to electri or harder to Electrify Vehicles than expected and so we have a slower scenario for that um we're we include the policies things like Ira that could impact the types of sales shares that we would see on the demand side um and then on the supply side same thing we have assumptions about um what is defining each one of our scenarios things like resource availability uh the rate at which we can build out resources the technology options available and all of these things are",

        "text": " what not just the conditions we impose because we don't impose a condition well do say sh start but we allow amendments and whatnot is there how does that enter into the evaluation process day and are there me the limited liability we've seen they don't really have much Financial they don't have people they don't have Financial Resources so saying that we can begin construction within a period of time it's um and so I'm wondering if there oper there's been some conversation in the past about operating agreements between parent company and um subsidiary what that operating agreement says the responsibility current compan that the app perform on not necessar conditions but what they see well in terms of evaluating whether they can actually start when they see they're going to start we don't evalue mostly because statute requires Council to establish the construction stry and that has become very standardized without it being like substantive they to start it's not based on their ability to startend so and then any other that to meet is a so it's not representations that should be condition but we missing it that's something we can think about sorry secretary corette the record corette I just want to kind bring up the Practical difficulties of that so you know as Sarah pointed out Council for quite some time landed on that threeyear time frame can constrution and that's based upon really more about the staleness of data you know when an applicant submits their information and going to the process and then three years later even after a site certificate you know that sort of kind of where council's landed and that that data gets stale um and so they don't be in construction by that date they need to spit another amendment request because you know species can migrate into different areas you know new people may move in there may be new noise sensitive receptors so you know facts on the ground can change within that time frame it's not three years it's more like five years and so that's kind of what Cil landed but I think just the Practical difficulty is well they say they're going to be construction you know can we hold them to that well hold them to that by that condition and if they don't meet it they have to come back and request an amendment I just want to kind of throw that out there is you know the markets the practicality is is very complicated you know we've heard some presentations we know just a fraction I think of the complications you know that they these are really massive facilities they're very expensive there's a lot that goes into it you know the markets the power purchase agreements you know having uh construction contractors and spy Che there's a lot that goes into it so I just want to throw that out there is if they say they're going to do it are they going to do it I don't think they know at that point in time I think there there is a staging element you know Beyond sort of the know need standard there's a there's practically a staging part of this that they're forecasting the possibility to build these facilities if all of these things line up um and I don't think we can really change that on them because I think that's just the reality of the nature of this industry you know and the changes in the demands for noral energy which is what we're largely seeing you know in Supply chains and their limitations on the am of people you know construction workers who can actually do this work so there's a lot of elements that I think we have to be sort of thoughtful about that aren't on our side on their side and I appreciate that I guess how I look at it is that um it is the app saying hey we can intend to start construction in a certain amount of time and in my mind what can you show me that you have the ability and if they don't have any money don't have that causes me to question the ability that's one thing and this we don't have a main standard I I get that um um but as I look at the landscape as we assess these um applications there is limited uh landscape available for these projects and and um once we issue a site certificate that certificate is good for a long period of time that somebody like you say may never fail and that our issuing the site certificate in some way is a pretty high barrier to prevent anybody else from from developing a project on what may be the best Parcels for renewable energy generation and I guess I struggle with that a bit as what are the best chances of getting these facilities built in a timely man manner doesn't speak to a need standard but certainly speaks to getting a project done which is what is presented secretary for thank you Council yeah for the record I two two elements to that I'd like to respond to one is you know again Council sets a beginning construction deadline and an ending construction deadline and currently there is the ability to get two threee time extensions on the beginning construction timeline we're going to be opening up the amendment rules in 2024 um that's where the bulk of that evaluation is to be done that can be reevaluated so there's there's you know there's elements that Council has control over there but then there's also elements that Council doesn't control um you know a developer can sign a lease agreement with land owners and even if they don't have a site certificate it could lock up that land so outside of our process there is a level of control that that that we you do not have you know and so if somebody's trying to prevent you know a competitor for example from building in a prime area they don't have to build a facility they just have to get land owners to sign long-term lease agreements you on that land and it doesn't matter for us if they have a site certificate or not it's going to still going to lock up that land because they can't sign with anybody else and I agree with that um I'm just trying to control what we can control which is the issu of the S get to get a done that that's all I'm tring reconcile on my mind yeah and I think this you know these questions you know we can kind of look at them in you know in a very confined way which is important but it's also there are a lot of different kind of offs you know and variables that that is important to kind of be aware of because you know you can only control what you can control you know we have a process you have rules that's what your area is and that's exactly Focus but I think it is worthwhile to you be thinking about what are the things that these discussions and developers you know if they are paying attention at all are going to realize that we're asking more questions and um you know private citizens have the ability to go out their legislators and and raise concerns about some of these things I think we've can put in a position where on the legislature has set some very high expectations um it's almost like the Gold Rush right you're you're racing out there to go meet something that may or may not happen but I I do believe in controlling what we can and the best thing that we can do is continue to make it clear that we are not rubber stamping things we are looking at data um Sarah to your point I'm concerned about collecting data that we can't really do anything with I think that is a waste of resource all the way around but I do think we're our rights to ask questions in one way to it might be that we ask more question questions when we have developers throughout the process so that's you know in my mind I don't see this getting any easier um especially as new technologies come on board and even our conversation this morning um about the temporary you generators and things so we're going to continue to to see it there will be a demand for resources I can tell you from my personal World um supply chain issues are not getting any better they are not going to get any better any time quickly and so we will anyone else have comments at this time think about it council member um and I know I stated this before um it is this standard that um that we are responsible for you know with other standards other other agencies are are responsible for evaluating and the information is quite intensive um and I so I guess that's why I spent so much to on on this retirement retirement and while are ours so what is our evidence can have for that we ar asking for today that operating agreement um that someone mentioned to us like oh here's a piece that we before um that may be available not available but at least it's something you know I don't know what I what else is out there that would build evid F like we evid yes this this entity can what they someone next era we can start to ask for that either as a preconstruction condition or I follow up on that especially if there's push back to the performance guarantee you know that okay with that now there's push back um that that is just okay not that um and the other thing uh that I would we talked about is the structure of the organizations themselves with the staed liability companies and looking at it most all are pretty clearent comp has no obligation no no obligation to fulfill obligations of the subsidiary and so how you know so okay that's the case and we understand what does thank you council member dein council member CH either you have any comments no not this thank you secretary yes talk and I think you conversation is good and I think this is exactly we to do it to see what changes have we made we certainly you know heard Council um made change tried to make some changes you know it's going to be iterative um but I just will put this out there that you know we are do a series of rule makings that we call the ru making alignment we've got the first one done which is sort of rearranging things the second second version um phase two really is going to be you largely non-substantive as well that's going to be rearranging things um and it's going to be the third phase which is going to be more really a bunch of different Ru makings you know including the organizational expertise we're going to look at individual standards to try to then really assess what are we asking for in terms of the application materials and and what's the standard um so that's when we're going to really dig into those so um you Tom Jackman is going to be coming back likely in January with a request for the 2024 Ru making schedule certainly the phase two will be on that we'll have to see",

        "text": ", and that is my primary concern too. I thank you for listening to my concerns about this. But it's the dogs being in the cages and the non stop barking is what my main compliant is with this. Thank you very much for your time. Thank you. My name is Sherri Fowler. I live at 30 91 Southeast 112th street. And I own several of those pieces. I own two pieces of property within that neighborhood. We sort of. Our family owns the back of it. We moved there. We bought the property to keep out the city and keep out the noises. We wanted our children to be raised in a small town. We now anytime we're in the back, we have to smell dog urine. There is a watershed in the back of low spot, and my fear is, when they wash out those kennels, yes, the urine goes out in the ground, but my well is back there, so I don't know what it's going to do to my well. There was always, excuse me, animals in those woods. There was raccoons, there was squirrels. There's been foxes. There's been all kinds of stuff back there. And now with dogs back there, we don't have any. So they've ruined the habitat of our neighborhood. And I've always thought that if I move somewhere, I shouldn't take what I don't like of where I live and bring it to another spot. I don't know where these people move from, but wherever they moved from, they bought all the stuff that. That they didn't like about where they were at, brought it to my neighborhood, and I don't like it either. I do hear the barking morning, noon, and night. If I'm outside and the dogs happen to get a notice of something moving, they bark. I just don't think a commercial business should be allowed in a spot that people bought in as purely residential. Thank you. Thank you. Did you sign in? I signed in over there. Okay. Thank you. Okay. My name is Donna d. Amato. I live at 30. 6100 10th street. My problem with it is the acreage that we own behind it. My husband and I just spent $25,000 on fencing so that my sister in law, my niece, my husband, and they can all ride their horses, exercise them, and practice, and the horses are distracted by the constant barking. And we don't even have 35 dogs now. So with 35 dogs and then three littiters of puppies, the amount of barking that will go on, that's natural for an animal. It's natural for an animal to bark, and it's going to happen, and it's only going to get worse. I can't open my bedroom window. I used to open my bedroom window and my a laai door so the wind would blow through. But the barking, I just shut them because I want the sound to leave me alone. I. I'm 70 years old, and I work all day long. I want to come home to quiet. The barking is unbearable, and it's almost like crying. It's terrible. The barking is horrible. They're not mistreating the dogs. I don't know them. I've never met them. I just know what I can't stand in my home now. That's a lot of acreage to buy to lose all of the value of all of it. The six acres in the bag, it's useless. I couldn't even rent it. People don't want to listen to the barking. And my sister in law can't ride a horse. She can't practice for shows, nothing. Because the constant barking distracts the horses. I mean, I understand that they have as much right with their barking as we do as horses, but it didn't start that way. So that's my complaint. Thank you for listening. Thank you very much. Is there anyone else before I close the public portion, then we'll close the public portion of the hearing at this point. And I'm going to ask the how would it come back up and maybe start addressing some of these concerns and see what we can do to maybe work with our neighbors a little bit here? Maybe you came up with some ideas that can make it even better. So I do want to apologize to the neighbors. A lot of the neighbors've never actually. You're going to have to talk directly to us. For right now, I apologize, but it is good that afterwards, if you get together with your neighbors, you know, it's always a good thing. I got it. O yeah. So we're 300ft from the house. It'cleaned every day. The smell can't be coming from our kennel. Now. Animal services shows up all the time for inspections. Randomly they come through and we get a green light. You can walk through my kennel. There's nothing coming from the kennel. So I don't. The smell thing and the trailer. I know for a time we were waiting to dump the dump trailer once a week until it was full. So if any smell, if there was a smell, since that was parked towards the back of the property, it could have been from the trailer. But now that's dumped every three days. So is there a better solution? Because I'm not familiar with your business, but is there a better solution that maybe can overcome any smell on a regular bases in your business? There is. I mean, we can enclose the runs a little bit more lime the ground, and we can use a different type of bedding and that will help with the smell. I mean, if there's any smell. I don't smell anything there. And we have company and people come over constantly. I mean, if there was, we would fix it because our house is 300ft. Well, you're also asking for a special use permit. So for any reason you violate the special use permit, you'll lose the special use permit. So it's in your best interest to get it up to snuff, correct? Correct. Absolutely. If you can keep on addressing the light situation, we will change. We'll shield the lights. We apologize for that. We just. We wanted it light outside because my kids go outside and play at night. We go outside sometimes, but we didn't realize that it was even affecting anyone else in the neighborhood. We have a neighbor that's right to the left of us. She's the only neighbor we know in the neighborhood. We ask, you know, she goes, I love the lights. Do you ever hear the dogs? I love the dog. She even sent a letter of approval in our behalf. One neighbor behind us, we called, asking her just to figure, we don't know anyone else here, but we did call, so wasn't done without consideration for the neighbors. But we can make the adjustments to change that. The dogs are never kept in cages, ever. Part of the reason why they're noisy in the morning is because they have half an acre to run. I don't know how to make adjustments to the barking. They don't bark at night. Well, they may bark at night, but they're in the building, so you can't hear anything at night. There'someone else that has a bunch of dogs. We go outside at night and we hear a lot of barking. And just because we have dogs, we think that we put the dogs away. There's someone else that's. That's a couple of parcels over from us that have a lot of dogs. I don't know if the barking'being. Confused with ours, but you can stand right in front of my kennel at night and you will not hear a peep. The barking during the day. The only adjustment I see that we can make is if we left some inside while we let others run and then take turns, which we like our dogs to be free. We let them out in the morning and they're running and they're playing, so they're barking. So if you're somewhere between in our house, seven and 10:00 a.m. that's where you're going to hear the most barking. Our employee goes in, cleans the kennels out, and while they're cleaning, they're out just playing and running. The only way to really change the barking is if we let them out, maybe two at time, which means lengthening the workday, but we're willing to do that. But certainly at night, you won't hear any barking that comes from our kennel. Definitely not any else. Have any questions? I got a question. So they've been here five years. How long have you been getting complaints about this operation? We haven't. You haven't? No, sir. The first code enforcement case that we had. Let me see if I can explain this. The first notification was on January 4, 2023. And as I mentioned previously, the actual alleged violation is running a kennel without an SUP sign outside, puppies for sale. There's no mention of noise, lighting, odor, anything listed in the code violation. Question, what do you know about odors with kettles that could improve the situation. That could be a recommendation. If the board made a recommendation, we actually discuss that on site. They are in the process of basically improving, enhancing their facility. And there was a nice, very, very nice facility. It probably the most elaborate facility that I've personally witnessed in Marion county. And they actually poured concrete areas for their runs. They have a drainage system that is built into it, which is a containment system. It has its own septic system, so it doesn't go into the surface water, actually gets put into a septic system, but basically it has channels down the middle of the runs and they're sloped in. It makes cleaning easier, more expeditious, and would be easy to add to the facility. We actually had that conversation on site. And how do",

        "text": " on the record of the draft proposed order hearing expressing concerns about whether the reasons were site-specific specifically recommended consideration of site-specific components like or the unique ability of the site to provide both wind and solar at the site and as you've you've you've received the applicant requested a 30-day extension at that hearing to submit additional evidence and on the 15th they provided a supplemental packet that was provided in hard copy and electronically to counsel and i i think i don't want to repeat what you've heard or maybe what you've reviewed but in response to the specific recommendations that we heard out of the testimony from council we wanted to that in the supplemental response applicant explains that the wind energy site was selected based on favorable interpretation of wind the site allows for wind and solar which provides a balanced generation it has robust wind resources and that allows the site itself allows for shared infrastructure of the two technologies being wind and solar i think we are interested in whether council has any further concerns or comments that we should be in that goal exception chair this is hamilton thank you sarah i do have an additional unfortunately it's a little lengthy so bear with me here i'll focus my comments on the solar facility and its need to justify an exception to protecting agricultural land for continued agricultural production required under lcdc statewide planning goal 3. oregon's land use program was developed and initially adopted back in the early 1970s i heard the late hector mcpherson say on several occasions that the primary motivation for oregon's land use program was protection of farm and forest lands or ever in from ever increasing development pressures in the 1960s and goal three states in part agricultural land shall be preserved and maintained for farm use consistent with existing and future needs for ag products forest and open space mine conservation and development commission solar rules which i helped initially develop when i was the co-chair of the lcdc solar rules advisory committee require an exception be taken when 12 acres of high value or 20 acres of arable land are taken out of agricultural production by a solar facility clearly these thresholds will be exceeded by this application and an exception to protecting farmlands is required whereas force 69.504 sub 2 sub c which is f sec statute sets out the requirements that must be met when taking an energy facility citing council reasons to statewide planning goals they include three parts a reasons justify why the state policy here goal three should not apply b significant we abbreviate it as easy consequences anticipate anticipated from the proposed solar facility have been identified and adverse impacts will be mitigated and c the proposed solar facility will be compatible with other adjacent uses or will be made compatible i agree these criteria do not require an alternatives analysis as the lcdc requirements do and i stated that clearly on may 26 in my comments the evidence presented identifies the majority of the subject 100 1896 acres is identified in nrcs soil class 3 and is designated as arable land with scattered inclusions of high value this acreage has been cropped in the past and is in the county's exclusive farm use zone as i stated may 26 i agree uh with and accept many of the reasons provided by the applicant justifying the removal of this acreage from statewide planning goal 3 farmland protections but i also believe many of these reasons could apply to any dry land wheat acreage in the region and there needs to be a demonstration why this specific site should no longer be protected for agricultural use and how the applicable criteria are met for help in understanding how to meet these criteria the oregon supreme court found in our rural oregon versus at a gas-powered electric generation facility was particularly suited to its site due to its proximity to an existing natural gas pipeline transmission line and substation so the question here is how is the solar site particularly suited for this project aside from the financial benefits to the farming operation lack of current farming practices and minimal impact to adjacent farming activities why is this site particularly for this solar facility i believe it's particularly suited because it's proposed to be developed in conjunction with the wind facility and all of its supporting facilities the applicant's new testimony emphasizes the benefits of being cited near the bpa transmission line and proposed bpa substation to be constructed with the wind facility new testimony also emphasizes that the solar facility will balance electric loads with the wind facility wind in the evening solar during the day and increased reliability to the grid in addition they state of all the acres under management of cunningham this parcel can best integrate wind and solar electric generation therefore i believe the site certificate should be conditioned to support the goal 3 exception as long as the solar facility site is developed in conjunction with the wind facility to take advantage of the shared supporting facilities transmission substation roads and battery storage i'm going to leave it to the staff to draft the exact language for such a however i believe the solar facility is particularly suited for the proposed site because it's associated with the wind its shared supporting facilities therefore must be developed in conjunction with the wind facility and you know one of the questions is you know is one turbine enough i think you know the wind facility has to be commercially viable so those are my comments it's my position go ahead i have a bit of a lengthy one not quite as long as hanley's the credentials and expertise of steve corey and bob levy and their written testimony in their june 13th declarations uh connects the dots for me solar pv site has been taken out of ag production because it was an uneconomical to farm a least productive area for farming with no water resource or irrigation and with the grazing limitations it's not economically feasible a farm trying to farm the property even with the recent up-to-date practices generally provides a negative financial return the low returns in soil erosion are the primary considerations and why it is some of the least viable property in their ownership and in the county in addition the site's within a mile of a bpa transmission line that runs through the site of a proposed bonneville substation providing an economical connection to reach the grid and provide integration of wind and solar generation 1896 acres or less than seven percent of the total dry land wheat producing land in the family ownership and less than 1.2 percent of the total agricultural acres owned and managed by the family the proposed solar pv facility location is flat with excellent aspects towards the sun as close to the transmission infrastructure requiring no separate inner tie line the location of the solar pv facility takes advantage of a relatively flat area the availability of wind facility infrastructure and will have a lack of impact on existing agricultural operations including ranching near the substation any other solar pv on their ownership would be remote from the substation and would not serve the project's purpose of a fully integrated round-the-clock hybrid renewable energy facility so i find that the gold three exceptions justified i find that the inclusion of solar at this particular location creates a more balanced generation profile increasing reliability of the grid and increases the project's viability the solar site is particularly suited because it is different from other cropland in umatilla county and the region because it will be located in close proximity to a proposed wind energy facility and provides interconnection opportunity for the solar facility without requiring additional transmission lines because the two facilities are so interconnected i feel it's appropriate to condition the goal 3 except to approve the goal 3 exception on a condition that the approval is on the basis of the solar facility being built in conjunction with the wind for this is anne byer and although i wasn't present at the two hearings that happened before this i did listen to the audio tape so i have some familiarity and i have reviewed the materials thank you to the applicant and the property owners for providing the background i agree with vice chair howe on how that really helped explain why this site was less suitable for i would like staff to ensure that there's a finding that reflects discussion of those locational dependent the transmission line the location near project substations and the in conjunction with wind i think that does distinguish this project and we want to make sure we're explicit about that i think that locational factor is is pretty critical to this particular application so thank you for the record todd cornett just uh two sort of follow-ups to this one so you both read you know moderately lengthy uh statements can we get those and either if you want them back we can make copies of them and return them to you or we can just take them if you're you don't want them back so i think that would be helpful for us um as councilmember buyer said i think using that kind of either language or paraphrasing that will help us supplement the findings so um and then just looking for again consensus on you know the that type of language that phrasing and the condition from all council members yes this is marcie uh cindy uh yes grill this is perry choctew yes thanks perry uh this is jordan for the record i i believe the proximity connectivity geographical conditions power generation goals and benefits to the state uh represent the highest and best use of this project and ground so yes thank you all good okay thank you very much hand it back to kate now okay so we're going to move on to the which is the protected area standard under this standard the council must prohibit the sighting of energy facilities in protected areas except for special cases primarily transmission lines or pipelines where there is no reasonable alternative protected areas include national and state parks national monuments and other areas identified in the council rules as having special scenic natural or environmental value for proposed facilities near protected areas the standard requires council to determine the facility would have no significant direct or indirect adverse impact on these protected areas so in the application evaluated the analysis area which is the pink dotted line around the proposed site boundary and in their analysis they identified 18 protected areas includes four state wildlife refuges five state fish hatcheries two state parks one state heritage area two agricultural experimental stations one blm bureau of land management area of critical environmental concern and three state wildlife areas so in their analysis basically we looked at the proximity of identified protected areas in relation to the components and that would be the wind turbines the solar facility and the transmission line and one of the key findings is that for the wind and solar",

        "text": " residents, the school health Asia market. Councilor Sinclair, thank you for the question. So as noted, there was no public testimony received on either the annexation or the zone change. With the exception of the email correspondence that happened with Mister Knudsen today. Was there notice given to the surrounding area? Yes. City staff as well as the applicant team complied with the required notice parameters for both the land use actions and associated meetings. And how was that done? Through mailing of public notices of the hearing to properties within 500ft of the site boundary. And then we also post it on our website and then through the other public means required by state law. Thank you. All right. With that, we'll open it up for public hearing. We did not have anybody who registered for virtual comments. Is there anybody in the audience who wishes to give testimony on this item? Thank you. Welcome. And if you would state your name, your company and who you represent. If anybody. And then I could also get you to fill out one of the yellow cards. Very good. Evening. Got it. Okay. For the record, my name is with the law firm Schwab. Leave it. Perfect. Law firm Schwabe, Williamson, Wyatt. My address is 1211 southeast Fifth Ave. Portland, Oregon. Here on behalf of GleepDX, the applicant, and so I apologize about not filling out the card earlier, but I'll get, make sure I get that done. I'm gonna keep my comments short today. I think staff did a really good job, both in the written staff report as well as in the testimony tonight summarizing kind of the two requests here, the annexation and the zone change. We agree with the draft findings they've come up with, as well as conclusions in the staff report. I wasn't aware of Mister Knudsen's comments because apparently they came in today, but we do agree with staff's response on that as well too. FEMA's 2018 mapping is really what dictates the floodplain designations on the property, at least from our opinion. So I don't really know if there's much else to say on that, but I'm happy to take questions there. Otherwise, again, I think we just, we appreciate staff's work on this and we agree with the findings, so have to take questions. Very good. Thank you. Any questions or comments? And from anybody online. I think my only question, just for clarification, this was an annexation and zone change requested by the property owner. So the property owner requested the annexation and inattendant having the annexation, if the property is to come into the city, they're going to have to designate it with zoning. So the city actually initiated the zone change, but we agree with the industrial sanctuary recommended zoning. That's what's consistent with the North Hillsboro industrial area comprehensive plan? So in terms of what the city has already done from a planning effort, this makes a lot of sense. Would the city vote to bring the annexation land in? And so the applicant, when they desire to be annexed into our city limits, they understand that there will be an accompanying zone change and they are in agreement with that? Yes, we are. Okay, thanks. All right. And this is councilor Sinclair. I have one additional question. Do you have any additional information you can give us on transportation impact due to this zone change? Thank you. Yeah. In addition to the staff's findings on the transportation impacts, the zone change, this again is what the city already contemplated within the North Hillsboro industrial area community plan. So in some senses, traffic has already been analyzed there. In addition, we do not think that this implicates the state transportation planning rule. We agree with staff's findings on that point. In terms of traffic impacts from development, were this property to develop, that would be addressed at the application phase for an actual project. So again, there's a lot more hoops we'd have to jump through before there'd be any sort of transportation impacts. And as the applicant team, we'd have the obligation to analyze and mitigate for any of those. All right, thank you. It's time for real. All right, thank you, guys. I appreciate it. So anybody else from the audience? All right, seeing none, we will close the public hearing and may I have a motion and a second to adopt order number 14. So moved. Pace? Second, Martin. Thank you. It's been moved and seconded. Do we have any discussion prior to votes? All right, seeing none, may we have. Oh, yes. I'm so sorry. It's hard online. I feel a little frustrated because of the, the 500 foot ratio of notice for the surrounding neighbors and it is a rural area that doesn't leave with contacting anybody and it will ultimately have impact in the surrounding area, whether it be bus routes, the school, the elementary school there, the Helvetia market there, directly across the street. So I do find that disheartening that additional efforts weren't made beyond 500ft. Thank you. Any other comments then may we have a roll call? Councillor Martin? Aye. Councillor Alcare? Aye. Councillor van Bevern? Aye. Councilor Sinclair? No. Councillor Pace. Hi. Thank you. Order number 14 is adopted by a vote of four ayes and one nay. We'll move on to agenda item 5.3 and 5.4, and these will be considered as, as item 7.2 also. And this is for the annexation and zone change. For the van Rose property. And with that, we'll invite planning director Dan Diaz to come back up and we'll open up the hearing on the public hearing on items 5.35.4 and we'll hear from planning staff and then we'll hear the video. Good evening again, mayor and council. It's great to see you again. I'm going to ask Mister Jackson to tee up the ORS video part of the hearing and then I'll give the oral staff report on this topic as well. All public testimony and evidence submitted must refer to applicable approval criteria which are listed in the staff report or other land use regulations or criteria you believe may apply to the decision. Any testimony or written evidence needs to be specific and detailed so the city can understand and respond to each criterion or issue discussed in the testimony. Failure to raise an issue before the record closes prevents an appeal to the land use board of appeals based on that issue. Failure by the applicant to raise an issue before the record closes prevents inaction for damages in circuit court based on that issue. All testimony and evidence that addresses the approval criteria will be responded to prior to the closing of the record. Thank you. And you know, as I watch the new video, it kind of makes me wonder if these are the kids as grown up adults, because we've used that one with the cute kids for quite a while, so you know that. Anyway. Okay, that's my, that's my filler and now it's back over to Mister DSD. I'll do my best to follow that up, mayor. So, similar to the last hearing, the applicable approval criteria for this annexation is Metro code chapter 3.09 and the Hillsboro Community Development code 12.80.010 e as well as for the zone change. The approval criteria are Hillsboro Community Development code 12.80.168 point. And so this item is similarly an annexation and a zone change. It's an applicant initiated annexation for approximately 129.7 acres in our North Hillsboro industrial area, commonly referred to as the Jackson East south sub area. It is one that is anticipated for industrial development. Similarly to the last one, notification was provided for 500ft from the external boundaries of the full site to all adjacent properties. That is a state law requirement. It also was posted in our typical notice measures both on our website and through our other communication means. And similarly to the last project, the recommended city initiated zoning for the site is industrial sanctuary, which is compliant with the comprehensive planning work that the council adopted a couple of years ago related to the Jackson East south sub area. I'm happy again, to answer any questions on this application, either now or after you take testimony from the public. And I will note that no written testimony was received on the annexation zone change request on this item prior to my presentation this evening. Thank you, council president. Yeah, I was curious. This. I think this interfaces with the council, the Crescent Park Crescent Park Greenway. Sorry, I was thinking Council Kreika on the larger one, but Crescent Park Greenway, there plans for a larger part of this to be dedicated to that Crescent Park Greenway. Am I correct in that? Yeah. The northern boundary of the site, which there is a vicinity map in your packet, is comprised of part of the Weibull Creek corridor and also the reservoir that is north of this site that is part of the Crescent Park Greenway. Through the annexation of this property and the application of our zoning, we will put into place the Crescent park greenway setback requirements and overlay requirements. So that sets up for future development to play a role in helping to set aside and improve that area in alignment with city plans. They are also conversations happening with the developer because similar to the last set of questions, this is purely just to bring the property into the city's authority and jurisdiction into applier zoning. This is not going to by itself result in any development or activity happening on the site that would be anticipated in subsequent land use applications and decisions that would happen after the annexation and zone change was approved, should it be approved. But we would be in conversations with development partners at that point",

        "text": " thing that texas did about 15 years ago with the competitive renewable energy this was a program to develop transmission within texas by identifying places with the highest within potential and figuring out where the best places to optimize new lines would be from those places to the big cities in um in central and southern texas that was a largely successful effort that built new transmission where it was needed to facilitate a lot of new end development what it didn't do was build transmission to other parts of the country in adjacent states that would have avoided the blackout the texas experience this but it is worth spotlighting within a big area within texas that did sort of optimize transmission planning another good example is miso's multi-value projects the midwest iso ran a process that covered unlike texas multiple states beginning nine or ten years ago again focused on accessing new wind and the other things that transmission can provide to the grid so those two examples are ways that if an rto formed in the northwest or the broader west you could see a more i think effective and in some cases competitive process for planning and procuring transmission and the final point i guess i wanted to make is i think it's worth keeping in mind and spotlighting for the legislature that the way we built our existing grid in the northwest bonneville has three quarters of the circuit miles of lines bonneville's often been the sort of builder of first resort for the region in the last hundred years that has become increasingly a difficult role for bonneville to play and i know ravi's here maybe wants to comment on but having a federal agency with capital to build lines has been sort of a a blessing for the region to have a lot of extra capacity lying around that doesn't seem to be a role that bonneville is as able to play now whether it's a combination of its current commercial position challenges with fish passage issues or just the fact that it has a lot of debt now and it's less willing to increase its leverage the way we've done things in the past to build out transmission is probably not the way we're going to be able to do it going forward so the solutions we relied on for the last hundred years aren't as available to us thank you spencer we'll go to fred next and i'll note again uh we're certainly over time on the agenda but i think we'll make it up on some of the other questions i had a sneaking suspicion that there's been more more discussion on these questions than our last meeting and so far i'm right right so uh and this discussion could go on for quite a while longer and you know if but i think if we're focusing on what views to provide to the legislature i'll just mention a couple um first is in rto the the generic concept offers one big thing for me which is harmonization across a whole range of issues having to do with transmission um you know up at the operational level you know just day to day minute to minute at the planning level in integrating across you know a bigger footprint to optimize both new transmission you know expansion but also and i think this is undervalued right now but it's pretty significant the expanding the capability of the existing system so through you know the current phrase du jour which i really don't like uh grid enhancing technologies gets you know just as one example um and yes the utilities in bonneville are doing a lot of that already but you know you get a benefit by making it you know harmonizing that across a wider footprint and then also on not just the planning but also cost and and really the rto at least in concept provides is the ability to decide what gets built so you don't have planning over here in the order 1000 planning region in our case northern grid and the implementation over there with the balancing authorities or other transmission so at least in theory that is the way it should work in practice i think there's a big divide between single state rtos like texas and i think spencer was right to point out the crows uh development process there is a big success and the multi-state rt or yeah the three state rtos are california new york and texas oregon is not those states we are not going to be a single state rto and the multi-state rtos have integrated planning and so forth they run into a couple of issues one of which is state interest we really see this in miso in particular where the mvp process worked pretty well for a cycle but hasn't really gone forward and i think in part you know when new transmission started to get built you started seeing different state interests emerging a lot of opposition in some states to new long lines that other states really wanted and that's not even to get into all the inter rto uh issues as well so i just yes it an rto could offer a lot of advantages for transmission but you know they're going to be some difficulties we have to wrestle with the second maybe the second point i want to make is about unavoidably we have to talk about the situation with bonneville bonneville's not just a transmission owner which they they also operate an integrated system as spencer also pointed out and this that system like all of the west except for the iso operates under a contract-based approach not a flow-based approach now i think it's easy to say well an rto you can move to a flow-based approach it's all going to be great but that really we have to look at bonneville as a institution with a really important role in trying to move from a contract-based approach to a flow-based approach given bonneville's integrated approach is going to be a big issue to have to unravel and kind of piece together where you know how you do that transmission it's not just a matter of grandfathering rights and that sort of thing the bonneville system has some unique features that we have to consider in the transition to an rto process so i just wanted to say those two things there's lots more obviously we could talk about thank you fred and there certainly is we could probably do this topic all day and uh come back tomorrow uh we'll go to mike and then ravi and those are the only uh hands i'm seeing at the moment and then while we could keep this going i'd like to move on to the next topic just so we can cover some some other material we can always come back to this uh at the end if there's time uh mike yeah thanks adam i'll i'll try to keep these comments brief because i know we're we're running short and a lot of what i was gonna say was actually covered by spencer and fred so i appreciate the comments there um but really i just wanted to make some kind of high-level comments about you know like what is it we'd like to show to the legislature that you know an rto can provide and and really that it's it's that it can provide benefits to oregon customers and i think transmission planning is is a key piece um in which benef benefits can accrue and flow through to oregon customers and i think the hope um you know in a well-planned and well-functioning rto is that you'd actually be able to optimize existing um rather than kind of build out new transmissions so spencer i appreciate your your thoughts there and kind of looking at some best practices from other areas yeah i think i think it also comes down to um putting strong side rails and we can speak about this more in the governance conversation but having a strong governance structure in place that ensures kind of you know voices are equally considered from throughout the footprint um because you know the rto will have kind of like a central hub for transmission planning and i think um you know within within that transmission planning i think ideally we would get to a place where you know we we can look at the transmission that's kind of across the footprint and then use that to then decide which resources if new resources are going to be procured which would be kind of the most cost effective to fit within that existing transmission footprint which is kind of a flip of the current paradigm which is you know that happens to an extent in utility resource planning but right now the prevailing paradigm seems to be more okay let's find a resource that best complements our existing resource stack and then find a way to get the electrons from say you know montana or wyoming wind back to the northwest so yeah basically i think at a high level i think that rtos can give can provide a lot of promise i think it comes down to governance i think if we have kind of a a good governance structure with a central uh transmission planning entity uh hopefully we can really optimize the system and i think that's the way that we can get benefits back so i think kind of laying that down at a high level to the legislature would be helpful thanks mike and thanks for bringing that back to the legislative um focus um ravi and then we are we'll move on to question number seven on renewables thanks adam and and thank you some really really great conversation and great uh inputs that have already been said and provided so it's kind of taken away my punch line so i guess waiting long enough actually worked in this case a couple of quick points that i want to make i i fully agree with the point about strong governance structure in place but i want to add on to it that when writing this report also to consider market structure market design and operation that that is probably also key to um to the overall success of an rto now said that i i think what we need to really i fully agree number one that coordination amongst the larger set of groups and the transmission footprint on a broad geographical footprint does provide the opportunity to have optimization of the transmission built based on a much broader collective need definitely re-emphasize that whether you have an archer you don't have an rto the permitting challenges and the policies around it are still going to remain so that's again reinforce and re-emphasize that that doesn't change uh whether you go to an arc or you don't go to an rto the point around you know there was a lot of comments made around bonneville and i i agree on to some of them but in the last decade and we are reaching a saturation point you know if you're talking about next 20 years or so there may not be as much system capacity left",

Those are the criteria with which masters are going to fight with 42 options 41 42 options we start with many options on Monday the group worked to share ideas information according to the classifications of how this comes into play in the survey that they took were able to talk about that information and I think that we already When we get halfway there we have like five or six with whom we will move forward and the rest of them eh we're going to review at the next meeting to have the whole list to have a very detailed analysis that we are going to do all together I also wanted to share with you that the next steps are focus on pushing an Open House and a a tall approach is the next point April 10 in the blue part of Salem from a 6:30 meeting a meeting virtual on the 16th and then we will have it everywhere if they are going to get it no Don't worry, you don't have to write it. I promise you that we are going to give it to you and the April 23 in the center of 50 more than 6:30 to 8:30 South Salem time in virtual North and northeast and that is what we are doing and I will respond to your your questions and with that I end thanks I don't know if anyone has any ask more and I was listening and I wrote the airport as a idea member mandel Thank you president eh sorry I didn't hear the meeting Monday but those who are still there offline are the ones who are more viable in the Graph they developed It is simply true that the things that They had less interest, they decided to consideration the future That is, what What happened is that on Monday night the working group considered those things that were less interesting than those of medium and high interest and we start with what of less interest in the group and these I think they are easily eh we retired because the group was in agree we move on to the high things interest what could be high interest and some of these are they maintained and others moved towards the moderate consideration category and not we saw all the things that were moderate consideration because there will be more discussion about it Thank you I will take notes I'll try to tell you that I know that, for example, the commissions of business licenses were withheld I think annexing developed areas within eh the borders of urban growth eh Also a levy tax real estate also tax corporate income was maintained and there was several things that they asked us to do we would like to check more that I had to do with taxes instead of payments and Also I think the sales tax of marijuana where somamos is limited. So they asked us to do more research on this to have more options Thanks and I don't see any other asks one more Bel check member Thank you president, thank you for that summary I learned a lot and I am intrigued by this survey eh And this survey statistically valid it sounds like that the workforce has a challenge to have a reflection of salem okay with the members and until we understand This worries me, what is going to happen to the surveys statistically significant then we can have more information about how people will contact you and what is the sample universal that is going to be taken Thank you for the question us and the city a portfolio and we use a company that is called dhm and if you have heard baby A lo they know them better and they do our services survey and they They are also aware of it and We are also at about 20 as an example representative huh because it's changing all the time but it is true that they Come try to square our demographic information against eh different ways and it is not just one survey too eh they have answers on the phone eh And and so that people can text eh your responses in a survey and and They call people at the end if they are looking for certain person age information or demographic go to mark the person and in a manner with intention You are trying to square the representation of the community and I hope That answered your question, yes. Yes, he answered, I just had that concern. to reach everyone and of course not I've got a solution but it seems to be good and it is also It's true that we translated it into English and Spanish for the purpose of having each other's voices thank you courney It's time for open discussion If someone had an open discussion open discussion but I think we are everyone ready to finish I don't know if there is any last comments eh yes anyone I would like to say something else and the final point is public testimony no one signed up I want to thank you all the staff and members who eh With this we close the session.

        "text": " large it was it was near the the ac uh transmission lines and there was arcing due to the wildfire smoke so the the the intertie had to be de-energized uh to not to not further the wildfire and so what ended up happening was not only did california lose potentially so they were talking about major system impacts here so beyond oregon they lost you know three and a half gigawatts of potential import and then and then the dc entertain had to be also de-energized not because the wildfire smoke because now the system was out of balance so there's another couple gigawatts so you know all of a sudden california is in a huge you know pinch without without some of the imports they really rely on and there are other times of the year when we rely on imports across the intertie and that could be really important for oregonians as well all right let's go to the next slide okay so a couple key findings from the oregon study uh from our our 2020 um offshore wind study was this ability for you know uh interconnections of of maybe between two and three gigawatts of nameplate capacity offshore went but closer to you know two gigawatts of power flows um on the actual existing transmission that works as as gauged from a production cost model and then some of the um some of the complementary benefits i indicated before one thing i didn't mention was that there there is a you know a larger scale relief of historic transmission flows from east to west so not just across the coastal range but also from the farther east part of the region all the way to the coast and also to the i5 corridor so by serving some of that i5 load from the ocean you relieve you free up some coastal capacity some of that cascade transmission capacity which has some implications for future uh generation and transmission um the last thing i want to mention is we're really i would say we're just really starting on this work and fully the the reliability and resilience value of offshore wind in the northwest and on the west coast in general um so uh the next layer so there has been some production cost modeling done several studies this one and several others and now but what the next part is really to look closely at resource adequacy you know do some detailed power flow work including steady state short circuit and dynamic studies to understand the impacts the true impacts uh to the existing transmission grid and also you know how a purpose-built transmission infrastructure might benefit or how it would be affected um by offshore wind power flows and then and then of course if we're looking beyond the three gigawatts beyond the two gigawatts then there's there's a role for new production cost modeling and we're doing some of that in our study right now so next slide final this is the current study it's funded by the national offshore one research and development consortium and boem and we're looking at this this exact range we've got great wind speeds uh and strong capacity value as i indicated we have 18 months we started at the beginning of this year um and we're at the point we're optimizing generation footprints in the ocean for for electricity system values and the same values i've been indicating in these slides evaluating three conceptual transmission scenarios to move that power and seek it at load centers in uh in the i5 corridor as well as down in san francisco um and we're guided by poet and and as from as in an advisory capacity uh as as led by jason bush um and i'll take any questions about that as we go here but thank you very much for the time happy to talk more thanks travis that was great um jason just has a couple of additional slides and then there's been some really great questions for you in the chat if you want to take a look are you able to stay on for a little bit longer so we can do a discussion okay great jason i'll just um have you do your remaining two slides while travis takes a look at the chat and then we can kind of do it all at oh your slides disappeared there you go okay thanks travis um yeah i think that's a wise decision let's go through recap and the synthesis of the feedback we heard on these topics um you know 100 clean power grid that gets to the generation profile a little bit then the transmission power supply reliability travis touched on with enhancements and expansions to um maybe increase the transfer capacity on east west and north south pathways and power system resilience and here here we go was able to get a synthesis of the comments we we got on this topic down to one slide so maybe this can help us stay on track for our for our timeline for the meeting um we'll point out on the right that wildfire risk is kind of a big um maybe more frequent natural event extreme natural event that the pacific northwest encounters so planning for these is a little easier than planning for like the big earthquake scenario we talked about on the last topic so some of the themes where floating offshore wind generation profile is complementary to solar and provides resource diversity we've talked about diversity um in that aspect and then the locational diversity for balancing power flows on the transmission system is another um key feature of offshore wind that's relatively unique then floating offshoring compulsory reliability um explore these need to explore these benefits with in relation to kind of the transmission expansion necessary talked about that a bit and transmission solutions that reduce the east-west pathways the reduced congestion on those pathways and then also provide alternative north-south with stuff many folks highlighted in the comments as well so generally we heard a lot of feedback relating to these five or four four bullet points and then we'll open it up for uh additional feedback and questions for um so uh kathy i see your hand up i'm just gonna cover um a few in the chat and then i'll go to kathy and then sean um there was some really good discussion and questions in the chat about this topic and i'm trying to scroll through there was a question for travis about what studies were done uh whether there were economic dispatch studies or reliability studies contemplating the nerc and whack reliability obligations and cathy also had a question about the pnl 2021 study that was referenced and if the link could be put in the chat it looks like the oto literature review has a reference for the 2020 study um ashley also asked about whether you could share a little bit more on the locations chosen for offshore wind looks more centralized while the bomb call areas are more southern oregon um there's also a clarifying question from troy about on slide 53 saying the total load on the oregon coast is one gigawatt or is that just around the south coast area that um you could clarify and then maybe i'll pause there for those and then cover the rest okay thanks yeah a couple of those questions i think are related to the footprint we considered so we we ran in this first study it was you know we depict four locations that span the coast that was our ideas just to kind of you know inspect the the characteristics of offshore wind and how they might vary across the coastline um and then also looking that of course so spatially but also in time as you saw me uh walk through today um so so that was our focus so the in terms of you know the coastal low the coastal load was north to south the thought was it's roughly order of magnitude it's not really a precise number but on the order of one gigawatt of load on the coast that could be served by offshore one um if the transmission north of south was was suitable to do that um and then richie helped me with the second question that had to do with um had to do with the footprint yeah the it might have been oh go ahead oh go ahead no please um the i think there was a clarifying question about whether one gigawatt was total load on the oregon coast or just in the south coast area yeah that's the total coast um and then jess had a comment about how we can ensure communities where the most offshore wind development is happening actually benefit from and receive that energy generation to improve south coast energy resiliency rather than being entirely sold to the broader grid or and or california grid yeah um go ahead that's a really good question um it's an important one the way it works right i mean there's so when the electronics is generated and interconnected you know it's not you don't really there's no way to trace that electron right it goes into the grid and the grid then serves uh power flows for with uh you know what the uh infrastructure can what the capacity is of individual lengths of the infrastructure so the way to sink the load on the coast is to ensure that transmission up and down the is suitable so that when the grid hit when the power hits the grid i mean it's not like there's a separate i just want to be clear that there's not a separate intertie into portland a separate one into san francisco right it i mean you know outside of talk about you know some sort of backbone that might interconnect specifically in certain places as the major kind of thoroughfare for for moving power this study you know looked at existing 230 kv bpa substations so once the power hits those substations provided that there is um there aren't any constraints on on the trend or failures on the transmission system north to south along the coast that power should go to the coast um and the coast should see a direct benefit and that's kind of uh you know i think the system operators have to keep that in mind you know to make sure that you know the coast can be served reliably and and but the benefits are are system-wide i mean everyone benefits it's not like i know that's that's a common question it's not just the coastal folks get the benefit or just the i5 folks get the benefit i mean it's been it's a it's kind of a rising tide you know we we all benefit from it and um but there are some acute power quality benefits that would be experienced near where the interconnections happen so that is a bit different in terms of you know um some things i mentioned in power quality so the to the the the stability of frequency and voltage you know you know along the coast particularly in radial extensions on the coast

        "text": " to talk about our collaboration going forward so I can report back to your board that those meetings have taken place we had four maybe five meetings between our two staff teams and one of those meetings included chair Harrington and mayor Lube the intent of those meetings was to move towards a signed agreement for our collaboration approach we're not quite there yet but we received comments back yesterday from City of tiger staff after our meeting last week it seems like we're moving in a really positive direction and we' found quite a bit of common ground in agreement so we're feeling very optimistic about our conversations moving forward so thank you for the additional time I think that it has been valuable for both of our teams talking a little bit more about city of tiger and some of their planning work in this slide as a reminder in 2021 after we had begun this ordinance process the city of tiger requested a 500 acre Urban growth boundary expansion known as River Terrace 2.0 that was approved by Metro Council last year so part of the reason this ordinance was continued for such a long period of time was to allow the Metro Urban growth boundary land swap process to play out and find out the final decision on that so when we had a decision on that a year ago we knew that 500 Acres was coming into Washington County's Urban growth boundary it was swapped for some land in Clackamus County this does cover part of the area that we had considered as a part of this ordinance so that area is now within the urban growth boundary it is no longer rural city of tiger will move forward in their comprehensive planning work they're planning for 4,500 homes and Associated businesses and Commercial areas as well as they move forward with planning and developing this area Tiger's comprehensive planning work will include extensive public process hearings Community engagement meetings and County staff will be participating in a technical advisory um role as a part of that comprehensive planning the background on the tile Flat Road Extension proposal and how we got here is listed on this Slide the connection was initially identified over a decade ago as a part of the South Cooper Mountain planning process it was further studied in Washington County's Cooper Mountain Transportation study and the urban Reserve Transportation study which was funded by Metro with the intent of allowing Washington County as the regional transportation system provider to have a better understanding of what transportation system improvements we need associated with future Urban growth boundary expansions it was interesting to see one of those expansions take place so quickly during the process of this ordinance prior studies all recommended the inclusion of the tile Flat Road Extension in the County's transportation system plan we specifically included it in our urban planning area agreement with the city of tiger which your board adopted by ordinance in 2021 and tiger city council also adopted at that time the initial ordinance proposed to your board did include a specific alignment of a roadway and did include findings that took an exception to Statewide planning rules in order to allow planning within a rural area the B engrossment of this ordinance walked that back to a refinement area what this slide shows is what those three different refinement areas look like Staff feel that moving towards the refinement area reflected that there is still a lot of coordination and a lot of things that we need to answer before we're ready to put that alignment on the map walking this back to the refinement area allows us to continue doing that collaboration allows us to flag for our community transparently though we expect there to be change in this area but it does not presuppose what that solution to these Transportation needs will be and it does not presuppose where something specifically will go so we have a lot of work ahead of us refinement area our locations where we've identified that there is a need for some kind of a transportation solution but again it does not presuppose what that solution will be the process of determining the need mode and function and general alignment will take place in the future we cannot fund or construct a capital project until we have finished the rest of those planning processes and we come back to your board and specifically draw a line within our plan documents so this is only the beginning of the process we're not prepared to do any of those other things what will likely happen is that city of tiger will finish their comprehensive planning for the River Terrace 2.0 area County staff will then bring forward an ordinance to make our transportation system plan match their transportation system plan as we do when any City adopts a transportation system plan once we know what tiger is doing within the River Terrace 2.0 area and at some point in the future we can consider future planning for the undesignated areas where we have drawn the refinement areas as a part of this ordin so the refinement areas really allow us to do that additional coordination work it's not just about our needs today it's about setting us up for success in the future we know that this area is changing we know it's growing we want to be ready for that I know there have been a lot of questions about looking at environmental impacts and specific concerns about there being a creek crossing with the tile Flat Road Extension that's all a part of the future work that will be done the Mountain Side Way Extension the north south South component of the collector facilities that we're talking about in this area also includes two creek crossings so we know this is an area that has a number of areas that will need to be studied in Greater detail again as a part of future comprehensive planning processes by Tigard and possibly by the county other Alternatives could emerge that we haven't yet identified that's kind of the beauty of the refinement areas it gives us that flexibility to change as um conditions change or as other planning work so our staff recommendation for today is that your board deliberate on be engrossed ordinance number 882 following those deliberations staff recommendation is to adopt the ordinance and by separate action adopt the findings and that concludes our staff report thank you I'm first going to open the floor to my my colleagues and myself for questions and then come back to comments but if you can't resist making comments now fine I'm not gonna object that so um do any commission District Commissioners have any questions of our staff with regard to today's presentation and how we've gotten to be engrossed ordinance 882 or on B uh engrossed ordinance 882 itself go ahead commissioner f thank you chair heon um thank you staff for your great presentation and all the work you're doing with this ordinance um I think I have uh four specific questions for you and especially the last two will probably be a repeat of what you said because you covered it very well um the first question I have is why is the Statewide planning goal exception is listed um we don't need a exception to Statewide planning rules in order to adopt this ordinance that's not included in our findings we did need an exception for the original filed ordinance and the a engrossment of the ordinance because those proposed an alignment within the undesignated um and at the time Urban Reserve areas which are considered Urban so we no longer need an exception for doing a refinement area the exception is no longer included in our findings for that reason so it's not included in being grossed ordinance nor is a exception part of the findings for being grossed ordinance correct thank you thank you Aon uh the the other question I have for you is um and you've covered it but it's a questions that keeps coming back so just bear with us as you repeat yourself and throughout the years um could you just briefly reiterate what triggered the the extra connectivity need within this area so um I'm actually going to go back to the slide that shows Tiger's concept plan because I think that's the best map that we have in this presentation actually this one is kind of okay from beaverton's plan too um so speak to both we can speak to both what I like actually about the Beaverton one is it's zoomed out a little bit more and so one of the interesting things about Washington county is how we have a crescent of urban area and so that means that there's a lot of pressure on our rural Transportation facilities to carry Urban traffic if we were building cities in Sim City or a computer program we would make them all round because that's really the best way to serve urban areas right it's that Hub and spoke model then of Transportation Systems works really well that's not what we're dealing within Washington County we have this Crescent shape that's also where our number of our Urban reserves were identified so we knew that that's where a lot of the future Urban growth boundary expansions would take place as as a part of building out those areas and making sure that we have the adequate level of Transportation needed and I mean multimodal Transportation it's important to consider additional connectivity so a part of identifying this particular extension is creating additional connectivity additional resiliency and redundancy to our existing transportation system when we initially did the Cooper Mountain Transportation study and the urban reserves Transportation study we um we're looking at the fact that this was an urban Reserve most of it was an urban reserve some of it's undesignated and we expected it to come into the urban growth boundary at some point and so that is what happened about a year ago and so as a part of that it makes the planning for these future connections even more important and again sets us up for success in not precluding connectivity that we may need 20 years from now does that answer the question yeah yes thank you um my my third question is can we add I think one more slide if you go to the one that shows the refinement area mountain sideway to the study area it's a question that came to me can you repeat the question can we add Mountain Side way to the study area it's it's in there yeah I don't quite understand so there's some of the nomenclature around the particular roadways has been a little bit confusing throughout this process so the tile Flat Road Extension is that East West portion and that's in that first refinement area that is outside the urban growth boundary and rural undesignated land the middle portion has an East West piece which would be the tile Flat Road Extension so this as I understand it the study areas are not um so specifically discreet as drawn correct they illustrative they are intended to be illustrative they're intended to be that flag in the plan that something is going to change and so again",

        "text": " lifting that up chair um I may be biased in this but I think Washington County has an amazing story to tell and I think sometimes and much of our conversation is the cuts what can't we do there's a whole lot we are doing in Service delivery each and every day and that's really really what I hear at the Crux of that request under the leadership of an obber as assistant um County Administrator liazon to the finance department she will be working with Finance as well as our County leadership team on continuing to debrief this budget process and look forward to determining how we can best um capture that story and being really clear with our departments because our departments are subject matter experts they're the ones who are closest to that story and can can build that um budget expectation for next year HS I I hope in my response you hear that staff understand uh what the request is and there's um a plan for how that will be addressed thank you and just to add on that I want to make another comment telling we always focus on the problems and what we have to solve in our issues right and sometime you to look at how good we are and how wonderful we are and tell that story not only for the community but for all the people who are working because absolutely you know you get beat down after you know all of the challenges and troubles that you have and looking back and going hey you know we're doing a lot of really good work and step back and give yourself that time to appreciate that and share that with the community is is great I just wanted to highlight and raise up one more time the um the specialty courts they like you said do tremendous work we've seen where they actually you know have effect and and they're producing results but the fact that they're not mandated by the state then there's no State money either unfunded or or underfunded you know money's coming down from it but clearly a place where we we know it's working it needs to be fully funded by you know our dollars because this is a place where no one else is going to fund it we know it's great work we're going to fund it and probably sooner or later everybody else will figure it out and um will be the the bkm and The Shining Star bleeding the way so good good job da thank you for that so i' I'd like to um just also respond to that um import a finer point on just the District Attorney's office and proposed budget so the district attorney even with a flat budget scenario was in in the place of not being able to support the specialty courts if not for the FTE increase that you see within um the proposed budget that is because the DA has to focus on mandated requirements and so it was really this Crux of is is the county I as the budget officer are also looking at the board's um budget principles and priorities willing to put forward a proposed budget that would cut specialty courts the answer is no and the reason why and just specialty courts yes I know we're on the District Attorney's office but this is a one Washington County um approach to Service delivery they are proven to reduce recidivism and as we look at our Public Safety and Justice Collective that is a goal reducing recidivism uh Miss kelbert will be talking about that a bit more once we get to Community Corrections and the increase in Community Corrections funding to get our Center to capacity so as I look at this area I am really proud of my colleagues in Washington count for the problem solving we've done and focusing on that clear goal within the system and addressing um in this proposed budget the challenges that we lifted up um based on board um leadership and direction of wanting to understand the challenges in our current Public Safety and justice system here in County I think um I if I can make a comment and and I know you have more slides so I'll be brief um this morning we keep hearing um this idea of services not funded especially when it comes to State role in in State adequately funding programs but the good news this year and what I'm really excited for moving forward is this morning in this budget cycle here we have the association of Oregon County's executive director in the room with us Gina Nichols so I I and I see that you're taking a lot of notes Gina so it gives me hope that um you know this will be something that AOC centers and really Advocates because I think it also Public Safety and Justice is a area or service area that a lot of counties can really get behind and express their concerns there's not a lot of dividing ISS you know everybody cares about their safety uh everybody cares about having safe communities because that means we have safe people in our community so thank you for joining us this morning and da Barton is also in the room thank you um I think your department was the one that had a lot of the wordss in the budget summaries so and I thought oh attorneys of course we'll have a lot more but I really appreciate the services I kept Googling last uh last week about oh this service and that service and what do they do so it's a you provide a lot of good services and it's not just the budget cycle time that I appreciate all you do uh but it's the time that we're for at least two weeks weeks or three weeks we're living and breathing what you do so thank you for your services thank you commissioner F it's actually a perfect segue into this next slide if we're ready we're ready okay so we are going to talk again about the impact of unfunded and underfunded mandates which you were all just talking about so this is this is great um some of the things you know we talk about unfunded and underfunded mandates all the time and I think Miss Angie touched on this earlier this morning um with the the board's to you know do more work in that area and ask more questions and be more prepared but one thing we're still struggling from all the ones in the last three or four years so that is no truer than of the District Attorney's Office who had just a number I mean it impacts the whole system but um a couple examples here the Ramos Watkins ruling it was the retroactive requirement for non-unanimous juries and so that meant that any conviction from a non-unanimous jury in a serious criminal case had to be retried or at least relooked at reviewed and many of these cases go back several years like several several years five 10 15 years several so while some cases settled in plea agreements many had to be retried and think about a victim in a case who might have been 5 years old when this conviction or decision verdict came down from a jury and were 15 years later 20 and they're coming back to have to do it all over again and so that's kind of the storytelling of the of the Mandate but the funding story is that there wasn't there weren't any dollars at that time to help the District Attorney's Office workload get all those cases back and figure out what to do with them and they have to do Outreach with victims and all of that so it impacted the entire department that way another unfunded mandate is mandatory expunction of some of their cases this didn't come with funding or FTE to to manage that and so they're trying desperately to follow the law and get cases expunged as needed which we know has an impact to people in the community who are trying to get jobs trying to get housing um basic needs met um so they were expected to absorb some of that without additional resources and then even further back than that I think were changes to Discovery laws that also impacted the DA's office so they became the central location for Discovery to be held stored and disseminated without any additional resources to do that as well so even when changes or mandates are a good thing good reform people are in favor of that happening if it doesn't come with the funding to address it then we're all you know it leaves the county all of you all of us kind of dead in the water trying to absorb and figure out how to make this happen um and doing more with less so um that's one of the reasons that the the case loads in the district attorney's office are the highest in the Tri County Area and it's really become unsustainable for staff including victim services and the digital evidence technicians the prolific increase in digital evidence has had a huge impact to workload as well so we all know phones tablets computers cloud storage devices digital surveillance even something as seemingly simple as the addition of bodyw warn cameras creates a significant workload when you think about the DA's office working with nine law enforcement agencies in Washington County and their potential for each agency to use a different vendor or a different software and to have to compile all of that into the DA's office um is quite a workload but even thinking about one incident that law enforcement might be called to maybe two three four officers deputies handling that they're all wearing body warn cameras so that could be hours and hours of a footage that needs to be reviewed as a district attorney's office worked through their requested budget scenario this year um Miss Angie just touched on a lot of what I'm about to say some really difficult decisions were put before all of us on to her Point earlier a flat budget meaning a reduction the District Attorney's Office had to really look at what is mandated how do we get sustainable case loads and what programs does that mean we have to look at eliminating which of course are some of the most effective amazing programs that we have and so um we did work with the office with um da Barton and his office on thinking about what would it take what does it mean how many Deputy District Attorneys operate one specialty court and what we found and that's the reason I read the whole big list to you all because there's so many it's not equivalent to one Deputy district attorney or one staff operating one court it's really Blended funding some of it comes from federal grants and so it's just really hard to articulate or figure out a one for one or we could preserve three specialty courts and we have to give up one specialy court and so that's that's the work you'll see in this budget um trying to maintain effective Services as well as think about the the folks",

        "text": " getting into the Weeds on data sources and assumptions but it is getting to the heart of uh priorities of concerns so for example we see the need for a meeting with environmental justice and Equity organizations and a listening session is probably not enough to really dig into some of the priorities and concerns and and um and key questions for EJ and Equity organizations so we would organize an organizational meeting to have that discussion and the the details of this is are something that we'll develop with Kerns and West over the coming weeks and then uh you all are joining a webinar today and we anticipate holding more webinars probably one to two more this year and they serve really to get updates um or to provide updates on the energy strategy and to get a sense of what's coming next so I'm going to try to summarize all of what I just said on one slide and we'll see how it goes so um how will these groups work and what's the difference so here's another go at that um so I'm just going to focus here on the timeline for this year and the timeline to inform the modeling and the technical analysis uh there will be work happening next year but I just want to focus on the near-term here to help keep things really clear so in July and August we anticipate holding as as I said several public listening sessions to hear from folks we also plan to organize some organizational meetings to deepen our understanding um in some cases and we will also plan to get the working groups started and the working groups will by topic be getting really into the Weeds on data sources on making sure that we using the most appropriate and Oregon specific data they'll be talking about assumptions and really getting into the the modeling um and then Odo staff are going to be working throughout this process together with our Consultants to synthesize the feedback that we're hearing we will work to post information on our website and to organize it in a way that towards the end of August helps us share with the working groups what we've heard um and help um and and we're going to ask the working groups to help us translate questions into numbers that's the that's the simplest way I can explain it so you can imagine there being some priorities that come out of the public listening sessions the organizational meetings and then the question will be well what can we do in the model about this or if not the model what can we do in some technical analysis and so the working groups are going to help us kind of make that link um and so the idea is that the working groups at the start will be meeting um to to work through the um the data and the assumptions and then they'll Circle back around and consider consider this feedback that we've received and throughout this process um the inter agency Steering group and The Advisory Group will meet approximately once a month to inform the process H and I um I failed in my animation so there's another box that I think will come up at the end but I just wanted to signal that we also see the um engagement with the tribes as an ongoing process throughout this process here I think that yeah Jessica hey Edith I I responded in the Q&amp;A but I I thought it was worthwhile to sort of let everybody know the answer um again another question from R who was asking about um whether there would be an opportunity to engage labor as an affinity group to have a deeper understanding of implications um from each of the the scenarios in the strategy and the answer is yes um we're hoping that that many of you out there and others would help us to be able to find engagement opportunities with um people and organizations that we may not have a direct relationship with uh so uh just to um share with the whole group that that's uh a part of our engagement effort is to identify areas where where people can help us engage with those who might really be interested yeah thanks Jessica and that's a perfect this is a perfect time to bring that up yeah absolutely um and then the the last thing I want to mention on this slide is just that we once we've kind of worked through this kind of July through August um series of meetings and conversations we plan to um pull everything together so that all of the stakeholder engagement will inform how we plan to undertake the modeling what the scenarios are expected to be and we'll have a webinar to explain how all of the stakeholder engagement all of the conversations that we've had has informed the uh the technical analysis and so that'll be another opportunity just to reflect back what we heard and what we were able to do with uh with with what we what we heard and what we learned so I'd like to talk in a bit more detail about the advisory and the working groups um because these are two structures that are going to be very important for the energy strategy and that um I think it's it's useful to just give a little bit more of a flavor so folks who are interested can start thinking about whether they might want to express interest in joining these groups so the the role of The Advisory Group um I called it a sounding Bo on an earlier slide so it's to it it it's really that it's to provide insights it's to suggest recommendations to ask questions to advise us um and sometimes to have difficult conversations uh that that are important to have um in in one room and and meet once a month over the um the whole project members of The Advisory Group will be asked to engage with their networks as well to help bring robust views to those meetings the uh idea of you know who who would who The Advisory Group would be comprised of uh we anticipate a diverse representation of communities of socioeconomic backgrounds Geographic areas perspectives expertise lived experiences lived experiences and subject matter expertise and there are no restrictions on who can express interest um I'll say that here we have some dates that that we'd like you to keep in mind we will be asking for expressions of Interest During the period that you see here June 10th 24th and we're working with Kerns and West to uh structure the kind of form that we'll have for how folks can uh submit expressions of interest and I think it's important to also signal that we're looking to July 9th or 10th to have a first Advisory Group meeting so those are dates that you can already keep in mind and consider um and we hope that you'll consider an expression of um sorry I've I've started to go completely off script so now I have to find My Notes okay um so the what's the scope of The Advisory Group and and how are we thinking about this so Odo will be making the selection of Advisory Group members and we're going to be guided by the scope of the bill so this text this you see here um comes from HB 3630 and we have to make sure that the Advisory Group um has representation has has people in the room who are able to inform a discussion on all of these topics that you see here so State energy demands and Trends energy resources uh technology choices considering to costs Energy Efficiency feasibility availability economic and employment impact energy burden and energy resilience environmental justice land use considerations natural resource impacts emerging Technologies and investment opportunities um energy generation transmission distribution infrastructure Energy Efficiency energy security and the impacts of broader markets Community benefits and Community energy resilience I usually don't just read a slide but I thought it was important because I think that many people on this webinar will see themselves somewhere in here and if you do uh you might want to consider submitting uh an expression of interest and I'll also add again from the bill we also feel that this is just important to make sure that the Advisory Group represents a diverse range of interests expertise education socioeconomic backgrounds communities Geographic areas of the state so if I turn now to the working groups um the working groups are uh the ones we get in the weeds so it's a forum to Deep dive into key topic areas which I'll show on the next slide um and also to understand and discuss the suggestions that have come out of the listening sessions um and the organizational meetings um and so who would be in a working group it's we're really looking for individuals interested in informing and able to inform topical areas of the energy strategy in more depth and we anticipate first meetings to be scheduled Ed mid July and for there to be kind of an intense period um July and August for the working groups um some of you might remember or might have even responded to a questionnaire that we sent around in April and the goal of that questionnaire was to help us uh Jessica should I keep going should I pause because you just popped up keep going but at the end we'll I'll jump in with the question okay um the goal of that questionnaire was to help us think about how to organize discussions around um technical issues in the energy strategy and we got 130 responses in total we we also had other questionnaires including um for environmental justice groups and this is a snapshot of who we heard from Jessie you want to ask your question now or you want me to show the other questionnaire slide I can go either way go ahead when you're when you're finished um uh just call in me and I'll I'll pop back up again perfect okay so um we also asked which topics people would be interested in engaging more deeply on um and we organize the list of topics here by how they're presented in House Bill 3630 um and you can as you can see um there was a lot of interest across these topics and and the last thing I'll say before bringing Jessica back on is that um that is informing how we're thinking about the how we'll organize the working groups so um when we get when we organize a working groups we'll likely divide up the topic a little differently so this is not uh set in stone um but I'll just say the language of the bill doesn't lend itself easily to how we'd organize discussions so what we have done is to take sometimes categories that are too broad like energy resource and Technology choices might be too big a topic for one group and we've tried to think of how the topics might be divided up more more effectively for a more effective conversation um so this is a starting point we'll be working on this with our Consultants we envision seven to eight groups organized roughly along these lines um and um we'll be working on a process for how we uh how we uh structure the working groups and bring people into the working groups Jessica this is probably good time for you to bring up the question you have actually",

        "text": " that in a form of energy security or in security if you can't afford fuel or electricity that's not a that's not a good thing even if Supply is available and when you think about um mitigation that could be done to reduce risks cost also matters we'll talk about that a little bit later um and and sort of the there's a declining value of of uh investment decisions you could make that cost is kind of goes up quite high at some of those choices we'll get to that a little bit later but we wanted to highlight that piece here's a strategy uh we don't pretend to know everything or that we're doing everything for the state um what we're really trying to do is coordinate a lot of different efforts um at the state level and local level utility level to bring together existing information recognizing that a lot of work's been done and is being done right now in this field um by our partners and we also we are doing some some new analysis some original analysis we'll get to that here but I wanted just to make a note that um we know that work's being done in this sector and we're trying at the state level to help coordinate that um from the state perspective to find the best way that we can to like I said help everybody increase our resilience and security all right a little bit note before we kind of get going into the for the content this is a fuel piece that I mentioned fuel resilience uh Senate Bill 1567 from the state legislature uh directs us to do do these things recognize that here in the Eastern region the Cascadia abduction Zone uh 9.0 earthquake may seem uh far away you may think it doesn't affect you and uh all the science says this shaking will likely not uh affect you from the shaking perspective of an earthquake but it will affect you from distribution of fuel and it may affect you from electricity um because considering sort of how the networks could be damaged fuel in the state even here mostly comes from the port of Portland uh fuel Terminals and is distributed out by truck across our state we've got some slides to kind of show the mapping of where fuel goes in the state here but just keep this in mind that even if you're not your buildings aren't damaged by an earthquake you may have uh be very impacted from the energy perspective by a megaquake so the state's asked us to look um at our facilities mostly public facilities across the state that have fuel and considered ways to increase um increased capacity of fuel the idea being that if we have more fuel on site even if it's a small amount at a time of emergency uh that fuel could be used for emergency response purposes um and uh you know by thinking about how long it might take for fuel to get to the region um it's better to have more supply on hand for that immediate response we'll kind to get to that a little bit here in a bit okay um more you know slide here with that QR code that takes you to leave to our website there's a little link there that's our project email uh basically we got a lot of ways to get in touch with us stay in touch with us and we'd like to connect with everybody here um this is really a note of what we've done we've done surveys uh public sector we've also done private sector surveys uh primarily utilities and uh fuel companies so if you're on this call from a utility you probably got an email from me or my colleague asking you to help us with the survey um a few months ago just want to recognize that's happened uh I think that's the end of my oh no one more slide here on the introduction sort of the lead in remaining work so we're doing these meetings I mentioned that we're going across the state uh this week and next week we have to do the big we have a couple big things left um assessing the fuel storage capacity and areas for increased storage that's a big piece of work that's yet to come this summer uh data collection is mostly done and now it's some analysis on those fuel locations uh and putting some criteria around what we might be looking for to increase fuel capacity in the future anyway we'll get to that um crossing the te. for our September submitt uh the deadline for our plan is the end of September uh we have to submit it to US Department of energy our federal partners and then as I mentioned they'll they'll score and grade us the last Point here is really something I want to mention and emphasize throughout this whole meeting is we are both required by the feds USD e and the state to review and update our plan on a regular basis every year every other year uh we're taking that to heart and so this is really the first iteration of our plan this 2024 plan um it's not going to be everything and I know that we're doing our best to make sure it's awesome document but it's not going to do everything we want which is okay because we're going to keep working 2025 2026 and Beyond uh to to keep talking with people to gather more data to do more analysis to be open for how things will change in the future new risks may be coming more apparent and we want to be able to address and consider those and future iterations of our plan so uh thanks for your help today on this project in 2024 if you feel like we' really missed something or you want to talk more that's okay uh because we have opportunities every year to keep working on this project um and really this is our our first big effort and we've got a lot of work yet to come um at that I'm going to pass over to Dr Casey stemman and she's going to lead uh the next piece of the presentation here yeah so thanks for joining us today everybody um what I'm going to start with is giving you an overview of the project timeline and the structure how we're approaching um the objectives that we're trying to meet and so that's where I want to start is with our objectives so as a reminder we're working to identify assess and mitigate risks to our energy infrastructure in order that we can plan for respond to and recover from events that could disrupt our energy Supply and so as we're working towards these objectives we're um approaching it through a series of efforts that starts with stakeholder engagement so the Gant chart on the slide right now at the very top is representing um our stakeholder engagement efforts they started at the end of last year when we were really getting the project um up and running and they span the entire timeline of the project so they'll wrap up this summer and I'll give you a little more detail as to what those engagement efforts had looked like um we also spent a large amount of effort focused on data collection um our technical analysis is very data intense and so we really concentrated on getting the most robust and and highest quality data that we could get our hands on We performed the risk assessment um which I'll giving you give you an overview of some of those preliminary results today and then from all of that feedback literature review Etc we were able to reach a point of um compiling some risk mitigation measures that we're going to present to you today and this is where we're going to really rely heavily on you guys to help us understand how those mitigation measures should be prioritized specifically in your region because the priorities obviously will vary region um region to region and then as Max mentioned we do have the fuel storage portion of this project um that spans a good timeline throughout the project as well so the spatial structure of the project is we adopted the six regions as defined by OEM um it sounds like many of you on this call may already be familiar with this map that's on the left of the screen here each of the regions are colorcoded and then of course we're reaching out to the tribal governments as well to understand their unique priorities here's a snapshot on the right of just the distribution of their headquarters across the state within the energy sector itself we're focusing on on three primary areas of electricity natural gas and liquid fuels so you will see things organized in this manner throughout the talk today so a little bit more on our project um stakeholder engagement efforts we started with the kickoff meeting and then these two yellow bars that are um overlapping in time one of them is focused on the private sector the other is uh public sector in both of these Arenas we did request data as I mentioned before and then we also were really working to better understand the threats that are impacting the energy sector across the state so we're wanting to get the perspective specifically from the private sector and then also what is unique to each of the six regions Statewide we do have um engagement efforts around the fuel storage component of the project and then right now we're in the middle of what we um refer to as the road show this series of meetings where we're traveling across the state um and with the tribal governments to get feedback um largely on these risk mitigation measures and of course we'll roll out the project as we wrap up and so this is just a snapshot of where we are in the road show um as Max mentioned we've met with the northwest region and Portland Metro and today now of course we're with you guys in the Eastern region so with our methods we um put a link in the chat for you guys to access a handout so if you don't have that up you're welcome to um refer to that now and you'll have more detailed images of these maps that are um just small screenshots on the slide right now we don't have time to get into each of the details for these Maps but we want you to have them for reference um as your con considering the risk mitigation meas measures later on and so we included a series of maps for the electricity sub sector the first one is focused on sourcing so this is looking at the different types of power plants and sources and capacity and so on throughout the state the next map is focused on transmission so these you know primary transmission lines Statewide and then we have one on customers which I'll actually get into a little bit of detail in the next slide for natural gas we're summarizing everything in one map so you have sourcing and transmission and the service providers all summarized in one location for liquid fuels we have actually quite a large collection of maps because there are several Commodities that would fall within this Sub sub sector we're using diesel here as an example so you have one focused on sourcing this",

        "text": " infrastructure different types of infrastructure how that energy flows through the energy system and we're able to analyze the risk as it relates to distinct threads this is a very data intense process and for the liquid fuel subsector we were able to secure sufficient data to conduct this technical analysis however given the time constraints of this project for the electricity and natural gas Subs sectors we were not comfortable with the the data that we were able to secure that we could conduct a robust analysis so what we decided to do was pivot and we created what we're calling a hybrid survey and what this does is it gives the utilities the service providers an opportunity to conduct a self assessment that gives us the data points we need to come up with our vulnerability rankings and I'll walk through how we're approaching that so for liquid fuels we did do our technical analysis for all the natural hazards but for natural gas and electricity we used the hybrid survey for um human cause threats because of the nature of these threats we can't create a hazard Zone and so for consistency we use that same hybrid survey approach for the natural Hazard for the human cause threats across all three of the sub sectors and so this is how we approached the analysis whether it was through the technical analysis or the hybrid survey we divided our types of information in four categories we start with exposure so this is looking at historical events future projections simulations a combination of those depends on the threat and what type of data is available and through that we're considering the assets that are exposed and how frequently they're exposed to that threat for sensitivity we're looking at the inherent qualities of the assets that would inform us as to how they would be affected by different threats and we're just looking at how many of these system elements are sensitive to a given thread then for potential impact we want to understand the customers impacted and the time it takes to restore service and for adaptive capacity we're looking at a collection of different measures whether they be physical or operational we are using operational in a very broad sense here and then we also considered the maturity of the implementation of those measures and so we can simplify these categories down into a raing system where each category gets its own score falling somewhere between zero and three we simply add those values up and that gives us our overall vulnerability ranking so in a scenario such as this one we have high exposure so we have a score of three High sensitivity which gives us a score of one high potential impact a score of three and then very high adaptive capacity and here the scoring is inverse so we get a score of zero this means in this case um for this region a great measures they've gone to Great measures to adapt to a given threat so we simply add these together and it gives us a total of seven which would fall into the moderate level of vulnerability so with that you guys have an overview of what's going on how we're approaching it and the different um approaches we're taking for the actual risk assessment the next half of our time together is going to be spent with you guys is really giving us a lot of feedback and so again if you haven't connected to SPO please do so um if you need a hard copy in the room U you can take a moment to do that we're going to take about five minutes for everybody to do whatever they need to do or connect to slido and then whenever we come back we're going to start um participating in the engagement through the slider e e can you guys yes but now it's a bad Echo technical difficulties everyone we'll get figure it out okay can you hear online Ronda said take just still get yeah just and by okay I'll just keep talking so it's not no surprise to there we go so it's no surprise to us that there's more fuel storage near population centers and that's what I just wanted to um note on on this slide but sp15 67 does ask us to look specifically at publicly owned um facilities so we're talking about OD do um local airports um gas motor pools and those kinds of locations and so when we're only looking at public facilities then the storage capacity of course gets significantly and um we're talking about now less than um 1.3 million gallons of storage capacity and it's no surprise to us that the private sector owns most of the storage so um and we only have like 222 tanks but we're looking at Public Utilities but earlier this month we met with ODOT Department of administrative Services parks and W Corrections Aviation all those folks that own and operate their own fuel sites and right now they are assessing their sites and looking to see if there's a strategic location where they could actually increase fuel storage again not to replace the fuel Hub these are small amounts of fuel so that we would have extra on hand for emergency response um purposes and at this point you know we do want to come up with a short list for legislators to consider and there is no current plan right now for a funding source to um for this work but that right now our Target is just to get a short list for legislators to can consider and then I don't know if you can tell from this map but the I5 fordor and West you know we all seen these Maps before this is the most uh impacted area towards the coast and so perhaps those locations might not be the best options for increasing fuel storage but we're looking at the Cascades um region here and so uh looking pretty good for possibility to increase fuel storage but even though Studies have shown that the Cascades region won't be uh impacted directly you're going to get extended power outages and you're going to experience fuel shortages so you know we're looking at locations that have adequate backup power or ability to put in backup power so here are your locations and I I think our question to you all in the region is do you have locations that have adequate backup power um that you might want to consider increasing fuel storage and if you do you're going to get an opportunity here in a short while to say yes I do and then our agency will reach back out to you and begin those talks and just want everybody here to understand that whatever locations are being considered will be evaluated against our risk analysis results against dogami um science made criteria with the islanding that we're talking about with the state will look like after a Cascadia event um and then I do want to also say that don't we're not ruling out any location because while we're planning for the worst case Oregon experiences winter storms often Southern Oregon is cut off from the supply chain for a little while so you know whatever Mak makes sense um whatever you think is a good site just let us know we can just vet it and and put it through the criteria we have established criteria for fuel points of distribution for a Cascadia event that FEMA help us put together and that's you know so we have that list of criteria as well so again we're going to evaluate each location and when we get to that short list we're going to be meeting with communities as well because um there might be added health or environmental risk and we want to make sure that they get to avoid their concerns and we're asking them to bear this additional risk on behalf of preparedness and disaster resilience so um that's where we're at right now are there any questions about 1567 all right then I'm GNA turn it over to KY yeah so this is your first chance to communicate with us by a slid out so U we're just wanting to know if you're interested in G with Odo to work on efforts to increase F storage capacity please tell us yes or no if you are filling it out in the room handwritten please make sure that your contact information is on them so that if you do want Odo to follow with you they have a way to do so so what we're going to do now is move in to preliminary feedback or preliminary results and we're going to have a rhythm them to our correspondents now so we're going to start with stakeholder engagement feedback and I will let you guys know who has been giving us this information what they've been telling us what their feedback is and then we'll do a quick checkin from there we're going to move on to our preliminary results for the actual risk assessment and this will be divided across the three sub sectors so electricity natural gas and liquid fuels and we'll follow this same series of content so we'll start with who's engaging with us um give you that those overall vulnerability rankings in the form of a matrix I'll dig into adaptive capacity a little bit to highlight some of the nuances in the data and then we'll do a quick checkin and then finally we'll get into the risk mitigation measures here we've divided it across four categories one is all systems so very high level approach that could apply to any sub sector and then we'll go through each of the sub sectors electricity natural gas and liquid fuels and here we'll probably spend more time with you guys giving us feedback than me speaking to you and so I'll tee up the risk mitigation measures and then our efforts are really focused on you guys telling us how you want them prioritized and so this is the stage that people have found a bit cumbersome on their devices prioritizing them you're dragging and dropping so you're welcome to use the hard copies in the room if you don't have a laptop so let's Dive Right In to stakeholder engagement first who has been giving us information we have 14 44 folks um total that have have been participating thus far their distribution across the state is summarized in the map on the left so each of these circles are sized by the number of respondents they're colorcoded by the region that they're located in you can see that Portland metro and wamit Valley tend to high have the highest representation but we have had responses from across um all six of the regions in the top right you can see that the majority of folks are from the government that's the big yellow box and then we also have a good number from private sector and consumer owned utilities those are the blue boxes in the middle and then a number of nonprofits and and some other categories as well and to our knowledge 15% of the folks who have engaged with us thus far do have some association with environmental justice issues so what have we been asking folks well as I mentioned before one of our primary um pieces of information that we're trying to understand is threats and so this map summarizes the types of threats and the",

preparedness um I often joke in these meetings that we're not talking about nuclear safety but if you want to talk about nuclear safety you can at another time um today talking about energ security and our energy security plan we're working on right now um so next we have people online uh we've got the owl device here um the owl picks up and it will track sound in the room um so just keep that in mind if you have any side chats with your neighbor the might go to you and see but that's how it goes um I do a quick introduction of our team here just so people know who you're who you're staring at and we have a slide here with just some basic information um de Henry works with me um at Department of energy um people may know de from her role on emergency support for fuels our emergency manager also energy security program manager as well so a lot of work for us uh we have Michaels um an energy analy Policy analy Department of energy um and Micha talk at the end about another project that as ongoing and two members of our Contracting team Dr uh say PhD from State go there you are yes you are we are building um and Andrew eorth of our Consulting team and Tom Cecilia another member of our team is online today uh so we have a lot of information today to give you and just sort of a as a um maybe the very first thing I'll say is this is we're trying everybody s to a lot of Z presentations we're trying to this is Hy so there little complexity to it all we're trying to make it um not so One Direction so we are going to be asking mid buness but welcome we're going to be asking a lot from you from online people in the room to help us to get us feedback to get this input just kind of two ways we're GNA well there's one way we're going to do that two two ways to do it um there's a tool called slido which is Casey we talk a little bit more about uh that's on your phone you can get it through this QR code um or the link we found that if you have a laptop it's easier to use a laptop via the link than on the phone just because it's IP is kind of small on your phone we also have the same that's so for online phone laptop is the way to your computer's way to go in the room we also have um these print outs people might have print out they're the same questions that you would see on the online version uh that's just be printed out if you prefer to uh to hand WR kind of work on the paper that's okay um please feel free to do so we'll collect afterwards we did a similar presentation yesterday in t um we've allocated two hours for this block of time we were probably wrapped up in about 90 minutes so to be honest just on sort of for your awareness what's going to happen but we welcome questions in discussion and you know we're here to talk so as long as we need put Just For Thoughts on let's see what else I recording the meeting uh so people know about that um muted a lot of information yeah okay I think we're good to go there on the very basis of okay we all right while we're talking I should say um so obviously in we for our plan our work is a Statewide effort um we're doing meetings in the regions regions across regions across the state uh we use a regional delineation set up by Oregan Department of Emergency Management they divide their regions into six regions across the state uh just for context um so today it's m Washington clus and and Columbia County as the Portland metro regions dived by or BM that we're using as well like I said yesterday we were in t for considered the North Coast region tomorrow we'll be in peton uh for the Eastern region next week bend Salem and so we're covering the state here in two weeks with similar uh content we have meing specific information later in this presentation so you can see some data some information that's focused on the Metro region I recognize that many of you here at online represent organizations that cover more than just natural Invasion and that's okay um we'll talk about sort of how to interact with us sort of the context of that a little bit are you gonna do introduction yeah we can do that yeah know online okay let's do that so we gotta know who we are how about we start over here I J hi good morning I'm Jan Wilson resilience coordinator with cl hi an name ISO I am a Milwaukee resident um and also a graduate researcher with our civil engineering envir hi I'm Mar

with the electric utilities I'm and in governs online do we have the ability for folks to speak or is it okay go TR sure fo you g introduce yourself I hope the my audio is not great so I hope you called on me I'm Diana fos I'm the senior policy analyst uh for the underground storage tank program at the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality sorry and I think you called on me as well this is Aaron Fox I'm part of Washington County Emergency Management and uh I'll be taking over the fuel plan once Scott Porter retires so for good so that's where my involvement later good good morning my name is Jack kerid I'm on the board of Engineers for sustainable future I've spent 40 over 40 years in the energy industry I've written a book fueling America and inside's journey I've given over a 100 presentations on radios television and podcasts on a broad range of renewable energy issues recent work here has been on the critical energy infrastructure and the risk that it presents to our state and to our city you you say denell yes hey Dell Peterson Port of Portland um I kind of married a couple of these things I develop our res resilience program at the for the port of Portland at the airport well and Port wide and then I also facilitate our energy carbon action team so coordinating all of our efforts managing uh energy Port White Diana you introduce yourself to the please oh sorry I thought I already did so Diana Foss underground storage tank senior policy Analyst at Oregon DEQ sorry about that Haley I'm Haley ellot I'm actually with city of Hood River so I just picked

Cecilia Oregon Department of energy thanks Tom ver hi Veronica Leonard she H pronouns I'm the associate deputy director of programs at Latino Network here to represent Tony defel our executive director yeah I believe that was everybody is there anybody on Zoom that missed uh I'm Coen the uh Farm production and conservation uh USDA county executive director for T Columbia Cloud up and Washington counties and I'm just here to listen morning everyone laer of Oregon DQ fuel T seismic stability analyst cool thanks thanks everybody online and the room appreciate that okay so we talk about who we are um we just got about agenda schedule what we're going to talk about a little bit of the overview timeline and then going to pass it over to Casey kind of walk through um methods and share information preliminary the slido is the um the program I mentioned earlier that going to help us um doing some work we're going to talk about fuel storage stakeholder engagement feedback risk analysis results and risk mitigation measures and it's really in the risk mitigation measures discussion where we're going to we're going to ask for your in drout but really at that end what we're going to look fig your input um talk about next steps and then might as well talk strategy for just a minute and then talk and off we go so I'll keep this brief I have some opening introduction um Mark just about who we are organ Department of energy here's our title slide um so you know it's it's a 120 FTE or so right now doing all sorts of really interesting and engaging work um you know including I mentioned our group that does nuclear safety energy Security emergency response for fuels um all sorts of other great projects that works on as well um I talked about the goals here but really just to reiterate um the risk assessment results um is fairly data heavy I hope you find interesting in engaging um it's good work and good results and it feeds into the mitigation methods that we're going to talk about as well and so looking for you know your input on a lot of this details to come and then of course who we are uh oo our Contracting friends CNA um Halen alri is a subcontractor to C who may have heard of alen Al was a lot of work in state on cic resilience cic analysis geotechnical hazards been working with us uh Oregon pu staff has also been working on us very closely not here today um but we've been working very closely with their team of on this project and you everybody here okay so I wanted to go through just to kind of a set um why we're even why are we doing this why what's this all about State energy security plans um we are doing this uh for a couple reasons one because the federal government said we had to the state government said we had to and three it's a really good ide um to do a state energy security plan and the analysis that were undertaking and coming up with um recommended mitigation options uh for us to work on towards",

confirm Cheryl yes I am that was so strange okay I but I apologize I'm not sure I could see that people were speaking but I could no longer hear so I logged off and and uh returned so my apologies so chair Grail I'll turn it back over to you we've had a motion uh that um councilor Devlin made and I made a second to it and the motion is a to um support the the staff recommendation I don't know whether there's needed uh to be two separate motions here one to add Banco Santander and the another one to not add Key Bank I don't know if you need an affirmative not adding Key Bank or not so anyway if um thank you sorry madam chair I do have two motions um kind of it to that effect but that doesn't mean you could make I mean I believe that uh councilmember devlin's motion was the staff recommendation was really the combination of those two so um that was my understanding and I'll make certainly make that change to the motion language as it goes into the minutes unless council members want to change that now that you're comfortable with the motion that was made thank you uh council member that one's comfortable Vice chair house since you provided the second are you comfortable still yes I am okay well it sounded like there's already been plenty of deliberation are we ready to call the roll secretary Cornett please call the roll Perry choctude and buyer Cindy Condon yes Richard Devlin yes Marcy Grail yes can't how yes Jordan Truitt yes motion carries Madam chair thank you uh Mr Skidmore thank you we look forward to working with you uh in the future Sicily's been a great asset to helping us and we look forward to working with you as well thank you Mr chair all right uh the next and final agenda item is the Muddy Creek energy project appointment of special Advisory Group this is an action item again we have Todd Cornett assistant director for citing and Council secretary to present thank you madam chair um during the last council meeting I did mention this I think it was during Hillary foot's presentation uh or his public comment I don't recall but but there was um some comment about the lack of large-scale solar projects in the Willamette Valley and I had to mention that at that point we did have a notice of intent submitted we just had not had a chance to review it fully to make sure that it had everything that was needed subsequent to the June 1st meeting that has been done everything that was that is required in a notice of intent was included and so we do have this notice of intent which is effectively live now um I will get into the details so the notice content was submitted on May 19th of this year and the application um is for the Muddy Creek energy Park thank you for advancing the slide Nancy um as you are aware the submission of the notice of intent is the very first step in the process for obtaining a site um applicant is the Muddy Creek energy Park LLC they are a wholly owned subsidiary uh hanwa Q cells use Corp and in the next couple of slides I'll go over uh the the details of the project and the location but because the facility is greater than 12 acres the project location is on high value Farmland it is in high value soils going back to the one of the prior presentations the threshold for abstract jurisdiction is met and so that is why it is uh within the jurisdiction of the energy facility citing Council Nancy you can advance the slide thank you so this gives you kind of a laundry list of of the description of the facility so um kind of the main description is that it's 199 megawatt facility solar PV solar generation it would be located entirely without in within unincorporated Lynn County and entirely within the County's exclusive Farm use Zone therefore um a goal exception to um goal three will be required again going back to Patrick's presentation um we'll have a lot of different conversations because of the type of farm use and the location of this project but it will have to go through the goal exception process so you can see in the secondary list the related in supporting facilities it's typical of what we have seen with other solar projects it would include you know the battery storage system as an option um and the system would include 12 feet 36 feet by 10 feet tall enclosures and that would be located sort of in the center of the project would include a fairly short uh 230 KV gen Pi line and and I'll I'll show another slide which shows the location of the project and it'll make more sense about why that's so short inverters and Transformers a collector substation 34.5 KV collector lines a seven foot tall perimeter fence and you can see you know 100 on 1588 Acres or 2.5 square miles so a full perimeter fence surrounding that that site and then in Service Roads um probably around the perimeter of the project as well as throughout the internal site as well next slide please so this is a zoomed out version um you can see the Blue Line running down the middle of the slide is interscape five so you can see the black lines kind of in the center is the project location this would be the site boundary and so you can see that it's immediately adjacent to Interstate 5 and at the very bottom of the slide you can see how the the lines of I5 start to jar a little bit and really just off of that the slide is um Eugene and Springfield so it's just really north of Eugene Springfield um you can see to the the West I don't know how well you can see the slide but you have Junction City and Coburg and then to the north of the site on the east side of the highway is Brownsville so this gives you a sort of a bigger sense of where it is so it's right there just north of Eugene and Springfield right along I-5 so next slide this is more of a zoomed in um map again you can see I5 is a little more to the left of the slide you can see the black lines are the project boundary and then the green line that kind of runs through it is an existing 230 KV Pacific core transmission line so that's what I would assume the reason why they're proposing the project in this location um the green Hollow Square it's a little bit hard to see but you can see the purple line um that stands out a little bit more just at the very top of that purple line is a green Hollow Square thank you that is the existing substation yeah that's the existing Pacific cord Diamond Hill substation this is why you know the purple line would be the gentai line that's why it's a very short Gentile line um you know the project surrounds where it would interconnect with the grid so again probably the the main reason why they're proposing this is it would be very a relatively inexpensive to connect it to the grid based on its uh proximal location to the transmission line in the uh the yellow Square you can kind of see at the bottom of the um purple line that would be the collector substation for the facility and then the solid green square would be a 10 acre centralized battery storage area so that would be where the battery energy storage system and I talked about the uh the sort of the configurations or the the diameters of the um the container units you know that would hold the batteries that's where they would all be located it's in there so it gives you a sense of where the project is located and the facilities associated with the project are there any questions about the configuration um yes Madam chair yes council member Devlin um this is not to State anything for the record about the council's ultimate decisions relative to this but if I've got the area correctly and I'm looking at it on other Maps it appears that there's at least there's one area that is set aside for Wetlands preserve that might be close to the area but it appears almost all of the rest of the area is in active cultivation and I don't know if that's for grass seed given where it's at or if it's something else but it all appears to be or much of it appears to be an active cultivation yeah thank you councilmember Devlin I believe that is the case um so when we received the notice of um you know it the purpose of the notice of intent is that it's a a fairly generalized overview of what the project is who's proposing it where it is um so at this point we we do not have all of those details in the record my understanding though is you are correct I believe if not the entirety of the facility then certainly the most of it is in grass seed production um just in in that area typically in Lynn County there's a lot of grass seed production in that area and I believe this is um that as well we will certainly know more about that as we proceed further into the review process um and that all that information will be required to be in the application once it's submitted but uh but again I I believe you are correct thank you um I don't have this on any of the slides but I will make notes since we are just working on it right now trying to get the notice out uh again we you know we've determined that everything um required to be in the notice of intent is in the notice of intent and um we are working um particularly Chase uh Mickey Walker is working on the notices and so we intend to have a notice a public notice sent out on Tuesday or Wednesday so this would be um the adjacent property owner notice email notification and then likely Thursday of next week we'll have the newspaper notice out so that will alert um if they're not already alerted to",

Webster I am a senior administrative law judge at the office of administrative hearings and I am the um Council appointed hearing officer uh serving today as on this matter and serving today as the presiding officer for this public um we all know it's uh Thursday uh November 17 2022 I'll note that it is about oh it is 6 21 p.m at this time um we have uh people attending in person at the um Oxford Inn Suites located in Hermiston we have folks appearing via um video conference and we have folks appearing uh telephonically um uh Kellen I guess I want to check in with you and um see how many comment cards you've received there I have I have two um and then the applicant I presume is going to but they didn't fill one out so I have two so far in the room okay and um have other participants raised their hand or signaled that the uh participants that are appearing virtually if you received any other ones thank you uh it doesn't look like there's anybody online um well then I will I'll continue on um I'll note that the purpose of this public hearing is to provide an opportunity for the public reviewing agencies and the applicant if they wish to do so uh present to present oral and written testimony on the West End solar project application for site certificate and the draft proposed order uh as you we were just discussing or you were just discussing um we have a 22 day record of the public hearing comment period on the draft proposed order and it is scheduled to close at the conclusion of this hearing I don't know if there will be requests to extend that period or not but if there are we will address those in the at the conclusion of my presentation of what to expect during public hearing anticipating um I will call on each person interested in providing oral testimony starting with the applicant then the people in person and then those any on the webinar and then any by phone the council members May provide comments or questions to the applicant during this process when we have a bigger crowd we uh sometimes put a time limit on um the amount of time but I think tonight uh at this point if there's only uh a handful or so of okay um if there's only a handful of folks who want to provide comments along with the applicant we know we'll give you the time that you need and we'll only use the Sheep hook if you go on way too long uh if a council member asks a clarifying um the time will be stopped we won't hold that against the the uh public member making the comment and then we'll restart the time if need be okay and this is a reminder also we'll go over once again what uh Kellen had mentioned earlier that um this is the opportunity for the public to um make their comment and um raise their concerns or and if not raised at this time uh that any concerns in the future will be considered waived pursuant to 345-0150 220 subsection five A and B a person who intends to raise any issue that may be the basis for a contested case must raise the issue in person or virtually at the hearing or in a written comment submitted to the Department of energy before the deadline stated in the notice of public hearing which as I indicated was today November 17 2022. a person who intends to raise any issue that may be the basis for a contested case must raise the issue with sufficient specificity to afford the council the department of energy and the applicant an adequate opportunity to respond including a statement of facts that support the person's position on the issue to raise an issue in a contested case the issue must be within the council's raised in writing or in person or virtually prior to the close of the record of the public comment period uh is which is uh tonight and raised with sufficient specificity to afford the council the department and the applicant adequate opportunity to and one time for this time with feeling to raise the issue with sufficient specificity a person must present facts that support the person's position on the issue uh and I understand uh at this point Kellen you have uh perhaps the applicant and two others who wish to make comment correct okay so as I indicated uh the commenters can have the time that they need to make their statements I want to give some instructions um prior to testifying and providing comment I ask that uh you a state your full name with spelling you provide the name of the organization or group that you are representing the title if you're representing an organization or group and the physical mail or email address if you uh wished and and advise if you wish to receive notice of the proposed Kellen do you want me to go through the requirements again or do you think we're I think we're good okay uh Kellen do you want to um do you want the applicant to uh comment first or do you want the members of the public to go first here we had it structured where it was applicant public Council applicant so application first if that sounds okay to you that's fine by me so is um is there a representative from the applicant present at with you in yes yes than if there's more than one of you feel free to yeah my God thank you uh hello my name is Rob carulla I'm a development manager with yours energy America uh representing the applicant uh ee West End solar you're a solar Holdings LLC um just wanted to say that we are excited about this project excuse me I'm sorry to interrupt you but would you spell your name because I'm not going to try to get that right that's okay it's Italian uh karula c-u-r-u-l-l-a it's on various paperworks that uh vodo has already we are excited to be here uh representing this project um we think it's a great site uh foreign energy project given the uh existing energy infrastructure uh crisscrossing the site uh and adjacent to it um a little bit about our company uh year with energy America we've been developing owning and operating utility scale wind and solar projects for over 30 years in the United States we were one of the earliest developers of wind in California back in the late 80s we've developed owned and operated utility scale solar in the United States for over 10 years um and closer to home here in Umatilla County we developed own and operate the combine Hills one and two wind farms outside of Milton Freewater we are I'm here and happy to answer any questions that come up I want to also just mention uh our project is split into two Parcels the landowners for both of those Parcels are here and they will speak as well the Western half of the Porsche the Western half of the project is owned by Art Pryor the eastern half is owned by Steve and Wanda Scott and they are both here and thank you for well welcoming us and happy to provide any additional questions no any comments or answers I will not I will not provide any thank you do the um others on behalf of the applicant want to add anything well those are the folks I am I believe that are going to provide okay their oh I'm sorry oh I'm sorry okay sorry Allison Okay so I don't see anybody rushing up there um also for the applicant so do we go now to the um uh like maybe the landowners or members of the public to go forward the the the it looks like the two folks that are going to provide comment are the landowners so yes so Stephen Scott and one okay yeah she'll let me do this okay thank you for having uh given us an opportunity to address this uh my name is Steve Scott my wife Wanda is uh right back there and and one of my three boys is is uh interested in this so he decided to come to this meeting I I think maybe it might be helpful if you understand the property owners and who they are and so I want to just give you a little background on the less on the uh uh the Scott family uh I grew up in Stanfield when school in Stanfield my wife went to school in Hermiston we dated in high school and got married a couple years out of high school I went to work for Les Schwab she told me I had to get a job so I went to work for Les Schwab and I like going the word for Less Robin Hermiston because the hermiston's home and I didn't have to go anyplace else so but if if any of you have uh are familiar with the Les Schwab company uh they promote from within and so if you want to get a promotion you have to and so I did or we did as a family and we moved about three and a half years after I went to work for the company to Legrand uh got into the management program the assistant manager program uh spent about five years maybe five and a half years there moved to Salem had an opportunity to be a store manager and Salem at a brand new the old Shred the North North Salem on Commercial Street Fred Meyers Fred Meyers got out of the out of the automotive business and Mr Schwab bottom out and several of the towns around there so I got an opportunity to go to Salem I did not want to go to Salem it was a big town and I was intimidated by the bigger cities but after about two weeks of driving through town and you know I was just like the rest of them go in and out and off you go we spent about three years in Salem uh we wanted to get back to the eastern part of the uh the area and the company was building a new store in Kennewick Washington so we applied for that got that store it's been about four years there and an opportunity in Hermiston came up so we were excited we we moved to Hermiston bought a little place out in the country with a couple acres and uh you know it was home it was about halfway between where she grew up and where I grew up so so we had a good time uh coming to Hermiston and raising our family we had uh we have five kids um and they're uh they're all excited about this West End solar project the uh the thing that I we had an opportunity to buy some land several years ago and",

        "text": " through graduate school as well we gradu school as well we can get it from undergrad to PhD at this point so we've been pretty successful in ensuring that our students go those routes if they don't go thatout we' also develop a technician training track importance of the technician training was that uh we recognized that some folks didn't need to be um have a PhD or a master's or a bachelor's in science to be effective lab technicians and and so we've also beg that development and have several technicians right now hired that CTI Trav numbers that are working through their uh their trp uh in 201 22 we sampled the Columbia River at Hampford reach to develop a Columbia River Matrix for laboratory ion exchange test what that is it's a a simulant of the Columbia river that we can utilize to test our ion exchange materials to ensure that the artificial muscles are able to detect the contaminants in that particular area in the hamper breach because um the laboratory tests work well but unfortunately the laboratory tests are very specific to a neutral pH water that does not have any of the co- competing ions that we see at the hand reach and then in 2023 we developed and implemented our first sampling and Analysis plants for the first foods we did this at the W site we went off of the hord site and you saw that I mentioned we developed those sampling protocols for the hord site we utilize those in the develop of this s sampling analysis plan the big reason why we didn't do this originally at H at the hord site is because one we didn't want them uh we didn't want to concern them too much with fact that this is the first time we're doing this and so we wanted a test site the l site is a CTI own site just down river from the hord site and so it has a very similar set of soils and plant communities and then this year we proposed a Hanford solar and storage proposal on the Hanford industrial lands and the c2r seated LS consistent with the carbon fre energy leasing effort and the department of Energy's clean the clean energy Mantra so this is currently where we're at and we are we are looking forward to seeing how that shapes up so I want to talk a little bit about our travel member scientists and technician training beyond what we've already discussed here are a number of our interms of various levels of technicians um our scientist training track is really the profession for the professional development of our travel members son to become scientists we have have opportunities for high school students for undergraduate students for graduate students and finally we've got this PhD track that has just opened up for Lauren on the right in the middle there and we also have our technician training track it's a non-degree pathway to develop the techn technical competence and environmental sciences and the young lady on the right uh Des sha dick she is um one of those techn and has done an exceptional job and I anticipate that she will continue to grow in this field we've also done some Botanical restoration and some research here's the Pacific northwest side side office prison protected designation area um this is just Northeast of the p&amp; campus it's right along the river there um there's a little uranium Plum not too not too far from there underneath um hopefully we'll Capt some of that in the sa R just kidding we'll see it I don't think we're looking at that um so we did a number of things we developed the soil and moisture sensors to automate our Greenhouse irrigation we produced roughly 40,000 plant in fiscal year 17 replanted approximately 12 acres of this land uh produced a number of seedlings have have continued to our ongoing cheat grass trial we all recognize the the negative impacts of Che grass on the site and and on the ecosystem in general and the need to improve that so we consider that one of the environmental cont threats that we think we need to address and deal with uh we did some seaing trials at our Field Station to understand first Bo and um some of those seing Trails were to understand how sandberg's POA could help control CH grass we are prop we are planning to propose and some changes to the restoration manual to ensure that we increase the number UE sandur Blue Grass uh seating to ensure that uh we reduce fire risk from the that sheet graphs some Cactus tests were completed in fiscal year 21 at this site that you see here and also under our solar panels and in our at our Field Station to understand the impacts of U the solar panels and the cheat GS and then we have been working towards uh some research to understand how to improve overall restoration of the shrub step species that support first so we're no longer laboratory accredited in 2019 much of our staff members that we had at the time many were non- tribal members and moved on to work at the hord site uh and some of them moved on to work in the energy field so um from 2019 on we began restaffing but at the time this demonstrated that we had the ability with this Quality Systems and um the processes that we had developed those standard operating procedures to to obtain and retain accreditation through that period time here's one of our interns assisting toil we talked about the tribal risk calculator and the importance of that to do that we developed a GIS display that took the concentrations of various samples that had been collected at the handford site and reported to the handford site and we assigned some risk to those based on the trip of subsistence scenario and had put together an ability to display that risk for the 100 B um so through the natural resource damage assessment we're obviously involved to look at a number of Assessments here some work that we are we'll be starting here very shortly is a hyperic study of the hampon reach at the Columbia River um we're hoping to demonstrate potential River impacts to upwelling and organisms which ultimately two of at least two of those benic organisms two two families of those B benic organisms are first foods and many of the other first food depend upon those organisms no this just for the reach the r reach so some access and sampling protocols we develop these protocols to access the hord site uh we' also developed some sampling documents that were that were prepared to comply with those neac Institute standards and then as I mentioned we performed last year our first sampling and Analysis plan for the first foods in at that test site wanit and we did so to ensure that the protocols were effective we did that again this year and uh are currently working with Pacific Northwest National Laboratories to build internal capacity on some of the methods that we hope to utilize in the long term and uh we are also working to as an organization acquire the former chemical depot lands at least a portion of those lands and there are several Circle remedies intact on those lands and those Circle remedies will give us an opportunity to demonstrate our ability to do long-term stewardship and to grow that capacity around first foods access sampling and long long-term management of the Circ remedies next slide so that was a look at the past here's a look at the future so ctr's vision for future management of the Hampford lands includes our definition of long-term stewardship we also have a vision for that long-term stewardship ultimately we'd like to return to our former role of the stewards of those land and resources and our commitment to doe for those long-term stewardship is will continue to work to become long-term partners and managers of all the lands and resources at Hanford and we will work ly and respectfully with all those parties involved and prudently use that funding provided by the US Department of energy to meet both those goals and our own policy goals so we have an endstate vision for the handford site that is that is clean restored protected enhanced and accessible um clean being below our own health standards consistent with that tribal subsistance scenario restored ensuring that the uh ecosystem services and the equivalency of those services are restored protected ensuring that it's permanently protecting the quality and quantity of both cultural and natural resources that it's enhanced for the continual Improvement in the quality and quantity of accessible natural resources at the site and it is safe and open access by CTR members U for the use of those traditional lands and resources throughout the UN also we we defined the hamper should not be further developed unless explicitly done through government to consultation that we should get the first R of refusal should land become available within that seated territory and that we'll continue to work towards becoming long-term partners of the site we continue to be proactively engaged in managing the national cultural resources at or affected by uh our Nate vision for management of the handford lands is consistent with the closure of the Seventh Generation report this is the 2017 Edition that was presented to the state traffic government working group we would like to be the long-term partners and managers of all the lands and resources to Hite to ensure that the federal government upholds its Trust responsibility participate in the in this longterm multigenerational Mission and that and that uh we try to get most of the long-term stewardship Concepts consistent between the department of Energy's handford long-term stewardship program plan which has some differences between uh that plan and the closure for the seventh generation and it's important it's important to have those similar in the model to and for do to utilize those travel view points Andi access and use just somebody's question earlier us Mak a question before you move on the first um C we'll have to probably negotiate that has territories as well to the West C to the east uh and some of those likely overlap as the treaty WR or the writers of the treaty U were less uh precise I think than they could have been and I think there was also benefit to the US government to ensure that there is potentially in I mean just what we know from uh so when we look at the river vision and the Upland Vision the Upland Vision describes how the big game roots and berries are impacted and the touchstones to improve them here we're looking at the river vision and the and the uh water and fish as critical to the river Vision within that River Vision there are five T Stones that's hydrology geomorphology connectivity riparian vegetation and biota so i' I've changed these restoration actions to be largely based on ones that are at",

on just the issues you're tracking and I think that actually what's happening sort of overall in the headlines really makes a difference for kind of the tone and tenor of how the issues that you care about most actually play out in the capital so with that said um I just grabbed a few of the headlines from the day that session ended on March 7th to just sort of give a flavor for how the session went and actually the boldest of them is the one that that I think really stands out the most as someone who's been through a lot of short sessions um I think this is my eth and also um who's who also has experienced the sort of tumult of the last several legislative sessions just that this one seemed to go pretty well as far as the partisan ranker goes that has been such a big feature of the last um the last several sessions that's not without exception but certainly the bills weren't being read aloud um in the same way they have been for years now which slows down the process and um and um also kind of like is this daily reminder of the partisan ranker if you will um also the um the there was no walkouts or even really any talk of walkouts um it was all very uh very much focused on issues that there was by there was bipartisan support for so I think that really helped those issues were drug policy um for those who haven't been paying attention um there was a lot of conversation about measure 110 um and making changes to that measure which was voter approved um but the legislature now is kind of having their say and what they think based on seeing it in action for a couple of years might be some changes to make um and that that was one very high-profile issue housing was another issue and Alexis um hammer from dlcd is going to talk a little bit about housing when I get to my last slide when I asked for folks in audience to participate um he's already ready to talk about housing for us addressing homelessness was another major issue and that includes a multitude of related issues of course and then a surprise big issue also with by strong bipartisan support in the end was campaign Finance reform which has been a topic both at The Ballot Box and in the legislature for years and years and years Without Limits actually taking effect so um so this is a big a big deal for Oregon and I think on climate and energy issues um money and politics just as they play into most issues money and politics certainly plays into those conversations so I think it'll be really interesting to track how that big headline level issue filters down and affects our work um in the legislature in the years to come those um limits take effect next year so the election this year this fall will not have those um those limits in place and in fact there was a large contribution uh just made that made the news yesterday um so just know that that will continue to be the case until next year here so um I would also say that um while these were the headlines even when the headlines were not energy or climate in the last several years often they were it was still a really big deal issue where there was always some sort of major effort that was happening um that was controversial or contentious and that was just really not the case this year um we did have some energy related bills that were somewhat contentious but either they passed or they didn't but there wasn't like one huge thing like if you think two years ago during short session we were working on the cooling relief package um La uh we were working on uh that was a short session Bill we've had major bills during the long sessions there was the big climate package last session two years ago or three years ago um there was the hill 2021 clean energy conversation so and then before that the cap and trade um cap conversations of course so I think it was just a really different session than it has been for a while on energy and climate but there certainly were things to talk I'm sorry to interrupt um uh representative Levy has her hand raised oh great thank you I can't see anybody but the four people in front of me so thank you for letting me know representative leevy did you want to weigh in when you're done I just think that the campaign finance bill doesn't take effect till 2027 oh 2027 okay thank you yeah I read an article thank you I think I just read it when I read it I thought January 2025 I probably just saw that because that's what I expected but 27 so we still have a couple of Elections yeah I do believe on the house side they want to fix a couple of things and bring it back to the governor for signing before it works for everybody perfect thank you so much I think I just like read the article in OPB and I just must have misread the year when I was reading it I'm not an expert on super that's okay your your legislative session is much more interesting than the one we lived through thank you all right so um you can go ahead and go to the next slide of we'll get into the energy issues that did come up this session we're going to sort of talk big picture and then I'm going to just talk specifically about a couple of bells that are sort of I think the closest to the work of either this group well yeah this group so um to start with uh on bills that I would describe as climate change and again any energy bills climate change etc etc but um I put one first that is closest to the work of this commission which is the greenhouse gas reduction goals bill that was Senate Bill 1550 9 this was actually um based on recommendations in the road map to 2030 that you all adopted a couple of years ago and these goals made it through committee um in the Senate uh a year ago and then got transferred into that large climate package Bill House Bill 349 and at the last minute these goals were removed from that bill and so senator demro of course the member of the committee hi Senator um that moved forward that that bill uh was brought back again this session and it actually had I diplomatically I know he's listening I hope he doesn't mind had a rough session it didn't get scheduled for a work session it didn't move forward um so uh so this commission has on its to-do list statutorily to continue to recommend um adopting greenhouse gas reduction goals that match the best available science and Senator golden um Senator denos retiring Senator golden has set on the record he plans to bring this bill forward again so I don't think the conversation is over and I think the commission will continue to have a goal a a role in recommending that the goals be adopted or changed for um for the the state so just know that that conversation will be forthcoming I'm sure at the commission on how to plan for think about that in the future um for now we still have the same statutory goals that were there in 2007 so um just wanted to kind of start there since that's a bill that I think is of everything the most pertinent to your work um both looking back and looking forward uh but similarly um just just as much related to your work as the natural and working lands fund this was also legislation that came forward from recommendations from the Oregon climate action commission past last year and um there's a $10 million fund and you all got to dig deep in that um in the in the like early winter late fall early winter and recommended it of course as you know and those funds were allocated during this session so kind of check that box it's all officially official and then um another major climate U measure is funding for heating and cooling relief in Senate Bill 1530 I'm going to talk about that more in a minute in detail there were also some statutory changes to our programs I'll talk to those in detail in a minute and then also a couple of other bills that passed related to energy and one that didn't um but there was a bill related to energy Market sounds like there's interest in talking more about that in the future there's legislation that will require the state's two largest utilities to issue a verbal update to the leg legislature periodically on progress to uh related to energy markets and how the state and those two utilities play in that space so that is essentially the legislature just wanted to keep posted on those efforts and then I know we have a member of the commission who was a leader um in the next bill House Bill 4112 this was a second attempt at creating um sort of a clean energy technology Economic Development package for those who have followed the news last session a big deal was the chips it was the chips act at the federal level and then an Oregon chips act that was sort of designed to create a bunch of incentives and um sort of promoting of semiconductor Manufacturing in Oregon and this is an effort that would do that but for clean energy technology and in fact it sounds like that bill will become part of interim work and be coming back again it seems to me like the primary issue with it just in listening to the committee hearings um there were some issues and some some pieces of it that were not like all Kumbaya but I think at the end it was sort of a money question so it'll be interesting to see um what happens with that and I actually talked",

        "text": " level what are the major energy sources that are that we're consuming within Oregon so you can see at another level uh how much it comes from petroleum fuels natural gas and hydroelectric power and at those end resources uh based on the the different sectors we've got how much is used by Transportation the residential sector the industrial sector and the commercial sector you can see transportation is is the largest amount next slide please so this is the what the resources we use to generate electricity just focused on just electricity and so this is what's generated within our state which generate outside of our state that's imported in and so you can see Hydro power as we we've noted is a huge resource in the largest one but we still use a lot of natural gas and coal to generate the electricity that we consume so we have uh long-term goals around from house bill 2021 around decarbonizing our electricity sector and so we go to the next slide so that's going to require changing how we use uh some how we generate some of our electricity and that could be with natural gas coming coming decarbonized fuels incorporating renewable natural gas or hydrogen or could be electrifying or using other resources to generate more electricity but this is just an idea of kind of the scale of the change that we're talking about it's it's quite a bit of a change and with electricity we're also talking about greater generation needing more of it as well as cleaning up the electricity they we're already using so it's a it's a robust challenge go to the next slide please and with Transportation this is demonstrating all the different fuels we use we kind of mentioned some of those biofuels ethanol and biodiesel but for the most part petroleum fuels really Drive um the trans fuel transportation fuel use within our state you can see gasoline and Diesel make up the majority of it so we do have goals around the clean fuels program and trying to decarbonize and reduce the emissions that come from Transportation f F so if we go to the next slide that does mean changing the way we use a lot of those fuels and so this is again trying to demonstrate the big change that we would be talking about Alternatives whether that's turning to electrifying Transportation or using um uh low emission fuels or some kind of other alternative whether maybe a Bou fuel okay next slide please and then we're talking about build bus this is showing what we consume within buildings and see you can see it's dominated as you probably recognize by electricity natural gas and biomass we talked about uh the majority of the the fuel use we use within these uh buildings is is critical and so if we're talking about making some changes there there's some big changes to be had it would have a many many cascading impacts if we were to Electrify more of these applications or use other fuels uh to splice this consumption so next slide so that was kind of a macro level view of energy in Oregon so now we're going to talk about why an energy strategy so in the 2022 bional Energy report we took a look at a variety of different studies um looking at decarbonizing energy uh within States and we concluded that we've got a lot of existing programs a lot of great work we're doing but we need to make sure everything's directed kind of One Direction we need to figure out how we're going to do with it how we're going to meet all these policy objectives and and decarbonize and how can we get everybody aligned and so we recommended energy strategy because we thought it would help align policy Development Across a variet different state agencies uh set some expectations certainly signal to Industry and business where we're looking to go uh and also taking take advantage of uh opportunities within Technologies and say okay how can we make sure as a state we're investing effectively and coming up with a good effective plan and uh that efficiently uses State dollars uh on our future economy and uh our Energy Future okay can we have the next slide please so and this is the house bill that house bill 3630 that directed organ Department of energy to lead this work and we're want to develop this uh energy strategy and it's important to note that this energy strategy isn't necessarily a linear plan of how we're going to get to a certain point it's more an evaluation of of different opportunities and taking a look at we're going to do some energy modeling what could it look like and what choices do we have in front of us uh and what policies U May inform that so we're going on a trajectory working together it's also an opportunity for us to take a look at the economic and employment impacts energy burden affordability and many things we need to take into consideration uh with this energy transition that's that's upon us I have this is Kent yeah pleas is energy burden the same as demand it's not actually so energy burden kind of refers more to affordability and so it takes a look at what are the energy costs of households and says uh I'm trying to remember what the percentage is but what is the percentage that they're paying for their energy cost okay and for many oregonians it's it's very high they have a greater burden yeah and there's looking at that household there's Transportation burden so the cost of of Transportation as well as the burden for their electricity natural gas or their their fuel bills and it's important for us to take a look at that uh one to look at disparity because if if you look at rural oregonians or Urban oregonians are there big disparities there uh we look at for transportation larger vehicle miles traveled for a lot of people live in rural areas have to travel a lot more they might have higher Transportation costs are there opportunities for us to address that or take that into consideration if we're going to make choices about the fuels that we have that people have access to um you know all of a sudden are we making things that aren't affordable or we're increasing the energy burden for a lot of the communities within the state um it's it's something that we really need to take into account when making some of choices thank you yes of course okay uh next slide please so the energy strategy itself we broken up into to three parts so the energy strategy will have some policy objectives and so we want to basically create kind of a summary of of what we've um what we found out when we do our energy modeling uh the pathways that we we took a look at the different options and we'll talk about kind of those different scenarios in a bit uh description of of how we work with stakeholders so it's going to be critical for the success of the energy strategy that we involve a variety of different communities within Oregon not just within the energy sector which certainly we want to involve in utilities and people directly working in energy but we want to work with a variet different communities so we can have those conversations let's say around affordability or energy burden so make sure we're taking into account the the changes or recommendations we we make uh make sure they they take into account the impact to all these communities Oregon and at the end the goal will be to provide some policy recommendations to the legislature uh in the governor's office on what could uh put us on a trajectory to meet our goals and take into account equity in our Energy Future and energy transition okay next slide please so within the technical analysis we've hired a a technical contractor uh SEI and they are going to do some energy modeling for us and so we'll kind of talk through what that looks like uh I don't know about you but I'm not as familiar with energy modeling as some and it gets really technical uh if we go to the next slide but essentially we're going to create a baseline kind of Baseline course scenario where we are trying to get from uh where we are today to meet our emissions goals in 2050 and taking a look at those Mission goals how can we be on a trajectory to get there what kind of uh Chang do we need to make what do we take into consideration so we have that corar and then how can we compare it to so what kind of things can we find out by comparing different options of let's say we we're going to Electrify a lot of Transportation okay well does that happen faster or slower and how does that change things uh do we retain fuels like natural gas within buildings long term or does that change uh there's a lot of different trade-offs and evaluations and and that's kind of where we can kind of show the differences and opportunities with in the state and kind of the economic or Equity or other impacts so but the model can't answer all all questions and so we're not going to necessarily litigate existing policies we're going to be taking a look at what the future could evaluate um and there's some limitations to it so it's not going to solve all our energy problems so much as it's going to be an evaluation of kind of what the future might look like and when you look at energy modeling the importance of of developing it is really developing it to create a trajectory it's not to predict the future not to predict exactly what's going to happen 20 years from now I wouldn't trust it if it did uh if anything it's putting us on a trajectory so we can see what the next like three to five years should look like to to make it point us out in the right direction okay next slide please so and it serves to inform our decision-making so as I said it's not going to predict the future but it's the investigation of of the different choices and options so hopefully by doing this we can have great conversations and our working group groups and and different engagement opportunities and talk about the the different opportunities within the state what should be incorporated or considered uh and hopefully develop some strategies within the state of how do we can invest State dollars uh and what policies we need to to develop to um set us on a good trajectory for the future okay next slide please and so in with all this we're going to be trying to figure out some big energy questions and so so here are some kind of examples of pressing questions we have in energy all naturally curious and want to know what our future is going to look like but these are all the different things that we want to try to answer by uh comparing different scenarios or different Pathways we might be able to go as a state so for example what if some technologies or new clean energy resources are delayed or not developed hydrogen is certainly",

Matrix a q a period and the timeline for review and awards at the end of each application period Odo will confirm project eligibility and complete a competitive review the process will conclude with a notice of Awards in Grant contracts we recognize that federal grants can have a few extra strings attached so we plan to develop resources to support attendees with compliance and Reporting next slide please these are some of the metrics that Odo is considering to measure our progress toward these objectives these metrics will be incorporated into grant performance agreements where applicable we invite you to review these and comment on your ability to measure and report on these items we particularly seek your feedback on these metrics to help us determine if there are more relevant data sets that we can help asses assess our success on this project you can see some of these that we came up with are the reduction of fossil fuel reduction of total energy use and the metrics behind that might be number of EB charging stations or the measure measured energy use reduction in buildings or equipment there's there's ways to get at these metrics we can help we'd like to hear your thoughts next slide Tony so the ways to engage today is one of the many ways that you'll be able to engage with Odo on this proposal this slide outlines ways to get and stay involved you can submit comments on the online portal although in terms of this Draft application please note that the timeline is pretty tight with a deadline of this Friday you can submit an application and you can check out our job announcement announcements and actually even come to work for Odo next slide Tony for our next steps we intend to review public comments received to an integrate into our application and program design we will submit to usdoe no later than July 31st next slide Tony and now we've reached the time for your public comments we appreciate the comments we've already seen in the chat and the questions that are risen so far here's an opportunity to make a comment or ask a question please either use the chat or raise your hand so we can call on you to take you off mute also to remember that if you're on a phone you can press star 6 to raise your hand and start three to mute yourself when we call on you and the host unmute you from from our end now we now that you have some understanding of the grant opportunity please let us know what you think or particularly interested in knowing if you have plans to improve Energy Efficiency but lack federal or lack funding to implement what are your thoughts on the minimum and maximum and what about the sub Grant process would you prefer to see a competitive process or a first-come first-serve style process what else should we consider in designing our program so if we can go to any questions or public comment that would be appreciated Roger there is a sustainability and they're wondering if we are anticipating a single award cycle or multiple for the sub grants Emily I believe you'd be best to answer that I think it's a single right I'm happy to answer that you know given that this is a a one-time funding opportunity that we know of we intend for this to be a single award cycle and in terms of the um the um we have a three-year reporting period um and because of the nature of timelines in terms of how well by the time that we receive the funding award letter and we get these sub grants out to you all we'd probably be looking at about a two-year period of performance for our sub-grantees to stay on on track and on time I hope that helps answer the I'm not seeing oh yep they said it did thank you um yeah not seeing any hands raised um but yeah feel free to keep writing stuff in the chat or go ahead and raise your hand and we can unbeat you as well oh we got one more in the chat here from AJ uh at Fall City um does reducing emissions include electrifying of Municipal fleets I think that would qualify it depends upon how you how you want to go about it but I would definitely uh note it note it to us either an email or it will have the chat here but also we have the um portal that you can enter any uh comments in that we can collect easily and consolidate from there that's a good idea any other comments or questions uh it looks like we have a couple of hand raids uh raised now I think Natalie was first Natalie Rogers I'll go ahead and mute you go ahead hey Natalie I think we can barely hear you Natalie oh can you hear me now yep yep gotcha Natalie hey hey Roger hey everyone hey um how would um things like resiliency projects battery backup um solar arrays Etc which ties to the decarbonization efforts how would that kind of align with this um block grant I think that would fit in just really I would submit that as a comment from Milwaukee right yeah thank you thanks Natalie and we have another one from Julie Williams I'll unmute you now go ahead it's from Corvallis I'm curious if a city government can access these funds to create a revolve loan system um low to Middle income people to provide Gap funding for access to all of the incentives for energy upgrades would this qualify that might be on The Fringe but I would definitely submit that as a um that that's an interesting interesting point um the population in a Corvallis do you know um 59 000 too big yeah it probably is I think it was 35 000 or under and Corvallis may have got a direct uh Grant from the federal level okay I'll check that out thank you that would be the first stop I can confirm that Corvallis is um is applicable to to apply directly to the Department of energy Corvallis has an allocation of 122 590. thanks Emily that helps a lot I'm not seeing hands raised I haven't been able to do that for some reason but if there's other comments you want to make in the chat that'd be helpful there are I was just going to check with Stacy to make sure all of the um hand raised were answered first I think so Natalie did you re-raise your hand or is that just left up yeah I actually raised my hand again I was curious um are we allowed to you know one concern that I would have that's always a concern is just for these smaller jurisdictions we don't necessarily have the staff capacity to implement programs are you um open to local jurisdictions working with Utility Partners in um implementation of these programs for example if we were to partner with PGE on something would we still be eligible for Grant funds that would be the case awesome thank you okay and then we've got a couple of questions here in the chat um a question about accessing the presentation and um online webinar um how soon will folks be able to access well I think Emily has indicated that this will be up on our website the recording of this uh tomorrow and I sure hope it will be um but maybe give it one more day even so very quickly actually okay great yeah and the slide deck is already there if you if you want to review that I apologize for interrupting no that's awesome um we got another question here in the chat um it reads it seems the priority programming green energy scores EV Chargers Etc do not seem to have much of an EJ lens or are easily focused on at-risk communities how do you plan to address the large percent required for those folks that's why we are reaching out across the state we've invited numerous jurisdictions in fact 225 jurisdictions across the state which would include disadvantaged communities in rural sections of the state um so that's our way of reaching out and we will continue to do that through community-based organizations and and light to reach out to those communities that may not have heard the word great thanks Roger um we've got another question here about uh what are the possible limits on Grant awards for any one entity at this point we're looking at a minimum of 50 000 and a maximum of a hundred thousand you can see where we're trying to put some uh refinement around the program because there's there's a limited amount of money and uh and a whole bunch of cities if you divided uh the 1.4 Million by 225 cities you'd end up with about five thousand dollars a piece which wouldn't probably do a whole lot of good to any one uh City so um we're trying to confine the program to a fifty thousand and a hundred thousand dollar maximum and open to any other ideas that you feel may be better I'm just waiting here maybe some fingers are typing um but that was the the rounded questions so far actually I think we have one more um from Tim Lynch and I will go ahead and unmute you now so again I'm Tim Lynch from Multnomah um with will you be able to apply not having a direct allocation because those went to the city of Portland into Gresham would we be able to apply for projects for our unincorporated areas or smaller communities Troutdale Wood Village and other communities that other that wouldn't have a direct up direct allocation could we do projects essentially in those areas as an applicant yes absolutely Tim thanks for the question it's it is a bit confusing when Multnomah county is big and has a lot of cities in it that have a smaller populations those folks are eligible so get the word out to them uh we'll do our best to do the same could could we be the applicant essentially to serve those communities as well you'd be the best to answer that I don't I don't think so but um I believe that the answer could be we might need to do a little bit of research on this but I believe that the answer could be yes given the fact that Multnomah County wasn't eligible for a direct award and and the formula Apple application that they came up with their um is a little bit complicated in that essentially what they did was tempt the population obviously we know multiple Noma County is a large County but they took the populations of the largest cities out of the equation and you know as you already know um you know Portland got a direct allocation um and so what what you're left with there in terms of population of the county is much smaller um and so that leads me to",

our ugb or potential change to our GB won't even be part of the conversation because we don't it doesn't we don't qualify I wonder too if we just may remember the short session is um sort of it creates crazy pacemaking and um so if you do have questions come to you about the city's position on any bill and it's not coming to you top of Mind do ask because we have a whole um a whole Software System that's traffing bills and staff are entering uh City positions based on the policy statements and conversation here so so I have access to all of that uh really fast so just do reach out if you are asked a question um there's often uh we we make a lot of um more pragmatic decisions about which things we want to weigh in on and which we may not want to so that backstory is all works well if you are um asked to make an opinion and there's so there's a lot of activity around that bill there's other interests that you know are really opposed to that bill there's others that the governor's been working with over the course of the last uh Cy interim um and that will be very complex you you'll hear a lot about that bill coming up you'll also hear about major 110 and some of the impacts and I'm hearing a lot of Buzz around okay how are uh the chambers going to work with each other across the aisle to really uh put some sideboards on major 110 this often times happens with ballot measures right it takes a little time and it takes a few legislative Cycles to get it to where it's right and to where it's working uh hopefully with the goal and objective in mind to get people help and to uh help our communities within those aspects so so just for thep is my notes there's a lot of Buzz around 110 got it so and our position is basically we're not getting into the to the Weeds on 110 we are simply supporting reform great okay and then finally um what we do see here again so it doesn't feel like an exercise INF futility for our staff um everything we see here probably has the potential to resurface in 2025 right so we use it as a little bit of a framework going into how we prep our legislative agenda and how we look at measures that'll probably be coming in the long session in 2025 so even though a lot of these things are throw away or I might say to you hey this probably isn't going to fly just expect to see it again so it doesn't hurt to do a little of the back work and it turns out that's just 12 short months away is that it just geared towards the next 35 along that line just um if if the committee's ever taken a position on a bill we also staff have access to that as well so there's a lot of repeat to your point um ideas and we can go back and pull those statements and of support or opposition as well to to feed more conversation next week and the week after week um the only thing we didn't quite uh talk about is Wes the yeah the do you want to talk a little bit about that that's a commuter rail build it's uh it's a study bill again it is getting a hearing uh the I got a call from the mayor Woodburn yesterday or sometime recently asking me to testify so I will be part of a a series of panels testifying on that bill uh coming up in the next couple weeks so there is some energy behind that it looks like it did get a hearing so that's good sign can I ask an off B question so we were at a meeting last night with um s l kaer Public Schools I know that they are their own thing and doing their own thing but I also know that we're not that we want to support each other is there any do we track anything that would impact education especially s public schools and from a supportive viewpoint does that make any sense uh we don't do that today um and I think we appear open if Salem Kaiser had a request for support they would make one to us and and we would do that but right at this minute we're not tracking all the education related um it's outside of the we we have lovely expertise but not in that field so um so I could follow up with siser directly and make sure that they're aware that we're specifically you're referring to like funding yes yes funding what we want to talk about yeah a lot of times those are how that we don't put the city uh machine behind that kind of effort but it could be like on an individual elected official basis to support an effort um they're looking OB they have the same issue that we have obviously we're kind of tied at the HP that way because they're the Capital School District second largest school district we're the capital city second largest city a lot of similar themes they're um looking mostly at the uh at the just the education funding mechanism which is really totally separate from us uh we can be supportive of their efforts but not like we're not going to put the city machine behind it at this point now at some point we may decide that that's we want to do that but at this point it's not part of our priorities um we don't have a council approved priority to do that but always individual uh elected officials can do what they choose we just need to remember that um there is a pot of money in that building and we are all buying for it and we don't want to uh be buying for it over here while we're buying for it over here because it's just one set of legislators um that have to divy that up and so we just need to be really strategic about how we get so answer your question yeah I know that we're tight at the hip also know that like the asks that are going to create the real change for both of us are huge sure and we should be a united front in making I know that that's like a long-term plan but I want to be a good partner I I do as well yeah yeah great that's all I have Mr all right well thank you uh do we I see we have housing and homelessness and then local Revenue options as discussion points I think we covered those I feel like we did too um I know that those two things were of Interest as well as the measure 110 reform which I think we took care of in policy statements that were approved by Council most recently so I think we're in a good position I just wanted to keep these ideas um at top of Mind as we progress through the next few weeks I know it's not exactly on the called out on the agenda but I would like to just go around each one of these amazing staff members and just hear from them I know they each have a list of bills that they're working on if there's like one or two that that really is kind of peaked your interest or do you think that we ought to be we ought to know about or pay attention to or might be noteworthy um would that be okay it's fine um you could maybe even just talk talk about something that you're intrigued by but you don't have all your all the information lined up yeah you don't need like it doesn't I'm not asking for your expert analysis or whatever but just like hey this is something you might want to pay attention to for example I'm aware that there's a p pass Bill I'm curious about it but I haven't read through all of it so I look forward to doing that and Reporting next week thank you maybe I'm gonna Le on Jason so similar to what was introduced uh last year so it's a it's a basically a stud so basically doing studies and keeping track okay that's a big thing do we want to just kind of go down the maybe we'll just start here uh so I only have one Bild that's been uh that's on my my queue something about um battery storage for renewable energy um actually HED that to Juliana our climate action plan coordinator so she wrote up some information on that this morning I need to read through that um but I I end up getting routed through Public Works and she's on that side of the house so okay that's the only thing thanks uh recreational is really important um that that the law that we have around that is it's been challenged a few years ago and then it was Rewritten and now we're kind of back where it got some legal holds punched in it again so I think that's important just anything around the homelessness issue of course is of course important Justin are you hearing anything on that recreational IMM bill I haven't but I haven't been in that building yet so okay thanks Jason you any else who joined out uh Unice and I are both tracking an SDC bill right us I'm assuming they want to raise the sdcs no probably not they want take housing related so it has to do with u with um municipalities deferring sdc's for developers right so essentially it gives them an extra pot of money to work with when they're putting those housing pieces together and the state or the bill it's house $4.99 is proposing to set aside a pot of money that the state would then in turn buy that debt so wow sorry what do you mean what sorry I was asking because I got the same bill and I was going to ask you if you were going to cover it so oh yeah so it's interesting right so so we would defer the assessment the state would then buy that assess or that deferment from us so it would put it would money then has to be come back to us as sdc's and",

        "text": " yeah right we will see again all the heads are not in the room so we're all on the same page on this okay can you yeah yeah there's another provision let's see okay so um yeah so if we're ready to move on from this we can put a pin on it and then um I will rely on sector 818 to remind me that we do need to have a decision as part of emotion but um uh we can definitely a table this for now let it steer although the next issue is is almost um and it's just it's just that uh in the protected area standard itself and I do want to comment that at any time it would be helpful for me to pull up the role language and do that at the protected area uh standard as I mentioned the current standard says you know protected areas are are protected areas of national parks national monuments whatever designated on or before uh May 11 2007. um we would say look The Proposal will say let's eliminate that specific date and then do a similar goal post where it's protected areas that need to be considered in the council's evaluation are those established uh on or before the date the complete applications filed uh they on this issue were I think that the issues raised were substantively identical to the issues raised and the last one um the kind of I think the the operativeness of 469 4012 are like a little less clear now because protected areas are typically you know Federal protected areas often are designated through an act of Congress that that does become a new law but um you were not necessarily making a determination of compliance with that while you were just saying whether or not there's an environment impact um under your own standards again um there is I think I think the one just thing I'll highlight is that they're we are aware of like one says day laws and it's around State Scenic area or state Scenic waterways that actually contains development within the law itself uh it has to do with what you can put and particularly what utility facilities can develop within like I think a quarter mile of a state Scenic Waterway in those State Scenic waterways are often a a designated by the legislature if you made your determination that um no State Scenic waterways were impacted by the proposed facility you know and there was a new state Scenic Waterway designated like you know the day after the proposed order came out I think that is something that would be a very complicated but very scenario that would happen um so that that's just I think the one hiccup we know of typically though like there's no law really mandating what can be done in and around a state park uh the state parks just had their management plans that applies to what the state will do with the land um and there are requirements that the state has to adhere to when they are proposing development of state park going lands or state of lands but they typically don't apply to the private lands around them so there's not like a lot of bye I I think the same sort of like murkiness that that I think the the commenters are really concerned about um it's just that one particular area around State senior libraries which are obviously very important but um established so so I think we've kind of uh I think well I'm gonna pull off the language here because I want to make sure that I'm saying the right thing but I think we've recommended um similar language yeah exactly so uh oh no but we did not add the the additional nothing waves the obligation uh language here sure yes Ken so the language certificate holders for that needs of having to reply does it happen after it's that benefit lands that it's part of that side so it's the burdens on the internet just like they would with the feds yeah agency or local service okay for the record talk point I think that you know your first one sort of like an Engaged Species Act you know is a good example because you know it they still have to meet it at a federal level yeah so we we don't have any authority to say you don't have to meet these sort of federal requirements we're just not implementing them because they're not part of our requirements and so you know it's yeah that's where I think the distinction so they're not all probably need to clean is that that's probably a good way to think about it yeah and a good way to think about this too is that you know the council's decision of compliance with a particular State rule automobile ordinance is a it's binding upon the state um but if the council doesn't address you know there's no there's not that protection so um if a new rule happened and you didn't address it in your decision and didn't say you know we comply with this new DSL setback requirement then there's no protection for the certificate holder and basically that becomes between them and DSL to yeah that's a good way to yeah there's no protection for math side they've got to compliant and work it out be it said flooding with the state agency your local governments yeah I think again forever to talk about that I think just from a from a practical standpoint you know once you get to you know testing case and in that final order stage you know it's not that things couldn't get dealt with it just gets really complicated about how do you handle then some new standard requirement or Criterion at that late stage in the process yeah not impossible but but practically can be very difficult yeah well and one of the things in Atlantis is we're trying to provide certainty and this is an Arabic book and uh possibilities that something comes up after all the certainties have been given they've still got to be that seems like um I will I'll go ahead and put a pin in this product where we're good here um so our recommendation is uh same principles here but we haven't did it added that additional language I don't think it's necessary although people cancels together um okay the next comment was that um we had a commenter recommend that uh information related to environmental justice considerations should be added to the information requirements for nois and applications um and uh this the short version is because we agree with that and we do agree that environmental just that both that there is I don't think there's specific requirements for fsec but there is a general push for um State agencies including the department of energy that are involved in uh natural resource decisions uh to give greater weights environmental justice considerations and to incorporate them into their processes in some way um the uh the department now has a seat on the environmental justice Council and is working with that Council to develop a mapping tool too to help identify where environmental justice communities are located in Oregon um and that is something we are thinking about how to incorporate in our processes as well but um while we agree with this we do um believe that we can can put forward a rule now um partially because we haven't really talked to those environmental justice communities directly haven't got their input on how we can best serve them or incorporate those considerations into the review process uh and we do think doing so would really uh go beyond the scope of just the three standards we're talking about here so um we think that this should be included in the council's big kind of application process review rulemaking which is um something that's teed up in the department currently has a contractor doing some Outreach on our internal program evaluation that is also getting some stakeholder input on uh issues that are important to that homemaking so we don't recommend any changes to these proposals but this is something that I think will be a recurring theme and probably most most rulemaking proceedings going forward or at least the big uh the big kind of uh systemic overviewable mckins brother this is Marci Grill I did a huge topic is going to continue and I will definitely say until after the 2023 legislature meets because it's coming from all space that I've seen numerous legislative Concepts flying around I think we would be resisted even attempt to get ahead of that right now additionally I'm curious to see what things continue coming from uh the PC as for example the citizens Utility Board just have their annual policy conference and it was completely done by Community Driven action so I wouldn't 100 say wait until legislative approve action I mean I realize we can't always win it because we never know how that's going to go but there's a lot out there right now I definitely don't think we should Cindy I'm sure I'll thank you Cindy um I I was struck by this I want to make sure my understanding I have to come you just said it um is correct I was um not surprised by the comment but if we would consider that here it would be under the protected just this very limited and a broader I was thinking of that the fact everything and so that's what I hear today maybe we'll certainly um take it up as an issue with the world maintain but after we have all the pieces and it would be broader than just three of these three parabens right councilman that is that is correct that is what we're thank you so any other questions from the Council on this issue okay another comment was that there should be more accountability and transparency in the establishment of analysis areas um or conversely that the the use of analysis areas in the world should be eliminated uh and the study areas that are established for the review in the noi should be used throughout the we agree that there could be some more clarity and consistency uh in the establish of establishment of analysis areas in in a lot of cases as you just convert over so when we have a study um let's say 20 miles from a protected areas that is just what we use um for the analysis area as well um we you know there are different ways of going about setting those I think the um the kind of section 106 process for cultural resources and archaeological resources has you know their methodology I know we've seen some like estimated uh distances of War like say trash habitat that the um ODFW has incorporated into their habitat who has quantification tool um so there are kind of methods that you can use to estimate what the analysis area should be um again this is an issue that we think broader than just these three standards um and probably exceeds the scope of this rulemaking but I think looking at how and why analysis areas are established is something that we could consider in the application process we that's done the record talk on it and just uh you know this goes beyond this particular rule making but the way that the",

        "text": " to reiterate the the news from Monday about the EPA Grant yeah it's matter of fact I can let me pull it up right here unless that's probably going to be a council I know I I was putting on the spot so something that was out of the ordinary I know the Mario was probably going to talk about it but I got it here but I'll let you guys have that moment are you sure yeah okay well since uh um councelor May spilled the beans just to let everybody know that might be listening I think most of on Council already know uh we got awarded a $5 million EPA Grant um which is huge we've been trying to get this grant for long long time uh when H Craig and I when Craig told me about it we thought it was spam so we were like checking the email address and uh uh Googling all the people on the on the email to make sure it was valid but it is valid we got the official letter um that's going to go toward a Brownfield cleanup site the old Tannery site on oron Street which Not only was it a Tannery they also dealt in lead batteries there too so there's heavy metals lead Le battery recycling Henry great combination for this there's past issues out there so it needs to be cleaned up and and uh as I told several people it's really a trifecta for the city because we get to clean up the site it will help protect the Wildlife Refuge which butts up right against it um it's we'll create a new location to relocate our Public Works facility which will open up um up to four acres in our downtown core for uh Redevelopment for housing and jobs so it's it's a really great project for this city very excited about and as part of the cleanup at the end the cleanup is an opportunity to do a uh kind of an uh interpretive Center art um part of the cleanup um great added benefit that we'll be able to pursue more money yeah to do and yeah that's a really good point because we can leverage us to go out and get get additional monies from the state Etc so huge while you're before you do Council comments while you're talking about grants why don't you talk about the one we received the big check from last oh yeah and then um a second Grant we may have mentioned this before but it's worth mentioning again we also got it's not a grant I'm going to use a term that um we haven't heard a lot from uh Washington DC a lot but your marks are back um they're a little different than last time around but um representative congresswoman's uh Selenas and her staff and our staff um did an excellent job working um with her and we actually got a million-dollar Grant written into the a bill that passed back in February was signed into the law and that's going to go toward expanding our our Broadband Network into rural areas around around the city so that that was another huge win from the city and for our broadband system so I can't thank um our federal team enough for getting that across the Finish Line it's not easy there's a lot of competition for those dollars at the federal level um so they did a great job and staff did a great job so great anything else Ty no the only other well yeah I say no and then I grabb the mic the only other thing uh of noteworthy is music on the greens coming and hopefully I didn't spoil that for any of you guys uh so looks like uh music on theeg green.net is where you can find out the dates and I'm assuming who's going to be playing so check that out awesome thank you any other questions for the chief all right we'll roll right into uh oh I do have a question you got a question go ahead go ahead have we uh do we know who this person is over here I was getting to that oh okay I'm we were it was kind of Staff related so I didn't so all right I know in a hurry we've introduced him a just tell you poking the bear I I think we've re introduced him a couple times oh I apologize I wasn't here two weeks ago so you didn't watch you didn't watch that no yeah I I had a question for chief so I think last week uh maybe a Girl Scout came to the PD and got to play with m be a little bit and and what what did they do yes they did uh uh local girl scout reached out she over the years has been selling Girl Scout cookies and uh accumulated about $2,000 um that she was able to donate to uh something that she had a passion for and she reached out to us and she really loves our canine program so she got to come down and see Mila and Miss B and officer or Sergeant jent actually did a great um demonstration for her and they got to hang out they got a tour of the PD and subsequently we got $2,000 donated to the Sherwood Police Foundation which is fantastic and it will all be for uh the Canan program yep thank you for reminding me awesome awesome um any other questions Chief do you have anything else you want oh wait okay um I was going to point out that Sebastian is with us tonight um and uh along with Ryan our our intern attorney that will be covering for us while Ron's or why Ryan is so thank you for being here um anything for us any updates or anything I don't I don't have any because we don't usually ask for those listening Ryan concurred by nodding his head I'm being quiet all right we'll go ahead and roll right into Council announcements we'll start on this in tonight all right uh the Planning Commission met last week and the second reading of the climate friend the E Community regulations that they were reviewing there was much discussion around the impact to the city um and disdain for what is happening with that uh for sure would um the commission did vote to recommend it to the council uh it was a somber four zero vote U with the chair abstaining from the vote actually even um so they they understand that what we've chosen to do as a council directum uh is the lesser of two evils but it still isn't quite what we would prefer for a city um we will hear here the first reading July 16th for Council and then the second on August 6th and the Implement implementation date has been extended to September 13th instead of June 30th so uh these readings if it does pass at that second one will have at least a month before uh it's due to imped um and that's all I have for tonight thank you councelor may yes I have things thank you mayor appreciate the uh the opportunity to give an update the uh citizen or the temporary City Charter Review Committee um has finished meeting they met for the third time last week which they prepared a report Advanced it to Council in the work session today which we all um heard and uh considered and advanced um one topic um uh for future resolution and uh we'll further can do some more research on the other two um I appreciate the service of those people that we uh that participated on committee uh last Thursday joined everyone on the Das in uh first CI of our budget committee meetings we'll have our second one this Thursday very exciting um our acting city manager did a great uh presentation on the general fund um and we'll move on to conversations about the funds the uh other funs funds and our urban renewal budget uh proposed budget uh yesterday was the monthly um Cultural Arts board meeting um committee meeting and that was uh it went well and they are very excited about the art that will be installed later this year at the Oregon Street roundabout uh they reviewed that they're very excited about the EPA Grant and the opportunities of leveraging that Grant in doing um a park SL interpretive Trail something something on part of the open space that will be a Remnant that the that people can get on with that project um and not the encapsulated soil or encased soil that you can't tread on um and there's going to be a art walk event coming up I did not have the date but they're super excited about that it's next month awesome thank you and that's the end of my points for the day okay we're going to hold you to that um Taylor all right I got a bunch of announcements as well so uh the library the wccls passed a preliminary budget uh the our current um uh board also did some visioning and planning um for the upcoming year uh the school School Board um adopted some new graduation requirements that will start with the Freshman for this year essentially for those that are listening go watch the meeting but it really simplifies it and it makes it so that um uh students that are graduating have a lot more chances for graduating with honors um if they uh take the advanced classes but they can do it in in a number of different fields so that they're not required to do the exact ones that everybody else is they can pick up um advanced classes and things that they might be interested in as as long as our school offers them so it's a little bit more customizable but it's also something that the students will know well in advance whereas and be able to talk about it on Awards and applications for college and things like that whereas now they don't really know if they're going to qualify for something until pretty much the the term right before graduation and so it makes it so they're not eligible for some awards and talking about it like that so it simplifies it and it makes it more in alignment with uh with what our school is trying to do um we have coffee with Courtney neuron I don't know if anybody else is going to talk about that but June 1st at 11 am uh we could talk to our state representative about uh at the senior center there Jun June 1st also June 1st we've got the Pride Celebration in Stella olon Park uh it's a bunch of bands um and and food and festival thing type things there um let's see oh uh back to the school board um Wednesday tomorrow night they have a special meeting at 7 o'clock that where they're announcing our new superintendent so um I've I'm I don't know who it is either so I'm but uh you'll you'll get to meet them tomorrow and then Thursday they have their budget meeting as well starting at 6 so if you want to go you're spoiled",

        "text": " them since um if there is anything please um jump in but let's hear from JP um and then Carrie please yeah hi um I raised my hand when we were talking about the the euis um from preo postco um I just have some experience looking at a private data set so it's not a public data set so I don't really know how relevant it is but anecdotally it's kind of interesting I've looked at data sets around commercial buildings um about 16,000 16 million square foot and the difference in occupancy has been drastic you know across Seattle um what Oregon Denver different markets it's gone from you know like average around 80 90% occupancy down to you know at the height of the pandemic and it hasn't really recovered it's it was around 10 to 20% of actual occupancy and that affected the total energy consumption of those buildings by about 20 per which is quite interesting uh so it's not a one toone correlation but it definitely did decrease the intensity of you know the the the energy use intensity of those buildings quite significantly and as I said they still it is still we're still in a post pan pandemic state in in commercial real estate um things have definitely not recovered back to the pandemic levels so just I just thought that might be interesting for folks good thank you for the Insight we appreciate it uh Carrie go ahead good to see you K yeah hi um so first off I also support um setting the targets at the mean since that's the most stringent we're allowed um and that's not all that stringent but my other comment is kind of it's a I'm getting brain stormy on key drivers for targets and thinking about some of the Lessons Learned in Washington and just other things we're trying to accomplish in the region and I'm curious I'm gonna I don't know the answer to this I'm gonna put it in y'all's hands or put it out to the rest of the rack um but how could we consider flexibility in buildings and in the eui Target setting I don't know if that's a possible place to take it into consideration I know it's come up in the working group discussions in Washington as well that when building owners are undertaking you know putting battery storage on their facility or using on-site renewable generation and other things how can they be credited um in their ability to sort of flex their load during peak times and support other kind of goals that Oregon might have with grid modernization and um overall renewable adoption on the power supply side um just putting it out there I don't know the answer thanks Carrie I think that's a great um a great topic for discussion and I think that it's something that we could think about how would that show up potentially I mean it may be something that is very valuable to discuss within the context of this process but then it may or may not be able to be implemented directly here but it could have a lot of value somewhere else or or it could be something that is potentially considered in the overall Ru making in relation to the targets so it'd be really interesting to see kind of um where things go with that in terms of how the rack could potentially what types of things the rack could recommend I just want to acknowledge that we're at time if we wanted to stick with one hour Blake to give you time to go through the three or four other agenda items but before we close oh there is another comment in the chat the only emission reduction requirement in the bill is seek to maximize reductions in greenhouse gas emissions qualitative and not quantitative so it's a good comment yes and that the emissions reductions could be within the larger context of uh the state's goals and how they're trying to use the building performance standards to help meet those um larger goals just a a follow-up question for JP and maybe uh Vin has anything to say too and that is a question about I don't know JP if you're from uh sounds like maybe you're involved with commercial real estate but something I remember um hearing about and actually experiencing with our own office building is you know the lease uh requirements are that buildings have to maintain you know the the HVAC system the operating uh set points and those types of things regardless of whether they're um occupied and um so what I'm interested in is is have you are you seeing as leases are turning over any changes in those um requirements um that could be taken into consideration that maybe we hadn't seen in earlier data and not something we have to like you know get down into in discussion now but um just maybe a quick response and we could follow up offline is the question that is there changes in lease language the specifically yes I haven't actually seen that no it's a really good question though I wonder I wonder if that is happening in in in certain markets but no I I don't have any personal experience with that um I I will just add that you're right that even when there you can have occupied spaces in buildings that are still leased so there's a difference between least occupancy and actual occupancy you know you could have a least space but there's like one person in it or no one in it and you still have to run the agback um and that's why you're not seeing like a one to one ratio of like oh there's exactly you know you still we noticed a dip of about 20% in eui at the height of the pandemic but given that we were at like 10% occupancy um you can see that there's not a one to one ratio there so yeah that's because spaces might be occupied by one or two people you still have to keep the lights on and run the HVAC yeah I don't have anything but yeah that makes sense JP like the 20% reduction you're talking about might be more of a plug load reduction um but that it is making me think of some City owned property that uh was deeply affected by the pandemic and maybe it's not as relevant because the um that's it's I think assembly buildings and um like spectator event kind of buildings and how they have I think now they're back to normal so comparing pre pandemic to now it's probably similar but it does make me think about like how the HVAC systems do actually they're aligned with the actual event um so like we have an older building called the memorial coliseum it's agback system goes back to the 50s and it doesn't operate in the deepest of winter it doesn't operate in summer because the hbac system can't handle it so um it I would do really well on its eui compared to a mean for assembly and then we have another building that is very temperature controlled uh is in frequent use um that has a a very different eui um but one's very efficient and like the building's efficient the hbac system is newish the other one's very inefficient all glass has an HX Sy from the 50s but has a better UI so how do you treat those kinds of yes definitely the the pieces to have in consideration we're looking at that at euis okay Blake I think we can hand it back over to you oh we have a couple more slides um Anna do you want to step forward to yeah we a little bit of takeway yeah a little bit of takeaway and next steps um just a reminder of how we're doing this methodology that we're using those drivers of energy consumption which for the most part are building type and square footage but we have those other drivers as well that we will be looking at and we will be considering um and when you get the slide deck later you know go ahead and take a look at them try to think about what questions you have because the input that you give us is really important for the rest of the entire process and then also remember that all of this input goes into that overall methodology of the target setting so the drivers is just a component and the policy linkage is also important and dependent on you know how those criteria get set all lead to the final Target development that we're going to be working over over the next couple of meetings and the timeline for that just one quick reminder is we're going to be doing that mean eui develop and Target setting this month and next month um with the presentations on that uh both to the rack and to the public in August and September and then moving on throughout the fall towards the final rle making so that's all we have thank you very much for your time and attention and please do let us know what other input you would like to provide to the team uh as we go through this process BL back to you uh yeah thanks thanks so much um for spw and team to go over that methodology and thanks a lot to the rack for all the good comments and discussion there um I thought that was a great overview and something to look forward to you should all have all the rack members should have an invitation for another rack meeting that we've scheduled for August 21st on your calendar now um where we'll kind of come back together and uh implement the methodology that was discussed and actually present the average the mean euis um that that are our starting point for our Targets on on August 21st so um that'll be something to look forward to and we'll definitely be looking for more uh collaborative discussion and comments at that time too and leading up to that meeting um and if you do have any other comments on on today's meeting or anything that was uh discussed feel free to send those to me and I'm happy to to forward those on and relay them on to the to the team too as they're going through their analysis so thanks a lot for everyone for that section so uh now we can kind of um I'll share my screen here and kind of go back to the agenda for today's meeting um so that that covered our our first item eui Target development and the next item that we wanted to to tee up for rack discussion or rack input is this uh concept of energy data aggregation so um we've we've started to let me share the right screen um here we go so we've we've started to kind of get to the the concept of and the scenario where we've got a a building that has multiple meters um you know multiple tenants that control those meters and pay the bills uh for those meters and the the legislation started to consider this sort of a scenario um but then directed it to be part of the rul making so if you look back house build 349",

        "text": " charging automatically once it's hovering over it so that's called on Route and then of course at night time it's going to be charged at our Dell web Facility by being plugged yeah a very fancy yeah an electric bus after the warranty period is expected to have the same overall cost per mile of most other buses so it's more expensive to procure them but the long range benefit is for graders any questions that I could possibly answer about the battery electric bus program before I move on to a few other initiatives I have just one quick question uh it looks like now we can use electric cars in emergencies as house backup has there been any discussion on any sort of resiliency aspect for the bus battery which I have to imagine a pretty large yes I'm unsure do you know about that 10 or Chris I don't know uh all the details but it's similar to an electric vehicle car uh yeah the battery banks are much larger than the car so obviously yeah so it's like have many Tesla walls available and so yeah the energy is able to be like an emergency for example you could actually deploy a bus to serve as a backup system I believe it's possible and Chris did you have any other yeah I was going to say it might be possible but it's something that we have not explored at this time sure okay thank you thank you any other questions okay care the target for deployment spring yes our Target is January okay you should see them on the road soon you looked a little nervous when you said yeah so January expression so January is the date that they'll be fully deployed you'll start seeing them out on the road for training because there's a fairly extensive training process that we have to go through with the operators and also just some real life testing as far as battery use and those types of things on the route so in the coming months you'll see them out on the Route 11 simulating uh writing or in service and then January it'll be full deployment thank you I guess um is it public knowledge like how big are the batteries like Teslas have like 100 kilowatt hour batteries what are these for the buses I wish I knew that off the top of my I don't have that but we could get okay just curious yeah totally in support of this I agree with everything so I'd like to talk about their renewable natural gas program that chariots has as well so RNG is a capturing of orangier renewable natural gas so the capturing of methane from decomposing organic sources for instance landfills dairy farms refining and pumping it into the natural gas pipeline so chariots uses renewable natural gas since 2018 December of 2018 and the program works by having these producers through a broker a partner and certified fleets as an off user of the RNG produced and chariots is an off-user for this and so from an environmental impact or aspect methane is a greenhouse gas and the methane is being captured so it's not going out into the atmosphere and refined and then placed into the natural gas pipeline going directly to so um that is a benefit of capturing that methane and going into our buses so are you getting specific like from a specific Source are you really just kind of paying for this broader program that augments natural gas like with renewable natural gas so we're um I just talked to Greg Thompson our maintenance manager about this the other it's not at the point where we can say we're pulling from this dairy farm right now he's hoping to get there someday but right now it's just from the options on a list and then we're getting the benefits essentially you're subsidizing the program and then right okay yes it's like renewable energy credits yeah that's all right yeah okay exactly we recently with the last few years replaced our bus wash so uh chariots Prides ourselves and having really clean vehicles for riders in our community and the Rainy winter months every bus is washed every day and during the summer months it's usually every other day so clean and well maintained vehicles have shown that increases perceived safety and uh so it is important for us to keep the fleet clean for our writers in our community so this creates a large amount of water since we have you know 64 local buses plus we have our regional and our Paratransit as well so the bus wash the old bus wash was very inefficient and mostly ineffective so the bus washer was replaced with one that has much smaller footprint that does a much better job and especially scrubbing the back and under uh the uh normal conditions requiring less maintenance so with this new bus wash we were able to install a Water Reclamation system that catches cleans and reuses the water we added a reverse osmosis final rinse to reduce class water spots negating the need for our blower to dry at the end on the windshield and through this bus wash the new uh one reduces our soap usage by nearly 70 percent and our water consumption for the bus wash by 80 percent so this is a really exciting feature and I like to talk about it a lot so um but yeah the best water wash replacement has been super beneficial is that a no web also yes so we also have an r99 program so we have 64 heavy duty buses 30 of those are diesel and 34 are renewable natural gas so for the diesel buses we're using r99 we were doing B20 which is a blend of diesel 80 and then the 20 is soy pudding oil and residual cooking oil algae animal fat and canola which is better than just regular diesel B20 was a huge Improvement but then our 99 came to be as an option and it's made much like bio but it's not a blend it is the fuel and uh let's see here uh so we checked we tested B20 by wet feeling a small isolated part of our Fleet to determine if any unforeseen issues that arise they worked well we used B20 we then began investigating the use of either a mixture of biofuel and renewable diesel r99 was experiencing some positive results in the industry so when r99 started to become available chariots was using every chance they could there are some supply issues because Portland took the majority of the r99 but then when uh there was more readily available than uh Downstream we were able to consume after that so uh our sole source of fuel for our diesel fleet is r99 now is r99 renewable diesel are all of our diesel vehicles run on that as well yeah oh awesome in the city great that's cool before was it B20 you know I just know it's renewable okay okay that's why I was asking I've never heard the different letters I'm not sure whichever and there's a lot of letters yeah okay the other program is our re-refined oil program so re-refined oil is a process where news oil like motor oil is processed back to a pure base stock and then the additives are added back in so the oil never wears out but the additives do so instead of getting rid of our oil we actually go through the re-refine process takes out those additives um so it come boils down to a virgin oil and then we re-add brush additives so because of this kind of Statistics chariots have used 62 856 quarts or 15 000 or so gallons of re-refined oil it takes 24 barrels of crude oil to make 12 gallons of motor oil so chariots have saved um almost 3 000 barrels of crude from being produced just from this one we refined oil program our LED lighting project so when our Kaiser Transit Center was being built in 2013 or was built LED lighting was the original option so since that time chariots had conducted three major initiatives to replace the lining on the transit mall at the downtown Transit Center the exterior of our administrative and maintenance facilities and within all bus working areas within the maintenance shop so each time one of these phases was completed reliability of the lighting was increased so Greg Thompson again manager maintenance said that the repair cost and the time before LED took uh I mean you could go down to the trend downtrend Transit Center and there was always bulbs out and since LED it's not the case and so it's been a huge safety um Improvement as well as cost for maintenance and upkeep and then while the project costs varied the rebates from the Energy Trust of Oregon typically saw a return on our investment in 14 to 24 months I would like to share this picture uh the befores on the top left and then this is out at Del Webb so this is our Maintenance and Facilities location we have some administrative offices and as you can see behind our shop is where we store the buses in the evening time and so um top left is before and then after and this is one example so we did it not only at Del Webb but ktc downtown Transit Center and uh there's a lot of positives from it including okay so my last slide is about kind of the behind the scenes so those were really great examples of what charities is doing in regards to sustainability you know public facing and you know what our writers can experience on our buses and and washing and whatnot and then uh we also have an established a sustainability committee our Green Team I'm the chair of the sustainability committee and it was established um I'd say about 10 or so years ago and uh since covid I you know kind of brought it back to life and our committee our three priorities is Outreach education both internal and outside and as well as recommendations and research about various um ways we can improve as an agency and then also um the sustainability Committee just initiated a greenhouse gas emissions inventory over calendar year 2022 we just got the results about a month or so ago and they were presented to our board at the August work session and then from the Baseline information it's going to feed into our climate action plan so we're going through writing of the scope right now and the procurement process in order to bring uh consultant on to help us develop the kind of action plan that isn't complementary to our local Regional Partners including City of Salem and then also the county and the state level organ ODOT and then um so the climate action plan is a huge Initiative for the district it's one of our 13 activities for two fiscal year 24 which we're currently in right now and uh to kind of get started we're also",

Gonzalez and our alternate is not available so um I'd also like to just go around the room and have other people do introductions as well sure I'm Jeff Johnson I'm uh resources planner in public works I'm Bobby Kidd I am the Strategic initiatives administrator from chariots welcome I am Ted stonecliffe I'm a Transit planner at chariots okay sorry uh and I'm Robert Chandler assistant director of Public Works okay city manager hi another dimke Public Works welcome everybody did you receive any anybody for public comment I didn't receive any public comments okay and nobody's here to speak uh so we have our minutes from the from three six and five eight any comments or all right Perfect all right we will turn it over to our desk thank you so much that's right I looks like somebody's annoying there oh thank you also from Chariot okay lots of moving Parts there sure is all right thank you so much I'm Bobby Kidd as I previously mentioned I'm the Strategic initiative administrator for chariots I've been with chariots almost two years and uh okay I'll just oh yes there we go thank you dive in return it's almost two years and uh two of my main initiatives that I've been working on so far is I'm the project manager for the organizational strategic plan and then my second main initiative that I've been working on is I'm the champion of sustainability across the organization it's a lot of moving parts we have you know operations with our Maintenance and Facilities our Fleet and then we have a lot of behind the scenes admin work and so I'm just kind of coordinating those efforts and today I'm here to speak to a brief update about the the various initiatives or projects that charius is currently working on or has accomplished around sustainability and then what we're looking to uh forward so future climate action plan and things of those sorts so thank you so much for having me today please let me know if you have any throughout and after so I am going to briefly go through our four services and uh the first one is our chariots local and that is um the service within the Stephen Kaiser Urban growth boundary we have 21 local fixed routes with 64 buses and it operates seven days a week all of the buses have an extensive list of accessibility features all are Ada accessible and currently we just implemented the electric electronic Fair system for payment in August so that's really exciting I rode the bus here and it was one of the first times I was able to scan with my app I used to be since I was an employee I could just use my badge but now everybody's using the app internally or the card so exciting stuff and and with that comes Fair capping so individuals or writers who can build each day pay if they would like to for a day pass and then at a certain point it caps for the month instead of having to continue paying um for uh the whole month at caps at the 30-day rate so that's exciting and then something else I'd like to highlight is a youth ride free program and that is a partnership between the City of Salem thank you and in the city of Kaiser and uh the school district and Chariot so that has proven to be very successful and the ridership for youth has increased tremendously and so that's just a feature I wanted to highlight around about the local service so the second service I would like to highlight is the Chariots Regional so that the public transportation that provides service to our 17 rural areas surrounding Salem and Kaiser and then our chariots Lift Service uh if the Paratransit transportation service for the Salem Kaiser area chariots lift is an origin to destination shared ride public transportation service and it's for individuals who are unable to use a regular Terry's local bus service due to functional limitation an application process helps identify those individuals and they are scheduled over the phone through a call center and then finally we have the Chariot shop and ride this has two arms um which first of all shop and ride is for senior 60 and over and people with disabilities and all Chariot shop and ride buses are Ada accessible as well and unlike chariots list no applications are required for this service so the two arms is the Dial-A-Ride service and that has resumed post covet and that picked you up at home and takes it to any destination with Salem kinds of urban growth boundary medical appointments have priority and again that's for sixth year or over and people with disabilities and then the second arm is the writer uh right Shopper shuttle service which is not resumed post covet but that's a a grocery store um system thank you I'll be coming back anytime uh that is something that our executive team is weighing the pros and cons um at this time we're sticking with the Dollar Ride only but uh we'll be reviewing the shop and ride soon I I don't have a time for when we might be implementing that again but um all I can say is that it's going to the executive team for consideration soon next couple of months okay thank you Chad and this is Ted can you introduced himself earlier but thank you um and then uh so those are the four Services local Regional Paratransit or um lift and then our dialer ride so another uh uh service I'd like to highlight is the commuter options program so the the main purpose behind the commuter options program is to reduce traffic congestion pollution dependence on gas and oil energy consumption and stress and so why reduce better air quality to save money community livability and conserve resources so how does the program achieve this uh they provide information and connecting and help around uh carpooling vanpooling bicycling walking there's several challenges throughout the year to promote this and then also there's uh group best past programs where businesses can um buy a some passive at a discounted rate for their employees so the commuter options program is this is that's where this is housed in it's a great program so on to talking about sustainability once we kind of have the you know the Baseline the bread and butter what chariots does so some sustainability highlights I'd like to start with the battery electric bus project and there are 10 battery electric buses that have been delivered in our own sites chariots will be the second Transit Agency in the nation to have both Depot which is plug-in charging for the battery electric buses as well as inductive um on the same bus they're going to be compatible with both and uh so we have 10 on site and we have also grant funding for 10 more that will be procured uh Depot Chargers will be installed at the Del Webb maintenance and then inductive Trojan construction has started at Kaiser the transit center and uh this month so just a couple weeks ago or a week or so ago and if you haven't been out to Kaiser tran center I'd suggest taking a look it is a construction site so it might not be the most beautiful site in the world but to me it is I think it's gorgeous because that means the battery electric buses are coming uh and then all of the stakeholders around the infrastructure meeting uh meet bi-weekly so there's it's been a process to get the infrastructure going and now it's going and we're hoping to get the battery electric buses on Route shortly or as soon as possible and you might be wondering well where is the route going to be that's going to be electrified it's route 11. it's our largest route it serves both Salem and Kaiser and there's diversity so the first 10 buses are slated to Electrify in Route 11 which serves Lancaster beginning at the jail traveling through business districts residential communities Chemeketa Community College and all the way to our Kaiser Transit Center uh and then because the Route 11 is our busiest uh service both Salem and Kaiser so we thought it was going to be a a great route to Electrify and again this is where we're starting so this is the first 10 buses but with the other uh buses coming there's going to be more routes electrified but this is where we're starting at the good a good spread and uh very densely populated so the um benefits of the electrification with the zero tailpipe emission is going to be wonderful in a condensed area like so the battery electric bus benefits these are just a few um I don't have all day to kind of talk about all of them but just some highlights of zero tailpipe emissions it's cleaner air the battery electric buses don't have tailpipes so there's nothing coming out of them uh because there is not one and there's also very uh quiet uh you can hear a soft purr if you're on the bus or directly buy it but in general it's a quiet uh vehicle and it's also reduced maintenance time so although it's costly for parts uh it doesn't require as much maintenance and then once you get the parts it's easier to fix that's what the the findings are and let's see here hello how often we have to charge uh daily just once a day well some will be on Route charging so depending upon the route um it will be when it stops that kind of Transit Center the inductive so I'll be pulling over a charging infrastructure and I'll just be charging automatically once it's hovering over it so that's called on Route and then of course at night time it's going to be charged at our Dell web Facility by being plugged yeah a very fancy yeah an electric bus after the warranty period is expected to have the same overall cost per mile of most other buses so it's more expensive to procure them but the long range benefit is for graders any questions that I could possibly answer about the battery electric bus program before I move on to a few other initiatives I have just one quick question uh it looks like now we can use

restrictive and since it came from the governor's office and went straight to lcdc and we were not asked what we thought or what it was going to look like or anything else I don't like mandates and this is absolutely a significant mandate and I'll add the word unfunded to that because this is very much an unfunded mandate that we have to implement on a very fast timeline yeah commissioner Trace I think another Factor here is our uuas are not necessarily uh associated with other corridors for transportation you look at Bethany or others and it makes it even more difficult so I can you know I'm I'm not saying that it's easy to do this in a municipality but I think it's even more difficult when you're talking about some of our more Island type of situations I would just Echo her Point that's a really good point plus where Transit desert in many parts of the county and so you start putting in infill which we've all agreed we need to do and you put in heavy infill meaning large complex with no parking this poor board will be inundated with people who are unhappy about everyone parking in front of their house locking their driveways uh parking go down to the transit center I mean this is going to be a mess at best and just to add one more point on whether or not we joined the legal action there was a relatively short period of time when we could have decided to become a party to that and so it wasn't enough time for staff to even digest the rules as they had been adopted and figure out what it meant for us to implement them and so that's part of the reason as well that we didn't join as one of those parties does that mean we can't comment we'd have to confirm with County Council on that and see what our Avenues are to become a party or file a brief so we could always we could always provide comment at lcdc meetings yes that is a path forward and so we could prepare comment for the April hearing certainly um I just wanted to share that I need to go off camera because being on Eastern time my stomach is growling like nobody's business so I need to go at 7 30 I understand I'm going to try to explain this slide I just go I'm just gonna try to explain this slide it covers multiple sections um code and tries to do so succinctly um there are in general three Pathways for complying with the uh remainder of uh parking uh reform Part B pathway one is simply to repeal all minimum parking requirements throughout the urban unincorporated area of uh Washington County the cities are also considering what to do with this um pathway two and pathway three have a number of attributes that are the same and uh some attributes that are different uh the first two rows there say the same thing you don't have to look to see if there's a word that's different they say they're trying to indicate the same thing the first row has opportunities indicates there would be opportunities to reduce the amount of parking uh required and there's eight categories in which a developer could choose to do something other than um provide additional parking spaces by getting reductions through those types of categories on either Pathway to or pathway three in addition both pathway two and three would require Washington County to develop some form of what's called unbundled parking and that's where the rent lease or sale of property is separated from the parking space um reviewing the Department's guidance on how to implement this they indicate this would generally require the organization to adopt some form of General ordinance related to regulating um the re the rental lease or sale uh agreements uh of existing Residential um and that would be within the transit corridors shown above uh in the case of pathway three or throughout the entire urban area in the case of pathway two in addition the second row there is requires the county to adopt on street parking for 10 of all on-street parking spaces this is uh one of the situations where we may end up with a change in the rules coordinating with their staff indicates that this may not be something that continues to apply to to Washington but it is also a significant number of uh parking spaces that would need to be um we're actually not sure how to count how many parking spaces there are on streets uh in unincorporated Urban Washington County um but 10 would be a a large number we do not have a parking meters or parking pricing program of any sort now and we think it would be difficult to implement um so pathway two is called the fair pricing approach Fair parking approach and requires three of the five policies listed there um pathway three uh tries to get to the reduced regulation name of it and it has a number of limits on the amount of parking that can be required uh minimum parking that can be required for uh that was a lot uh the also parking reform B has parking our existing standards for maximums are not too uh different than what is required here um the new one for us is buildings more than 65 000 square feet floor area that includes residential buildings uh and we don't know exactly um you know how impactful that's going to be but it is uh the surface area parking uh would not be able to be larger than the floor area of the building and we may have some other uh adjustments to certain uses for our parking maximums but we're generally close or uh similar in most parking D also has for when a development does build or expand a parking lot requirements related to how um that lot is designed and structured there are requirements to allow for redevelopment of parking lots including Redevelopment for Transit oriented bicycle parking Etc but conversions to other uses and there's a question I don't blame you I think you're still muted thank you I didn't mean to interrupt your uh oh uh sorry I was on Slide 12. that one on the for residential development the second sub bullet two off street parking spaces didn't we just address parking as part of the middle housing ordinance that's something we've been taking a look at is how this uh interacts with the middle housing uh rules but okay the computer to have come from different separate processes so before we amend the code we'll have to review that in more detail okay all right thank you um so I do want to draw your attention on this slide to um the third bullet down um for parking lots that are more than a quarter acre in size there's a number of uh requirements for a new or expanded lot of that size and in particular there's tree canopy or enhanced tree um uh requirements there and Washington County currently does not have a tree code but we do have a street tree approved list but we don't have any um way of organizing how big the canopy of a tree is while this does require us to provide consideration of that and we don't have anything related to the layout of of trees or features in the in the parking area thank you Steve uh for I just need the quick reminder would this be for new development or would this be retroactive so that existing parking lots would have to be retrofitted to meet the standard this would be for new uh or expanded parking okay thank you expansion could be anything I presume if you expanded the a Rec Center where you're on the complex if you expanded a swimming pool I've expanded something that came in for land use review right what happens it could be anything laundry room get bigger yeah any type of use that is building a parking area would have new requirements for associated with it yeah right that's an incentive plan yeah uh furthermore we're going to balance the budget by putting in paid parking yeah we got a lot of money can we put in parking meters it's basically in District too they're wealthy you said they report it and um furthermore there's uh electric vehicle charging capacity requirements so these go into effect um in about 10 days here uh new multi-family buildings with five or more units must have electrical capacity for service to 40 percent of parking spaces Washington county is addressing this through the electrical permitting process until our development code can be amended uh and updated to to match these requirements so is this a bad I I don't know the full extent of how expensive or impactful it is to install additional electrical service capacity and new construction or remodels for that matter I I don't know uh but it would be for only for multi-family residential buildings five or more units I I don't I I don't know if that's a owner how the impacts there I'm not the expert on electrical service panels I'd like to think the private sector will step into that Gap quickly and say we'll do that for you because I have to believe those are profit centers it's tied to an ORS as well who's not just rules so keep on oh I was going to tell them just a quick question um and I don't want the answer now uh given our affordable housing pipeline construction pipeline uh mizzy and G could we get a summary of which proposals are still in the land use review pipeline that might be affected by this because 40 is pretty steep in my opinion just for 2023 I think it's it's a good goal but to require 40 for 2023 as of April just surprises me a little bit it doesn't include the actual charging system it just includes the electrical service capacity that's my understanding so we've been coordinating with uh other jurisdictions uh Corvallis in the city of tiger to partially removed their uh minimum parking requirements and are seeing the process of updating their development codes the other departments that I've coordinated with are all pursuing uh pathway one is simply a very challenging to to go after the other Pathways a number of jurisdictions in the metro area have also requested uh alternative implementation timelines and that's the one that you were recommending at least for parking B right yeah pathway one remove all minimum parking requirements um it seems like the other pathways are very challenging I think they would be for Washington County as well um but we could explore them further if we had more time so here we are um and then this is part the first part of the regulatory changes again",

        "text": " set out today that the analysts are working with the public saying here are the tools we have Ava and how is the rest of being introduced I guess to to members of the public I'll I'll take the question I I think um you know once the aresta tool was created you know there was um some education and Outreach but I think it's been a while since we've done that and so um you know om car you know our new um operations and analyst you know who's largely doing process Improvement I I literally just had a conversation with her in the last couple of days saying you know maybe we should do you know some type of you know YouTube video you know to better explain how the tool works so I mean I think we can get you know you know sort of forget that you know this isn't you know something that people use all the time and they they should automatically know how to do it which is why I wanted to bring it up here today cuz and clearly people don't know don't understand you know the level of you know sophistication and the amount of layers that are in here and the things that you can do with it and you know definitely we have much more work to do on creating that education so you know we we put the link in the in the notice and I think that's valuable but there should be you know and we recognize that there should be a link to the the map but also probably a link to how to use that you know better better education better opportunities because it is a very sophisticated tool it has a lot of opportunities that was the whole well that was it was the military that paid for us you know for this and and they wanted it to for the purpose of being you know making sure people knew that there were you know important military assets that could be nearby that needed to be evaluated but we leveraged it for the purpose of getting this kind of data out there and so we do have a need to do better education and the reason I asked the question is when I heard um crer speak and um read the letter um that I knew the arest a tool was out there and so do they not have access to it and I knew it was public on the um and how that really played out for the public so I I think it would be good to pursue a tutorial of some kind yeah and and we think we need to come back also and have this on a council agenda item and just walk through you know some different sort of scenarios and how to utilize the data because I mean I think it's it's helpful for you council members to be able to go on here and you know and find information and and do some kind of you know work and Analysis on your own because it's available to you as well yeah I will say I have been out to it and it is somewhat daunting I mean yeah if you're not used to to working with it yeah I mean the value is it has a lot the problem is it has a lot you know it's just I mean the same thing you know that creates difficulties is it can be overwhelming because there's a lot of information in here and it does take a little while and if you're not you don't have a background you know with with GIS or mapping it's it's you know some of it's pretty intuitive but but some of it's not and I think some help uh is that's on our responsibility to kind of help bridge the gap for people just to Qui uh yes councelor berer um just I think it's a great resource and just even the topographic maps because so often you can't can't get a sense of where this place is um but the education piece will be just critical and having gone to the public information meeting in doofer that's probably not the right time in place to introduce the tool because it's too early um but then you don't want to wait until you know it's too late because then people aren't aware of the tools so an online tool that's fun and not daunting um is probably the way to go but um a I know I appreciate sort of sitting and watching somebody manipulate the tool so different people learn differently and it will take some exploration but it's it's a wonderful tool and if we can maximize the use of it I think it will alleviate some of the public frustration thank you okay 3:00 Council L do we need to um make a motion to address okay I need a motion who wants to move we heard one earlier that would work so coun this is counselor buyer um I move we um do not allow an extension of the 45-day comment period for the B2 H to um project um and retain the 45 DayDay comment period that ends on May 30th 2024 um my comment on that is that I appreciate um the time that it takes to review these but that Council has already or the department has already granted the 45-day period instead of the minimum 21 day period so do I have a second I sh conon um thank you um Cindy Cardon um for the record I second that motion then I'd like to discuss for a moment uh we've got a okay discussion so I just want to be clear so the 30th is the last day of the 45 day period right um and so if there was some concern still about the need for an extension could the party then bring It Forward on the 30th and ask for an extension for instance if the the tool that we've just been talking about that should be so helpful wasn't operating I mean that might be something to consider so there is another bite at the Apple um so it's all I have to say Okay um we've got a motion and second secretary esterson could you please call the rot Cindy Condon yes Katie Imes yes Anne berer yes Richard delin yes Perry choc toot yes and Kent how yes motion carries Mr chair okay I believe that completes today's uh meeting is is there anything for the good of the order a last minute thing to say oh yes yeah let's get it off happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday Todd and happy birthday to yeah speech no quick yeah okay with that uh the time is now 3:04 and the April 19th 2024 meeting of the energy facility sighting council is adjourned well done",

        "text": "ical or P construction geotechnical condition where they're going to go out there with with geotechnical engineers and coordinate with dogami in the department and they're going to do some soil testing and geotechnical testing to make sure that everything on the facility components are cited on you know in stable locations with stable soils that structural foil protection is is um becoming a more and more interesting Capital standard to look at um Council looks at the impacts to soils uh taking the accountant mitigation that they are not going that the construction operation retirement of the facility is not going to adversely impact soils oh oh there I am okay so there's two uh primary soil types at the site we're going to talk about this also in land use because it um there as well as it matters here because the types of soils indicate the permeability or how well or not well soils drain that has to do with how susceptible to erosion they may be also well-drained or Sandy soils also are more poor for agriculture and Crop Production because you don't actually have soils that can retain moisture and hold roots of plants so these are the we have a Atkins uh fine sandy loam antiquincy it's cut off at the Box Quincy fine sand there you go okay uh and these two uh soil classes are class four and class six what's interesting for this facility again what council sees for for the vast majority of its other facilities is that applicants often submit a 1200 C nifties permit which has an erosion and sediment control plan as part of it this is a DEQ permit and the applicant which is a federally delegated permit but applicants submit it to support an evaluation under soil protection to say hey we're going to do all of this um as per that that permit um than to use that for findings underneath soil protection and as part of the application what's interesting here and in learning about it is that there's and I I you know I'm going to Super paraphrase here but there's there's kind of two triggers for that DEQ permit and one of them is these the acreage impact the acreage impacted from construction but also excuse me um whether or not there's an interconnection with what Waters of the state date so this has this Nexus with Wetlands which is really interesting which is going to be one of our last ones but basically there's no weapons on the site this this the 1200 C permit doesn't actually apply to this project so this is interesting because we don't have that then as part of this application but what the applicant does do is they they recommend um an erosion and sediment control measures and it's included as attachment i1 which addresses uh not just construction related impacts to soils but also operational impacts to soils which is also something that isn't captured in that nifty's permit um and for other facilities we usually end up doing a different condition for operation to make sure that again those operational activities when you go out to a site to do maintenance or if you have to retrench something that then you have coverage that these are still going to apply for those operational activities okay okay I'm okay moving on all right so Landing standard councilors councils familiar with it um Council must ensure that the facility will comply with Oregon's land use planning goals adopted by the land conservation development commission or lcdc um and then if the facility does not comply with one of the Statewide planning goals the council may find that the facility qualifies for an exception under its land use Rule and then the other part um of what is evaluated under land use um a compliance with the applicable substantive criteria which is uh provided by the special Advisory Group which is Umatilla County in this circumstance and then so there's that uh the evaluation of what is applicable substantive criteria and whether or not the facility meets it and uh any conditions that would go underneath associated with that as as well So speaking of the criteria here the table two I have up here is old double no it's not old it's the one from the draft proposed order but the cap the applicant in its comments basically said well there is in land use condition two and in the DPO we drafted findings which were based off of the county identifying its criteria um that they said that ucdc section 152.562 includes design details for the like the parking lot associated with the O M enclosure so um and this is a kind of a a cool aspect of uh the the capsules rules is that the record closes at the the close of the hearing on the draft proposed order but council's rules do contemplate that there may be some outstanding questions that happen from there so Council does council's rules does uh allow the department we call it um we call it agency uh consultation for the proposed order so we can actually go out to reviewing agencies and ask some questions and do some you know reviewing and so we've done that in a couple instances one is with Umatilla County on this applicant comment to which the county did right um and they said um whatever uh what did they say whatever they said um that the UCD the the the the development code in question consists of design details for parking lots and since the solar project is not a business open to the public where members of the public would visit and required a dedicated and improved parking area in the parking lot design standards would not generally apply to this project so um we are in our recommendation is that in the proposed order we're going to strike out and remove that from this table along with the evaluation in the order and we're going to footnote to kind of tell that um you know to so for the future um but then there was a provision of that in land use a condition too that would also be struck out so uh the goal three exception um in the draft proposed order um we make uh findings underneath uh three of the reasons one of them is locational dependency minimal direct impacts to add within the subject tracks minimal and direct uh indirect impacts to AG within the surrounding area and um minimal impacts to resources protected by Council standards the recommended land use condition six and is recommended to support the evaluation under the locational dependency because the department does recommend that this is a unique site because there is no transmission line and it is located in a manner that is advantageous to tie into one of those existing transmission lines and land use condition six basically says well hey you know tell us which one it is eventually you know when you can't paraphrasing there um that is that and then the next part is kind of what the bigger discussion at um council's review of the draft proposed order so and in our staff you know we've paraphrased um uh council member Jenkins Howe and buyers comments try to capture them um and I feel like the applicant did a um I'm gonna then peel away from here and I'm gonna open up well there's the canvas comment I'm gonna open up the applicant's supplemental responses so in exhibit K so um council member Howe and Jenkins provided feedback and raised good questions because it identified a you know a discrepancy in the application I'm going to again try to paraphrase and capture uh uh chair Jenkins your I'm sorry council member Jenkins your comments but what um council member Jenkins observed is that in the application we had a figure that showed adjacent plots not within the site boundary as having the same soils but the applicant in in the evaluation of the kind of um the impacts to adjacent AG discuss that hey but there are uh peas and corn and potatoes being grown over there and so um hanley's comment was well but that figure also says that those aren't irrigated so how can you be growing those over there without irrigation but you're saying that you can't do the same here so at the uh hearing on the draft proposed order this was was raised um and the both of the landowners came um and uh Arthur Pryor specific to that comment is the one of the land owner of subject trap one I think yep um which is on the East Side East Square side which I'll pop up a figure here and he confirmed that it indeed you know that figure was wrong and since that figure had been provided they actually um were then part of an Irrigation um entered into the Irrigation District and those Parcels are irrigated um for them him to be able to grow those um and in his testimony um he explained that you know there's minimal water rights out there and so when you have a minimal water right when you're farming you move it to where it's going to be the most beneficial and he indicated not only is there not a water right on the the his parcel part of the subject property but there's also not infrastructure there and it's just not the best land to move a water right to even if he could again that's that's paraphrasing based on his testimony now in the applicant's supplemental responses they uh provided uh declarations and I'm pulling these up here from both of the landowners and in the staff report I start with so I'm talking about art prior because it relates to the discrepancy in the application about whether or not those will face the partials are irrigated or not um so the applicant provided evidence um one his declaration to back up his testimony also to back up the landowner letters in exhibit k that evidences that one yes those are actually irrigated because they were recently added into the um East Irrigation District I think um and that also uh well not and that kind of like wraps it up for him but then he also in his history like he has formed the area um he has limited water rights and the concept of applying it to where it would be the most beneficial um and then they also provide the testimony of uh Declaration of Steve Scott who is the land owner of the uh subject tracked uh two and so he's the gentleman that went out there and and tried to farm that land and he tried to do Dryland wheat on the um and so his testimony reflects his efforts now what it does do which we talked a little bit some at the DPO hearing but it kind of gives metrics and and and data to evidence and support you know his his words um which is he he basically says how much how many how much they were able to yield in 2013 and 2015 and then he gives an estimate of how much revenue they made and then he also talks about how much how much the costs were to",

        "text": " us the in in the expansion area that we are uh you have that's before you here um we have overwhelming support um and actually number of them number of them will be or we expect to be testifying here and certainly in written and verbal testimony provided supportive testimony during our process and our Planning Commission and city council so um in the expansion area we have great neighbors and partners in support of this and we want to make that clear and that's not always the case with an urban growth boundary expansion you can go ahead and Advance please you the second question we saw a lot of comment um about loss of farmland and loss of food production and the loss of the importance of of keeping land and food production um in Oregon um working with our property owners we ask them um are you is your land farmed um if it is what's what does it grow each year um is any of that food product food crops and how much is that grown and what we identified on about 800 acres of our expansion area of property owners that we were able to get to um in in you know four or five days of kind of asking this question after seeing letters that have come in only 8% of the acreage in our expansion area is growing any kind of food the vast majority of it is growing grass seed and clover and fur trees Nowa when food is grown there's actually only one farmer who's annually permanently growing food of any kind and that's a Orchard um any other food that's grown is actually very occasionally rotated in strawberries as well as winter wheat so I you know we want to be accurate we want to be clear and our property owners can answer questions and and tell you what's grown grown on their property but the expansion area around North Plains is overwhelmingly not food in the expansion of this ugb would not impact food production in Washington County and we want to be clear about that so thank you um if we can go ahead and scroll to the next one please there's also a lot of comment or concern or at least information that's being spread about that North Plains is planning a 500 Acre Site on its west side within its new Urban growth boundary that's based on some misunderstanding it's based on some old information and we want to clarify that this exhibit right here is the page right out of our economic opportunities analysis the document that would that uh Todd mentioned was adopted by city council and was acknowledged by the state and this details what large sites we are planning for there's no 500 Acre Site for Semiconductor in our Urban growth boundary expansion the semiconductor task force back last summer identified North plains as a potential candidate for a 500 Acre Site and the city council decided yes the city would be a partner if something along but we are not this ugb expansion planning process that continues to this day never did include a 500 Acre Site and this ugb expansion currently does not include that so we want to be clear about that because there's a lot of misinformation that persists for reason um so anyway uh next slide please I need to speed it up sorry about that that actually oh anyway here's the urban growth R so we'll go and turn over to the mayor thank you very much all right thank you very much bill so um North Plains has been my home for nearly 17 years and over the past um 15 years I've actually dedicated an incredible amount of the time volunteering on the city council and other boards and committees and I've witnessed the challenges we face on multiple levels due to a lack of specific city services resources and sustainable funding as far back as 2000 the community has talked about a vision to capture more economic growth in the region recently in 2015 the community community members business owners uh City staff um we actually developed a vision statement that guides the city council's banial goals this statement empowers us to see growth and Independence while preserving our small town charm and a sense of community preserving our Town's charm is always always top of mind every Council and every mayor stretching back to Butch Kindle has looked at thoughtful and appropriate growth in September 2021 after years of discussion the city council approved resolution number 2160 establishing four priorities for the community and economic development within the ugb expansion study process first we aim to reverse the bedroom community Trend by creating a thriving jobs housing balance second we want to grow business Investments to diversify our property tax base and reduce long commutes third we aim to sustainably fund community and economic infrastructure to enhance Community Health and diversity and fourth we want to expand local Commercial Services which offers shorter distance distances for residents to travel to grocery stores coffee shops Etc in closing I I think you will see North Plains take shape as a well-planned thoughtful Community we agree about smart growth but we will do better we will do one better than that we intend to grow thoughtfully intentionally and with the best interest of our res residents and our businesses we want to keep north PL strong and flourishing for the future and now I'll turn this over to City Hurst as I said before um I'm Cynthia Hurst and I'm um a city of North Plains resident um my husband and I moved to North Plains 43 years ago um population was 700 people um I was also mayor from 1989 to and my husband has been on the Planning Commission and city council for a total of 20 years over our 43e um term living there since my term as mayor I have served on many committees and boards and continue to serve on the city budget committee the downtown Improvement plan project policy advisory committee and I'm also on the North Plains Parks Foundation I am president of the North plane senior Plaza which is a lowincome senior apartment building that provides affordable housing for seniors um I have been a member of the Chamber of Commerce since its Inception in 1986 as a business owner I am now retired and I am on the board of directors for the chamber and that's whom I'm speaking for today I have seen North Plains grow for from a full rural community where all of the businesses catered to all of the Agricultural around and that has now changed to a housing community where people have to travel outside of the city to go to work big difference in 40 years I have I I have continued to be involved in the city's develop Vel M because I saw that the city was having to follow the development within its boundaries rather than be a leader in their own City the county and the state and Metro have always up to this point have always dictated what North Plains could and could not do this is the first thing that has come from the city by the city for the city all of the laws and policies that have been put in place affect affected North Plains without consideration of future changes you can see that by the boundary by our Urban growth boundary now when I was mayor in 1990 our Urban growth boundary was the city limit we're required by law to have a 20-year Urban growth boundary this is the second time that this has come to you but this one has been made by the by the citizens okay um this is a plan for the next 20 years just like the previous ugb plan the plan is for small and medium scale manufacturing warehouse distribution grocery General merchandise shops the lack of Commercial Services forces our residents to go outside the community for their needs the national goal to reduce our carbon footprint goes hand inand with providing space for business development closer to housing areas our residents created a vision in 2015 as the beginning of this plan eight years ago the city has taken extra steps to involve the residents and businesses in the direction of growth this is a plan sculpted by the residents over the past eight years and yet remains within the scope of Oregon's land use laws I appreciate your service on Planning Commission I know that it is a difficult job and thank you again for listening to us good evening chlock wood and Commissioners again I'm Stuart king and the chairman of the North Plains Planning Commission I moved into North Plains in 1994 was appointed to the Planning Commission in 1995 uh was elected to the chair position in 2001 has held that position continuously to this date I'm one of the few people in North plains that was involved in the last ugb expansion in the late 90s early 2000s I believe we have done a more efficient job this time around uh our last ugb expansion was based on housing needs uh this uh ugb expansion is a balance of our housing needs and the need for employment ground the city council of North PL vision is to change North Plains from a bedroom community to a more self sustaining Community we pay more for services per capita than most Washington County cities an increase in employment ground will allow the per capita cost on residents and uh will increase the our tax base this will also allow for employment opport more employment opportunities and services for our citizens since our last ugb expansion Metro introduced a five mile buffer around the you the metro ugb in Washington County the land in this buffer was divided into urban and rural reserves the rural reserves were identified to protect Agricultural and farmlands for the next 50 years the cities of North Plains and Banks were within this F mile buffer but not part of Metro we could not participate in determining our own Urban Reserve areas a different category of undesignated lands was created that did identify lands around North and Banks to protect our right to determine our own urbanization for future growth it is in these undesignated lands which are not protected under the reserve rural Reserve designation that we are planning our future Urban growth expansions are costly lengthy and time consuming I believe it is more efficient and fiscally responsible to ask for more land and use less than to ask for less and need more thank you for your time thank you all very much now um I thought it might be appropriate to allow uh say up to five minutes if Commissioners have questions for the uh Team from North Plains if not uh we'll open our public hearing and have our public testimony yes commissioner Kaiser are you you're willing to yes thank you chair uh guys looking at this expansion um it's a uh an ambitious expansion um I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you arrived at uh the acreage that you did I know that uh um Mr borw",

        "text": " certificate holder has the organizational expertise to do everything to build own operate uh manage and ultimately decommission the facility um so it's sort of a broader thing but I mean that's all included in all of the specific standards that they provide the correct information do we have the right management plan and that's getting back into the details like I said not to minimize the questions on who's doing what and when and how that's all important and that's all within the meat weed management plan as that gets perfected over time and but think what's the level you know that needs to be in that plan at approval versus you know how much then gets perfected over time based upon project thank you I guess I just look at it you know we're having these conversations so hopefully the public uh the folks who are directly affected can take some of our thoughts and our ideas and they can take them back when they're having their conversations with the developers thank you sorry Chris we are no no no need to apologize this is your time and your um okay um I uh uh so I I would add just one thing that in our conversations with both the county um and others we we have we do acknowledge that there is limited availability of um P like licensed pesticide applicators and other vendors in this area um and they're in high demand with with all the development and so part of the reason that we took this approach of uh requiring the preconstruction uh plan and requiring the implementation of that plan was to ensure that uh both the personnel and the timing the Personnel at the time that ground disturbing activities would actually happen uh had been clearly thought out and arranged for before they actually start moving dirt around and and opening up land that that that could increase the likelihood of an infestation or an infestation spreading um and and that is I think something new and and additional that we are proposing for this facility um and and we do hope that the approach will help the certificate holder get a hold get ahead of of any potential issues by by taking really the early action um to to get out there and either eradicate existing in uh infestations or do pre-treatment of the ground distrib areas to make sure that they don't come into the new distrib areas so um I I think that the the issue is raised of whether or not not only next era has the capability but just whether there's enough people to to get ahead of the issue um are are very valid and I I think we've given a pretty clear overview of what we've done to address that but I appreciate the discussion all I um so uh moving forward in the fish and wildlife habitat standard still which um we'll know currently most of our weed control issues do fall kind of under fish and wildlife habitat standards or the land use standards um which again is its own interesting uh twist um so the proposed order other also in the fish and wildlife habitat standard the proposed order recommends changes to condition con fw2 um that's reducing seasonal avoidance poppers for fenus Hawk nness from 6 to.5 miles um that was based on ODFW guidance and comments on the record um the condition also allows for restrictions avoidance restrictions around those nests to be lifted if a nest is determined to be unoccupied for the nesting season on or after May 31st uh so essentially the certificate holder has to send a biologist out do Nest checks on all the uh Nest that they identified in their pre in the surveys that were um submitted as part of the uh request and then make sure that there's no birs using those tests in the seasons before they um conduct work within the the appropriate buffer um the proposed order uh also makes one clarification if you'll remember in the draft proposed order the department recommended and the council um I believe agreed with a change uh to require the uh thresholds of concern for bird and bat species to be updated prior to finalization of the wildlife monitoring and mitigation plan um when we issued the draft proposed order the condition one condition said that that plan should be done before construction one said it should be done operations uh when the termines and the the fatality monitoring would actually start um to make those consistent with each other we've changed them both to require the plan to be finalized before um and we think that makes sense it'll also give the biologist that obw more time to kind of get information and and help us determine what those appropriate thresholds might be next slide um based on comments on the proposed order uh the based on comments on the draft proposed order the proposed order uh recommends changes to condition pre H4 um we had already recommended a condition that the certificate holder be required to submit a complete section 106 documentation form um when there would be uh visual impacts to Historic built environment resources in the analysis area um based on comments that uh there were potential impacts to the Bartholomew Meers Farm which is an inhp eligible property in the viewshed of the facility but outside of the analysis area we recommended that um the section 106 documentation form also be required for impacts to that form um what that form is is a uh kind of a tool for recordation of both the historic attributes of a historic resource um and a and and what the potential impacts to the visual setting and other attributes of that resource would be um it's pretty commonly used as mitigation in other contexts for impacts to for impacts to to Historic resources particularly indirect impacts SE oficial impacts um yeah so uh this was one of the contested issues so we'll come back to this a little bit more but if there's any questions about what that is I'm happy to answer you right um and one more on that slide okay um getting into the public services and Wildfire uh issues that came up in public comments the proposed order does uh require the certificate holder to revise their Emergency Management plan to include additional information about how fire supression and response activities will be uh carried out and coordinated with local fire service providers and other emergency re service providers prior to finalization of that plan um we've uh yeah and actually if you can go to the next slide um so we we are also uh requiring similar con consultation and coordination with fire service districts and emergency service providers for the Wildfire mitigation plans um that would be applicable both to construction and operation of the facility um and I just want to again um clarify that because this is an older facility that was originally approved prior to the adoption of the um wildfire mitigation plan um it kind of worked out so that a lot of the fire prevention and risk management um actions are described in the Wildfire mitigation plan a lot of the fire response um actions and coordination are included in that Emergency Management plan um so there's two plans addressing fire um we we recommended the conditions be revised to require both of those plans be reviewed um at least and with with local emergency services provide uh Emergency Services personnel and local fire protection districts um uh and so that coordination should actually be going on pel uh Vice chair cond um thank you quick question um consultation and review does that require a sign off is there any evidence of sign off by a reviewing a reviewer uh I it it doesn't formally ire a sign off it does require our approval and we you know we look for your direction on what level of evidence you want to satisfy that the local uh providers concerns have been addressed um you know I think our standard procedure would be um to see what the applicant provides if they provide just a general comment letter we might have a follow-up call with with the Personnel identified just to make sure that they fully understand what they were asked and and if they have any out saying concerns before we issue our final approval um but I think what we would expect to see is a just a general letter saying that they've been consulted uh seeing if they have any recommendations but um since the certificate holder is doing a lot of this coordination um we would hope that all their recommendations would have already been uh incorporated into whatever we're receiving and we just get a what saying that they're happy with the final result I think I once heard that hope is not a strategy and I guess for this particular one Wildfire mitigation especially is a new standard for us and one we're responsible for with no reviewing agency identified I'd prefer some sort of sign off that somebody with experience and um expertise in the subject matter would review and sign it as evidence that it makes sense to someone um thank you secretary cornette for the record Todd cornet um thanks Vice chair con yes I think you know we we're hear what you're saying here and so that's in the in the record so you know should this move forward I think yeah we'll we'll be very careful make sure we have good and adequate documentation to verify you know as Chris said you know whoever the service providers have meaningfully evaluated you know and responded um you you know I've had a conversation recently and we do intend to bring back um more as an information um sort of uh had the Wildfire standard for some time we've had some examples um and I think it's about time that we kind of re-evaluate to see how's it working um you know what's been done what what's your comfort level what's your direction and so that that type of thing as well um you know and absolutely heard what you just said but also that should be thought through later on when we're seeking you know more General kind of Direction from Council about how you would us like us to implement that standard thank you yeah councelor buer this is councelor Byer um just an observation that we rely heavily on reviewing agencies federal state local and where those reviewing agencies are involved having something in the record saying yes this is great like the wildlife piece making sure that we have something in the record that says ODFW agrees with these changes it can be an email it can be you know something as simple as that just when we rely on somebody else's expertise and the applicant relies on them to have that quick box checked basically to know that they've been consulted and agree with the mitigation plan um because we do of rely on on others to inform our decisions so thank you thank you council members and I believe the certificate holders representatives are in the audience so uh they they've heard uh and we'll make sure that um our consultant that's helping us you know cross all the te's and Dot the eyes with pre-construction compliance also",

        "text": " in grass seed production um just in in that area typically in Lynn County there's a lot of grass seed production in that area and I believe this is um that as well we will certainly know more about that as we proceed further into the review process um and that all that information will be required to be in the application once it's submitted but uh but again I I believe you are correct thank you um I don't have this on any of the slides but I will make notes since we are just working on it right now trying to get the notice out uh again we you know we've determined that everything um required to be in the notice of intent is in the notice of intent and um we are working um particularly Chase uh Mickey Walker is working on the notices and so we intend to have a notice a public notice sent out on Tuesday or Wednesday so this would be um the adjacent property owner notice email notification and then likely Thursday of next week we'll have the newspaper notice out so that will alert um if they're not already alerted to the project that we received the notice of um and that we are going to be holding a public information meeting in the city of Brownsville at City Hall and I believe that is on July 25th that would be in the evening um starting at five but we'll we'll confirm all those details those will be in the notice and we will send that notice out to the council as well so you'll you'll see that early next week uh next slide please I know we've done this several times but it's probably a good opportunity this is Cindy story to interrupt uh before you go on um are can you go back to the um previous slide just for a second so um are the enclosed black Air are those uh separate tax slots or Property Owners do you know how many property owners are involved I do not recall I'm sure that's in the notice of intent um just based upon the acreage I would imagine there are multiple tax slots um you know even if it's all under one ownership which I believe it is but but I would need to confirm that I would think that there are certainly multiple tax slots that it would be located on okay and I I was just curious if the tax slots are represented here by the law you know we've got not just a boundary but there are internal I was just wondering if those were designating the the boundary lines probably well I can't confirm that sometimes you know the the property or the project boundary lines do follow tax hotlines but sometimes they follow Farm Fields so it could be you know property owner you know has um different farming on the same tax lot you know one uh you know a good valuable farm field and maybe want a less valuable farm field so um I've not done enough look at the details of the project to be able to confirm one way or another but we will have that information moving forward so unfortunately I'm sorry I don't have a good answer to your question no worries thanks um so going back to the steps in our process so the slide shows the the major steps in our process the the um and then that those are the you know the top row the Chevrons um going from the notice of intent all the way through the council's decision the second row would be the the main driver of that um that phase and then the next two boxes are really the sort of particip participation opportunities and who participates in it so so you can see that the the first box the notice of intent that's where we're at right now and that's that's surrounded by you know the the yellow box uh the applicant is the main driver they submitted their notice of intent this includes a public notice which again I indicated we are working on right now um there will be a public comment period um that'll be in the range of 45 days between when we send the notice out and then when the the the public comment period won't conclude at the public information meeting it will go past that and then there's also agency coordination so we will be getting out memos very soon to the local government I've been in communication with the local County planning director and this is what we're doing today is appointing them to you know to be a special Advisory Group that is really the purpose of this agenda item not just an overview of the project but then we'll also be sending memos out to State agencies and tribal governments that that are identified in this process as and just a reminder that um you know they submitted the notice of um the latter part of last month and the notice of intent is good for two years so they will have two years within which to submit their preliminary application um if they fail to do that the notice of intent will expire and they'll have to resubmit a notice of intent um so and then also the timing trigger from that date in May when they submitted the notice of intent is the next phase the project order which is the list of standards and requirements that has to be submitted in the application we the department you can see we're the driver of that one we have 140 days to issue the the project order and so we have to sequence getting the notice out holding the public information meeting sending out memos to all of the state agencies local governments tribal governments getting comments back from them in order to to inform us on what should be included in the project order and again we have 140 next slide please so going back to the land use review Patrick talked about this on one of his slides and you know if you remember the diagram talked about sort of the two paths whether there's a local Landings path or the fsec path so the applicant until they submit their preliminary application has the ability to choose who's going to do the land use review they can choose the local government to do the land use review or they can choose fsec to do that review in the notice of intent the applicant has indicated that they are going to be seeking fsec to conduct the land use review as part of its Consolidated review and again I've had that conversation with the local government Lynn County as well so they're aware of that the applicant can change their mind at the prior to the preliminary application and choose the local land use path so will still see whether they continue to want to do that but as a result of them choosing the energy facility citing Council to conduct a land use review the Lynn County Board of County Commissioners must be appointed as a special Advisory Group that's a statutory mandate next slide please so what that means for Lynn County is today yeah really there's no other opportunity that's why you'll see that there's really the staff's recommendation is a single recommendation councils options are really one option you don't have the ability to not appoint them as a special Advisory Group because that's a mandate in statute I've already sent them a letter had a couple phone calls but I already sent them a letter giving them a heads up that that would be occurring during this council meeting and what their role is as a special Advisory Group will be sending them a follow-up letter after this but just to reiterate you know what is their role as a special Advisory Group so at the notice of intent stage we're going to be seeking any issues of concern you know it's their knowledge of the the project location is certainly going to be a lot better than ours and we want to know what issues of concern they have if they were going to be conducting the review to what would their land use criteria be do they have any directly applicable comprehensive plan Provisions so that would be the applicable substantive criteria are there any data or studies that needed to be done or evaluated to determine compliance with the land use standards what are the necessary permits and then do they have any thoughts or ideas on the analysis area so I don't have a particular slide we do usually when we have the public information meeting is in the notice of intent dictates study area distances based upon certain certain issues or standards so whether it's the site boundary or going out a half mile or five miles or 20 miles under the notice of intent the applicant is required to do desktop studies consistent with those study area distances so those same issues and standards become have analysis area distances in the application they typically are the same as the study area distances but they don't have to be they can be greater they can be lesser than those study area distances and so when we're seeking input from the public from reviewing agencies we want to know you know do you have any concerns you know if it's a half mile study area is there something at three quarters of a mile that you think is really significant and therefore we should establish the analysis area at three quarters of a mile versus a half a mile for example so that's why the analysis area is listed in or analysis areas are listed in some of the information that we're seeking from them um and then throughout the process during completeness review um you know once we get that application or that preliminary application we are going to seek the Lynn County's review of that to determine did they submit everything that's needed for for us to review and make findings and then once issue completeness we again go back to them and try to figure out you know do they have any issues of concern if they were going to put in conditions based upon their review what would those conditions be that helps inform us as staff in making the findings the recommended findings and conditions that we put in the draft proposed order the next slide please um so yeah so that um concludes really the overview of the project the role of the special Advisory Group and so our recommendation is Staff consistent with the statute is to appoint the Lynn County Board of Commissioners as a special Advisory Group for any proceedings related to this project so this would not just be the application it would be any subsequent amendments to the application or the approved site certificate should Council ultimately approve the state certificate in the next slide please so with that I will turn it over to council happy to take any questions that you have if not you have again one one one motion um really is your limitation on that thank you council members are there any questions or comments regarding this Madam chair this is Kent yes Vice chair how I moved the council appoint the Lynn County Board of Commissioners a special advisor group for Council proceedings related to the proposed many Creek energy project thank you sir I'm sure I accept Cindy Condon a second thank",

        "text": " complete and a complete application is not an approval it just means there's sufficient information for us to draft findings and recommendations and conditions in a draft proposed order so that's that's what happens in that time Gap and a bunch of other really exciting things but that's supposed to say so a lot of what I'm gonna go over um by um Allison green Webster presiding over the hearing so issuance of the draft proposed order uh it initiates a public comment period so there's been a 22-day comment period where folks can provide their comments either you know via email we have an online comment portal um folks can come and provide oral testimony here tonight either in person or through the webinar um folks can also provide comments in writing tonight uh you can fax it I haven't gotten any facts comments but you could somebody could do that it still exists um and why it's important to comment on the DPO if you want to participate further in the council's process you have to comment on the DPO um the council's process it's the contested case proceeding it's a built-in appeal process that the council does have um I just want to note that Allison green Webster was the hearing officer for the Boardman to having my contested case so she she can speak some Council standards so uh so that's that's good um and so for consideration the contested case an issue must be raised with sufficient specificity that the council the department and the applicant understand the issue in an afforded an opportunity to respond so this is lifted out of the rules in the statute and that's why we kind of have that organization where the applicant goes last because the intent is that the burden of proof to demonstrate that the standards are met is on the applicant and if somebody raises an issue they're really identity defies an issue of of fact or present facts that there may be um a standard may not be met or there is there's something missing uh the applicant is afforded an opportunity to to provide that or respond to it and then in rules and statute to raise an issue with sufficient specificity a person must present facts that support a person's position on the issue so this is really kind of council and the Public's guidance about what these what sufficient specificity means you have to present facts so these are um and I went over this slide in the complete application um these are examples of of effective commenting so uh providing specific Council standards or a specific rule where there may be an issue um providing specific information on whether or not a standard has been met and why um supporting facts and comments and attaching reference materials but then also helping us understand where in that reference material there may be conflicting or supportive information like help us understand what the issue um and then making uh indicating where in the DPO or the application there may be an issue so less effective comments just stating support or opposition um providing a copy of a report but actually not doing an analysis and telling us how that supportive of a position or of an issue raising issues that are outside of council's um and of course folks can do that there's just not anything that we can do with it or Council can do with it later on or just making unsubstantiated um yes paragraph on tell me if I need to hush but I think it's important for Pete this is chair Grill I think it's important for folks to understand this isn't um a tactic so we don't have to address it but if you don't have the specificity then you can't respond to it and I would just ask that if they're where you would direct people like you know we have on our website that they can get the information so if you could just state that that would be awesome so helping people understand where to find the information well I think we've had comments numerous times during my tenure on Council where folks feel like my state of something and then we say well you didn't meet the criteria and so if you get on the upset website there's a lot of resources that I think can help folks and I just don't want people to feel like we don't want to respond the third thing either we legally can't because they fall outside of our jurisdiction or that as staff Council we can't respond to what they've said so yes the record talk when I I think that's a great uh comment question uh chair Grill so in the the notice so we have a notice requirement for the draft proposed order um it could be like five pages long um but it kind of goes through and it explains that it articulates that requirement you know about the sufficient specificity it also includes a link to information on our website including the public guide and in that public guide you know we largely State what the rule that statute says you know we don't go too far because we have to kind of be careful about not getting into that legal interpretation or providing legal advice but yes um I think the we certainly put that information as much as we feel we comfortably can within the notice and then linking it to other documents on a website um we we do that certainly in the notice thank you and we do and in the on the informational meeting on the on the application we do have like more slides that try to help people connect standards with you know with if you're interested in this this is where you look but it is a good point because we let for instance there's more people in the room tonight than there was at the informational meeting so I think in like this slide deck we could maybe add add one of like some of those slides that we do have in the informational meeting so people see an example of at least like you know if your issue is the soil protection standard then this is what we're saying anyhow because a lot of people don't work in rules and statutes like we do yeah thank you Cindy Cindy come in um I am curious Kevin this is kind of a new message to me the expedited uh nature of it so the I I'm I'm just I'm curious when the public knows something is happening and so what would be the first notice of and secondly is this an unusually short period of time for public response from at an hour well it would it depends on what time frame uh you know because what we used to it's 21 days uh that's like that's the minimum has to be at least 21 days before the hearing um of issuing notice and we used to do that you used to you know several years years ago run a very similar within that time frame or 30 days um for uh you know so that was very um and but for some of our more recent projects like we have a pretty lengthy comment periods so uh it's it's within the legal bounds but also it just we haven't really had that much interest in it so we thought that it would be in part of the reason I ask is is uh there could there be less interest because of this expedited uh process and I don't tend to know and yeah yeah uh well that you know the difference if it was uh no you know the public would have gotten you know it's notice in the very beginning I I mean I guess it's speculative would more people be interested if they had one that and then six months later they get another one and then you know a month later they get another one I don't know uh so it's just that the first time the public hears about an expedited review is at the complete application noticing okay and usually you know in internally we're trying to be more efficient with how we do our work so really what we did with this project is why will while we were reviewing the preliminary application prior to deeming it complete and then after deeming it complete we were actually writing the DPO so that usually what council sees is we deem an application complete and then we're like okay now we're gonna start your DPO and then that's why there's kind of this bigger time frame so that's also why it was a real kind of quick turnaround um because we were more like we were we were ready to go reiterate one point that telling me um so I think you bring up a really good question you know essentially is there enough time comment um on this and it's a good question it's something that we you know we think about pretty significantly um and so it absolutely meets the minimum legal requirements there's no question about that you know but is that adequate sometimes yeah sometimes no um you know and if we had had a lot of participation at the public information meeting on the complete application um I don't believe we would have probably had the same common time frame we would have increased it because these these you know are a little bit speculative you know we sort of speculated that there probably wouldn't be that much interest in this based upon that information that I think that's a you know a legitimate speculation we could be wrong um but if there had been a lot more interest we we would have provided more common time frame it's not related to the fact that it's an expedited review it's related to the interest associated with the project yeah thank you okay fine yeah ready ready okay oh well I'm up so just before I uh pass it off to the presiding officer here just some um Logistics um and I think I'll let her do it I just um I don't really know I think I may just go over here because I'm still I'll be running the presentation so I'm just gonna I'll be here if that so if we need to like flip to any other images or anything you can just find up in here well um kellen's doing that I will introduce myself greetings from the Portland metro area everybody um I'm Allison green Webster I am a senior administrative law judge at the office of administrative hearings and I am the um Council appointed hearing officer uh serving today as on this matter and serving today as the presiding officer for this public um we all know it's uh Thursday uh November 17 2022 I'll note that it is about oh it is 6 21 p.m at this time um we have uh people attending in person at the um Oxford Inn Suites located in Hermiston we have folks appearing via um video conference and we have folks appearing uh telephonically um uh Kellen I guess I want to check in with you and um see how many comment cards you've received there I have I have two um and then the applicant I presume is going to but they didn't fill one out so I have two so far in the room okay and um have",

by October 1st 2024 yet here you are impacting go 5 resources while the surveys for these resources are still underway lastly there continue to be conflicting Transportation studies between the county and City on if there is actually a need here why continue to perpetuate and fund a proposal that we know is out of compliance on so many levels and causes harm to your constituents and natural resources please vote no on ordinance 882 next Madam chair we have John Stone and charlin conception I got that right good evening my name is cherylyn conception good job pronouncing it um I have a short short statement tonight oh I'm a 34e resident of Hillsboro um I know um very knowledgeable experts have and I still see still are giving much feedback I've seen and read the many excellent reasons to vote no I see no reason to vote Yes not even for theoretical future plans I came tonight to add my presence and voice asking to align with what the Community has said which is a no vote you thank you Commissioners for having me again my name is John Stone and I live on Vander Mo Road proponents of this ordinance have failed completely to meet Statewide planning goals despite their attempt to sneak through justification at the 12th hour the first goal is to get citizen involvements proponents of this ordinance have been unable to answer our questions ignored thousands of people who have stated their explicit opposition to the ordinance and and when uh we have actually been able to get staff to respond to points they went back and changed wording of the ordinance to sneak their way past real and substantial legal opposition when we received thousands of signatures many Billboard signs and countless letters and dozens of people testifying against this ordinance staff fell back on tired tropes of silent majority or even worse The More infantilizing We Know It what best for you this is all after not even informing everybody who was impacted by this road in the first place years ago an issue I know you were concerned with proponents of 882 just outright failed to work with other governing bodies that have jurisdiction in the area they are trying to bully Community leaders into submission and the fact that the mayor here expressing her concerns should be enough evidence to anyone to show that proponents of this ordinance are not in compliance with go too additionally this ordinance has been con cons constantly and consistently changing it even changed after it was engrossed this shows a lack of planning and it does not allow the proper time for comments or collaboration there is no way to pretend that this ordinance is consistent with Goal three or four as it cuts diagonally across farm and Forest land substantially destroying both in a most manner but after all goal five Takes the Cake not only does it ruin a historic Farmhouse a business it also goes through streams Wetlands beaver habitats and carbon capturing forests I don't have enough time but you right next we have Tanya steel and uh commissioner Rogers since he is on Zoom I just wanted to share with him uh we have received two items in hard copy and I realize that you won't have the opportunity of them in hard yes go ahead thank you Miss steel good evening thank you it's nice to see everyone again thank you for having us I'm not as eloquently spoken as everyone else and I did not write out something specific because I think many people approach the points that I would like to make also I would like to say while I think Erin Wardell speaks very eloquently I believe that she is misleading you in some ways there was a document that came out yesterday from Washington County on page 12 it says after the refinement area is included inside the ugb or a future exception to Statewide planning goals is adopted which takes us right back to where we started in the very beginning which was someone asking for an exception to Statewide planning goals she continues to state to you this development will only happen when this land is brought into the ugb but it very clearly in writing here says that may not be the case so I was unable to join the meeting last Tuesday but I did hear I believe Mr Rogers stated he was planning for The Unborn so I wanted to address that issue I brought two pictures the first is 127 degree air temperature reading during the heat Dome that was the air temperature on a farm with trees the second picture is the ground temperature 146 degrees Fahrenheit this is not asphalt this is not concrete this is the dirt on a farm with the trees if you put another road here this is the future of The Unborn 146 degrees that's otherworldly that does not serve The Unborn we've been selling trees the last three weeks I'm a little frazzled after all that we had a family that came last year the wife she was pregnant she carried her UK cut tree up the hill it put her into labor she had her baby the very next day she calls them the lone l Farm baby that is someone that was unborn they came back this year and we got to meet that beautiful baby there are many many unborn and we are trying to save this for them the memories the nature the things that are important to all of us not another road thank you so much thank you hello chair and commissioner I am Lily steel and I'm here to talk about um 882 I have a letter from my fourth grade teacher who comes to our farm every year I am now currently in seventh grade and I'll will read you the letter from her my dad and I started a tradition 20 years ago that just two of us go together to pick out our Christmas tree the week after Thanksgiving and this has continued to bring some of our favorite memories after I moved out of my family home the only part that has changed is that we now get two trees we would search annually for a new tree lot never quite falling in love with one enough to return the next year then we found lone owl everyone there is so incredibly kind and helpful and I've truly never had a better smelling treat last year I was fortunate enough to include my own child in this tradition for the first time and this year my dad and I bed around the farm while currently while I currently carry my second child who I will be adding to this tradition when he arrives it has become an important part of our Christmas tradition and we really hope it will stay that way for a long long time to come we love lone owl tree farm if you continue to put this road in then you will ruin their traditions and everyone else's Traditions who go there as well and like my mother said the the family who had the child born after and please vote now thank you very much thank you all right next we have Harry steel and Jason steel uh hello chair and Commissioners um I'm Harry steel um I'm the son of Tom steel the owner of Lone Al Farm on tile Flat Road I've worked there for um many years now uh the first year that I worked um at Lone ale Farm our main competitor was lich's Farm down the road um which was our principal competitor um for selling trees liches is gone now it's nothing more than a bunch of Housing Development and all of the hard workk and all of the effort that they put in was for nothing because in the end the main thing that mattered to the county was just to put in more development and to spread further and further out and it's looking like it may be the same for the work of my mom and if this proposition does get passed the message that that sends to all of the people who have worked so hard to make businesses out here many of whom are in this very room right now is that their work is meaningless in comparison to the development um occurring uh and the expansion of the urban growth boundary uh takes priority over all of the work that they've put in um and that's not a message that um any of us want to hear it's very harmful towards the goals of everybody in this room and it serves as sort of a killing blow towards uh any of of the progress that's being made by these individuals to help make a successful life forsel so I uh implore of you to um vote no on 882 hi my name is Jason Hoffman and thank you for letting me speak I'm here to encourage a no vote on 882 uh we are a farm family and we've been farming in this uh Valley for 45 years uh we run a Farm Stand just south of U where tile Flat Road is and we do farm some of the some of the ground that this ordinance would take out um it is class one soils in the area and it is vital agriculture is very vital to this economy that Washington County has as well as aggr tourism that comes into this County we are already having a hard enough time in the county moving our farm equipment from field to field and from Farm to farm and bringing more auxiliary roads that will bring more traffic into our area is will make it very will make it even more challenging than what we already are facing we have seen in the recent years a decline in class one soils from developments around our area especially on the Roy Rogers uh Road and the corridor and bringing it to this ordinance there will be more class one soils decreasing in the area as well as making it harder and harder for Farmers to operate our operations I encourage a vote thank you next we have Diane from melli and you want to go first sure hi I'm Angela Taylor I am um uh property owner um family uh of said beaver dams and um protecting the Beavers is high on my priority list but that's not what I came to talk about it's my understanding this board consists of Commissioners voted for by the people you are meant to serve the community represent not post your own agendas instead we find you ignoring valid arguments disregarding compelling evidence in opposition as well as pushing financial and climate irresponsibility in regards to ordinance 882 for the last almost two years the community has been here raising their voices in opposition of the tile Flat Road Extension and we have not been heard you have sat here while individuals small small businesses and not for-profits have testified against the road all have presented arguments in of there has been overwhelming evidence and opposition to this road being",

        "text": "arbonate decarbonizing Oregon's natural gas will likely not come from one strategy but through a combination of Energy Efficiency Investments electrocation and the development of low carbon alternative fuels next slide please okay and so for transportation so decarbonation of the transmitted sector will be critical to meeting our State climate goals the studies we were brief but consistent in their findings for the transportation sector one decoration begins with extensive electrification of as many vehicles as possible this means rapid transition of light duty vehicles from Gaslamp diesel to electric vehicles and when we're talking about light duty Vehicles we're talking about Passenger cars SUVs Vans pickup trucks and vehicles less than 8 500 pounds the success of light duty vehicle adoption will depend on the availability of electric models and the charging infrastructure needed to support them can we get electric charging options to be as ubiquitous as the gas stations we're familiar with now this will also take time passenger vehicles average life is about 15 to 16 years so even if all new car sales were electric it will take a long while for all the fleet to be converted it is also likely that some Vehicles will be difficult or even impossible to Electrify in the near to midterm and these vehicles will need low and zero carbon fueling options to achieve full sector decarbonization for example heavy duty trucks trains Aviation and Marine applications will lag behind light duty vehicles renewable versions of diesel natural gas aviation fuel are available and can reduce emissions today and may be very maybe a viable option but renewable hydrogen also has the potential to be a zero carbon solution for these applications but it's not publicly available in Oregon and it will take significant development to make it readily available as you can see in the visualization to the right renewable electricity could power electrolyzers to make hydrogen which could be used as a fuel or used to make synthetic biofuels to power hard to Electrify vehicles it is also important to note that some studies demonstrated that dependence on low and zero carbon replacement fuels May decline as technology advances and new vehicle models are electrified or other alternatives are identified the cost of this dramatic shift in the transportation sector will be significant and there are Equity considerations to keep in mind fuel savings are likely to be substantial on The Upfront costs of purchasing electric vehicles will decrease and be in line with internal combustion engine vehicles but they are expensive now and will be a significant barrier for many oregonians it will take time for the used electric vehicle Market to develop and provide lower cost options and developing Equitable charging infrastructure will also be a challenge if you're renting or living in multi-family housing you may not have access to charging at home or have little control over adding charging you may have to charge your vehicle more expensive or just inconvenient retail public charging stations decarvisation of the transportation sector by greater use of renewable biofuels electricity or other Alternatives that can be produced in Oregon will be critical to the state meaning its decr conversation targets and it also presents an exciting Economic Opportunity to retain more Transportation fuel related dollars in the state I do want to also mention that Odo will be coming out with our biennial zero emission vehicle Report later this year and that Port report will provide a great lot of great information on where we are today and where we're going and now Amy will talk about the electric thanks thanks Michael the the studies we reviewed all predicted that demand for electricity will grow significantly in the decades ahead driven by increasing electrification of buildings and depending on the pathway we follow to reach our clean energy Target organs electricity demand is projected to increase by 50 to 100 percent between now and 2050. at the same time that our electricity demands are growing will also need to be cleaning or decarbonizing the electricity flowing through the grid and serving Oregon this means that we will need to deploy initial additional renewable energy resources to meet new electricity demand while also replacing existing fossil Resources with renewable resources one study looking at Oregon specifically found a need for as much as 30 gigawatts or three thousand three thirty thousand megawatts of new wind and solar capacity to meet Oregon's electricity needs in 2050. and to put that into context approximately two gigawatts compared to 30 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity were deployed in Oregon between 2010 and there are multiple Pathways to achieve our clean energy targets but the scale of clean energy development will be substantial under every scenario there are also important considerations and trade-offs associated with different Pathways for transitioning to clean for example if we build more transmission we might be able to import more solar power from California and the southwestern United States and import more wind power from across the region or off the Pacific coast this pathway would allow us to Source renewable energy from a broader geographic area which would increase access to low-cost clean energy while minimizing land use impacts in but building new transmission infrastructure can be challenging and it can take a decade or more to secure the necessary approvals to build a new line alternatively we could prioritize deployment of small-scale and community-based renewable projects which can deliver clean energy while also providing co-benefits like increased energy resiliency and new economic opportunities in local communities but these projects are also likely to be higher costs than larger utility scale Oregon will need to engage with stakeholders to identify an optimal Pathway to achieve the level of renewable energy build out needed to achieve our policy targets while balancing these trade-offs and next slide please in recent years Oregon has experienced 116 degree temperatures catastrophic wildfires and extreme drought in large portions of the state the effects and the costs of climate change are increasingly being felt by oregonians and these impacts are inequitably spread across the state's technical modeling shows that Oregon can achieve its mid-century clean energy and climate goals now there are multiple Pathways we can take to reach our goals and each of these Pathways has unique trade-offs for the state so we have some really important choices to make what do we want our Clean Energy Future to look like and how do we want to get how can we rapidly scale up renewable energy production while balancing important considerations around land use and Wildlife impacts Community energy resilience and the benefits and drawbacks of building a more regionalized energy system how can we avoid minimize mitigate and compensate for any adverse impacts that may arise how can we ensure that the cost of the clean energy transition are not disproportionately borne by communities experiencing high energy burdens and prevent those communities from being left behind by the transition how can we work with stakeholders to chart a course for Oregon's Energy Future that's thoughtful inclusive and deliberately considers the trade-offs of the various Pathways available to us the choices we make should be guided by careful consideration and balancing of the costs benefits and other trade-offs associated with the pathways available to us we have an opportunity to develop a common understanding of the necessary scale and speed of the clean energy transition and to create an intentional strategy for building a clean energy economy that works for all oregonians but first we need to chart a course to get there next slide please thank you while preparing the 2022 biennial Energy report we determined that a comprehensive State energy strategy would help Oregon navigate these trade-offs and align public and private actions to support an intentional Equitable transition to a clean energy a state energy strategy could identify specific Pathways to meet the state's policy goals that maintain affordability and reliability strengthen the economy and prioritize Equity while balancing trade-offs to maximize benefits and minimize Harms a state energy strategy that's informed by the best available data and Analysis and that's developed with input from diverse voices from across the state could provide guiding principles and a framework to promote coordination on energy policy planning and resource a state energy strategy should complement and build on existing plans that have been developed by utilities Regional entities agencies and local and it should be developed using an inclusive process and should focus not only on how the state's Energy Systems can decarbonize but also how to help oregonians navigate the transition with previously underrepresented voices at the center of the conversation and decision making the exact scope of the energy strategy should be developed through engagement with stakeholders community members and other state agencies ideally as a result of direction from the legislature and governor the house committee on climate energy and the environment is currently considering House Bill 2534 which would direct the department of energy to engage with stakeholders and produce a state energy strategy for Oregon a clean energy transition is already underway in Oregon but as the 2022 biennial Energy report explains this transition could occur through a number of ways with different trade-offs and implications for the state developing a state energy strategy would give Oregon an opportunity to proactively plan for the the transition that works for the state and our and I'm happy to take any questions thank you Amy that was really well done and I believe Jessica has a question from the chat I have a few and um thanks to Cara for the great questions as he threw that she threw into the chat um I'm going to start by answering the first one then I have a question for Michael and one for Amy so um Cara asked us how does Odo go about deciding what topics are going to be in the biennial Energy report and um I love that question because that's something near and dear to our hearts all these things are near and dear to our hearts I don't even know why I said um but this area is really about getting a broad understanding of what people are interested in Red Energy and that comes down to we send out a um a survey to people to tell us what are you interested in what are the questions you have around energy to we just listen in the meetings that we go to and the conferences that we attend to the topics that are seen as sort of the top of Mind things that people are interested in Hot Topics if you will and we also engage um stakeholders and others to understand sort of what their what they're thinking about as far as the energy World goes and then last we just do a lot of research on things happening at the state level Regional level nationally and even globally to understand what what things people are thinking about around the world that might be informative or useful to discussions going on in Oregon so um I I'd like to think that we have sort of a very broad",

        "text": " so as I said it's not going to predict the future but it's the investigation of of the different choices and options so hopefully by doing this we can have great conversations and our working group groups and and different engagement opportunities and talk about the the different opportunities within the state what should be incorporated or considered uh and hopefully develop some strategies within the state of how do we can invest State dollars uh and what policies we need to to develop to um set us on a good trajectory for the future okay next slide please and so in with all this we're going to be trying to figure out some big energy questions and so so here are some kind of examples of pressing questions we have in energy all naturally curious and want to know what our future is going to look like but these are all the different things that we want to try to answer by uh comparing different scenarios or different Pathways we might be able to go as a state so for example what if some technologies or new clean energy resources are delayed or not developed hydrogen is certainly an option it's certainly something we want to develop as a resource does that is that quickly developed and we certainly have a immediate hydrogen Supply or is that slow to develop within the state and what will that impact and what with the cost of of those different alternative fuels and consumer adoption of of heat pumps electric vehicles uh certainly I know you talk about transmission expansion uh is it easy to expand transmission and have access to the state we certainly know there's going to be more wind development uh east of the of U the Rockies there's going to be a lot more Solar Development within the Southwest is Oregon able to to tap into those is develop transmission lines so Oregon has access to it or if it doesn't does it need to develop more of its uh energy within the state because transmission expansion is is hindered so there are a lot of options there and things to consider okay and I'll turn you over to Edith thanks Michael um yeah next slide so I'm I'm going to take us a little bit into the weeds but not too far I promise of the modeling and it's so that you get you can understand a little bit kind of how um How we'll be looking at the world to come up with what's going to come out of all of this this technical analysis because in the end at a high level what we're going to be doing is is engaging with folks over the next few months to um understand what the priority questions are that we can answer with this kind of tool so essentially you know we we pull a few levers but we have a budget we can't pull every lever and so we can test out you know if we have uh more or less transmission what does that mean in terms of um how much uh resource build we need in the state and outside the state to meet our goals that kind of things so but to to to bring you along the journey I think it's helpful to look a little bit under the hood of of of what we're looking at here so essentially the whole process the technical um analysis starts with um where are we today and so it looks at Oregon's economy across um split up between residential commercial um indust and transportation and we just kind of see you know how many of how many houses do we have how many apartments how many you know just the what do we have in place today um and then we project that out over time all the way out to 2050 so we'll be looking at a 2050 time frame and and so you know there's there's a trick to that we don't know but we're going to try to make some reasonable assumptions on what that might look like and then that determines how much energy we need to meet that demand across the different sectors um and we're really interested in how much electricity we need um how much we need in terms of Transportation fuels and direct use fuels um and uh and that might change what we see today in terms of that breakdown might change for example if we do a lot more electrification that first diagram that I always call it the noodle diagram that uh that Michael showed the you know the electricity slice might grow for example and certainly if we're decarbonizing the resources will change so we might go from natural gas to renewable natural gas for some uses for for example um and then finally the um the model kind of takes all of that information um you know what's the demand um what's the energy need to meet that demand and then it sets some rules and cranks out some results so we have to maintain reliability on the system um we're testing out meeting our energy policy objectives so that's buil in um cost is really important so uh we need we need to make sure that we're minimizing cost wherever possible and there is the the possibility to introduce some constraints and I mention that um here specifically because we can build in some constraints that take into account our um land use rules as they exist today for example so the model won't say you could build anything everywhere no constraint so we can build that in as well if we go to the next slide please um so what what goes into a scenario essentially a scenario is where we test questions and we'll be able to to do a few different scenarios in this um in this analysis and there's kind of two ways that we can we can uh test uh different questions and one is by um having more or less of something so imagine here the examples heat pump adoption so imagine that um more people adopt heat pumps that'll have an impact on uh where we're getting our energy from and where we need to get it from and we can reduce it and that'll also change the picture and it'll also change costs potentially so we'll learn something by by uh moving that lever up or down and there's then there's the option to just turn something on or off so we could say uh no no new transmission is built by a certain year what is that going to do to everything else to what we need to build and how much we need to build in Oregon versus outside of Oregon um so this is kind of you know looking a little deeper under the hood the types of levers that we can pull in the model to come up with um what the world would look like if these things were to happen essentially we're testing uncertainties because there's a ton of uncertainty um that we're dealing with and trying to think through how we meet our decarbonization objectives and so this this whole process is to uh come up with with um a a lot of um informed projections reasonable projections and then test things out if we go to the slide um and this is just to show you how we look at the the economy uh so we split things up as I said by residential commercial industrial transportation and then um there are 70 sub sectors so I don't think I haven't counted these bullets I don't think it adds up to 70 but this is just a flavor so you can see it's kind of you know uh I mean we really get down to to almost the appliance level in looking at these Sub sub sectors to understand what's in place today and what we can expect over time across each sector uh and then if we go to the next slide um it's also to really important to remember referring again back to that noodly slide at the beginning that we're not an island and we're really interdependent in our um electricity system we're interdependent on where we get our liquid um and gaseous fuels and so the model is going to be looking at the whole region um and will include things like accounting for um competition for fuels so there's not a an infinite amount of biomass for example and so we'll be looking at what that company comptition will look like and who's looking for how much over time um so competition for biomass for Renewables for hydrogen derived from Renewables that'll be built in um we'll be looking at the the whole electricity system the full footprint um we'll be uh capturing transmission lines and pipeline flows over the region and and constraints on on and any constraints on on building new transmission lines and pipelines and I think it's important also to say that there's a benefit here to looking region wide because we we benefit from really different weather patterns and different time zones across this region so particularly for the electricity system when it's raining in Oregon which I know is hard to imagine but when it's raining up here there might be uh sun in the southwest that we can benefit from um during the day to help meet our electricity demand for example um so we also get that the benefit of the the regional view in thinking about how we meet our decarbonization goals okay next slide please um okay so I just wanted to make a few uh notes on how we're thinking about land use and natural resources one is I just want to emphasize that we'll be using the the orisa tool the Oregon renewable sighting assessment to inform the work that we're doing um I think that's important to say we'll be we'll really be digging into the challenges um both in public engagement and we'll have a working group that's focused on land use and natural resources and that'll be an opportunity for for some experts to come together and really kind of hash out the how to think about these things and and how how we can kind of honestly do what we can in the model and what we can't we can consider at least in the policy discussion that comes out and I just included some of the thing we've heard a lot more than this actually but but some of the things we've heard so far you know there's the tension between um development and land conservation um there's you know what do we do with um industrial zoned areas um when we're reading developing them there's there's a lot of discussion about um Urban growth boundaries for housing versus um solar sighting um we're paying very close attention to the land conservation and development commission's uh solar sighting um rules advisory committee and kind of the discussions and how they're unfolding there um and we've also heard a bit about Agra full take so this is really just a flavor and just to say that we're we're just at the start of the conversation um so we we're um we'll be talking about ways to engage shortly in this presentation so if we go to the slide um there are also some things and and this is really the list of things that's difficult to model in that Central model but we still want to",

        "text": " the legislature just wanted to keep posted on those efforts and then I know we have a member of the commission who was a leader um in the next bill House Bill 4112 this was a second attempt at creating um sort of a clean energy technology Economic Development package for those who have followed the news last session a big deal was the chips it was the chips act at the federal level and then an Oregon chips act that was sort of designed to create a bunch of incentives and um sort of promoting of semiconductor Manufacturing in Oregon and this is an effort that would do that but for clean energy technology and in fact it sounds like that bill will become part of interim work and be coming back again it seems to me like the primary issue with it just in listening to the committee hearings um there were some issues and some some pieces of it that were not like all Kumbaya but I think at the end it was sort of a money question so it'll be interesting to see um what happens with that and I actually talked more than I meant to because I would love it if folks who know more about it that are on this call feel free to weigh in in a minute when I give that chance and we can go to the next slide great thanks um another big topic that continues to come up related to energy and climate is around energy facility sighting you all just heard about floating offshore wind House Bill 4080 in the road map as well as there were labor standards and procurement standards in that bill that did pass as you know I don't need to talk about it any more than that but it was certainly a high-profile Bill during session um battery energy storage systems this is um a a technology that has um has been becoming more and more affordable um as you know electricity unlike liquid fuels cannot be easily stored battery storage is a solution for that an expensive one that getting more affordable like I said and there's now um a lot of of interest in setting up uh fullon like energy facilities that are 25 megawatts or greater um that excuse me that would be Standalone B battery energy storage systems so if anybody clicks on the link for the report that we just pulled together in the last week of the bills that passed and didn't pass the session that related to energy and climate um you'll see a picture actually on the C the smaller picture is of one of these types of facilities the inside of it so what needed to happen is that right now there's no way that um the energy facility sighting Council can consider these type of projects because they aren't defined so they're now defined in the energy facility sighting Council statutes and there's also a mechanism that will allow a developer to either go through FC to get sightings to get a site certificate or to go through um County Planning processes in order to get approval and then be built so um it's sort of a Choose Your Own Adventure for the developer as as of the structure of the legislation at this point and then finally another high-profile bill was um that uh was regarding fsec jurisdiction on federal lands I was actually in a different meeting but heard that you all had a conversation about this bill earlier so I don't need to go into detail since it was talked about earlier but I will just say overall that there is so much tension on this issue of energy facility sighting um and so much conversation I'm sure that it will be a hot topic again next year and I just want to be clear that it's a it's just an interesting issue with two very um with two sides there's and maybe more than that but there's folks who think that we really need to sort of continue to have really strong protections for a variety of environmental resources before making decisions about energy facility sighting and there's folks who say that climate change necessitates taking a second look at those processes and seeing if we need to streamline them or somehow sort of review fewer things or reduce the the public process in order to make the processes faster so that tension um between the two uh is really interesting and um sometimes it feels like in the capital there's a lot of like one side of that coin for those of us that are working on sighting we hear a lot about the other side of the coin on the folks who want to see fewer project cited or who um who want to hold on to that more robust review so I just think it'll be really interesting see how it plays out and just kind of wanted to raise the flag that I'm sure it will be a Hot Topic next session and then we can go to the next slide and I'm just going to quickly kind of go through a couple of bills and then we'll turn to turn over to you all so there was a housing Omnibus funding bill the variety of the money was focused on um really specific housing projects through programs or homelessness relief projects for programs but there was additional funding for programs promoting Heating and Cooling relief indoor quality and Energy Efficiency so we were really excited to see this package come forward I really want to give a shout out to Senator Casey Jama who I think um as a housing Champion really gets it that we have these issues related to climate change where folks you know need to have access to cooling or we have more extreme weather events um and so we need to sort of be prepared for those and then also he really gets it to that heat pumps can be life-saving devices for so it was really with his leadership and pardon my lazy my bulleting that I'm just realizing I did a cut and paste and didn't realize there were extra bols so pardon that um but um but as you can see here um there was a major investment in the healthy homes repair fund that was something that the environmental advocates in the Oregon conservation Network really fought for as part of a climate budget and then um specifically the ones that Senator Jama I think really kind of made happen were making sure that the Oregon Health Authority had additional resource for emergency air conditioners and air filters um money to our department for the Oregon Rental home heat pump program which is running out of money imminently if it's not just run out today or so um that program has gone really well um very fast six we've gone through $12 million in rebate funding in less than six months and then also um the $2 million to the Department of Human Services for warming and cooling shelters so that's one thing I wanted to quickly highlight as far as a whole build look at and then one more really quick one is our own bill on the next slide and that Senate 1525 literally passed the Senate with a with a floor speech that was good Bills should pass so definitely wasn't very contentious or high high level of interest um it just one of those little bills but I did just want to mention it because it made several changes to existing climate programs and I won't get into the weeds here but if anyone's interested you could either look at the report and see those changes if you have questions let me know but just wanted to make sure for awareness folks know that you know we put these new programs in place that are meant to address climate change and they need tweaking sometimes they need additional funding so um between these two bills just kind of wanted to give everybody that very visceral reminder that we pass a bill and then the work isn't done and sometimes we have to go back um or ask for new things or whatever so with that we can go to the last slide which is really about me sort of turning it over to you and like I already said I kind of planted a planted a member of the audience so there's three questions people can raise hands and since I'm oh I guess I could pull up the the audience better than I have it pulled up so I can call on folks actually but great thank you for those who worked on bills this session do you want to add anything I know I might have gotten something wrong like B representative Levy caught or you might want to add something to a bill that you worked on um did any legislation get missed it just kind of grabbed I think like my idea of what those kind of top bills were but maybe I missed something that that I shouldn't have that folks want to share today and then finally what climate issues do you think are likely to come up next session just so we can kind of get our thinking caps on as a group about what might be coming down the line so I'm going to turn things over but like I said I believe Alexis will be ready to pitch in first great Alexis thank you Chrissy and and chair McDonald thank you for the opportunity to be here my name is Alexis Hammer I'm the legislative and policy coordinator for the Department of land conservation and development and chrisy listed basically every bill that I would have listed had I been giving a presentation on climate so I would just want to add one comment and that it should uh probably come as a major shock to everyone in this room sarcasm intended that we have a housing governor and for the last two sessions Governor kotek has made a huge priority out of priority out of Housing and two bills have really impacted the department of land conservation and development one was in 2023 the Oregon housing needs analysis which is reforming the way that we plan for housing in the state and the second was the Senate Bill 1537 from this legislative session that does a number of things uh but most importantly for the Department of land conservation development it includes um a new office that is going to be helping cities and um local jurisdictions make sure that they're really doing the most they can towards planning for for Housing Development and the reason I want to priortize this and and highlight it as a as a climate conversation is that there there are really two ways that you can talk about housing and climate one is the energy that you use within a house and the the energy that is consumed within a home and the second is the way the energy is used between getting uh between homes and other buildings and that in other words between in in a transportation context and we have a major imbalance in the way that uh housing and jobs are located in many communities throughout the state and this drives are greenhouse gas emissions and the transportation sector Transportation sector as you all know I'm sure is the largest sector of our greenhouse gas emissions and",

        "text": " that's not an issue at all. I've addressed all the other requirements. And regarding the fence, if you would give me a week, it will be put up. We've had no accident. We have not one dog. Our dogs, all of them are beyond already 6ft tall fences. Whenever they go to us, to those a little bit more open, where every single dog is with our own, with our presence. So therefore they are never running or roaming by themselves. Most of the times they are on the leashes as well too. So we had not one instance of dog jumping over the fence or going into anybody's yards. However, I understand we've agreed on the, the defense and I will have no problem to put it up. I apologize for on my part on the confusion. I expect that maybe I will get some connections also from the department. Anyway, as soon as Mister Autumn contacted me about looks like going forward with no complaints about the noise, I got all the permits in the row right now. I'm waiting for the departments to approve it, but everything has been filed and paid for. So let me just confirm. You felt that you didn't need to comply with those conditions until after the one year and you got approved again. I thought that I need Marie to more direct me like for that permit to. To actually, that is going to last for Ivafa, the noise was the primary concerns, you know, so it was a test run, how that operation goes and if everything is okay, I put it up all these conditions and I will be able to get granted the longer term special permit use. So I apologize if I misunderstood on my part, but I want to be compliant with everything and I will put it immediately. This is not the matter. If it's just when. And it was on my part misunderstanding it. I'll bring it to the board. Questions? Yes, Commissioner Curry? Yeah, just a couple questions. Relative to the canine specialist, part of this. Are you selling these animals primarily to law enforcement? No, that's a thank you for asking. I mean, our name is k nine specialist, but I would like to please. We do not really work with the police or military. That canine has been. We've been in business for over ten years, almost 15 years, to do more. That more represents the abbreviation of the word canine, which is a dog. We are a dog specialist. We serve local community and actually rent, so we don't really sell. If comes some law officer and he would like to purchase a dog from us, of course we will. But I am not right now in any active matter working with the police departments. I mean, if they approach me, it might be one on time customized. But mostly what I am providing services is to regular public, including the training where dogs, not just the german shepherds and Dobermans. What percentage of, of the animals are sold locally versus out of town? Are all of them sold locally? I wouldn't say all of them. I would say probably 80%, 85 locally. But the training I also, as was mentioned, it's not just the brining I mean, I'll maybe sell a dog or two a month, maybe. I mean, mostly as a dog training, I am helping the local people, and that's 90, 95%. That said, I do have sometimes the clients coming from outside of this area, but mostly also working with everyday people and their pets, their dogs, and that's been about 90% local. Any other questions, Commissioner Gray? So remind me, how many, how many breeding females do you have? How many males and how many litters a year? So I've been asking for two to four litters to be having two to four litters a year. This year we had three litters. And so, yes, my breeding females, I have breeding females and I have right now one breeding male. But how it's. Yes, okay, so you had three litters this year? I had three litters this year, yes. How many dogs are typically in a litter? Generally there can be anywhere from four to eight puppies. I would say generally, gem and shepherd's litter is somewhere between four, six. When you have eight, it's kind of a little bit bigger of the leader. You could also have two or three, but I believe our where seven, five and six. I would like to. And that was over the period of the whole year. And one of that container ships, which I just had to apply them, permitted commercial building permits for each individual. One of them, and one of the containers is specializing only for my breeding on the breeding program. But we definitely try to, we follow strict guidelines, actually european guidelines regarding the breeding. So all our dogs are tested for their health. They need to have a titles, group, temperament shows, etcetera, hip dysplasia. Dysplasia, exactly. DM and everything like that. I've been working with animal control. I mean, they've been in my property multiple times as well. As well, too. And again, regarding those requirements, all but the fence has been taken care of. I just waiting for the permit to be approved and the fence will be up. Give me a week. Thank you. Question. Yes, sir. I don't understand how you could have missed the licensure portion. Well, the kennel license, because they were asking for the special use permit. So that's all. How that can license from the animal control, I cannot. So that's actually what they started up. They came to me like, oh, okay, I'll apply for a kennel license. And then the kennel license will start to look at it. You need a special because it's agriculture. Again, that was me. I thought, I'm on agriculture. I can have my animals. I'm in rural area 20 acres. What better place to be. And my south neighbor, he has a sanctuary there. 90 acres. Hundreds of animals, including 2030 dogs, who are also running. So, regarding the noise, of course my dogs do bark, but I am raising a family of five children. You know, young children, never been a big issue. They do bark, but sometimes it's my neighbor's dogs as well too. So it's hard to tell exactly when always the noise is coming. That's sad. It does when dogs do, Barkley. But we do try to. As I like my piece, we do try to manage as much as we can to keep them quiet. And I believe I've been doing since we've been here last year, much, much better. Any other questions of the applicant at the moment? Mister Veloci, if you'd like to have a seat for a moment. I do have four people who have signed up to speak on this issue. And I'll also open for additional public comment after these four. The first being Richard Findlay. Thank you, commissioner. My name is Richard Finley. I live at 21 55 Southwest 80th street in Ocala. Directly across the street from the place that's holding the horses or the dogs. There's horses between us. I'm rather familiar with Mister Velasquez situation with raising animals. I also raised rats. I had 500 of them. I studied zoology in California as a herpetologist. They can get ahead of you. But now we're dealing with animals that are not attacking us, but they are attacking us with noise. Tremendous noise. They start in the morning, they subside a little bit. Then at feeding time, they pick up, they come back again. We have a direct line from his property to our property. And most of the people on 80th street also have the same situation. They're hearing these animals all day. It appears that the kennel that was made was directing the noise not to Mister Lisbon house, but away towards Jennifer Connor's house across the street from us. And this noise is very disturbing. The peace and the tranquility that was in the neighborhood is long gone. And now we're fearful that people, if they'll move, property routes will drop. We're concerned about this, as most of the neighbors on the neighborhood are. We took a list of neighbors that wanted to sell, sign a petition to also recognize this. They couldn't be here today because of work schedule, but we're concerned about it. The people on the street are disturbed about it. We're disturbed about the noise. I'm not worried about the dogs attacking us. I can handle dogs, but it's the noise, the continuous outplay of noise that's bombarding us. That's what we want curbed. If Mister Zawotsky can find a way of doing that, barring putting a wall up or something to that effect, that might. To handle the situation, I don't know, but that's our concern. Thank you. Sure. Yes. May I ask you a question, Mister Finley? Okay, so I'm just. Why hasn't anyone called and made any complaints in the last year? Why haven't they? We have made complaints. The street has. We sent a letter in last year about the noise. I don't know why everyone else, they're not aware of how to do it. Just curious. It helps us. Yeah, we weren't aware either, until Jennifer figured out how to do this. And she sort of breached this situation, bringing it to our attention. Our neighbors are concerned about it. Sorry. So when you send in the letter, are you talking about when the applicant made the first application or what? Commissioner Bryan is asking is because we said, I think during that hearing, if you have issues, let us know. But from the time of the",

we um hold these off until next meeting U Madam chair I made note of that we will include that on the November agenda thank you then the next item would be the Council secretary report Mr secretary thank you madam chair um I'll first start with Staffing updates so we have initiated the recruitment process to replace Wally Adams um he position is the operations and policy analyst to um so we just um it was Tuesday maybe um so it was earlier this week that the notice went out um so we will probably be you know in that five to weeks time five to six week time frame um so I'll keep council members updated on that progress next I will get into some project updates so the first is the yellow rose bush Energy Center so oh you don't you can go back uh a notice of intent was submitted on September 1st by yellow rose bush Energy Center LLC which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Savon LLC for the yellow rose bush Energy Center the project is a proposed solar PV generation facility with a capacity of 800 megaw and related and supporting facilities on 8,075 Acres so 12.6 square miles uh on privately owned land um zone for exclusive Farm use in both Wasco and Sherman counties the majority of it is in Wasco County but the transmission line would go over into Sherman County um the department issued a public notice last week um you should have gotten that notice as well um this is for the notice of intent uh we've established a public information meeting on the evening of November 2nd in mopin um and there is currently an open comment period that will conclude on December 1st any questions on to the next update um the next is the Umatilla Morrow County Connector project um similarly we received the notice of intent uh in mid-september on the 13th by Umatilla Electric Cooperative for this project um they are the project applicant uh project is a proposed 14m 230 KV transmission line with portions located in both Morrow and new matilla County just as a reminder the thres threshold for fsec jurisdiction on transmission lines is um at at least 230 KV more than 10 miles and in more than one jurisdiction so it's not greatly over that but it is over that um and so it is your jurisdiction so the department also issued a public uh notice last week on the notice of intent and uh we're combining this public information meeting this one will be on the evening of November 1st um and that will be in Boardman and then the next night will be the one for the yellow rose bush and similarly there is a open public comment period that will conclude on December 1st so we're just at the notice of intent stage for both projects um just getting the word out for people um so we'll start to receive um thoughts and comments and you know concerns from the public from reviewing agencies um over the next you know 60 days now if you could move this slide Nancy next I have a compliance update so this is the and my apologies for anybody who's probably listen listening to me I'm sure I'm going to not pronounce this correctly uh poo Fields solar energy facility so if you recall this is the formerly known as Montag solar so this is the one that you passed driving down to Arlington the last time we went to I mean um Condon excuse me the last time we went to the city of Condon there was the one facility that was recently built it's that facility um so it is operating um earlier this year it went into operation uh it's in Gillum County it's 162 Mega it yeah it commenced operation in April um on October 17th so just two days ago we received notice that an M there was an mc4 electrical connector fire um so I had to ask what does that mean so um and mc4 is basically um sort of a connector point between cables um and so for some reason that sparked a fire um it was put out rather quickly did not cause any damage um but we had the exact same incident uh in August um it was there was an mc4 fire um again it was found and put out very quickly but this is of concern um particularly since um many solar facilities do not in the long term have on-site Personnel a Wind Facility will have an operations in maintenance facility they'll have people doing maintenance all the time on the winter solar facilities you know again probably depending on the size uh will not so this currently does have uh Personnel because it's still early in operation um and uh some point in time it will not so this is a bit of concern that we're seeing two fires caused by the same issue within a couple of months of each other secretary KCK could I ask just real quick uh are the mc4 connections above ground or are they on the ground yes um thank you Vice chair how for the question they are above ground so if not very far at least in the pictures that we saw I'm not engineer I'm not fil I just was looking at the pictures recently which is the only thing that I know about and so um it seemed to be at least from the picture you know a couple of feet maybe above ground um and so you have kind of cabling that kind of goes up and then it it's almost like a distributor cap you know like multiple wires connecting into the central point um and then that connects up into the solar panel um itself at least that's what it appeared on the photo um so yes it is in fairly close proximity to the ground and it is above ground counc member cond umk sorry chair gra I I don't know if you can how well you can see everybody um I'm happy to call on people I'm happy to let you do it um whatever is thank you count um secretary cornette yes please do thank you um thank you just um I think I understood the second one or both of them were at the same place and is the mc4 electrical connector common throughout uh solar facilities or is it is this one unusual in some my understanding is it's it's common and you know and I asked I asked I asked the question myself um yes and at least with this facility I assume it's the same with others but I can't guarantee that because I didn't ask the question but there are probably thousands of them uh of the you know size of the facility the acreage size of the facility and the number of panels and so not that we've know this but um if one had if someone at a facility or some one at a facility that was totally unattended that's been installed for a while um could a fire have developed and we just just nobody knows about it you know could they have been going on for some time but but they go certain buyers yeah I think it's a good question and you know all these facilities have um essentially and I assume it's for solar it's the same as a wind but a a scata system basically a monitoring system to make sure things are running correctly and if something doesn't occur some you know sort of element trips and then makes you know somebody who's watching you know one facility or multiple facilities remotely that alerts them um they can actually call somebody very quickly you know to get on it but um but I I don't I don't know what the time frame would be that's something I think we need to look into to figure out you know if and when a fire occurs in the same circumstances what's what happens yeah exactly what happens how does the alert happen you know what's the timing of if there are no on-site Personnel or um you know local fire officials to be able to respond thank you and these are these just happened you know one incident you know you're you're beginning you know operation kind of have to work through Kinks we get that you know these are Big industrial facilities and there are a lot of components you know I think the bigger concern is",

        "text": " with the Cani Street project in the development, transformation of the riverfront and private investment is very exciting in the future of Salem and Killer Burger came to the city That's why we are doing something very well sadly we no longer have burgerville what's going on burgerville Come with me You know how what's happening Come and we want to talk to you we also show that sal is worried we are worried about the most vulnerable in the community to be leaders in the state responding to the response from people in a situation of c we have tripled the number of uh beds for people who are homeless and 80% of shelters uh in the last 5 years we have received uh many congratulations from the government we have underutilized motels and hotels much better than anywhere else in the state and we have great successes but our our income challenges threaten providing these services and threaten our success despite the city's jobs capabilities and the progress we have made in housing and economic development we are faced with an unprecedented revenue shortfall that crisis was not created by city management the city council or any of you it is a math problem that needs a State correction and until the state fixes it we are going to live in a system Broken income that is not kept up with Costs that rise such as the costs of firefighters, police and libraries, we do not have enough firefighters to respond to the increases in 98 calls after covid, we do not have enough police to solve the problems, violence and neither do we. we have a community outreach property taxes have helped the city 30 years ago 550 have given a fairly limited income today the same dollars that paid for police officers and firefighters only pay for three quarters of one How did we get to this moment and I came to the council in 2017 and at the beginning of the crisis of people experiencing homelessness 26 by the residents of Sale saw that homelessness is one of the number one priority 3% of 2018 after 31 after 49 and in In 2021, 58 percent of residents responded to homelessness as one of the problems they wanted the council to solve and here is what matters. Cities do not have mechanisms to solve the problem of homelessness. Cities provide infrastructure for public safety. We care. for water sewage streets parks police and firefighters the counties provide social services to the residents they are responsible for eh health treatments eh And for addictions and public health and they receive money from the State to solve these problems but cities as they come out are the first and last lines of defense and when the problems are on Liberty Street and not Gordon Road the residents expect action from us using grants we were able to solve street problems but the revenue system has never been adjusted to fund those services annually our the Residents' expectations lead us to find new strategies to go beyond self-sufficiency. We teamed up with community partners to create the Homelessness Alliance and with Midle Valley community agencies we created a navigation system. We partnered with Church. Park to create three microalgue communities we have created a team to Connect people who do not have shelters with the services they need and we also have pilot programs for people who live in vehicles and we have a safe parks program so that people who live in your vehicles live safely and legally all of these programs have been launched since 2017 to respond to the wishes of the residents at the center of that homelessness crisis availability of housing costs we said we are going to simplify the process to improve this development to continue to respond to the needs of the community The city limits eliminate barriers the creation of shelters to eliminate barriers to eh Find housing for example a new program that provides the community with three accessories of construction plans now the Community members can download the plans in English and Spanish on the city's website. As other municipalities leave, this division between two departments and multiple divisions is allowed to operate. These structures separated and limited collaboration between functions and have created Silos and have created inconsistencies and in the customer experiences the developers are frustrated with that permitting process and are not satisfied with the passage and availability of information in response last year we changed professionals Oh and we put them on a team to build a culture of services downtown in which a culture of service delivery informed by data-driven decisions we are going to produce more housing faster for the community and on November 30, 2023 the housing authorities exceeded the housing placement goals not only exceeded those housing placement objectives but only spend 68 percent of the budget for that program and as a result we can continue with the program and we follow this original plan. The housing authorities have negotiated with the owners of Geer Park to achieve the affordability of a 22-bedroom complex. 224 units we are going to show you that the Salem Park part is 659 unique homes and 369 apartments in the northern part of Salem 450 apartment complexes and 333 in mahonia in the state part of Salem in Titan Hills 436 units three subdivisions and 391 unique housing and all of these exist of many affordable apartments and units for online and and really This is a good time to move forward Even preventing homelessness increase housing and we focus on responding to the violent crimes that are growing we are in a crime reduction initiative chif wak and I said how the city should reduce the increase in crime we saw in detail what was happening and where we studied we did a study we presented it in work sessions in marion county and the city During that work session I promised to engage with the community to identify solutions. I am happy to tell you that we brought the community together for these conversations on March 6 and we are planning three more. The goal of these meetings and at the meeting is to raise awareness. identify the parties involved and develop prevention prevention and intervention strategies to help the police the police are one piece of the solution the rest It must come from the community as we have done to solve these challenges we have to see these partnerships with the residents non- profit organizations and businesses and strategies designed to help against violent climate and being here a year ago I spoke about Salem and a collaboration with the council interest groups and residents like the alc before me I reported the work of the employees of the city \u200b\u200band volunteers and after information about the state of the income situation I shared with you that without help from the County and the State Partners and public investment we would not be able to provide services to the population we do not have enough firefighters to adequately resolve and respond to emergency calls and we are not going to be able to raise this rate of violent crimes and I explained how 30 years ago in measurements 350 they had these real estate taxes that is an income that we can receive they leave us with two options, first find additional income or reduce services and today and we continue to fight to support the needs of the clients and we want to leverage uh all the legislators as well as those in the government we have been successful in obtaining grants and financing to benefit the city but we are still waiting for those new leaders to give us results in these taxes and we continue waiting and waiting and waiting and now We are seeing the things that have to do with the street situation and in this reform we see enough security infrastructure to keep them safe we \u200b\u200bhave a volunteer task, a group volunteer work identifying funding to solve short-term problems this working group represents the entire community and has people from all districts we do not have elected officials and a third party is facilitating I thank you and thank the city for the results of this process So what is the path that we have is a great challenge the path is and the result is not obvious but we have faced challenges before in the community we have faced covid and we support businesses with when there is a fire in the morning 200 people in the community found in the afternoon and when a fire started, construction people who were working together took their equipment towards the flames and they put out the fire and supported Joe Hinson and saved a large amount of the community and three days ago when the imaginable happened in Bush Park community people and first responders helped save lives our community responds to adversity with strength our community responds to challenges with perseverance we will protect what we have and we will find solutions together as a united community we will go and We are on the path to making the robust and vibrant city that we are looking forward to. Thank you very much, thank you, Mayor, I would like to thank all the elected officials for their efforts on behalf of the community and of course all the leadership, all the members of the Council as well as Your commissioners Remember that Salem is in Marion County too Of course they are here and on behalf of the three organizations they sponsor this event I want to thank the following partners who, well, pooled their efforts with the city staff to carry out this event also to sixty media for recording and for broadcasting live through Channel 21, thank you, we cannot do it you and finally I want to thank everyone for coming here, it has been a pleasure, an honor to be the sponsor this year, the City Club. Next year, the Salon Rotary Hall is going to be the host and I guarantee you that you are going to continue listening to the mayor today cer Ramos",

we're going to go through a lot of information about the Oregon energy security plan and where we're at in that process um maybe we'll do some quick introductions just so we know uh both who we're talking to and who's talking with us uh again Max woods from Department of energy I'm joined in the room here by my colleague Deana Henry hi everyone we have a one of these meeting owls by the way in

share but we're also going to be looking for your feedback and input throughout this presentation um I hope that's okay so at your computer uh if you can see the screen right now there is a link and a QR code to a um uh a tool called slider uh if you're on a computer the link uh will work for you and it'll take you to a website that not quite now but when we get going well we're going to ask you a series of questions and ask for some input uh and gather your feedback on sort of what we're talking about here today we really want to get your information and try to make this not so much uh the typical one-way Zoom presentations that we've all sat through over the years um but try can make it a little more interactive so uh hope that's okay try the link make sure it works we'll get to that throughout the presentation so oh here's our title page again all right quick agenda what we're going to talk about today uh the energy security plan uh Statewide this is a Statewide plan we're here in the Eastern region um and we will have some content that's focused on the region we also have some content that's sort of broad Statewide we'll kind of get to that in a minute here talking about our project is timeline Basics some methods um what we've done so far how we've done it and then we're going to release some results um we talk a little bit about fuel uh we also and just to kind of set the stage here the energy security plan is about all forms of energy in the state electricity natural gas liquid fuels propane State doesn't use a ton of propane but those are the primary focus areas um for the project although we do have some specific content about fuels uh and we'll kind of get to that um in a little bit here we have some stakeholder engagement feedback results we're going to share we're going to do uh roll out some risk analysis some technical results that I think people will find pretty interesting we'll talk about mitigation measures and then off we go okay quick summary just who we are uh if we haven't worked together before you haven't come into contact with the Oregon Department of energy with the state Energy Office uh we do a lot of things energy security and resilience uh is one of those things that's what my team focuses is on um uh we also handle nuclear safety by the way of which uh I unfortunately scheduled this meeting at the same time as a nuclear emergency drill from the Hanford site so some people uh here in Morrow and Umatilla counties um I know are occupied with that emergency drill so that's um my fault for scheduling that but so it goes we have a lot of things happening and you can see the other stuff that Odo does maybe you've come into contact with Odo as we call ourselves throughout the years just a quick summary on why we're here what we're talking about today I talked about that before but talk about the project share some results and get input I say Regional input um and I just to to give a a note that we are traveling across the state this week and next week uh on Tuesday we were in TMA yesterday in Portland today Pendleton next week we'll have a meeting in Bend Salem and Medford um the re the state we've used Oregon Department of Emergency Management's six regions um for the state to try and just organize our project and use the OEM or or odm I guess as they are now um use those regions um we'll talk about that a little bit and why that matters uh here in a second and just who we are again Odo I mentioned our contractors from CNA they've partnered with um an engineering firm called Halen Aldrich I know folks may be familiar with Hal Halen Aldridge but they do a lot of work in the western part of the state around seismic risk geot technical hazards um and that sort of thing so we have a good team uh Oregon pu staff Mission staff has worked closely with us uh on our on our project um just so folks know the Pu staff is been deeply involved and then uh and you um everybody else so there we go okay talk about why why are we doing this why are we doing a State entty security plan uh it's a good idea that's number one it's a good idea it's a good idea for the state of Oregon consider um the energy security energy resilience and how the state can help uh local Partners local governments emergency managers utilities fuel providers private companies everybody involved in energy um to try and make our state more resilient more secure that's that's the concept we're also doing this because the federal government and state government told us to do so and so this slide has a kind of a couple points on on that um the federal government through the um infrastructure investment and jobs Act was passed by Congress in the fall of 2021 uh which put some money into this program uh it also put a requirement that all states and Jeff from monan you can attest to this all states have to have a state energy security plan those plans are actually uh when we're done with our plan it'll be reviewed and scored by 's Department of energy um and they've hired Pacific Northwest National lab to help with that it'll be a technical review of of my project of our work done by the feds to make sure that it's aligned with the required contents which are here listed I won't read them to you um from Congress uh their Hook is that they both give us funding to do this project and they can withhold future funding if we don't have a compliant plan so um that's the financial incentive for us to do a good job at our job um but it's also a good plan as I mentioned oh go back to a little bit the state also State Legislature under Senate Bill 1567 required us to do this as well and directed my agency the oran Department of energy to be the lead on this project we call it s SP 1567 we'll talk about this a little bit later has some additional requirements Oregon specific in addition to the federal requirements uh the state legislature wanted us to look a little closer at fuel um liquid fuels diesel gasoline Jet and how it could be affected in the State and sort of ways to make ourselves more resilient on the fuel side so we'll get to that in a little bit okay here's our sort of our Topline goal can read the words in Blue uh and with a red underline sort of addition there the blue words uh are from a federal definition of energy security we at the state have added in the underlined red that says at an affordable price to uh really to make a note and highlight that affordability and cost matters for consumers it matters for utilities it matters for investment decisions um and will say that in a form of energy security or in security if you can't afford fuel or electricity that's not a that's not a good thing even if Supply is available and when you think about um mitigation that could be done to reduce risks cost also matters we'll talk about that a little bit later um and and sort of the there's a declining value of of uh investment decisions you could make that cost is kind of goes up quite high at some of those choices we'll get to that a little bit later but we wanted to highlight that piece here's a strategy uh we don't pretend to know everything or that we're doing everything for the state um what we're really trying to do is coordinate a lot of different efforts um at the state level and local level utility level to bring together existing information recognizing that a lot of work's been done and is being done right now in this field um by our partners and we also we are doing some some new analysis some original analysis we'll get to that here but I wanted just to make a note that um we",

subcontractor to C who may have heard of alen Al was a lot of work in state on cic resilience cic analysis geotechnical hazards been working with us uh Oregon pu staff has also been working on us very closely not here today um but we've been working very closely with their team of on this project and you everybody here okay so I wanted to go through just to kind of a set um why we're even why are we doing this why what's this all about State energy security plans um we are doing this uh for a couple reasons one because the federal government said we had to the state government said we had to and three it's a really good ide um to do a state energy security plan and the analysis that were undertaking and coming up with um recommended mitigation options uh for us to work on towards the future reduce our risk reduce our or enery systems make us more secure resilient that's the whole concept these required contents that we've listed out here may look legal Le they are they come directly from um the federal directive which was the infrastructure investment and jobs act Federal legislation passed in Fall 2021 directs every state to have an eny security plan uh the plans that we uh submit to US Department of energy will actually be viewed and graded for compliance with the required content actually like pnl does that we do for on d uh if we don't we don't get a passing score us D has the ability to withhold funding from my agency uh because have a compant plan so they USD is both Congress is giving the funding for us to do this work they also come with a hook that we have to do it and we have to do it well um otherwise there's you know straight up with some funding for the future so we're pretty incentivized to get a good job at it um I also mentioned it's kind of listed here Senate bill that's Oregon Senate Bill 1567 that's the state directive that was from 2022 legislative session for us to do this project we'll talk about that a little bit later SP 1567 has some additional content what the feds are requiring of us particularly around Fuel and fuel resilience and fuel infrastructure um some people may be more famili that's be 1567 because of Mike's program and eq's program that bill is also directed to DEQ to work on a cic resilience of the um of major tanks of major fuel tanks in uh certain counties of the state M County uh Columbia County and Lane County okay three so FB picking 67 there a lot of energy resilience infrastructure those two major programs are housed here I just want to let you know sort of where we're coming from um energy security goals broad Top Line we're trying to drive to here uh the words in sort of vitalite blue um is a federal goal and then we at the state level added in the underline and red piece that's says at an affordable price um just to you know denote that importance of affordability in security and resilience as well uh this might play out in many number of ways but from Equity Environ Justice perspective as important it also comes into you thinking about tradeoffs and we get to the end talk about mitigation measures there's any number of mitigation measures that a utility a provider a state a government could do that might be very expensive and maybe it's not worth it so this sort of a an acknowledgement that affordability really matters for a lot of reasons here so we put that in there um and then kind of our strategy it's also recognition so all relevant information recognition that a lot of work has been done in this field by many other organizations um utilities not natural has a heck of a robust progr on usili um so we're not trying to be duplicative in any way uh we are collecting new data we are doing new analysis you'll see some of that R out here but we're also trying to make sure that we are um capturing information that's already been prepared by other organizations by utilities by other governments um and and pull it together into a comprehensive approach um some of the information is security sensitive and not available for public but most not most will be available most information and our primary report will be publicly available um when it's finished so just kind of an acknowledgement here that a lot of work's been done and is being done in this sector now not just us we're trying to coordinate State's efforts so this is another piece um sort of our just to get back to s567 the fuel spe the enemy security plan is not just about fuel uh it's about all sectors of energy electricity natural gas liquid fuels uh propane but the directive from the state government probably as we can imagine because of Oregon's risk with the fuel terminals in Portland um sort of our dependencies on uh refineries out of state one pipeline that brings that fuel into the state a lot of risk in sort of where is fuel infrastructure and so there's a unique directive need was a directed from the state for HS to work on a particular aspect of energy Security on uh fuels and you can see sort of I won't read the slide here but this is part of our effort on going now is around um Geographic diversity of fuel storage in the State uh I will make a note to say that the directive is not to replace the terminals from the port that's not our scope that's not our effort rather as you'll see when we get into this details a little bit later it's about considering locations across the state that could be augmented with additional storage capacity typically public facilities that maybe have a tank and maybe an additional tank that makes sense we could find a way to get in the tank Supply and then in case of emergency the thought being additional Supply is on hand in that location maybe you would had a week's worth of diesel and now maybe you'll have two weeks worth of diesel if it's psychically resilient if it's Wildfire resilient and if it's able to be accessed by people and machines so that's a big effort um and important part of our Venture here so I just want to kind of set the stage here for what to expect on the fuels piece in particular okay plan progress we've got got l two our CES don't we um trying to make it easy for people to track where we are go to our website see what's happening uh we we've done a lot of work um we've done public sector surveys we've done private sector surveys uh thanks to everybody who has contributed information and F to our surveys already it's really appreciated uh the entities we've talked to um progress kind of on the website but also you talk to us to here we are I don't know if I mentioned this earlier the deadline for this plan is the end of September this year um to be clear we have to Target September 30th the middle that's um the end of federal fiscal year that's a federal deadline it's also a state deadline for us to submit our plan um but just because we submit a plan on a certain date then does not mean it's the end of our work uh Pho is making this a um a pro a big Key Program as you sometimes say where it's ongoing work uh we plan in our minds uh with our support from legislative from our agency we'll keep going in 2025 2026 and Beyond we have a direct from all the feds and the state to review and update our plan as appropriate on Recycle and we will do so taking that to heart and a lot of the work as you imagine diving into to the scale uh you want to cover so many important things you want to keep working on on and so we will keep doing those things in the coming years after s it's a Statewide plan but I have a vision for um further refinement uh in the future getting more data May more granularity on risks and threats um and sort of as we move forward future inovations of the work um I have a vision for how how I can do so keep that can you say anything about the survey and um you know level of participation how did it go yes that's a great question I'll actually summarize that in a slide minut so yeah we'll definitely give you that thank you for asking yes um okay the last thing here before I pass it over remaining work um like I mentioned we're talking to Across the regions this week and next week the fuel storage capacity and recommended areas to increase storage was a pretty big lift we're going to be ongoing this summer working on that um some of you looking around maybe M was in a meeting with us two weeks ago last week last week we had a state agency coordination meeting amongst agencies that uh own or operate uh fuel fuel storage locations um you know ODOT gas I know he he doesn't to operate but you're certainly involved in fuel sector um or of Corrections parts and wreck like they all actually own and operate fuel storage locations and so we want to talk to them about you know our mandate our directive around fuel resiliency um so we've done that we keep doing that um we say crit and.bi through September 2024 the middle the information be collect here today as well as the other meetings across the state will feed into our final report and final analysis casy and Andrew will be working really that hard of the summer we have well getting that final version rolled out we'll have a release um sometimes before probably in September it'll be a webinar sort of thing we'll roll out the results um of our plan and then as I mentioned earlier update review every year yeah this the FED makeas review every year the state every other year um so that's our site there okay any questions there's a lot of stuff there we're going to get into even more details now um okay any questions onl good to go okay we pass it over to Dr thank than so thanks for asking about the stolder engagement level of participation we will get into that after the break when we show some of our preliminary results what I'm going to start with is more high level um just Foundation background how we structure this project and the timeline we've had to work on it and as we're wrapping things up so as we get into the timeline and the structure I want to just first remind us of why we're",

        "text": " beginning? All right, so here's a picture from our first planting, our second planting, Hillsboro. We've been around for a long time, mostly important, but this is our first year expanding our yoga retreat program out the hillsboro. This is outside of M and M Marketplace where it plants and trees. Next slide, please. Like I said, my name is Mario. I say certified, licensed arborist. My program manager was named to be here, express their condolences. But I'll try to do my best to describe our program, what else in here we had and answer any questions. But like I said, we're all about building community development trees. Next slide. And these are we started. Just one person wants to see trees in the neighborhood and we've grown over the past three years to expand to several counties, including Washington county, multiple County, Clark county, all the way down to Eugene. So we're really happy to be here in Washington county and Hillsborough specifically. Next slide. So the reason that friends and trees are doing this program in Hillsboro is because HCP has been looking at what's missing from our downtown community. And one of the things that's missing a lot is street trees for various reasons, whether they were lifting the sidewalk or they just aged out or they were never planted. And so we started talking about, like, what were the need? Like, was this a priority? And it definitely was a priority for us to start replacing the tree to go downtown. There's a couple, and I think you might even have it coming up, a map that shows, like, tree equity and environmental equity. But we brought together, you know, we saw that swales and soil water conservation district was offering a grant and we went to friends of trees and asked them to apply, though. Just like everything we do, it's all about partnerships. And they went in two years ago and applied for that grant. And this year we've been able to get 100 trees planted with outreach through our community, through downtown, spreading out a little bit further. Cause we had a few hiccups in downtown. But Mario's done a really good job of helping educate our neighbors. And me, who I thought I knew everything about trees, I really wanted street trees and we had a lot of struggles, street trees. But he has helped me learn that doesn't matter if it's 10ft further away in a yard, it's still benefiting everyone in that neighbor. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, so like I said, next slide. We hosted two community tree planting events, 1 December 9, where we planted about 50 trees. We actually planted about five trees right in Shoot park, which is really exciting. And then the second one was at M and M Marketplace, which was amazing. We really encourage you guys to come out to them. If they haven't painted trees before, they're super fun. You get to know your neighbors and just feel connected to your environment. But it was great. We had, like EJ said, a little over 100 trees, 30 of them being street trees and about 70 to 80 being nar trees. So these trees are going to be doing so much for our community in terms of air quality, shade, beauty, mental health benefits. I mean, I could go on and on about the benefits of truths, but it's pretty amazing that we're able to do that all community led and volunteer with lead as well. Next slide. So just to follow up, you saw that there were more volunteers and trees planted and I was so amazed. The first event, I think we had quite a few people that were coming from Portland, but a lot, lot of people that were just neighbors that found out about it and wanted to learn more about trees and friends of trees does the whole experience. So learning about the trees that they're planting, really nice labels all the way to really nice labels that go on afterwards and how to plant the trees. It also was really a great community building, especially being at M and M. And I think we decided to do both projects at M and M last year. They contributed vouchers for all the volunteers to go on to grab one shop board. So great opportunity. Yeah. Thank you again to Eminem Marketplace. I know we have a year. Thank you. All right, so, yeah, I mean, I can't express my gratitude for the city and all the people that came out support this event. It was a great season, but that's not to say that it was super smooth sailing. And that's why I wanted to come here and express some of the challenges that we faced. So since there is no urban forestry department yet in city of Hillsboro, it was really challenging to know exactly what the right processes were to plant these trees. The permitting process was really complicated and misleading in certain points, especially on the website. It seemed like sometimes they said to do this and then I would follow instructions and then it would get rejected and it just went on and on and on. There's so many kits in the kitchen. So I would just. I'm looking. Have a review of the burning process, forestry trees. A big part of that was the implementation of root barriers, which are these things that go on the edge of sidewalks. When you plant trees, they're very hard to install and very expensive and not always necessary for trees. There's a lot of evidence supporting that they're not necessary and they just create a huge barrier for people that want to plant trees. So I'd love to work with you guys to research trees and see what trees are actually requiring these. We at Prince of Trees really believe in the philosophy of planting the right tree in the right place, which is basically the idea that you're not going to find a huge Douglas fir in four foot strip. Right? That makes no sense. And that principle goes, is sorry. Yeah. So basically, I think you guys get the gist there. And then also we really want to just work with you guys to replace all the trees that we're missing, especially with everyone asked for. Next slide, please. I feel like there's a lot of opportunity for us to work together in terms of placing the trees, especially on 10th Avenue, where it is a really, there's a really high need for canopy support, those local businesses and to add shades of people who can actually hang out on the street and enjoy eating food or just supporting these neighborhoods that have been kind of look past. So yeah, we would love to work with you guys. So we plant the trees on 10th Avenue. We would love some more supportive permitting. We would love look through that street tree code one more time and update the species of trees that are obviously planted in the street in the right of way strips. When I first started last year, there was only about 15 trees that were allowed to be planted. Half of those were ash trees, the rest of them were maple trees that weren't even allowed or sort, you can't even source them anymore. So we'd love to explain that list, because in urban forestry, diversity really wastes the resilience. So the university canopy really helps to promote resilience in our communities. So that's why we're here. And we also just want to work with the city of Hillsboro to continue our programming. Like EJ said, we have a two year grant with twelve and soil water Conservation district and we want to expand what we do so we can plant more trees and support our urban canopy here. So again, we want to thank friends and trees for coming out here. In doing this with our community, it's been really interesting. I think that all the departments that are involved in helping getting these trees planted occurred. Mario's concerns about the process being complicated and about there being some barriers, literally barriers that we can hopefully overcome in the future. I think, you know, I know the city's moving forward with hiring an urban forester and I'm really excited about that. More natural resources would be even better. More natural resource planning across the city would be even better. But I think that partnering with friends of trees in the future could really be beneficial for our city. And today we just found out about a city grant that came out. But we hope, our tour organizations hope to work with the city to apply for a where we could get funding, additional funding to plant more trees, urban trees and wilderness areas. So. And we started this focus on Walnut street. I'm glad we got to finally plant some trees on Walnut street. There were a lot of reasons that we couldn't plant trees on Walnut Street, a lot more reasons than we could. So we still want to move forward with slowing down traffic, making a sense of place, all the good things that trees do. But again, thanks friends and trees. And to Tualton Valley soil and Water Conservation district for this funding and for the city staff that supported us. And there's 100 more trees to plant. So if you live in the downtown area and want to get on that list, you can get on the waitlist now for plantings. And then we're doing plantings again in December and March. So hopefully we'll see you there to help dig some holes and put some labels on all your plants, all the other things. Thank you. Thank you. Good job. Thank you. And if people are wanting to get on the list today, contact zero.net partnership. Is there a website? City yes. So I brought a bunch of flyers. I'm not sure what protocol is for distributing those, but they have my contact information and our website is on there. So you just plug in your address and say you want trees, and then I'll reach out to you in the. In the fall and get your trees planted. So. And it's easy to go to the friends and Trees website",

        "text": " of what we're asking the question about which is also why we have a public comment period associated with this we want to know what people think you know are the notices providing the value that we you know at least are intending to and then the council can certainly make any direction of you know only make the legal requirements put in there or um leave everything as it is or let's bring this back and have a detailed conversation and go through you know each element of a notice to see which are the things that you like um which are the things that you don't like um and that we could remove from the notices and make that um certainly smaller and maybe more more simple for people to read um so really that's the the overall context of the conversation today is what if anything should we do with you know notices and then more broadly do wants to come back and talk about how the web pages are set up how the handouts are are done you know what are the materials that truly are valuable for the public to better understand you know our process and then their role in our process all right so I think there we're going to then move on um and so before you kind of talk about this unless you have any questions um before you really kind of get into a discussion about this we want to give people um an opportunity to you know provide their their thoughts their comments um I did send out yesterday um Miss Fuji CER sent a written comment she wasn't able to attend today so she' requested that I provide her written comments to council which which I did um shortly after she sent them to me yesterday so you have those you can already see at least what somebody has said and so with that you know unless there are any kind of specific questions which I think you know most of the discussions should occur after the public comment period um unless you have anything I will um let Nancy see if there's anybody who wants to provide comment there are no hands raised at this time but again let's just remind everyone how to uh raise your hand on a webinar uh again at the bottom of the main set of Windows or excuse me at the main window is a set of icons ions click on the participant and at the bottom of that window there's a hand icon if you click on that hand it will raise your hand and you can click it again when you are finished commenting if you are on the phone and would like to participate press star three on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and then again press star three to lower your hand when you are finished commenting there is one hand raised I go ahead and unmute your mic I believe that's Irene hello are you there you go hello hi hi Irene we can hear you yes this is Irene Gilbert and I think I'll just go through some specific comments until you tell me to shut up okay um and part part of this is um the or the sort of the presentation of information um first I would say um that this amendment is being um processed under type A and then uh a statement that the Oregon Department of energy has determined that um the request for Amendment two was complete effective 11th and then I would say ESC has recommended approval of the attached draft proposed order and I would attach the draft proposed order with the notice on any electronic um issuance of it the and these are sort of where I would put the information number four I would make a statement that epsac is now opening a public comment period beginning when ending whenever it would be the information basically on the right hand side of the first page of this notice and I would list the public comment period and have the public hearing occur at least five days prior to the end of the public comment period and one thing I will say is the comment on the bot in the comes over in the middle of that that says additional information will be provided the at the hearing about how to provide oral comment uh that's not even in any way useful if the public hearing were to end the the public comment period um also I don't believe that it's useful to include the information on the description of the approved facility but what people are going to want to know is um in the in the basically after this uh announcement of the public comment period I would then go into information on what was requested in the amendment request that would be the information uh on the left hand side page one and rather than um I mean most of this is okay but then when it gets down to site certificate conditions and you say gs6 g nc6 whatever um if you don't say what that change is there's it means nothing so in the notice of what the amendment is requesting it needs to include the changes to the site certificate conditions if there are any um and once that is done I would note to the public where the location is that would be the facility location and location of changes um the then after you go through that I think it is appropriate to list what the the fsac review process is and that to me means that you tell people what it is that has to be included in a comment in the event that they they may be asking for a contested case and so it would be the uh specificity information but also the information that's evaluated when people make these requests um so there really should be a separate section that says something to the effect of if you believe that you may be requesting a contested case uh regarding your comments you must include the following information and then say what they have to include that it must um involve an issue that uh would affect the decision regarding the site certificate if that's what you're going to say the information that says it must relate to whichever chapters you're going to consider and what of my recommendations is going to be you should not list chapters and limit public comments and contested cases to specific chapters because you are forcing a lot of people to go through a non-contested case um appeal by limiting their opportunities to get a contested case through Council I mean people have the right to either receive a contested case through councel or be able to present their issues before the circuit court so by minimizing the opportunities to be heard by Council you are forcing people to go to Circuit Court to have that information developed for a supreme court appeal so um let's see what else I have here um the information about you know making sure that when you say the scope of council review um it should say that some some things that if there are changes in the site certificate conditions it should clearly state for changes in the existing site certificate conditions um they must the facility must comply with all of the laws applicable to the change so that is not clear in this notice it still isn't clear um I think that it's fine to give them a bunch of information about other resources and where they can go and and all that but not in the middle of of uh providing information about these public comments and their opportunity to comment I would put all if you're going to include that I would put a separate section at the very last of this that says following our resources that may assist you in um in making your comments and you know maybe it's an attachment I don't know but not not mix it in there's like there are resources listed in the body of this there are also resources listed at the end of it and I don't I you know it it's really confusing um the the dra proposed order should be attached to every um submiss of this um request to make comment because people need to have easy quick access to what is it you're proposing and so let's see what else I here I made a whole bunch of just real specific comments about rewarding some of the stuff which probably aren't appropriate for for this particular uh comma time frame but I think there are problems with the fact that it's not in plain language it's not in understandable language through an eighth grade education and when you use things like DPO it you should State draft proposed order I mean at least two or three times before you use a term like DP or or uh RFA 2 or um those are going to mean anything to most people who are going to be reading these um you have any questions on the comments to to this point I am going to attempt to make some comments on the re on revisions to chapter 27 certainly one of them would be not limiting contested cases to only three divisions out of all of the divisions that that fsac is responsible for and perhaps having it having issues not have to raise a significant issue of of uh law or fact but maybe just raise an issue that is reasonably likely to affect fsac determination that the changes are going to um affect their decisions on the application something along those lines as opposed to making it so limited um see after all of that I would go ahead and include the information on Final order and then go into all of these resources that that are listed here does anyone have any questions was I it all clear on what I'm dating here I I really had only taken time to look at this just now because quite honestly I've been responding to all these reconsiderations and Men motions that I've been dealing with so thank you for your comments Miss Gilbert are there any questions from Council uh Mr chair if I might jump in so um Miss Gilbert we certainly you know we have this recorded and you know all the information you provided and yes definitely was able to track you know what your your comments were and we'll have that information if there's anything else you know feel free to submit it to me um you know in an email and we'll take a look at that as well so you this is in a you project so there's no time limits and there's no kind of issues but feel free to send that information to me and I'll certainly pass it on to council members as well if there's anything beyond um what you stated and then certainly if council members have any questions for Miss Gilbert please please do ask this is Marcy uh chair how if I may yes uh Miss Gilbert hello uh I just wanted to to say thanks you know I do a lot of writing in in my professional jobs and and I do believe you are correct when we think about um not just education level which some people might instantly be offended by that but that is you know when you think about the way newspapers or I guess we don't read those a ton these days but",

        "text": " case process and we did get a number of comments on and then finally um we are recognizing that the existing standards uh since the council cannot approve new site certificates except in pretty limited circumstances do not involve carbon dioxide emissions that those those existing standards will have a limited applicability in the um but there are some instances where they can be applied and that includes uh the modification of some uh fossil fuel power plants as well as any proposals you would get for a non-generating uh facility that that emits or diopside and that's something i think still exploring how exactly that might look in the future um but anyway since there is some limited applicability of those existing standards we do recommend that updating the standards as well as the carbon monetary offset rate is still justified just this slide shows kind of the existing universe of sight certificates for fossil fuel power plants um right now there are that's there's nine site certificates out there uh two of those facilities are no not moving forward that includes the governmental plan which has been um as you just heard about and then the perennial wind chaser station which was not built and um the certificate holder for that facility has submitted its intent to terminate to that and i think that would be you know legitimately good uh yes i just want to bring them to one sort of point so for the record for that some people are familiar with sort of the universe of gas plants in oregon this does not include the portland general electrics beaver plant in in and around classical knowing that's because it predates the site certificate requirements so that's a facility that was you know it's billboard it's operated by portland general electric not our jurisdiction you secretary yeah that since this is not included facilities there may also be a few uh high-efficiency covered in plants still in operation that are fossil fueled although a lot of those paper milling which i don't know that would actually involve as involved in sometimes software attributes should agree yes yeah you mentioned earlier non-generating the facility with the units what would that be typically that is a how the the standards are written or how the status is typically a service facility associated with an underground uh gas storage utilities like a compressor station or a pipeline compressor station as well so as we were preparing the proposed uh for this project our objectives were to implement the standard for new fossil fuel power plants uh and amend the application requirements accordingly to implement the standards for existing fossil fuel power plants and explain uh how the council will determine what a significant increase in emissions is to update the existing carbon dioxide emission standards based on the most efficient technology currently operating in the u.s and to update the monetary offset rate based on variable evidence on the current cost of offsets as the procedural history i kind of actually went back to just show how both the standards themselves have evolved and this project is involved so um the uh legislature enacted the existing carbon dioxide standards in 1997. um i went back to the slide you can see some of these early ones so the harness and generating plant actually was a subject to those carbon dioxide emission standards and then coyote springs which approved in 94 and then amended with the second unit later actually the standard only applies to that second unit um whereas thermostat which was approved before the standard came into effect but i think not built until after uh it's subject to it as are all the facilities um so that standard was in place uh from 1997 until now um and the council did update it several times um and updated the monetary offset rate several times although there was kind of a slump in uh early 2000s where there wasn't a lot of action on on updating those rules in 2021 as i mentioned the legislature passed hp 2021 which aside from this and contains a lot of uh climate uh climate policies and uh he sets new clean energy targets for oregon's electricity system that bill and the the requirements of uh rs469413 which is the new uh restrictions on possible power plants for the council took it back on september 25th of last year came to you with implementing rules um well i should back up and say this project was initially on the schedule as just an upstate of the monetary offset rate because the council had the authority to update that rate again as of july 1st of this year um so after the passage of hp 2021 we admitted the scope to implement these provisions as well um so we brought your proposals in april and the council approved them at that time and we got the notice before rulemaking now at the end of april we had our hearing last month in june and in response to a request a stakeholder the council extended the public comment deadline from the end of that hearing to july 11th um and that brings us to today so the proposed rules would amend um standard in division 24 rule 500 to incorporate the new requirements of hp and to clarify those standards uh the the non-emitting electricity standard is what is applicable to the review of an application for a new fossil fuel power um it would amend uh the uh existing carbon dioxide standards to reset the emission standard based on the most efficient gas-fired combined cycle electric turbine plant that's commercially demonstrated and operated in the united states it's not full that is spiritual statute um and then finally it would have been the monetary offside rate by 50 from 2.85 uh cents per 10 to four dollars and 27 cents per time of access carbon dioxide the proposals would also amend the information requirements in division 20 and 21 to uh adopt new application requirements for fossil fuel power plants and other facilities that have carbon dioxide uh and then it would have been the scope of council's review of an amendment to implement the new requirements for and define what is considered to be a significant increase in gross carbon dioxide emissions and then there's also a number of kind of organizational clerical changes uh including uh consolidating the carbon specific definitions that are currently in division one over to division 24 and then repealing a rule or two that that just states was in so four persons provided comments on visible making at the june hearing um the extended deadline for written comments was 5 pm on july 11th as of that deadline uh the council had received 12 comments uh from 11 different organizations and um all those comments and provided the council so i mean we will put them on the website um just a quick rundown um the commenters included few individuals jake's houston kathy moyet and martha vigley a joint comment from columbia river keeper verde road climate or justice in front of the columbia gorge uh comments from the league of women voters of oregon uh comments from portland general electric company vista corporation um uh comment from uh climate solutions renewable northwest metro action climate syrian team that they provided joint comments the green energy uh instance who provided comments ocea also provided the comments and then um the oregon odo uh provided our own testimony and a staff um particularly related to a few issues that i'll discuss um but those are related to some required findings that the council needs to maintain okay so getting into the substance um so one of the comments we got was that the new information requirements require just a discussion of methods of how an applicant would avoid greenhouse gas emissions or capture sequester and store carbon uh carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from from getting into the atmosphere and they said you know generally that a discussion of methods isn't enough and they wanted to know how the council would evaluate that information and our response here is just that those particular rules are just information requirements they're not the standard and the standard here is that the generated electricity generated from the facility will be non-emitting um and that is the statutory requirement um that means that no uh greenhouse gases will be emitted into the atmosphere there's some additional discussion on what exactly that means that we can talk about a second then here it is uh so several comments raised concerns that basically if a fossil fueled power plant were to meet the non-emitting electricity standard they would they would probably need to use some sort of firearm catheter storage and sequestration technology and that would either involve them sort of facility at their site or piping uh or likely at this point of time the technology is that they would likely build a pipeline or use an existing pipeline to to transport the emissions from their site to a underground storage facility the commenters uh urged the council to consider the unproven nature of carbon capture and sequestration technology when it determines whether a facility emits uh emits greenhouse gases uh and they also pointed to um potentials for leakage or failure or i would say well failure both in the short term but also in the long term over kind of the i guess i don't know how long of a scale but maybe the geological scale that they should require to prevent the significant and fastest uh i think this was really request for the council to kind of establish some intent on how strictly you're interpreting the nominating facility we believe that the rule as written which kind of restates the statute would likely require substantial evidence that greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity at a proposed facility would be captured and permanently stored we think that the the language is probably adequate as is but including some specific criteria to support the findings particularly the part about permanent storage the required rule and may ensure that there's concerns are addressed in future proceedings obviously you all won't always be the ones making these decisions so if you do want additional criteria or information included you can include um i do have some rule potential language that i will pull up to implement this um so this would add a new section to the carbon dioxide admissions standard that would basically say well i'll read it for people that are on the phone and can't see this but um it would say that if the facility will rely on carbon capture sequestration and uh to satisfy the requirements of section one which is the non-emitting uh not emitting electricity standard um the council must find that the certificate has demonstrated that the structure systems components and monitoring programs for the capture sequestration disorder greenhouse gases that result in the generation of electricity at the facility are reasonably likely to result in the permanent sequestration of the emissions from the atmosphere so in some ways that it's more words saying kind of the same thing i think um but i",

        "text": " we're really looking out that they would give the name the university they graduated from their experience with company but um our sort of issue with those specific people is we're not going to bind to using those people or to having those people SN time the parent company but we do get experience thank you I um I'll just thank you yeah and what well there's more to I'm sure we'll have CC just question how you want to do this want then I don't have that many SPS so I think that we get the information back I think you want okay so questions about the type of evidence that we've been receiving our has been brought up again in the last couple of years and so we've really targeted our focus and ourselves what are we doing um some of the shifts that we been implenting at the STA level um examples so as I mentioned we might get a list of projects that so instead of just taking that and that's done we now um go the developers web page we see what more information we can learn about those projects we identify the regulatory agency that issued that permit and try to better understand their permitting process do they have equivalent rules what is this really relevant know in Montana and Wyoming a for Fe so if we buil there that might not necessarily know how to do it there even cost compliance every really um and and this aspect of going you know really like internet web is something like kind of fact verification is time consuming it's difficult we're not getting very we haven't been picking up the phone to make phone calls to Regulatory Agencies to say tell me how expence was when buil it um because if that's time consuming and difficult and would one Le do looking around to see what other information is available was the permitting process even remotely um okay other changes that we have been implementing supported by Council during the per processes to say you're ring on parent sign parent letter in your exib D that says I affirm acknowledge and agree with all these representations of their Reliance on us now and future for that um another change that has been partially implemented in the per process is a request that applicant provide PR to instruction assed that they will be there to pay for all obligations one other change that Council has implemented is through um conditions where they um hopefully you know our process and our current rules all certificate holders have to report on their comp annual so what council was requested in some instances is that that annual be specific on the department plan for evaluating whether there is severe issues incidents actions of noncompliance going on where that decommissioning B may no we are will we evaluate a decomissioning bond at preconstruction we don't say does this cover not it's to restore the of well operated facility so in order to cover that Gap if there were to be one Council has said Department you evaluate that report that shows significant noncompliance bring it back to counil yes question that last bullet point I thought where we ended up on that was we can revisit the amount of the bond letter of credit not just that there's instances of non-compliance but if there are Market changes for example so it does go beyond we okay so um so so that's the mix of changes that we've been implenting through the per process we have a few other ideas that we wanted to talk out um so let's remember what the standard requires it requires that the council finds the applicant the ability to conru certificate to me that incompliance with Council standards is really covered enti the other so let's say that we're focusing on the evidence that we're getting for how the applicant can be and OPG this facility the of conditions also so we're asking the question how can we better has the ability to construct and operate compliance certificate conditions which you should think about mitigation mitigation water fire mitigation habitat mitigation these longterm expensive detail we they need to to implement this med sucess so um and and we don't evidence that we're getting as don't have finished the paper I sometimes we don't even know he giving us very so the way that we currently evaluate how certif certificate conditions once they have a site certificate take the site certificate put it in the Matrix and provide a narrative for each one all the why could process is same where we have to kind of get pretty far through and evaluating what conditions are needed but then before going to an approval step we're looking at what their compliance plan is how are you going to do it and how much does it cost and do you have enough money to implement this plan so what we would be talking about in terms of is a detailed SC budget can be the form of compliance plans very similar to what we do want to have and that budget to meet thatg we need their existing financial status comp CICS um this would be important to know that it's clear how this is work we can follow the same approach for the scope and cost of constructing and requesting and ability to the fund and be um have ability to design oper um but you know those those ideas are with challenges and issues as are all ideas that we have um it would be very difficult for staff to understand if with without criteria we St to understand if the scope was and if the budget was so it would just be data it would have you know data that they create against but it would um so then another piece of evidence that is finity in in our appli to request can receive and execute a cost reimbursement agreement and on average it's it's our forecasting cost process it wouldn't be less than 300 and we have to have that on hand before started and we have an obligation if we get too close to that amount they we amend that agreement they have to REM the policy you generally have to be on point in order for us to release that um so that clearly demonstrates the level of Financial Security get certainly is very available it's not challenging to obtain we could either ourselves or as to describe and present that some level of financial meet the standard okay so that is the summation of sorry everyone um okay she's so I think that um so in the staff report we provided a table that I found very interesting in just going through the alls we've G through the last couple years inment you can see shs and theid threshold we're getting um and so now really the challenges of doing any of this outside R making really it's difficult to keep track we making at a project level when not rule um and we also don't get comprehensive thorough input a r making advisory committee about what works about something and we really we got on didn't get pushed back and then all of a sudden we did and we all became good and comfortable in the subject umide b IDE thank you for that I'll just look around Vice chair how thank you CH girl this is a general big comment that doesn't get into the weave of the table that you've provided in all and it's without a need standard it seems the site certificate holders are the site certificates are speculative and so being speculative that kind of implies well if we approve something today it's not going to happen today they're speculating and it's going to be when they get a purchase agreement or something happens down the road that could be years and so the staff of the certificate holder that gave the qualifications that help um prove they are credible and can meet the requirements of the standard that we're addressing here may change and so pulls a rug out from under everything it seems so without a annual revisit or something like that of the credentials of the certificate holder on um the organizational expertise standards so on that's just a General comment thank you for your comment secretary cornette thank you madam chair cornette thank you sh and I think you highlighted an important point is there is tension here there is tension in that we have an evidentiary process that basically requires applicants to show upfront that they can meet all of the standards you know not just how the system is developed but also the legislature eliminated the need standards for generating facilities in the mid 90s um and so the policy for you know non or for generating facilities is Market based so these aren't entirely contradictory but but there is tension in in in this in what can we what should we require in this element because there should be and and S pointed out the vast majority of the certific ific holders and applicants are limited liability corporations who rely on parent company who don't want the liability so that's some difficult issues so I mean it's to to kind of just point out the obvious it's complicated and there's tension uh and so I think we can and should do different things but what those are and how we can do those I think involves a lot of conversation um that thank you council member cond he must be able to read my um cind for the record and want I really want to compliment uh staff on their grabbing hold of these issues and really going deep in um the review process and then a form be able to have the conversation so I have I think what is a pretty question uh with respect to explanation focus on the condition that they meet the um when I um material um I see a lot or read a lot of statements from the applicants themselves that says we will construct a facility you know will'll be begin construction within two years and there's a timeline presented in one certainly not a condition but are we evaluating um the applicant's ability to do what not just the conditions we impose because we don't impose a condition well do say sh start but we allow amendments and whatnot is there how does that enter into the evaluation process day and are there me the limited liability we've seen they don't really have much Financial they don't have people they don't have Financial Resources so saying that we can begin construction within a period of time it's um and so I'm wondering if there oper there's been some conversation in the past about operating agreements between parent company and um subsidiary what that operating agreement says the responsibility current compan that the app perform on not necessar conditions but what they see well in terms of evaluating whether they can actually start when they see they're going to start we don't evalue mostly because statute requires Council to establish the construction stry and that has become very standardized without it being like substantive they to start it's not based on their ability to startend so and then any other that to meet is a so it's not representations that should be condition but we missing it that's something we can",

        "text": " up here with us but sitting right behind uh we also have two members of avrid we have Mark isers he's the lead for Pacific Northwest development at avrid Renewables and then we also have Jason who's working as a developer at Aven Renewables thank you so first we' like to uh thank AO staff for uh their work on the uh draft public order and their comprehensive summary they provided as a as an introduction um the certificate holder is um in support of uh the findings and uh the proposed conditions in the draft public order subject to uh certain comments that we've submitted in a in a common letter dated March 15 2024 I'll go over briefly those comments they're pretty minor um the first one uh dealt with um a table two in the draft proposed order um looking at the temporary disturbance by facility component or activity uh that's that's being proposed as part of the draft um proposed order um as as proposed the language uh is talks about a maximum tempor disturbance uh the certificate older would like to the language to reflect a change that would make it an approximate temporary disturbance uh subject to a limit with with some of the discretion that might be allowed for the certificate holder not to exceed 10% of the approximate disturbance the reason for this requested change is that uh the the proposed temporary disturbance that um the certificate holder evaluated is based on preliminary design and there may be some changes you know later down the road as a construction undertaken so this uh approximate language with some res restriction with a 10% will allow some flexibility as as design is further developed and gets uh underway um the second comment that we provided relates to condition the new recommended condition 122 as well as the recommended amended condition 30 um that provides Odo with the right to adjust contingencies uh quote as appropriate and Ne necessary to ensure that cost to restore the site are adequate um specifically would like to get some additional guidance from Odo as to the the words appropriate and necessary um to better understand what may trigger os's discretion in requiring uh or adjusting the contingency so so that certificate holder can better plan and understand what what may trigger uh that right um the the two other comments that the certificate holder raised in that letter are pretty minor one of them relates to the recommended amended condition 27 currently the um draft proposed order does not reflect uh the language that was adopted in the site certificate and the amended site certificate so we would like to request that that language from the site certificate be um added to the uh or replaces the current language in the draft proposed order uh and the last comment is is minor one in table three of the uh DPO just correcting a temporary impact ratio um from 1:1 to 2:1 so that's that's it really for the comments that the certific goer raised uh before this hearing uh would' be happy to answer uh CLR questions from the council otherwise would reserve some rebuttal time to answer comments from the public uh and as you mentioned the the public comment period is open until 29th so we might decide to you know answer public comments or other questions s uh later next week and take the time to answer those properly thank you thank you for being here tonight any question do we go now to questions from the council for the record Todd cornite yes um if any council members have any clarifying questions for the comments that were provided by the certificate aler it would be appropriate to ask those now but you're not required to so we obviously the um it's being recorded we're taking notes we'll make note of all of this so these go onto the record so this will also be what the council reviews um when you when you when the record is totally closed and you're reviewing the draft proposed order um but if you have any clarifying questions please ask them now nice shair Condon councelor CR um hi thank you again for being here I would just like to say that the um the comment about uh what triggers necessary and I can't remember exactly what El she said but I think that's something that aligns with what we've talked about frequently in other conversations so I would just like to say to staff to please pay extra attention to that I think it saves everyone a lot of unnecessary grief if we could provide some guidance to that yeah uh Madam Vice chair yeah and I think that's appropriate and I think that would be a good conversation to have when Council reviews the draft proposed order and so that would be potentially you know you can have the discussion about that provide some direction and guidance to us in terms of making any changes necessary to clarify that in the proposed order Mr secretary and and councelor Grail councelor delin any comments or questions no not at this time um thank so counc buyer thank you again for joining us and um on the waste minimization which is going to continue to be a big issue um are you comfortable with that language and any idea on the likelihood of finding a recycler or somebody who can help minimize that Wast stream and it's it's more curiosity than anything I think the language as written gives you as a developer some options to address that but just just out of curiosity yeah it's a good question um so we are comfortable with the language as written you know with that optionality there we are exploring recycling methods we are currently Contracting the repowering of the project and our plan is right now we're working with that contractor to identify recycling facilities and methods on site to break down the blades so we can transport them so likelihood I don't have a percentage right now but to me I can see the team is doing the work to try to make it happen as best as we can which is why we're comfortable with that language because that is our preference to recycle as well thank you okay with that we'll move on to public testimony and before I open the hearing up to that public testimony I want to remind the public that prior to the close of the record you may submit written testimony in a variety of ways the comment portal email and handing in your written comment tonight and we've got blue forms if anybody wants to comment and doesn't have a blue form um just raise your hand and someone will get it to you and just keep in mind that you have till March 29th uh to submit comments and Nancy can we maybe show up hands and then we'll get a count of how many people would like to make comments tonight or provide comment pretty impressive you just came to hear so very impressive um and how about anyone in the webinar or on the do we need to I do not see any hands raised at this time let me give directions for people on the webinar or on the phone on how to raise their hand um if you're participating on the webinar at the bottom of the main window is a set of icons you're going to click on the participant and at the bottom of that window is a hand icon if you click on that that will raise your hand and you'll click it again when you're finished commenting to lower your hand if you are on the phone press star three on your keypad to raise your hand and then when you're finished commenting you can press star three again to lower your hand just give it a minute I'm just going to roll forward yeah there are no hands raised at this time okay seeing no one that wants to make comment in the room or on the webinar or by phone uh we'll move on as previously stated the comment deadline is March 29th at 5:00 pm the certificate holder will be given until Monday April 1st at 5:00 pm to provide responses to comments however if requested by the certificate holder the department is authorized to grant them additional time respond and do does the comment no no further comments okay thank you very much sorry sorry we're at the council member comment phase now so if council members want to make any comments they can um at which point then the certificate holder could then respond to that okay councelor buer certainly thank you and thank you again um just a a question for staff um we have this is a fairly minor Amendment with repowering not a lot of new disturbance but we do have a couple of new standards in particular the Wildfire standard and just reviewing some of the council's recent decisions to ensure that there is some consistency there I understand that different projects have different impacts but Council has spent a fair bit of time looking at our Wildfire standards and trying to give better direction to applicants and also help us um ensure compliance with those so wanting to make sure that uh the DPO that comes back to us has that assessment the same would apply apply for organizational expertise which Council has spent a fair bit of time honing in on the conditions for that standard to give better guidance to the applicant on what our expectation is there the relationship between the parent companies and the llc's so making sure that um those conditions reflect uh what the council has already talked about and as councelor Grail pointed out the um the Reclamation Bond um language that we really try to Define what we mean to give guidance on what that appropriateness test really looks like so that would be my comment and I know it's kind of running on but trying provide not just consistency but Clarity so thank delin no comments on this this this public hearing it's the next one that I have comments on Vice chair comment councelor Imes yes um councelor Imes for the record thank you for being here tonight um my comments are based on the DPO um specifically page 98 um under way and I just noticed um throughout that section um on the site certificate that was initially um issued there was a waste management plan and um the department is recommending um condition 130 which has um some good recommendations in there for um the applicant to issue um notice of uh contracts and agreements with your um um different vendors which is good um and so I just wanted to comment on the fact that maybe um a little more information would be useful I think for uh in detail for um especially since uh we had a waste management plan with the first site certificate so um that's That's the basis of my comment and it goes back to also um subsection um B under waste minimization and that is that the applicant plans to manage the accumulation",

        "text": " and do a site plan that has everything updated on it so everything can be permitted accurately. I guess what I'm getting at is, so this wasn't even legal in the first place, right? This was done. It's five years ago. There should have been additional permitting as far as the kennel because they do run air conditioning to that, and it is a larger building. So with that being said, there probably there needed to be permits on that. There needed to be permits for the drainage'retention area, and there has to be a signed and sealed report. It's called a major site plan when it incorporates stormater. So those are the things that we have concerns about that they need to go in back permit and have. So building department will be on site as soon as they are able to submit this, it will go through the review process just like any other commercial organization or structure. And it's not up to us, it's up to the building department if they will levy any fines to the Howards at that time. But not for the dogs. This isn't about the dog. What he's talking about is not the dogs. It's about the structures that were there. No, right off the bat now, he would have been able to have what you said initially, they, without building a thing, he would have been able to have a bunch of dogs. This is an a one piece of property. If they weren't engaged in a kennel operation, they could have as many dogs as they wanted to. Right? The fact that they are in a commercial operation mandates that they do have to have a kennel licensure and they do have to go through the special use permitting process. But it is an a one piece of property. So like I said, if they, you could have 40 dogs out there if they weren't engaged in a breeding operation. A lot of times people's concerns are addressed. At this point that we're in opposition, some people may still have some additional concerns. So if you want to have a seat and then take notes of any concerns that are brought out so you can come back and maybe address some of them, they are your neighbors, and it's nice for everyone to get along. So we're going to have a seat right now, and we're going to go ahead and open up the public portion of the hearing at this point. Is anyone in favor that would like to come up? Is anyone in opposition that still would like to come up after hearing all of the concerns addressed? So if you would come on up, and we're going to have you sign in, and then we'll have you state your name and address for the record. Sure. You can sign in on this side. And you can go ahead. And you can start, ma'am. And then you can sign in as soon as you're done. And we'll use both sidesk. Ok. Thank you. Thank you. If you can state your name and address for the record. I'm Dawn Kit Miller, and I live at 3078 Southeast 112th Street, Ocala, Florida. And I would like to say thank you for volunteering your time, for coming out and hearing us. And I am appreciative of the process. I'm going to read my letter because I get nervous and forget things. Is that okay? Because I did email it. It's your time. Ok. It's your time. Just remember, you have two minutes. I have lived on the property of my current address for over 50 years. I've seen our neighborhood grow and shrink and grow again. Everyone that moves in our neighborhood has the same reason to get away from the noise and busyness of the city life. We enjoy our quiet in the morning and the evening after a hard day work. We deserve our pursuit of happiness without the hindrance of a neighbor. My yard has been stolen without a penny changing hands. I can't enjoy my yard in its entirety anymore because I have to listen to dogs randomly at all hours of the day and the night. The dogs in question are kept in pens for the sole purpose of a prophet, not a rescue that has been previously registered or indicated. The lights from the property are so bright as chang the environment at night, as the dogs bark at the night randomly because they're not in the dark to sleep. Our livestock are and have been more prone to distress at random for unknown reasons because of the noise all day and night. I'll interject. We have horses. I've had them call it twice. They'd never call it before. One's twelve, one's seven. Animals need to get rest just like humans. This current puppy mill that I feel like it is situation does not allow for that and will only get worse if they're permitted to produce 23 litters a year. Think about what a toll that will ll take on the animals and the neighborhood. How many rescues truly exist that help these types of dogs that can no longer produce. How can you sell a house when there's a loud puppy mill next door? I already know of two people because I have a realtor that's a friend that opted not to buy in this neighborhood because of the puppy mill. We have to defend our way of life so it doesn't get changed forever. We shouldn't have to fight this hard for what we already paid for. We should have some rights. And I am hopeful that the county doesn t. I'm sorry I'm going to have to stop you at this point, but it'll help you at the county commissioners meeting to know where you're out on your timing. Absolutely. Thank you very much. Go ahead and state your name. And my name is Lee Kitz Miller. 3078 southeast hundred 12th street. And again, thank you all for your time here tonight. I'm going to pick off where she left off and I can really appreciate them saying there's no odor, but I'd love for you to come to my property and smell it. Okay? So I'm not sure how they're getting rid of the urine and that type of an odor. And if you have a dumpster full of crap, you're going to smell it. So please know that. And I would like you to put yourself in our positions at 300ft away from this, 600ft away from this, even a thousand feet away from it. You hear the dogs bark in the morning, so sometimes in the afternoon, in the evening, we've heard embarkking at 11:00 at night. Now, maybe they've made changes. I have no idea since all this has started, but it hasn't been that way. And I know my time's coming up. But why would Mister and misses Howard have some consideration for the area they are moving into? May I remind you we are here because the neighbors, due to the puppy mill, complained so much. Mister and Misses Howard were forced to comply with existing codes and laws. They did not seek this special use permit prior to the neighbors complaining they moved in, set up shop, and thumbed their nose at the rest of us as they did what they wanted. Now I'm sure we will hear how it will be a hardship for this family to be shut down from their income. Perhaps hear how it would be a hardship for this should have been a forethought instead of an afterthought. Either way, we feel like we shouldn't have to pay for their lack of planning. Also, the lights that showone on everyone's property adjacent to the Howards was not addressed until a complaint was filed. It looks like I'm at the end of my time. Do you need me to still write my name down here, please? Thank you. Thank you for the time. Thank you. Thank you very much for your time. My name is Darren Fowler. I live at 360 Southeast 110th Street, Oala, Florida 34480. Okay. Where I notice the smell is in the back of the Howard property when I'm back there working with my animals, and we've been working on clearing fencing and getting garbage out of the neighborhood. It's on the back side of where all those kennels are at when the wind blows down through. That's where I notice the smell. Anytime you go into the back of my yard there to work with an animal or deal with the horse, the dogs are instant triggered and you get 50 or however many dogs are there at that time, barking in that droning of those dogs non stop. I understand we have the right to own our property in Marion county and do anything we want, but the light that infiltrates through the night is my main complaint. And then the condition, the dogs are just always back there barking. It's something else I have not had, and I don't know them at all. And I have heard good things about their kennel. In my experience, other kennels in other places, not mister and misses Howard. These things tend to end up badly for the animals, and that is my primary concern too. I thank you for listening to my concerns about this. But it's the dogs being in the cages and the non stop barking is what my main compliant is with this. Thank you very much for your time. Thank you. My name is Sherri Fowler. I live at 30 91 Southeast 112th street. And I own several of those pieces. I own two pieces of property within that neighborhood. We sort of. Our family owns the back of it. We moved there. We bought the property to keep out the city and keep out the noises. We wanted our children to be raised in a small town. We now anytime we're in the back, we have to smell dog urine. There is a watershed in the back of low spot, and my fear is, when they wash out those kennels, yes, the urine goes out in the ground, but my well is back there, so I don't know what it's going to do to",

        "text": " protected area standard under this standard the council must prohibit the sighting of energy facilities in protected areas except for special cases primarily transmission lines or pipelines where there is no reasonable alternative protected areas include national and state parks national monuments and other areas identified in the council rules as having special scenic natural or environmental value for proposed facilities near protected areas the standard requires council to determine the facility would have no significant direct or indirect adverse impact on these protected areas so in the application evaluated the analysis area which is the pink dotted line around the proposed site boundary and in their analysis they identified 18 protected areas includes four state wildlife refuges five state fish hatcheries two state parks one state heritage area two agricultural experimental stations one blm bureau of land management area of critical environmental concern and three state wildlife areas so in their analysis basically we looked at the proximity of identified protected areas in relation to the components and that would be the wind turbines the solar facility and the transmission line and one of the key findings is that for the wind and solar components the protected area would be six or more miles away so little to no visual impact related to those components um the echo meadow site which is a area of critical environmental concern managed by the blm it's a viewing area for the public of the oregon national historic trail which is what the onht stands for it is approximately 0.2 miles or 1500 feet from the transmission line on the uec the only impact that we have potentially identified for protected areas as the project is proposed is that there could be a noise related effect when they construct the upgrade to the uec line if that route is selected so for that reason the department recommended a notification for the blm just to notify um blm that the dates of the construction and that that noise may be for visitors to that area i think it's important to note we did consult with blm and blm found that our analysis was adequate and that they actually determined no impacts from the facility so are there any questions on protected so the next section is the retirement and financial assurance and just as an overview a council realizes that there is a risk of construction of an energy facility and one of those risks is that it could stop before being completed and leave the community with an abandoned construction site and no funds for sites another risk is that a power plant owner might shut down the plant without restoring the site to a useful or non-hazardous condition in order to address these risks council first reviews the applicant's estimate of site restoration costs first to determine if they're reasonable and then they reviewed the capacity of the applicant to ensure that they have the ability to obtain adequate funds for site restoration council also includes a condition in a recite certificate that requires a bond or letter of credit for the amount established by council to be in place before construction begins specifically to provide funds for site restoration and that bond or letter of credit must be maintained for the life of the facility and it is adjusted periodically usually annually to account for inflation and other factors so i'm going to hand it over to sarah because there was some discussion at the at the public hearing testimony on part of the applicant where they had asked for an alternative amount to the recommended department contingency so i'm going to kick it over to her thank you kate okay so kate just walked you through the standard but i want to highlight again that part of your finding under the standard is that you find that the decommissioning estimate is satisfactory to restore the site to a useful non-hazardous condition so again part of our review to make a recommendation of whether that amount is satisfactory is to evaluate the methods uh the assumptions um and then to cross-reference if all of the facility components described throughout the application are reflected in the and then it's been our standard practice since 2005 to apply a 10 project management fee and a 10 to 20 future development contingency fee um to that total estimate and that would cover odo cost the 10 percent is a project management fee if odo then had to draw down on the bond in order to implement decommissioning in the event the applicant is unable to fulfill that obligation and then the future development contingency is really for uncertainties so i wanted to give you just a little bit of background the these contingencies again were established in 2005 based on um starting work with a consultant so i'm showing on my screen this first it's a cost estimating guy developed by pinell bush inc and this is as far as i understand it it all started okay so this is where the recommendation originated you can see here they've recommended these two numbers i've just cited that then again was evaluated and revised a couple of times most recently in january of 2011 that's this and i'll show you here so in this document it lays out for the project management fee a little bit of the scope that would be preparation of a final retirement plan obtaining legal access to the site legal expenses obtaining access to the bond or letter of credit etc etc some of these reasons are described in the draft proposed order um we no longer we up until 2013 or so people were using this guide and we stopped updating it so developers are no longer using this guide but maybe varying the approach to a decommissioning estimate but we have maintained the odo applied contingencies and really haven't we haven't changed them for any project since we started so in the applicant's comments which i'd like to just pull up for your reference okay so again this was in your attachment one to your staff report and here are there arguments that you can't see in the room but hopefully you can see on the screen arguing against are these applied contingencies and it is the case that in the application they offered an alternative approach which was an fte based approach where they are suggesting that that odo project management fee be based on the cost of two full-time employees for a duration of 16 months in their comments on the record the applicant claims there was no justification provided for the odo applied contingencies that they are illogical and consistent arbitrary and that there's no added value to the public i just want to point out this is not the first time that an applicant has taken issue with these contingencies um i mean in fact i've heard it since day one of seven years ago but most recently um the applicant for the bake of and solar project which was approved two years ago and for obsidian solar center both proposed fte based project management fees for the department which we brought forth to and in in both of those instances we struggled to understand how a duration could be assumed how do we know how long it's going to take for us to manage this uncertain process that we forecast to have quite a number of legal hiccups and uncertainties and we maintain the same question today is if it's an fte based approach how would we know it's limited to 16 months or 2 fte comment from the applicant was they requested that we provide additional rationale for the contingencies that were applied and use a standard and accepted cost estimating practice we're not totally sure what a standard and accepted cost estimating practice this is certainly standard for fsec facilities and the fsec process we are as you might recall we have been working with a consultant fairly uh heavily in the last year and i have sought whether they have expertise to evaluate typical project management costs for decommissioning of other type of industrial facilities they've affirmed they have a construction management team that could help us but we wanted to make sure to get council input on the direction before launching into that evaluation so i will pause there and see if you have any input on these contingencies any questions comments on sarah's asking yes ann suzanne so has the council pretty been pretty consistent in their application of the contingencies since 2005-2011 which i think is more than 10 years ago and i understand that 10 of some of these larger projects is a number with a lot of zeros i get that projects are becoming more complex and i would encourage you to continue working with the consultant to see if this is kind of in the ballpark or if it skews low or high and it may skew low in terms of actual project management costs i don't know again projects are becoming more um i'm con i'm comfortable with those contingencies knowing that they've been applied consistently and um the rationale was considered back when these were adopted so unless there's something i'm missing and i know it's it's a big dollar figure but it's a responsibility that the public really can't take on thank you and thank you also just for reference so the based on their method of the two fte for 16 months was about a half a million at our applied contingency it's 6.7 and then you know if you break it down to fte that's i believe it's one fte for almost seven years is what 6.7 million or two fte four and a half years just wanted to offer that thank you go ahead sure uh cindy condon for the record um so it's my understanding certainly based on what and uh just commented on it's been a long time practice um to use these contingencies i just want to confirm that the letters of credit are adjusted annually and at any time annually if it's found that through work with a consultant or otherwise the contingencies are found to be too or perhaps too low that they can be adjusted annually only if you want them to as of as of right now the only thing that the conditions the standard condition for evaluating the bond or letter of credit over time is for inflation otherwise we say i mean and they so we have a an estimate right now of 39 million dollars that's based on full build out so the condition allows for a reduction based on final number of components but that's it not changing methods and typically we've specified the contingencies are maintained now i think it's um on the table if a re-evaluation is something council wants on some frequency yeah and so um so it's a little different but just so you know in umatilla county's development code um their lan their conditional use criteria for wind facility they have a set of criteria that's kind of similar to councils but it establishes that that decommissioning estimate has to be evaluated every",

        "text": " necessary in response to these plans or to these the department amended its recommended findings of fact to clarify the intent of the review and approval process established by the condition moving on to retirement and financial the certificate holder or commented and requested on the dpo that the bonding requirement imposed by condition 157 be amended to exclude the costs of repowering and replacing the existing and rely on the existing um condition 109 for those associated costs this change would narrow the scope of the bonding requirement uh of recommended condition 157 to only the new turbines and or the battery storage approved in the final order on amendment 6. based on council's review the certificate holder's comments and of the dpo council directed staff to remove condition 157 and incorporate the proposed changes into the existing condition 109 of the consolidation and unnecessary duplication of condition requirements so condition 157 was or removed this this is cindy khan and i'm not sure who can see me go ahead cindy um thank you and i hope this is an appropriate comment um chase can you go to page 21 of the proposed order there's something doesn't read or i'm i'm not reading it correctly or it doesn't read correctly to me is it here retirement and financial so yes and i'm looking at the proposed order on request for amendment six dated december 21st it's on mine it's all in okay yeah okay so starting with the sentence the certificate holder asserts that sentence does not read properly to me uh the certificate holder asserts that the existing bond requirements of condition 109 should be maintained okay and would continue to cover the cost of updating the existing turbines with blades and cells and now we're deleting because right is the bracket a deletion let me see if i can pull up my attachment i thought the bracket was deleting let's see but if it's not it then would read what you have should be correct so i would i don't know why it's not in red line here so mine okay let me pull up does the bracket not indicate a and the bracket because does the bracket not indicate a deletion so if you look at cost of updating the existing turbines with blades and nacelles then there's a bracket because the cost of updating and i interpreted that bracket as a deletion of language if it's it's going to remain i think it's fine but if it's deleted i don't think it reads properly pulling up my proposed order i don't know why the red line isn't showing up but let me get here okay oh yeah so here's yeah so it's the same here um at that so your question is is everything within does the confines of the bracket mean it's to be deleted yeah it's the it's the costs that are being decreased it's not the blades in the isn't it yeah yeah well maybe it reads okay read the whole thing certs and continue to cover i think it reads fine without it the phrase being deleted i just did i brackets always indicated deletion so okay well so for the record top corner it's not in strikeout it's being added i think oh yeah so sarah just included a comment it's quoted language from the certificate holder comment so it's it's proposed is that it's not being deleted it's not being deleted it's parenthesis yeah there we go okay yeah because here i guess yeah this is thanks why can't i do this this is their from their comment and so this was our addition to their statement yeah so it is to remain not to be council member content okay i guess i'm not understanding the purpose of their bracket then that's that's our own verbage incorporated into their their language theirs there's just said cost of updating the existing turbines with blades in the cells will decrease due to the decrease in weight so we added this additional explanation clarification found within the bracket okay i guess i'd suggest removing the bracket but um is the sentence structure question there because then it's not their quote um so brackets referencing the fact that we've inserted that in their quote for clarification okay so would you this is mercy so would you remove that in the final order i i i don't cindy i don't want to misinterpret but it feels like the brackets are leading to something that's not intended and then it's going to cause additional confusion so are they are they there now for our purpose of discussion and they'll be removed later no they're in there for clarification but if you wanted us to change the structure we could keep the quote as is remove the brackets and then follow up with a clarification sentence i think that would be appropriate and help avoid any indication that it's something different cindy it was your comment so i'll ask you to confirm yes i was um thinking that you could just have the quote then as it is and then say the department agrees that the you know the the cost will actually be decreased or whatever i'm so very clear that it's very clear that the department accepted the assertion did someone ask about a footnote yeah this is hanley can you do it as a just put a footnote after nacelle hi patrick i would suggest it be in the i mean i can we can workshop it right now and i can oops or me yeah it's up to you to me it it is a little it is a concern that the the certificate holder asserts which is um and if the department agrees with the assertion then state that yeah i think we can do that with a remove that and then have a sentence following the quote to clarify that so we can either we can do this one of two ways um we can either do that right now come up with some language or we i think we have your clear direction on that um and then we can just make that adjustment into the final order then we give to um chair grail for her signature either way is fine um it really is your discretion thank you i just i think the additional sentence would be clear okay thank you i just like to comment so clearly for anyone who ever wonders whether we read things people read so thanks for that uh clarification question cindy uh todd you have enough to move forward on your end i feel comfortable uh chase what page is that on because again i think that needs to be part of the motion language okay i'm just making notes um for potential motion language thank you okay chase ready keep going okay thanks back at it the last amended condition in the proposed order came in the waste minimization standard and the special advisory group commented on the existing condition 144 and requested that the condition be amended to require that the certificate holder or its third-party contractor be required to dispose of any waste or recycled materials and a licensed similarly henry davies and richard jolly on behalf of blue mountain alliance requested that council require the certificate holder to provide a waste manifest or chain of custody from the receiving disposal facility to ensure that the waste is disposed of at a licensed facility based on council's review of these comments um an amendment was made to existing condition 144 include that specifying waste and recycled materials was required to be received by a licensed facility so amendment to that condition was to specify that waste and recycled were required to be received by a licensed facility and that the certificate holder would need to or would be required to demonstrate that prior to construction and evaluation of practical practicable means for recycling turbine parts so that was the amended change to existing condition 144 based on comments and council's review with that that's my overview of the amended conditions in the proposed order and i think uh with that uh i would just leave with i guess i will now it's it's time for council's uh deliberation i suppose and i don't know if todd maybe you can provide me with guidance would would council member condon's comment flip our recommendation from option one to option two or would it still be option one in terms of the motion language oh wait sorry me sorry i was trying to work on the motion language um uh it would be option two already because of the language that's already been proposed to be changed okay well then with that the department recommends that uh council adopt the proposed order with modifications um and then grant issuance of an amended site certificate in adopt a final order which is option two now i'll hand it over to council for thank you chase yes first of all are there any questions or comments about jace's presentation hearing none uh and knowing that todd may have to help us with the for the modification is anyone prepared to make a motion this is cindy i'll give it a try all right uh cindy condon uh here and i move to approve the proposed order with modifications as discussed with respect uh retirement and financial assurance this is phil i second that motion so i'm gonna ask todd thank you phil i'm gonna hold up one second todd does that uh the cindy's work in terms of capturing what we need i really apologize i was still working on the language can you restate that i'm cindy would you be willing to do that again please i'm not sure it will be exactly the same better try uh cindy conde and i move to approve the proposed order with modifications as discussed here with respect to the retirement fight retirement and financial assurance uh obligations i believe there needs to be two uh one is is the one that you referenced and i can provide some specific language and two is the two mile county setback so that was recommended by staff but that was not in the um you know proposed order that was sent to so um i guess if you would indulge me um i can read what i have now and hopefully it makes sense um so proposed uh to approve the um proposed order as the final order with the following changes on page 20 of the proposed order uh the two changes proposed by staff to clarify the two-mile county mortal county setback to wind turbines is only applicable to the two new wind turbines as is already indicated in the findings in the land use section so that would cover the first one and then the second is on page 21 in sentence three of the retirement financial assurance first paragraph remove the language in brackets and create a sentence at the end of the paragraph to clarify staff's agreement with the site certificate holders assertion in does that work for you cindy yes um so we have our emotion and phil since you made the second does the motion still work for you to continue with your yes thank you thank you does anyone else have any questions comments on the motion hearing none mr secretary",

        "text": " and so could you relate that to some of these pictures as to what what's that look like yeah the uh and I'll let me go back just real quickly here a couple of the earlier slides that we showed uh oops I think um no we don't have right-of-way Woods on those but the right-of-way varies along the frontage here and that's sort of typical with both of these projects where we've had development occur we've had dedication um and in some cases um more dedication to the north side where we have those industrial properties and then on the south side we may have limit lesser width from the center line on the south side but we think that we have throughout the entire Corridor we think that we have 60 plus feet of right-of-way or will have with a limited amount of property acquisitions okay thank you and the second option that we looked at on Blanton and this is our recommendation is to construct the multi-use path of 14 foot wide multi-use path on the north side of the roadway and again if you'll remember that's the industrial side uh far fewer conflict points driveways on the North side so we think that's much more conducive to the facilitating the shared use path which would meet that Regional Trail requirement by being 14 feet wide it would also we think have room for a landscape buffer uh on street we would have two travel Lanes we're proposing to reduce those from 12 to 11 feet each and as I mentioned on the south side then we're proposing uh an on-street bike lane with a painted buffer and then a wider than typical sidewalk at an eight foot wide sidewalk if you count the width of the and then some additional space behind the sidewalk and one of the unusual features here is that we there's a PGE power distribution line on the south side of the roadway and so for safety reasons it's preferable to have those distribution poles behind the sidewalk as opposed to between the sidewalk and the roadway and so this helps facilitate those and one of the benefits we think of the sidewalk the seven foot sidewalk here given that this may be seen as something of a Regional Trail Corridor even for folks who may be on the south side of the street providing that a little bit wider cross-section would be helpful for them as their Traverse seeing this uh Corridor here and I should know too I mean you can see it I I was I neglected to mention it earlier but if you notice the on the East End closer to 198th Avenue we're showing an end of project that stops short of 198th Avenue the reason we're doing that is we're actually doing some analysis of alternatives for how to address uh the potential longer term improvements that would be made at the 198th Avenue intersection it's currently an offset plan street is offset there so we're analyzing are there different uh realignment options or improvements that could be made with the road remaining offset that would help manage longer term anticipated traffic growth there um and trying to be sensitive to property impacts on both sides of the I mean I have a question um you said the staff is recommending option two and I noticed that the bike lane is then is shared both in coming and going is that the on the on the multi-use path so there's a sidewalk and then there's a bike lane and the other side is there's the same on the other side it's just a multi-use path so the that multi-use path would accommodate both bicycle and pedestrian so it functions essentially like a Regional Trail with the standard now for a Regional Trail is a 14 foot wide pathway and so this is functioning in both bicycle and for both bicycle and sidewalk traffic and of course people who choose to ride on street can still ride on the street they have that legal right to do so and the other option is just a sidewalk into bike Lanes correct bike lane and a sidewalk on each lane right that would be the more approach to doing a roadway and if we weren't on on a corridor that had been identified as a potential Trail alignment this you'd probably be seeing something that looked more like this as a similar to this as a recommendation from us with a bike lane on both sides so just thinking ahead about about the trail future Trail and then capacity wise I'm not sure which is the best practice or a road that will have a trail is it best to have two bike Lanes versus multi-use or um I don't know that there's a particular best practice I think that uh you know with the 14 foot wide I want to click back to that option with the 14 foot wide Trail that's that's ample width for both bicycle and pedestrian traffic to be able to maneuver in that area and so we think that it's an appropriate facility selection we have other instances uh where a cross-section matching or very similar to this has been implemented or you essentially have the bike facility being shared and so a couple of examples of it are actually under construction right now on Tualatin Sherwood Road and Roy Rogers Road down in the Sherwood area will be implementing multi-use pass sorry phone multi-use versus like I can the picture you have is how I imagined but also I when I ride a bike I use this like I don't know like I think um are we funneling people bikers on the multi-use where then it's traffic or accidents things like that I don't know I'm just I not questioning the concept I'm just wondering is this like a best practice way of anybody who writes yeah I I would say this is not un unexpected for a cyclist to to be confronted with something like this as part of their writing route I don't know arrested you want to add something I was just gonna add um sorry the you know the TV Trail project did look at multiple Alternatives and this was kind of how they preferred to see the the trail come through here and the sort of you know the 14 feet wide is uh probably anywhere from two to four feet wider than the current multi-use pass we're building down on 12 Sherwood Road uh so you know people are starting to see those multi-use paths or around the county so they're probably a little more familiar with them you know I think some jurisdictions have actually striped one side for bikes of the multi-use path one side for Peds so you can avoid that kind of conflict um so uh yeah it's a good point so there may be some operational adjustments that could be made too to just help facilitate yeah channelizing if you will so if I could suggest that you've got about three or four more slides on Blanton talking about cost and quite frankly the cost differential is what drives my decision but I know what I peeked ahead but why don't we go ahead and finish up the discussion on Blanton and then we can come back absolutely and finish the conversation okay absolutely all right okay well uh and the Blanton project the this particular project that we're working on currently is a little bit early in the process but as I said we wanted to really bring It Forward in conjunction with the kinnamon road project which is uh moving ahead a little bit more quickly through the project development process and and really look at these two in Tandem and so uh what we have shared with you here as we talk about public input received really as as Russ was alluding to the engagement that was done during the TV Trail concept planning effort we had a fairly extensive public engagement um and and there's a list there I won't read all of that but we we had quite a few discussions there were a number of as Russ said different Alternatives that were evaluated and considered and those did include facilities with on-street bike Lanes or cycle tracks and a variety of different things and so the uh the outcome of all of that work was the preferred recommendation with the multi-use path uh was the was the result of that effort and some specific comments here and again I won't go through and try to read all of these they're in your packet there slide 23 but um you know there was just general appreciation for the fact that we would be getting some sidewalk and bike improvements on this roadway um typical concerns that we just hear you know people uh obviously concerned about uh bicycle and pedestrian safety and especially for their kids and um and then there was some concern as as noted about the number of conflicts that might be encountered on the south side because of the number of additional driveways and cross streets um typical concerns that we hear about any project just around property impacts and concerns vegetation trees and then currently on street parking so as we designate roadways with bike lanes that doesn't mean that you can't park there and so this would potentially eliminate on-street parking for some folks that may be parking uh on or adjacent to the street today and then generally against eating and traffic calming those are those are pretty typical concerns that we would uh that we would hear too and on Blanton Street with the development of South Hillsborough that the trips have increased on that roadway significantly so we think it's important that we are making bicycle enhancements on this roadway just and pedestrian enhancements to try to help improve the safety for those folks that are trying to Traverse that Traverse that project area so again the uh and I'll go ahead and Advance a little bit so the recommendation as I noted is option to the implementing that first imp uh chunk of the TV Trail concept and um again we have developed this set of criteria as a sort of consistent way as we're evaluating different projects to try to present that information to you and so we are typically looking at at these different criteria on a one to four scale this is not a super scientific but we do try to look at these uh objectively and and try to do our best assessment of uh how these different options score on these uh different outcomes and then down below in the blue rows uh you see that the cost estimate information and then the bottom row there is the projected ultimate cost so we are anticipating that there could be approximately a two hundred thousand dollar cost differential with the trail concept being just a little bit more expensive moving on so again just the recommendation re recapping the recommendation is the uh Trail option and maybe uh commissioner at this point I guess we could either open up for additional questions or discussion about Blanton or if you'd like us to we can go ahead and talk through the kinemen as well and then maybe",

        "text": " on to it that when writing this report also to consider market structure market design and operation that that is probably also key to um to the overall success of an rto now said that i i think what we need to really i fully agree number one that coordination amongst the larger set of groups and the transmission footprint on a broad geographical footprint does provide the opportunity to have optimization of the transmission built based on a much broader collective need definitely re-emphasize that whether you have an archer you don't have an rto the permitting challenges and the policies around it are still going to remain so that's again reinforce and re-emphasize that that doesn't change uh whether you go to an arc or you don't go to an rto the point around you know there was a lot of comments made around bonneville and i i agree on to some of them but in the last decade and we are reaching a saturation point you know if you're talking about next 20 years or so there may not be as much system capacity left but since 2012 or even a little before that bonneville has built several transmission lines has reinforced the system has enabled over 7 megawatt of clean energy resources has done optimized risk-based planning to avoid building uh over a billion dollar project along the i-5 corridor but at the same time also come up with some creative mechanisms to offer conditional firm and and our conditional firm uh has been working fairly good this year this year itself we offered more than 1.5 gigawatt of conditional firm service the the challenge that we are still missing and we're missing the point is it's not so much on the transmission that you're facing the channel the challenge that bonneville faces and the rq will face also is on the localized when you have renewables and the generation trying to interconnect on 69 and 115 kb system where the system was never built to integrate hundreds and thousands of megawatts it requires major reinforcement uh along the along those renewable trying to come on the coastal the system there was was built as a delivery that come to the load but never as a supply side key things to remember is that the transmission planning has worked it may not be situated well enough to deal for the next 20 30 years out in the future for various reasons already noted but transmission planners have and planning has done fairly well but the challenges are more not on the network but more on the localized grid and the other thing is that i want to point out is that we always plan the system based on a 10-year planning horizon and and the build of a transmission takes longer than 10 years for all the points that have already been made however if you start planning based on a longer planning horizon as fork has been uh pushing for in their it possess presents a new challenge if we were prep we have to plan for 30 years and had we done that 30-year planning 30 years back we would have been building for gas projects not for renewables we would have made investments in gas projects uh transmission lines to enable gas energy into the to the loads which would have been in different parts of the system then where the the the markets are going where the future is going towards fleet energy so we have to generate a balance we can't just blindly say that the transmission planning is broken and rt will solve it we have to realize that there are multitude of complexity that rely that rests within the planning process and the planning process is not just the only thing if you look at the full value chain it's the planning it's the permitting it's the designing and the cost associated with the designing and and having a reliable operation you have to look at the full value chain and you have to balance it across not just the supply side which is where a lot of the focus remains you have to balance it against the demand side and make sure that the demand is there if the demand is for six gigawatt you're not going to plan on the supply side for 60 gigawatt because that imbalance will create a lot of transmission and a lot of stranded investment and extremely high rates so the balance is what the key message that i want to and get resulting spencer made some really good points and so did uh fred and and others so i will not repeat but thank you all right thank you robbie and everyone so i'll give uh you know i want to move on with the agenda but i'll get one last opportunity if you have a brief response to any of the last few comments particularly those who who haven't had a chance to speak up yet give you a moment now to speak up before we move on and while we're while we're waiting there for a moment uh we've had amira streeter from the governor's office join us as well as mary pleasant uh from deq i'm not sure if either either wants to introduce themselves but um feel free to take a moment to say hello yes i'll go ahead and jump in thank you adam um hi everyone my name is amira streeter i'm the new climate energy and transportation policy advisor happy to be here this morning uh sorry for being late i had a couple of technical difficulties but have been here for the majority of the discussion very good discussion um as i step into this role i'm sure i will have to learn a lot and i really appreciate everyone giving their perspective and i have to um i'll have to leave it at 10 a.m today but um looking forward to joining you in the future for these meetings great thank you for joining us um hi i'm mary pleasant can you hear me okay yeah i joined earlier by phone and couldn't figure out during roll call how jump in i'm here and it's just this has been really been um i feel like i'm more in the learning seat here so some of these presentations early on have been really really helpful for me to frame the contacts and yeah anyways i appreciate able to listen in all right glad you could join us all right uh well thank you all that was a great discussion um lots of good information there um now let's move on question number seven on renewables so again similar to the to the last uh discussion um really asked a question here about uh sort of implications on how renewable development from rto formation would be or would not be preferable to the status a lot of different sort of sub topics here on types and locations of purple implications distributed energy resources manufacturing potential and oregon jobs so i'll run through these again real quick and get us to the discussion slide general feedback so state policy state policy will likely drive significant new development of clean energy resources with or without an rto i think we all see that transmission access one counter described transmission access as a significant barrier to the development of some renewables and then rto could help by sharing the cost of new transmission necessary to bring renewables to load resource agnostic this came up from about the need for a well-run rto to be resource agnostic and objectively value the energy and non-energy attributes that a resource can deliver reduced curtailments uh commenters expect that an rto would ensure fewer renewable resources are curtailed geographic diversity a regional rto should allow oregon customers to benefit more from high quality renewable resource areas such as wind in the intermountain states adverse impacts one commenter identified a potential cost burden on oregon customers they could accrue from quote many small renewable facilities adversely impacting system operations you know i'll do here i will uh try to keep an eye on the hand raised function since i've now found it if you if you have a bernie feedback on particular item here before we get to the discussion slide feel free to shoot your hand up and i will uh call on you adam um i just have a question about that the adverse impacts that could accrue from many small renewable facilities is that if an archaea if oregon utilities join an rto there could be an impact for many small renewable facilities i'm not really understanding what the concern is you know i i believe that was the concern that was being conveyed i'm wondering if the impact is that there's a lot of small projects instead of big ones and that that would cost more or if this is a citing concern or issue i'm not sure if anyone on the committee wants to speak to that issue we can also note it for later and i can uh we can bring it up in the discussion uh types of locations of renewables offshore wind so this was uh brought up by several commenters uh belief that rto would benefit the development of oregon's offshore wind which would require significant investment in generation and and identified at least one recent technical study that found the same solar rto formation may impact solar development but different views were shared on this one view oregon has vast solar resources in parts of the state that are currently underserved by iou transmission systems that could benefit from increased access enabled by an rto but another view was that our fuel formation would likely result in less solar being developed in oregon i think the uh argument there being that stronger solar resources in other parts of the west uh would instead be developed in lieu of oregon solar no impact other commenters suggested that rto formation would be unlikely to impact the types of renewables developed in oregon in location the location of renewable development can be significantly impacted by transmission access or lack thereof and the cost of that transmission on customers is an important consideration and rto may identify the most efficient upgrades needed to deliver renewables uh purpa lots of feedback on purple implications multiple commenters flagged ferc order they recently lowered the mandatory purchase obligation on utilities for renewable qfs from 20 to 5 megawatts but also noted that the basis for this change was that non-discriminatory non-discriminatory market access afforded by rto energy markets um and that this is something uh critical consideration during rto design existing qfs a note about this that came by multiple commenters the utilities have existing legally enforceable obligations to purchase power from some qfs and that would continue those agreements would be honored for their duration irrespective of rto formation retail rates one utility commenter asserted that it currently pays quote far more for generation from purple projects than for average market such that limitations on utility qf obligations from joining",

        "text": "ations provided that there is um there aren't any constraints on on the trend or failures on the transmission system north to south along the coast that power should go to the coast um and the coast should see a direct benefit and that's kind of uh you know i think the system operators have to keep that in mind you know to make sure that you know the coast can be served reliably and and but the benefits are are system-wide i mean everyone benefits it's not like i know that's that's a common question it's not just the coastal folks get the benefit or just the i5 folks get the benefit i mean it's been it's a it's kind of a rising tide you know we we all benefit from it and um but there are some acute power quality benefits that would be experienced near where the interconnections happen so that is a bit different in terms of you know um some things i mentioned in power quality so the to the the the stability of frequency and voltage you know you know along the coast particularly in radial extensions on the coast where maybe they're down down the road on a 115 kv line and it's somewhat un unreinforced i mean i think everybody's power quality is pretty good but it could be better potentially with with coastal generation it might make the the job of the system operator utility a bit easier um in some ways not at all but uh in terms of the other benefits um you know that really we all get them and uh it's just a matter of of building out the infrastructure the transmission infrastructure to make sure there are constraints and things held up along the along the line so to speak yeah i'll just add i agree with everything travis said about the way the regional grid works um but that there are some interesting ideas just um around sort of design characteristics that might involve some complementary battery storage or other sort of design characteristics that might help with more local resiliency that you know if a specific project was proposed could explore um there's a few other comments in the chat that i'm going to review um i'm going to go to kathy and then shawn to break it up a bit so go ahead kathy okay um yeah i had i had to concern first of all thank you on your slide 53 for putting in the megawatts as well as making us try to figure out how to get from volts to capacity so which the bomb charts never never did that but you know i am concerned about the fact original charts showed assume that you could use the full length of oregon for for your transmission but then they cut their call areas down to just a very to basically getting to two of them and so i was disconcerted when bob was asked about that in one of their meetings saying well that's a state issue um so i'm hoping there's going to be communication between odo and all those other groups and boom before they actually go out with something that can't be met the other thing that and this is one that might help with the the uh on the on the coast for for you know worker development um hp 3375 included specifically generating hydrogen with excess um but also you know the more we see the difficult um situation you're wearing from the ipcc the more it seems like getting involved with direct air capture is something and that's one that could also use a lot of renewable energy in order to operate so that could be done right on the coast so that might be a consideration of what what can be used locally to use excess yeah that's a great point um hydrogen is sometimes considered a form of storage it's a it's a great point coffee yeah no i mean that definitely that's in and and as i said that was included you know brock smith included in his bill um but but the direct air capture is one i haven't seen that being considered and and i think that that's the sooner we can get that online the better off we're going to be that's great thanks thanks so much kathy i'm not sure if um anyone from baum is on the line this time but you're welcome to add to the chat um uh colleagues from boehm if you wanted to um have a little bit more or provide a little bit more information on the call areas my sort of basic recollection is um boom did consider you know sort of the areas with the best wind resource and that um to explore in a call what developer interest is but um you know call areas could come further north in time sort of an ongoing process as far as i understand today i'm going to go to sean next go ahead first i want to say thank you for the presentation it helps clear from my mind what i've a disconnect i've been having with respect to um where the call areas are that volume is moving forward with versus the amount of capacity that the indicative study was identifying may be available in the in the system today and so that helps helps me understand that you looked at the entire coast and not just the southern oregon coast with respect to where potential um resources may connect so that's pretty helpful um i you know and i i don't i definitely don't want to be a wet blanket here i just want to try and caution everybody that um you know understanding that economic dispatch and pcm studies are are a bit of a different animal than the reliability studies that the transmission planners for these for the transmission providers to reach the coast and understand pg e is not one uh you know we don't have any lines that that go over to the to the coast and and so you know while we'll be involved in the regional context you know we we don't have the expertise in those areas um you know we'll need to get pacific war in bonneville uh heavily involved and and but i just want everybody to understand that those reliability studies are going to be critical to understanding what is actually able to you know potentially interconnect in those areas so uh just you know hopefully everybody keeps that in the back of their mind as we as we move forward there there is you know some potential we just don't know exactly what what that is yet and then the second thought i'll i'll leave with is you know just to sort of uh uh leave everybody with the understanding that there's been a an economic study request presented to northern grid um which is the regional transmission planning organization and uh some more work will be developed there and in just an informal conversation that i've had with with with our neighbors uh bpa pacificorp um there is definitely an intent on studying it i know both pge and pacific it sounds like are are likely going to consider it in terms of the irp processes so we'll understand what the resource uh uh can mean in terms of load service um uh but additionally there's you know there's lots of discussion around you know the actual transmission providers who serve the coast uh you know performing some of these these analysis and these studies to really drive into uh what the system is capable of today what it would mean in terms of flows etc so i just want to make those comments and i appreciate the time and you know i thank everybody for doing the work i you know uh i think this is this is very good information on could potentially be great for for the state of oregon so that's great sean um thanks for sharing i'm going to turn it over to adam for a response yeah thanks john and you uh you took my punchline a little bit i was going to respond to this flag for folks that um we did last week with the puc submit a request to northern grid um to do exactly some of that kind of analysis so and i know jason has slides on it coming up later so look forward to have a chance to preview a little bit of that because i know i'm not sure that many folks on the call are aware of it thanks adam and i know we have some slides on that study coming up in the next section um a couple other things from the chat that i wanted to make sure we called out in case you're on the phone and reminder for those on the phone that you can press star 3 to raise your hand in star 6 to mute or unmute um there were some comments about earthquakes from mike from earthquakes about are one factor in evaluating transmission vulnerability at the coast those factors are earthquakes and tsunamis as well and and some discussion about vulnerability of store-based infrastructure needing to operate and maintain floating offshore wind should be considered in terms of mitigating vulnerability of the east-west transmission system and then mike also commented that yesterday a dutch offshore wind turbine came apart and triggered a no sail zone for vessels in the area and was wondering if evaluation of risk and vulnerability considerations on unintended unintentional failures of a floating offshore wind facility might compromise power supply and other economic activities thanks for that question mike i don't know if our study will go into that level of detail i wasn't aware of the dutch offshore wind turbine so thanks for for sharing that um there's a couple of questions in the chat about links to uh various studies that travis uh mentioned i'll just note for everyone that slide 57 and 58 has a pretty good list of references uh with links in it that you can click on using the pdf version of the slide deck on our and just to jump in richie the 2021 reference that i think is throwing some through me too when i was trying to think about answer the question that's just a publication of the 2020 work so it's not a different study there's a study in 2020 which we did in our you we we put out there through boehm and then through pnnl technical report literature and then we took it to a peer-reviewed journal in 2021 and now we have a new study that launched late 21 early 22 on the southern oregon northern transmission then maybe to the the to mike's question about the the failure of um you know any single generator i mean the way floating officer win will have to comply with the the same requirements of any generator so you know if a natural gas plant fails it might be you're right that there are different you know it's not failing in the ocean and maybe it doesn't create a no sales zone so that that piece is different but in terms of the power system um and that piece should should be considered of course but in terms",

more about that in a minute but just wanted to acknowledge that and then David you are off you yes thank you and this is yeah this is the chart that I was interested in going back to because um I seem to remember from the guidance that these are the maximum levels set in statute right but if the state wanted to modify these the state could modify these which there might be programmatic reasons for doing that like the you know the $4,000 for electric load service center maybe through discussion with contractors you know maybe that one should be a little less to save money for some of the other things that get done because if it is 4,000 then the cost of doing an electric load service center is probably going to be 4,000 for somebody who's income qualified right um just want not to add more work will on all the things that you're working on but in terms of I know that it is a flexibility for the state you can't adjust these up but if you wanted to adjust any one particular one down or more because you thought that the prices in our Marketplace um would align with that there is the possibility to do that which could leave more money on the table for other other items yeah absolutely and thanks for flagging that David and um that is something we are aware of and I think a piece of our decision- making will be doing that Statewide market research to understand if all of these are appropriate um I'll also note that our hope would be that um maybe optimistic but that the rebate amount doesn't always go to you know that we're not always at the maximum amount of the rebate and that if it is below $4,000 we will be below $4,000 with the rebate as well but I appreciate you flagging that and that's definitely a option that we have as a state as we're designing the program this conversation has got two hands up so we'll go to them in a second and then we'll get back on track after those two and then I'm going to ask one quick question I think from the chat which is that are there technology efficiency minimums for the qualified products yeah so there are um qualified products that that I believe are that meet a certain minimum and then as a state we have the option to potentially make a stricter minimum for that so that's another program design decision right now the US doe references the energy star website um in their frequently asked questions page for available Technologies for the rebate program but the final decision on uh specific eligibility or Appliance standards will be part of our decision at the state level great and then we'll go to pra and Rachel and then we'll get back on track because I really just decided to take us off track without asking anyone first so um but such good information so glad to have it but Pera you're up thanks again christe you really appreciate it you know I think uh we believe at Samsung that consumers would benefit from having the choice of picking which of the allowed Technologies they would like to meet the 14,000 cap for here uh the law we think is clear on what a qualified electrification project is and it includes any of the eight categories in in here and um really I think it's critical that state programs be consistent and comprehensive on the eligible categories so that retailers and manufacturers can effectively educate consumers on the home rebate program uh so I really wanted to communicate this point uh while we were on this slide so apologies for uh for having to jump in here again but thank you no no it's great no I welcome it I just feel bad for well that I went off agenda so bad um and then Rachel go thank you for the opportunity um I'm just curious I hadn't really thought about this but and I wanted to confirm one thing and then ask a question is the um here program uh the the funding that's available for this spread out over a certain time period is it five years or or something like that what's that yeah it's eight eight years of the funding is available for okay gotcha and so I guess on that on that so understanding it's an eight-year time period um these the maximums that and they're going to remain the maximums for the whole eight-year period so there's no is there any adjustment in here for annual inflation or cost increases in the market that we might see between now and whatever eight years from now is because that that these will become not um not as usable right with as as each year progresses they um they will not meet up with the actual cost of yeah that's an excellent question um my understanding is that would probably be an option for us doe or that would probably require us doe to revise the program guidelines at the federal level um and I am not aware of that being mentioned in the guidelines currently um but that is a very good question and something we can bring up with them specifically thank you right so um as we get back to the slide we were getting ready to move on to I'll bring up a couple things that came up in the chat um in the meantime we did have a last um a last piece on income verification saying to keep it out of contractor or landlord's hands use a third party for verif verification as a comment from my very own contractor and also a PF staffer um and then another contractor agreed um and then um someone else just said getting an accurate income number will be important for those folks that are near the the kind of qualifying not deadline but limit and then um we have I'm GNA go ahead and ask this question to everybody and then I'll get into a couple of other well oh gosh a lot just happened in the chat in the last like minute so let's do this um we got some questions about like how we plan on expending the funds so would it would it be okay to talk about that for a second well yeah I saw those questions on if this is going to all be available up or them how do we kind of is it first come first sered do you expect them to last more than a year even if there is eight years could it go faster yeah so I'll say um in in response to I think Jeremy's question about the different kind of challenges that might be involved with that I think that that's a program design decision is how um whether or not we want to reserve specific amounts year-over-year and so that's something we're very open to feedback on I will say the way the US Department of energy is delivering these this funding to States um there are separate tranches of funding um that are released once a certain previous requirement is met so for example I believe one of them you've met 20% of low-income targets you get the subsequent amount of funding and that really isn't particularly relevant for this discussion other than the US Department of energy does space it out but it's not a year-by-year equal split of the total funding so hopefully that makes sense yeah um so kind of related well related to this there was a flag that um in general we might consider offering a larger number of smaller dollar incentives in order to provide a more stable program and that in thinking about the end of the program like if you slowly lower the incentives over time it might help um with the sort of Cliff kind of effect of the the rebate just ending and that being harmful to contractors so just raising that idea um and then we have someone saying energy certified products dis clay differ wildly in efficiency so some thoughts there A's pointing out that the dollar amounts are written into statute so it would require an act of Congress to change that and then um Jennifer hi Jennifer wanting to note that standards should align with BPA to allow for braiding and coou territory which is definitely something we're tracking and working to figure out um and then we have uh just a comment oh maybe this is okay someone's moved on to the slide yay such a great great moment um so the question you've all already read um here allows for rebates on a variety of appliances including electric heat pumps heat prump water heaters electric stoves heat prump cloth dryers weatherization measures and electric WI and Breakers which of these Technologies may be most beneficial to lowincome communities and um Nancy thank you has said she thinks Health induction would be really helpful to low-income communities and from a cost perspective heat pump hbac which um hbac is 55% of household energy use and then their second question here is Appliance replacement often occurs in emergency situations like when a furnace stops working in the winter must be replaced how can he here equip contractors to deliver Efficient Electric appliances in these situations so open for any thoughts on these two questions in the chat or with your hand up Zach thinks heat pump hot water also which is half of heating energy yeah and maybe I'll also note um so you may recognize this question from last week if you attended um and there was good conversation at that point I think um heat pump hot water heaters or heat pump water heaters we brought up a lot as um a technology that could have benefits particularly when we talk about Bill impacts so thank you and induction stoves for health got A plus one from Doug and then we can go to praya with their hand up you're off thanks again chrisy appreciate being able to in again you know I think as I mentioned earlier for reasons I stated uh we think all eight categories uh should be given rebates did really want to highlight induction cooking products how fast an induction cooking product can boil water twice as fast uh it's just outstanding uh putting less stress on the home agback system of an induction cooking product is another critical aspect uh instant temperature control ease of cleaning improved compared to non-induction are among some of the many benefits and uh energy star recently developed an electric cooking product specification and since here requires energy star if applicable only Energy Star Electric cooking product should receive the rebates in r view and so just wanted to weigh in with that as well thank you Ken great thank you so much um just somebody did did by the way point out that they thought induction could require some education for folks that get that and uh another thought in the chat",

        "text": " both up here and I guess I would start by just asking whether you have any questions about what you've heard on this first one maybe I'll read it at this time just to put Orient us the exception from the county is that the proposed facility would not pass through more than three zones including Umatilla counties the pcco I'm finding a fact number 12 to the contrary is wrong and is not supported by substantial evidence the record does not support the pcco findings that conclude that the UEC Cottonwood transmission line is a related or supporting facility to the proposed wind and solar energy this is uh characterized as a finding a an exception to a finding a fact to provide that orientation alsoever buyer thank you chair Grail um just a quick question we have six exemptions under this and several of them are dependent on whether or not we find that the setback is an applicable um yeah so if we can Tee It Up to sort of think if we find that it is not an applicable standard do we need to make explicit findings on the individual exceptions I guess is my question does that make yeah this is complicated material um and I think that maybe what would serve as well as sort of an orientation is to kind of start by looking at the statute together for a minute and then I'll try to place the exceptions uh into sort of the proper context okay so I'm I'm looking um really they're the same but I'm looking at them at this one um which presents 469-504 and just you know at the highest level I think it's uh worth kind of revisiting that the you know proposed facility I'm reading the very first sentence under subsection one shall be found in compliance with Statewide planning goals and then initially right there there are a the facility has received local land use approval that's one path that an applicant can take that is not the path that the applicant took here sub B uh the other path to compliance with Statewide planning goals is if the council determines that and here we have another fork in the road the a if the council determines that the facility complies with applicable substitute criteria from the affected local governments acknowledge comp plan and land use regulations that are required by the Statewide planning goals and in effect on the date of the application is submitted um that is the sort of gonna stop there because that's this essence of it that is one way for the council to conclude that uh or you know the the council's conclusion that the facility complies with applicable substantive criteria meets this statutory provision here the hearings officer the alj concluded that the Criterion three of Umatilla counties is not an applicable substitute criteria and this is what you've already considered in groupings one and two essentially and that the project can be found the council can find that the project does mean applicable substantive criteria it's uh just that because Criterion 3 was not required by Statewide planning goals it is not among those okay so that is the the first path that you've already considered then we go to B uh the other path through the council is to determine that for an energy facility or related supporting facility that must be evaluated against the applicable substitute criteria pursuant to sub five that the proposed facility does not not comply with one or more of the applicable substantive criteria but does otherwise comply with the applicable Statewide planning goals and here the hearings officer approach was to say even if we were to assume that Criterion 3 uh were an applicable substitute criteria this project can be analyzed here under this large B provision because it of the language in subsection five and by analyzing it under the subsection B the council May conclude that even though it may not comply with that Criterion three it does otherwise comply with the applicable Statewide planning uh the hearings officer order as well as the proposed ordered do analyze you know with and you probably saw this in reviewing the materials the Statewide planning goals and and the question about whether they require this Criterion and concluded that did not so I just want to look at subsection five because it is that is sort of the hook for this second path to be the council's other finding and the relevant language I believe begins sort it's not highlighted but it begins if the special Advisory Group recommends so I I would say that um the most important language starts here if the special Advisory Group recommends applicable substantive criteria for an energy facility or a related or supporting facility that passes through more than one jurisdiction or more than three zones in any one jurisdiction the council shall review the recommended criteria and determine whether to evaluate the proposed facility against the criteria recommended by the group against Statewide planning goals or against a combination and making this determination the council shall consult with this special Advisory Group and consider a number of factors so in the hearings officers proposed contested case order there's a fair amount well it was agreed with odo's initial proposed order which includes the reasoning to support consideration of all of those factors it also includes reasoning that supports the the path B um approach and I don't know if anyone has any questions about all of that it's just to pause for a minute so I think that for purposes of revisiting the exceptions um the important thing to note is that this finding of fact that the county raises an exception to is relevant to the question of this uh path B subsection five um alternative way for the council to find that the project complies um you know with regard to the uh the fact you know you've seen what what was considered by the hearings officer and the hearings officers conclusions you've heard from the county and I guess the question becomes whether you're have will go through the first sort of quasi-straw poll on this one of whether you are inclined to accept or reject this first exception on the finding effect the buyer why my brain hurts a bit but um but so we have um a finding in the pcco that says no this is not an applicable substantive criteria we also have findings that say even if it is a substantive criteria the applicant has demonstrated that the project can meet the other Statewide planning goals exactly okay and then I get a little fuzzy when we get to this um but for if it crosses more than three zones do we have to go there um and and uh hearings officer did but um if we if there are findings to support the other two Alternatives or or structures to get to this is how we're evaluating this do we have to make a determination on that issue um so I think that the the best way to frame that is that you know you get to ask yourself whether it be if proposed contested case order as presented is something you're comfortable with or if something here you know seems to suggest that there's a reason for a change um the the question for this particular exception about the uh the three zones I think what I will do to sort of Orient us all is read something that's kind of a reminder from this is actually the Oregon Supreme Court save our Rural Oregon decision and I think because we're lucky enough to have an Oregon Supreme Court opinion regarding the Landy standard that addresses what the council's role in particular is that just to put that context here and then come back to this so and this is in the um proposed contested case order at page 25 the passage that I'm reading from um and what it says that I think is important for the council to keep in is uh in short I'm going to start halfway through the quote the Statewide land use planning goals establish broad policy objectives well the applicable substantive criteria provides specific ways of implementing those objectives through local regulation because the local criteria are often more specific than the goals an application for a site certificate may fail to meet the local criteria but still meet the goals rs-469-504-1b Big B allows a comprehensive inquiry that requires the council to determine compliance with the most specific criteria that it can local applicable substantive criteria nowhere possible findings of compliance with the Statewide planning goals in the alternative and exceptions to the goals if necessary that scheme is consistent with the overall land use planning structure in Oregon So within that context the subsection 5 provides that where a project reaches a certain level of complexity um essentially you know if it's in more than one jurisdiction or the project overall is going to cross through multiple zones to a point where the legislature wanted to give the council uh the option in the in the case where it's reviewing projects of that complexity to consider compliance through one of a few different paths and what the hearings officer what the department and then the hearings officer um concluded was that that here because the project overall and you know this is where you know the the my sense is that if the hard work has been done regarding the facts this is your opportunity to ask questions about it but you know I'm not gonna question the conclusions reached if the overall project is you know a more complex project it crosses more than three zones and you know there are these different questions about related supported facility I think that my sense is the hearing officer got that right the LJ got it right as to what should be considered a related supporting facility but that that because of that the path of this subsection B where the council has the discretion to say okay even if this project may not comply and we'll assume even though the the prior finding was the Criterion through was not an applicable criteria even if it is this project can be found to comply with the landing standard because it complies with Statewide planning goals the council could even do a hybrid but here I think unless you've heard something today that makes you concerned that the Statewide planning goals require you know something that you know the project you know the the if you were to conclude and this is where Council for um you know did a good job of setting up if you were to conclude that this setback requirement is required by Statewide planning goals that would support you know a finding of of non-compliance because ultimately that is the test that is the standard is there compliance with Statewide planning goals the alj concluded that Statewide planning goals do not require the setback like the Supreme Court said counties can be more specific but essentially the council's role is to you know try to comply with the most detailed you know sensitive criteria but then there are there is the path where ultimately if it meets the Statewide planning goals that is a path of compliance okay so here with context this is why you see that the proposed contested case",

        "text": "all right hi folks hi is somebody online if you can hear me now i know i can hear you chris excellent thanks todd okay uh i will back up a second i my apologies to anybody joining us through the webinar so even better uh so i my name is chris clark i'm a signing analyst with the oregon department of energy and work for the energy facility society council um i'm joined by sarah asterson chase big bay walker and then we're joined by our applicants uh jeff fox and joe bortleson are going to give a quick round i gave a quick round of introductions so i'm going to give a quick overview of the energy facility sighting process uh then we'll have the applicant provide a quick overview of the proposed facility in the project and then at the end here we'll have a question and answer uh session and that will be open to both people here in the room and online uh and again apologies for the technical difficulties there um so the proposed facility is a 1.25 gigawatt solar photo tip will take power generation facility uh that would also have up to seven and a half gigawatts hours of distributed battery storage uh and that would all be located on a site of approximately uh ten thousand 900 acres for 17 square miles of predominantly cultivated efu land here in morrow county um the applicant is episode llc which is a whole young subsidiary of pine bay renewables and the applicant will again be giving a more in-depth presentation here in a minute of all this so uh as i mentioned uh so we as the signing division our staff to the energy facility site and council um and before anybody can construct or operate a large energy facility in oregon they must first obtain a site certificate from the um that council is a volunteer a body made up of seven just volunteer citizens um that are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the senate um and they are uh appointed basically with their sole function of reviewing and improving these large energy projects all right the council to do that review the council adopts standards to ensure that the siting construction operation retirement of facilities is consistent with the protection of public health and safety and that it complies with the protection of complies with oregon's energy land use and environmental protection i'll go through what those standards are in just a second and then as i mentioned the sighting division at the oregon department of energy uh are staffed to the council um and we also facilitate a lot of the review process so you'll get notices from us we will be the ones accepting public comments and then we'll also be the ones attracting the draft proposed order and later proposed order so you will hear a lot from us but any decisions that are made are made by the council itself and i am trying to speak loudly just because we're not using application today but if anybody's having trouble hearing me or or as questions come up just feel free to raise it yet and i can stop um okay so to issue a site certificate uh the council must determine uh basically three questions uh one that the facility complies with all applicable council standards um or the overall public benefit of that facility outweighs any adverse effect on a resource or interest protected by the standards that the facility does not mean so uh we call that balancing uh certain standards cannot be balanced so uh in general the facility uh doesn't play with some in some cases they may uh show make a show mean that there's a public benefit uh but for certain um uh more sensitive standards that that option does not exist and so can you think of anything off the head of what those standards are um so and then the other thing besides reviewing for the council's own uh the uh council will review for compliance with any other organ laws and rules that are related to the sighting of the um that are identified in what's called the project order and part of the reason we're having this meeting today is to get input on uh what all those additional requirements might be uh to help us write the project order um as part of that we've also reached out to all of our other sister state agencies that have subject matter expertise over issues related to society such as the oregon department of fish and wildlife the oregon land conservation development and several others there are some areas where the council doesn't have that would include anything that's federally delegated so we don't uh necessarily look at uh water quality permitting or um air quality germany and those are things that that will certainly be affected by the construction of the large energy facility but it's just because that's part of a federally delegated program it's not something that we specifically review for compliance um and then finally another big part of our review process is reviewing to see if the facility complies with the statewide uh planning ladies planning uh and there's a process here where we coordinate with the morrow county board of commissioners which has been appointed as the special advisory group for this project um that i will go in a little bit more piece i don't know how that works now but um the county is responsible for recommending what local ordinances and land use regulations apply to the review of this facility um so we're not just applying things at a state level we are also looking at local laws and ordinances that apply as so as i mentioned the council review process is generally a standards-based the council has adopted uh standards related to the the issues that are shot on the screen above me those include things like organizational expertise uh the council will look at geological hazards at the site soil protection to mention land use um the council will review for different kinds of impacts on protected areas or important scenic uh resources or recreation opportunities uh and the council will also review um for to make sure that the facility uh is consistent with the state's wildlife habitat policy and that it won't have significant impacts on any rather endangered species um in a little bit separately we'll do a review for impacts to historic cultural and archaeological resources um that typically happens in coordination with the state historic preservation office and also oregon's nine federally recognized tribes uh i do want to just point out that on uh this past friday the council had offered a new standard related to wildfire uh prevention and risk um so that will be part of the review process for this project um and basically the council is making sure that any applicant has sort of adequately characterized the wildfire or a scatter site so what the the probability of the facility itself causing wildfire but also what hazards they might be if a wildfire from their kind comes into the site and and what that means for first responders um or other uh resources that may be located close and uh we will also be yeah looking at uh things like public impacts of public services and um the wastes that may be generated uh during construction operations or retirement at the site as well uh so that's kind of a mouthful but that is generally uh the scope of standards that we'd be reviewing i want to say there are some things like uh aviation or military impacts that like i said are included in our review of applicable laws in standards or maybe kind of included through our coordination with other uh state and federal agencies um that aren't listed here by our so when we're doing these review uh when we're doing these impact reviews uh we typically set analysis areas which is the kind of geographic scope of impacts that we think may be caused by this facility um what i have up on the screen here is the study areas so in the notice of intent which is uh like i said the first document that's kind of provided in this process um there are kind of mandatory study areas that we get general information um and that includes information about land use impacts and fish and wildlife impacts uh that go out about half a mile uh and then we have impacts to recreation and threaten endangered species that go out to five miles uh impacts to scenic resources and uh public services that go out to ten miles and then impacts to protected areas and especially visual impacts to protected areas like a national park or um a wilderness area or wildlife areas which i think are uh in this particular study area um we would go out to 20 miles and one of the things that we are asking is we ask our redundant agency partners for coming on and any of you are welcome to comment on as well is whether or not these distances are appropriate or whether they should be um in some cases we will expand them if there's sensitive resources that we think might be impacted outside of these we can also treat them in if we don't identify any uh potential resources or we think that the impacts of the facility just won't extend that bar um so part of this review process is really making sure that the scope of the analysis that we're requiring the applicant to provide in their full application is supervised okay so for land use the applicant typically has two uh paths they can either seek locally and use proof of themselves or they can make the ask the council to make a landing's determination for them uh in this case the avenue has indicated that they intend to seek it councils and use so how that will look is that the applicant will provide information about compliance with any applicable global substantive criteria identified by the county in their occupation and then the council will review that uh the council will also be um reviewing the potential for a land use exception uh since this um this project is located on farmland a what we call a full degree exception uh will likely be required um as i mentioned before the memorial county board of commissioners has been appointed as a special special advisory group for this project um and uh we will be working with them to determine what exactly the criteria and global ordinances that apply i won't go through the entire process in detail but i did just want to point out that we are at the very beginning of this process now so we've received the notice of intent uh and we are currently coordinating with our reviewing agencies and we're collecting and reviewing all public say the speed times but we're accepting public comments until august 5th so we have another week if you want to provide anything in writing once we have received all the comments and we've gotten all the information we need from our sister agencies we will write the project order um which will set out the full study requirements and legal requirements for the and then the application is really the the the full piece of evidence that contains kind of all the in-depth analyses that",

        "text": " final project equipment might differ uh slightly from what was proposed in the application uh however I do want to point out that because these projects are competitively reviewed uh if you are awarded uh we will be looking at uh that final uh during a performance agreement or that final assessment of a project that the project and the components are substantially similar to what was proposed in the project if uh if it's not then that is something that could have impacted your competitive review in an earlier stage so just wanted to make quick note of that I don't clay I don't know if you have anything to add there um no the The Fallout of that could come up in the final determination of eligible costs for your reimbursement for your Grant distribution so that's the warning there right right excellent point uh as we uh keep moving through on these key app questions in section six uh we come to another one that's a bit of a compound question um this is uh please detail a resource assessment demonstrating adequate resource supply for the proposed system operations the resource assessment must describe a the type of resource or resources available B explain how the applicant evaluated the resource and see how the system will access the resource and again just as a quick tip you're writing this to reviewers who are assessing this the easiest way for them to disseminate this information from the question is in that compounded format the a through C in addition for this round we have also produced uh the resource assessment guide which you'll find under the applicant help tab on the crap webpage so definitely use that as a resource prior to filling out the application I think it'll give you some details of what we would be looking for and uh clay what would you like to add here yeah so another this is a great place for us to remind folks because normally this is a question that will have supporting documentation with it um you know assessments of of the power produced and things like that so put put all the information in the text box in the online application and then clearly name and reference your supporting documentation so also in that text box and then you will upload the document that has that matching name that you put in the text box as an uploaded document so that way all the reviewers can quickly match an answer in the online application with the downloaded document that you've provided and the names match and the question numbers match and things like that so it makes the review possible they cannot review information that they cannot find and that can affect your score um this resource assessment is lumped in with the strength of project so it's part of all of the things that that have a maximum value of 45 out of 100 points on the strength of application all right uh and I want to put one additional note here is that within that resource assessment guide uh the pro this our program does not uh specifically require any specific type of documentation to support that uh we know that within each uh with each industry or sub-industry of Renewables that there are multiple ways of providing this type of information from different uh different companies different software Etc uh what we're looking for is that information that you can provide there but we're not requiring a specific type I just wanted to make note of that and we'll go ahead and continue forward in the presentation uh this particular question is going to only come up for those projects uh in the opportunity announcements that are for construction of a renewable energy system with a resilience component to it as well and that question is describe the proposed operational use cases for the storage system including emergency power I'm sorry emergency backup power providing grid Services demand reduction Arbitrage or any other planned uses this is another area where for this um we have produced a uh a simple a basic guide that's available in the applicant help tab that's the resilience level assessment guide and the only other piece that we want to make sure we're talking about is when it comes to this resilience component is that we're looking for how this system uh also is supporting a broader local community benefits that are essential to the public welfare and Clay would you like to add anything on on this one well I think we've mentioned that in previous videos that again our definitions are very specific to this project and so make sure that you understand that we repeat it in in the language here on essential to the public welfare that is a key part of our resilience definition for crap that it has to provide grid outage services that provide this essential essential services to the public welfare in an outage um and again this falls under strength of project description um and part of that overall um scoring for for the strength of your right and uh just as as a quick hint um uh what Claire's referring to if you did not watch the very first video on the pro in this series the program overview there is a section where uh clay uh discusses that in terms of our definitions versus what you may find elsewhere uh even in the Private Industry world so if you haven't already make sure to go back and and check that out uh each one of these videos is helpful even the overview video as it relates to your application uh and we'll continue moving forward um and in this project description uh this question is described the community buildings infrastructure or other community assets that will benefit from the proposed system and you know what we're starting to look at here is a question that starts to move into our program priorities and Community benefits section an equity section of or yeah the equity section of the program uh what we're looking for here is to include how the system supports broader local or qualifying environmental justice Community benefits again that are essential to the public welfare and Clay would you like to add anything here well this is an example of where questions sort of overlap um and so that's why I want you to take your time to prepare individual answers for each question before you've read them for the first time because you may get to this question to say oh I answered this completely in the previous question because they are sort of similar and so make that distinction and read the questions carefully out of the application user guides and that way you prepare ahead of time and get the right language with the right question excellent yeah and can't agree more I just want to uh pause or I'm sorry we want to come to the conclusion of this one uh just reminding everyone again uh reading the the opportunity announcements reading the the competitive review scoring criteria going through the helpful information uh the tips and the guides that are available on the website even going through the legislation itself and the rules for the program for your particular project opportunity announcements these are all vital to your success we think with the application uh clay do you have any other things that you'd like to add here as we're wrapping this up nope thanks Jason okay well wonderful well thank you again for joining us for uh this video on Section six and uh we hope you'll keep moving forward our next video will be over the project plan and we look forward to uh seeing you in that one thank you very much",

Mar i' be happy to answer any questions any questions for the city manager I saw you raise your hand no I was my glass okay just making all right maybe I have a question um on the youth advisory Council or group um we've gotten a few applications when are we going to be reviewing those what's the process because wasn't there a first meeting coming up in October with the school dist yeah we don't anticipate having somebody for the first meeting but we do have several applications and I think we'll just work with the mayor to make sure we get that on upcoming agenda for consideration and approval from the city council I think we have three applications right now as what I've heard yeah could we do another round of posts on social media for that just to make sure that that the word's gotten out that that opportunity exists and for those that might be listening is we're partnering with the school district to set up a youth advisory committee and that committee is going to be um have basically high school students from our school district and for folks that aren't in our school district that are maybe maybe at a private school or homeschooled but live in city of Sherwood they have the opportunity to apply and get on that committee as well so uh check our social media check our website um on how to apply anymore and when's the first meeting again the first meeting is uh this Thursday October 19th so can we make sure that we get selections made before the next meeting so they're not coming in well the the first meeting is on what day Thursday this Thursday I don't think we can get it no before that next meeting before the next meeting yes yeah yeah I think we can look in the first part of November for getting applications in city government if get a move the school district awesome um so yeah let's just plan on having that on the November 7th uh agenda but we should be able to solicit another round of uh potential applicants before then so and we get four positions right now we have three so I think we're in good shape do we know how many have applied through the school yet I I don't have the inform I think they they're working on getting their positions filled okay all right Council announcements let's see Dan you want to go first tonight the uh Planning Commission did not meet since we have last met uh so I have no news from them and I don't have any other announcements for this week no thank you D not a whole lot uh the Parks Board will meet again on Monday November 6th as usual right here uh they did have their last meeting on October 2nd and it was a um it was an off-site meeting they met at Murdoch Park to kind of take a look at the park and what's there and and review the landscape and everything because as you may or may not know moch Park is going to be significantly redesigned improved upgraded whatever you want to call it all the above so they were kind of taking some notes and looking through through what's there and what they can do as they start that process so I think it was a wet day if I remember correctly too it might have been the only the first day that had rained in weeks and they met out there so kudos to them for braving the elements thank you Renee I opted to attend the Sherwood West meeting versus going to the water Consortium but I know there was a staff member there it was a good I'm glad I was at Sherwood was sorry Craig I went to L like many of you and on my way to LC I was on the call for the Sherwood senior advisory committee and there was a lot of Celebration about being designated senior or age friendly City and so their next step is to decide what to do with that um they're very very excited they're actually going to a business senior friendly award to be given out uh at the chamber Awards dinner so I'll be working with Maya on and I think that's it awesome thank you Renee Kim yeah so this afternoon I spent a couple hours um reviewing and scoring a couple Grant applications for um the Washington County Community Development Block B block grant program these are for the home ARP funds which are one-time funds uh related to the pandemic and there's two applications that we were scoring that will help with um um Supportive Services uh rental a utility um trying to keep people people in their homes and helping people that are already out of their homes so um two applicants for that and then I to attended the league of Oregon cities conference and it was it probably one of my favorite conferences this year we had a great um keynote speaker on the first day who was just um trying to think what his name was Bill Strickland um really uh help helped um with youth un under served underprivileged youth getting um a leg up in in in this world and proving that they deserve everything that every everybody else has it he was just very very good speaker our we also had a counselor workshop on the first day was a three hours and it was Ron Holyfield from sgr and he was a really Dynamic speaker talking about effective board um leadership effective elected officials and and um things like that but just a lot of great sessions a lot of networking it was I think the best part of attending leue of Oregan City's conference is networking with our fellow City councilors from around the area and I sat down you'd have lunch and you'd just meet people at your table and you talk about what's going on in your cities and you find out that a lot of cities are facing all the same problems that your fa City's facing whether it's a smaller city of a hundred people or a bigger city of 100 thousand people so it was interesting it was a good time and I thank the city um for budgeting us for us to be able to go to things like that all right H so uh we have had some phenomenal um movement with Library news this last month we um so the Sherwood Library Foundation uh was voted into existence uh I guess and now we're working with the secretary of state to incorporated as a nonprofit uh we've got our bylaws passed um that is so that we we can um raise money get grants uh do uh get requests uh and things like that for for tax purposes uh so that we can uh as a library have a little bit more financial stability and so when they want to do large Capital Improvements or uh you know this year the county cut some uh budget from the library it'd be nice to have another bucket of money that it could be pulled from so that we can keep offering the the services that are that are our our library is famous for um and then uh and by the way part of our startup funds for that Foundation were provided through the compu Community enhancement program uh here through uh cosos and Metro um we uh we do have some other you know I I talked about how the Washington uh provides a lot of funding 42% of our funding um and they they had some Cuts they that is through a levy that that they offer uh or that they uh try to pass every five years I think it is and they're currently bringing aboard uh a consultant to see if the uh the levy is at the right spot uh they're currently targeting that for the 2025 election uh for to see if it needs to get renewed we've got two more years left on the levy from the last time so uh with that being said I'm thrilled that",

        "text": " the content requirements of House Bill 3630 um just give us a shout and we can have a conversation about that together um there is no match requirement for this program and it is a non-competitive program for counties our application window opened on May 22nd 2024 and will be open through February 28th 202 5 and our program deadline is August 1st 2025 so in terms of the plan requirements as Matt said um the requirements for plan content are stipulated in House Bill 3630 and we're going to go over each of them just so we can really be clear about what we're talking about when we're talking about the requirements for this plan content so the first one is that plans need to be based on and planned for short-term medium-term and long-term power outages these terms in term in terms of uh what they mean um they're not defined in the statute but our guidance for shortterm is hours medium-term is days and long-term is weeks you don't have to hold to that but that does fit within um the broader State approach to resiliency and really when we're thinking about things like Cascadia that potential for weeks long outages um so something to consider there plans need to identify and map existing energy infrastructure in the county including transmission lines distribution lines substations and energy storage systems natural Hazard risks and communities that experience social vulnerability um and social vulnerability if you're not familiar with this term um refers to a a group or a portion of the community's level of resilience in the face of external stressors such as energy disruptions or disasters it's a composite measure um comprised of different socioeconomic demographic factors so thinking about things like age access to a vehicle housing type um a level of English proficiency things like that that can either increase resilience or uh lower it and increase vulnerability uh counties need to consult with representatives from environmental justice communities to identify and map socially vulnerable communities uh environmental justice communities are defined in Oregon statute and 4077 so not in this one um but what that term what that definition comprises um it's a it's a significant definition rural communities um communities experiencing lower incomes communities of color tribal communities uh we have the full definition in our FAQs and we can definitely go over each of that but just wanted to give you a sense of what that term means so reaching out to representatives from these communities to identify and map um where social vulnerability is occurring in your county identify potential locations for Community resilience centers and communication zones that the public can access during a power outage um so as it might sound the intention of a community resilience Center is a place that members of the public can go during an energy disruption during an emergency um you know likely intended to be uh provide services and resources for broader emergency needs um but specific to energy you would be thinking about things like heat ing cooling air filtration um and then charging of devices charging of mobile devices um there might be other communication tools there ham radio satellite phones things of that nature and counties need to use locations of communities that experience social vulnerabilities to prioritize uh where these potential locations may be so thinking about where the communities with the most social vulnerability as priority places for some of of your community resilience centers plans need to inventory the energy consumption needs of critical Public Services facilities so you're seeing that term that is in our definition of what community energy resilience needs it's really Central to achieving it central to these plans um and what is a critical Public Service facility this is defined in House Bill 3630 it is a facility related to law enforcement fire protection Health and Medical Services Sanitation Services Fuel and fueling Public Works and Engineering public information and Communications and emergency response and while that might sound like a lot if we're thinking about an emergency those are the essential services that you know to have Community um response happen in an emergency are are really critical and to make sure that folks stay safe um plans need to identify critical Public Service facilities where the development of alternate energy generation storage resources will meet local energy resilience needs so the image shows U some wind power and some solar power um but there are a lot of different ways that counties can approach um alternate energy generation and storage resources it could include these other renewable sources of energy it could be um backup fuel fuel resources uh generators microG grids battery storage um lots of combinations and it can really be driven by your County's needs and your County's goals identify plans need to identify opportunities to coordinate and locate energy infrastructure development to align with and support critical Public Service facilities plans need to identify time schedules priorities and potential funding sources for developing energy resilience and plans need to identify other actions and resources needed to implement the energy plan so you can really see particularly in these bottom two uh bullets content requirements that these plans are put pushing towards implementation um the idea is really to Think Through what are the community needs and then what are the ways that your county can move closer to getting these really important projects put on the ground um so thinking through time schedules thinking through priorities and funding um and that is a really important benefit of these plans they really do get you so much closer to being ready to take advantage of those funding opportunities and project opportunities when they arise um and so those are the plan requirements and you know within that there there are quite Broad and I think there are a lot of ways that your county can shape these plans to align with and meet other similar goals whether it's for energy or Emergency Management um or Economic Development so you know within meeting these plan requirements we really encourage you to shape these plans to best meet your local community's needs and goals um the applications are available up on our website right now now we have two applications one for counties that are applying um individually just for their County and another for counties that are applying in a cohort and I will go over what does a cohort mean and look like in this program in a moment um if you haven't checked out our applications please do um if somebody from Odo could drop our program page in the chat right now that would be awesome and we'll also have it linked on another slide um but the applications are quite simple you know we really tried to keep them as streamlined as possible we don't want applying to be a burden for you participating in this program um so encourage you to check them out simple fillable PDFs thanks so much Odo team you're the best um so you apply you submit it to us we'll oo staff will review it for completeness and eligibility if we have any questions we'll just Reach Out directly to you to go over those um and then we ask that you submit to our program email which is um shown up here on the slide we'll use that programmatic email for formal subm of application performance agreement reporting forms things of that nature so other program requirements um so following the application process in the performance agreement we will do a one-time funds dispersement Our intention is to get funds out to your to your county so that access to funds is not a barrier to you getting going on your planning so we'll do that onetime fund funds dispersement after the performance agreement is complete eligible uses of funds include County staff time hiring technical assistance providers Outreach travel and other costs as necessary for plan development if you think you have some costs in other we can go over you can reach out to us and we can go over what um those eligible costs might be uh we do have some interim reports during the program the first will be in October 2024 the other in March 2025 these are brief reports and really the intention is just to check in and say what have you gotten done what are your goals for the next um time in the program and are you having any challenges or are there any ways that we can support you help you through those challenges the deliverables for the program are a copy of your completed plan and a program completion form by our program deadline of August 1st 2025 that program completion form um is a self attestation form that you've completed your plan met all the content requirements and then you know the other major component is asking how did you use your funds how you used them all approximately how much in which categories um and if you reach August 1 and you have not completed your plan we do have some flexibility in the program Ted tedline and um ability to have an extension until December 31st 2025 that's laid out very clearly in our application documents and FAQs and I'm happy to go over it in our question and answer session or another time um if you have further questions about it there are two other uh components and requirements of our program counties need to formally adopt their plans go through their adoption process within their County and they need to incorporate these plans into their natural Hazard mitigation plans um these are two requirements that are in House 3630 however we do understand that um the county adoption process is a public process and might have its own timeline in that natural Hazard mitigation planning processes happen on their own fiveyear timeline with FEMA and OEM um so these requirements don't have to be complete by the August 1st 2025 deadline your plan needs to be complete your program completion form in um but if you're still working through your county adoption process or your natural Hazard mitigation update isn't going to happen for several years that's okay you can incorporate it um in the next round of revisions so the cohort option that I mentioned um in this program counties can decide to work together and pull their funds in a cohort uh we don't have a minimum or maximum size requirement for that it's can be determined um by your group of counties counties who are working together in a cohort need to identify a lead County so this county is responsible for program processes and paperwork they'll receive the funds Distribution on behalf of their cohort and they'll be responsible for upholding program requirements on behalf of the cohort so as I said there is a cohort specific application um don't be intimidated by the length it really is the same as is essentially the same as the single County application we just asked for information um from each County and ask each County and the cohort to sign it once your cohort is moving forward to the performance agreement process um that will just be complete with that lead County and Odo um so if your counties choose to move forward in a cohort",

Washington County hi everyone Kate Rogers with Mig EPG and um a senior planner there in the the lead Planner on the Consulting team good afternoon Matt craigie Washington County's economic development manager good afternoon everyone Mike Washington City manager with King City hey sorry I joined a little bit late uh pressing course director of government Affairs at the Home Building Association of Greater Portland and Tim O'Brien Metro uh as uh Glenn indicated he's taking over for me I retired actually in July I've been working on contract since and my last day will be much third so I actually do have a final date now hopefully we can get this done by then right now you know I I forget we're getting we're gonna go over all the next steps at the end of this meeting here um but with that I don't think oh Carl you're the last person here I believe I'm sorry for showing up late uh so Carl spring with dks I'll be talking about Transportation related stuff pipe up if I haven't called on you but I believe I have called on everyone on our Tac so with that I do know that we have a couple folks who want to provide public comment this afternoon I know that Jeffrey Kleinman is on the line and so is Chris Clement so moving into public Jeffrey you have you will have three minutes to provide your testimony um to the group uh thank you am I Audible yes you are great I'm doing this on my phone because my laptop is doing audits so uh in any event I represent the Eastview Road Neighbors and uh spoke last time and I just want to reiterate a few points uh this relates to the alignment of the future connector that has at least in the past been proposed for Eastview Road uh and just a few points on that for Chris clemo who is the transportation consultant for the neighborhood uh gets into more detail but this is well it is proposed or has been proposed is essentially an undevelopable incredibly expensive Road to Nowhere uh the connection um from the south uh would be incredibly difficult in terms of the grade the environmental issues and uh the lack of demand frankly if we're using that routing which was in fact discussed I think by Mr Springer at the last meeting because truck traffic isn't going to go that way um it's continue to come into town and use L word so there's very little benefit to be gained the county has indicated that there simply will not be a connection to the north to Farmland at the North End of Eastview Road not going to happen and as I said last time even putting a line on the map just for the heck of it is going to really seriously diminish the value of my clients rural properties and could result in a claim for inverse thank you very much thank you Jeff um Chris yes can you hear me yes okay uh my address is 2237 Northwest Corey Pines Drive Bend Oregon 97703 I previously gave testimony at the previous Tac ncac on behalf here the Eastview Road neighborhood association and consistent with Jeff um and and I guess also consistent with the transportation materials that have been prepared for this plan you know the concern of the neighborhood is the focus that has been placed on Eastview Road um and there's the neighborhood concerns with what's ultimately going to happen along that I mean that it's conceptual I mean but the conceptual alignment you know of course extends from Chapman Road in the south at least to Edie Road in the North um you know and and I it appears that the importance I'd say of this as a regional kind of north-south connector is diminished a little bit with some of the materials that have been produced that largely show it's going to carry neighborhood traffic from those areas largely to the east um and versus serving as a north-south connector Road I mean if it serves as a north-south connector but really only for the residential areas and that you know L word is really going to be carrying the vast majority of any sort of I guess higher order traffic I noted in the summary findings of the transportation analysis you know it comments that there's generally a lack of north-south connectivity in the area that Highway 99 is the primary route um excuse me L word is kind of secondary but isn't really meant to carry through traffic you know that that it doesn't have an origin or destination in the Sherwood area and certainly Eastview Road doesn't have that role so I guess from a transportation perspective and you know speaking on behalf of the neighborhood there is still concern that there is a lot of emphasis or has been past emphasis placed on this functioning as a regional um when I'm not positive that that's ever going to happen and there's also I guess to support that too it's just the cost of what it's going to take to construct that road uh on any sort of an alignment just largely due to topography and environmental concerns so I you know just I guess I'm speaking for the Eastview Road Neighbors I think the city in the long term or even in the short term I mean it's it's okay to think of north-south alignments but thinking or really viewing Eastview Road as that alignment that's anywhere cost effective is probably not the solution and that the city really needs to focus on on other alignments so that's kind of where I want to leave that um that's it Chris thank you um and then for the group to re-received a uh just a couple emails of public testimony that was sent out to the TAC we received a comment from Brian Fields Dennis Christian and Pete larocca so I I just want to enter that into the record and let everyone know that the TAC did those pieces of testimony so with that I'm just going to turn it over to Joe and Kate's okay hi everybody Let's uh go to the PowerPoint if we yep first agenda item is about the concept plan map and then we'll move on to a little bit more about Transportation after this so uh as you all have tracked along uh we have um built this map in steps and we're now at the point where Alternatives have been coalesced into a working draft concept plan the image here that's up on the screen and in your packet is uh is it all put together we did take an approach where we looked at this in a in a focused way uh in pieces four different districts within uh the area and Kate is going to go through those but my uh my introductory comments about the map is that um fundamentally it captures a strong emphasis by the city of employment in the North lowest densities in the East View area or West Ed you can think of it that way than the Far West District and the top of the hill uh on the western perimeter of the project area but a very interesting idea emerged along the way for um sort of a focus on multi-family and varied housing types and mixed use near Kruger Road uh so the area south of the high school has really uh sort of come into Focus as a bit of a destination for Sherwood West at this conceptual level and then finally in the southwest um the idea for a Hospitality Zone that would not only occupy the lands next to Highway 99 but actually potentially go up the hill as well and provide opportunity for Destination and Wine Country related types of uses so that's my five-minute summary of the um I'm going to be telling the CAC tonight sort of a reminder of what a concept plan is and isn't um and you all",

        "text": " and so the so-called belly of the duck is the middle of the day when there's so much solar that it's meeting almost all of the demand for electricity and then we get to 5 p.m and the sun starts going down and people at least in the before times would get off work and would come home and would turn on lots of things that consume electricity and then we have this ramp and to meet that ramp california has traditionally relied on what are called pure plants which are natural gas plants that can spin up quickly as soon as they're needed increasingly batteries are also being used to address peak demand and as i said that's where lithium-ion batteries can really shine providing those shorter bursts of energy for minutes or just a few hours but it's expensive to build enough batteries to replace all of the flexible resources we had or phasing out that could meet that peak demand and so hydrogen can play a role here in two ways first it could help replace some of those natural gas peaker plants either combusted as a fuel or via fuel cells um which would allow you know a resource to meet that ramp quickly and then second electrolyzers producing renewable hydrogen as i mentioned earlier are a flexible load that can easily be turned off or down they're not critical functions so that's load that could easily be shed during times of peak demand and what i mean is that for example if you have electrolyzers on your system as you start to hit that 5 pm peak um you know that's that's demand that you could shed at that moment and so that ramp is easier to meet but really as i said long duration energy storage is when we talk about energy storage this is really a competitive advantage for lithium ion batteries will be able to take a lot of that peak demand ramp um and peaker plant replacement but as i said they're really only good for about four hours and after that they start to get fantastically expensive so when it comes to the grid where renewable hydrogen energy could really shine is in providing long duration or ener seasonal energy storage storage for days for weeks even months and this becomes increasingly important with our grid populated with variable renewable energy because there will be events when those resources don't perform for long periods of time say when we have a really long cold snap in the winter with low wind um you know we wouldn't be getting as much solar um you know we wouldn't be getting as much solar radiation um so we wouldn't be getting as much from wind either with the low wind and we could be having really high demand for heating in our increasingly electrified buildings and so here's a diagram that shows some of the available storage technologies and kind of where they fit on this access we've got storage capacity here and then release time and so you can see you know some of the batteries here um you know really makes sense for some of those shorter periods when we start looking at longer duration uh that's where we start to see compressed air pumped hydro and hydrogen as the most viable options and those are the three that nrel identified as most viable for that long duration energy and then finally transportation um and this is a slide that i sold from evan ramsey at the bonneville environmental foundation and these delectable claws give an idea of the role that electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles can play respectively in light duty and heavy-duty transportation for light duty you see that the medius part of the claw here is given over to electric vehicles with lithium-ion batteries what we all really think of when we say evs that's because these evs are great for light duty um you know the weight of the batteries isn't a huge issue and for many uses these vehicles do not need to be driven hundreds of miles every day and so the time to recharge the batteries isn't um you know a huge concern daily and there may be a role for hydrogen vehicles in the light duty sector and that's represented by the smaller part of the claw and over on the other on the heavy duty side you see the bigger part of the claw is give it over to hydrogen and this is because there are likely to be a number of use cases where the potential weight of um lithium-ion ev batteries could be a problem um as well as how much space those batteries could take up that could otherwise be used to carry more goods and some of these use cases will require the vehicles travel many miles a day on schedules that don't really allow for long refueling times so thus hydrogen um would make more sense and renewable hydrogen as a transportation fuel there so hydrogen is also being considered for a lot of ground equipment at ports and it's actually already in use for forklifts at many warehouses and so there are also some new pilot hydrogen fairies and other marine vessels though it's still unclear to what degree hydrogen might be deployed in the marine sector so here's the schematic from the usdoe and that shows a many number of end uses for hydrogen and renewable hydrogen um you know this is essentially a representation of the hydrogen economy and there are niches where in here where renewable hydrogen makes sense today like i said long duration energy storage it's hard to decarbonize sectors some transportation these are places where we're just really not spoiled for choice for other options and that's where we're likely and frankly already seeing hydrogen and renewable hydrogen deployed now whether or not we come to this kind of economy hydrogen economy-wide deployment in the graphic is a question and that will depend on a number of factors including what choices we make in our decarbonization journey and in plotting our path to it is important to remember that we do have choices we have options there is no one true road to decarbonization and every single one of those options is going to have trade-offs you know be it land use or materials use or cost and so on and so it's up to us to determine which trade-offs we're willing to make and so this schematic represents one of our possible decarbonization futures last slide wrapping up it's been a wonderful audience um what's happening with renewable hydrogen today and honestly there's so much going on and it's all changing rapidly and so i'm just going to give a generic update here um globally there are a number of countries that have announced renewable hydrogen strategies and targets the eu also has announced targets for deployed megawatts of electrolyzer there are demonstration projects in europe to inject renewable hydrogen into natural gas pipelines there's also been some work pairing offshore wind with electrolyzers here in north america british columbia announced last year its renewable hydrogen strategy pardon me and the usdoe recently launched its hydrogen shot program with the goal of getting down one dollar per one kilogram of hydrogen in one decade um though to be clear that this program applies to all pathways for hydrogen so but this does mean that there is a lot of research happening around renewable hydrogen and we also have the federal infrastructure bill that passed in august and that provides billions for renewable hydrogen through a number of with respect to projects in the pacific pardon me um there are also there's a project in washington at the douglas county public utility district and there are also some potential projects planned um or announced as possible in oregon that's nowhere near the universe of what's happening but that's enough for today so we made it and now for the discussion portion of program um i'm really looking forward to your questions and comments about renewable hydrogen um and the study that we're undertaking um as i mentioned earlier there are a number of required elements but we'd really like to hear from you about anything that you might think is missing from that um anything you'd like to see us add um and i'm actually going all right sorry i'm just trying to navigate a number of windows so i'm gonna go back to slide nine with our study requirements okay so um do we have any questions in the chat that um that i did not answer through the course of this presentation yes i think we have one that we can um probably clarify i think there was a little bit of discussion around it and i would say um to the rest of the folks if you have questions or comments start getting ready start thinking about it feel free to put your hand up and my colleague linda ross will start unmuting and calling on folks also feel free to continue to use the so rebecca we had a question and a little bit of back and forth starting with skip sponso and i apologize skip if i said your name around slide 20 you noted that trucking hydrogen is more expensive than pipelines and so the question is how do costs of tracking hydrogen compare to the cost for trucking and propane is the cost per hour of the truck on the road about the same and then ken dragoon responded saying that the trekking cost of hydrogen has a lower volumetric energy density about one-third that of natural gas so in short it takes more trucks to deliver the same amount of energy so uh what what do you think about that um i think thank you ken dragoon that is uh definitely a huge part of the cost as he mentioned as ken mentioned because uh hydrogen does have that lower energy density you're going to need more trucks to get the same amount of energy than you would another fuel um for class beyond that you know i have not looked into that yet um but the distribution costs of hydrogen are something that we will address in the great and there have been some uh helpful comments in the chat and just to let everyone know we will be exporting the chat so we'll have this recorded rebecca will have it as she continues with the study and with that uh linda any hands up yet i haven't seen anything new come in the yes there's a steve ellis that's going to be uh that we can unmute steve you can speak now hello yes steve okay sounds good hey this is steve ellison with uh first element uh true zero brand uh that's uh building hydration stations in california and first and foremost thanks for putting this together and a lot of good work here there's a lot to and certainly you know you're taking on a i'll call it the top of the funnel uh where as you pull through it you have opportunities to move some things along faster than others so one of my comments was when i hear the word study and i heard it a lot often that is uh often too often a excuse for delay and i don't mean that in a",

        "text": " tabs on this this year too and um you know it could be something that the legislature might hear from people and want to take up um making some changes there just because of the supply chain or something so um just know that there's that legislative session coming and we don't necessarily have any plans to do that i'm not suggesting that but it might be just given how this year goes that it does come up there too all right thank great um so um alex um from corvallis had a question that i always like to try to answer and then like let rob and james correct me if i'm wrong so this is one where they can do that um the question was can a project be just for renewable generation without being paired with the resilience aspect and that's absolutely that's absolutely possible we have sort of four categories of projects and so one of them is what we sort of called pure renewables as like shorthand and then there's the renewables plus resilience the issue is that um the the bill is set up and our program is set up to give preference to those projects that are renewables plus resilience so that's the only thing you can absolutely apply we can absolutely accept those applications and um and and put them through the competitive review and they might you know turn out just fine but just want to make sure it's clear that that's the issue is that there's the resilience ones we have to spend a certain chunk of money towards those projects they also get um they can be up to 100 reimbursed versus um only 50 for the pure renewables does anybody want to add to that or correct me if i said anything wrong all right i'm learning every day any feel free the chat you can raise your hand um someone is wanting me to just make sure that i make it clear that there's um i can go back and show the dollar amounts just so it's clear um we can't fund necessarily a hundred percent of all projects so there's so many more slides now okay um but this is um the amount that we can give as a maximum grant award and the maximum percentage of the cost so it's up to a million dollars 100 percent for resilience plus renewables and a million dollars up to 50 for renewables only um we got a lot of questions just to give you some ideas on the first webinar we had about like specific project ideas that people had in mind that led to some good conversation so if you have anything in mind you're thinking and just want to know if it'll fit the project or question any other questions let us know i did see another one in the chat though which is great thanks joshua um this is a fire station it sounds like this could be an appropriate grant for the design phase to develop a renewable energy component what was the amount we could budget up front if awarded i'm gonna let that seems like one for but i think this slide is is helpful right so designing a five station renewable energy components so if it was just um kind of renewable well planning uh is it initially so yes planning renewable energy only you would be eligible if you're just in the planning stage uh up to like 100 100 000 dollars up to 100 if uh it was just and then moved on to construction renewable energy only a million dollars up to 50 of the total project costs and then if uh included the resilience it could be up to 100 of the project cost um and in terms of resilience versus energy uh own renewable energy only um it they'll be kind of reviewed competitively reviewed so um we have buckets set aside so at least up to at least 50 or more of the funding needs to go to kind of resilience projects it's not that resilient will get necessarily points above a renewable only but they have there is like we have to spend an amount of money on the resilience projects and they will be competitively reviewed and then we've got the renewable only they'll be competitively reviewed it's just kind of you will be able to get less uh money less less percentage of the total amount of the budget cost you'll still be able to get up to a million right right so in the end they could have that for the project for if you're doing the fire department construction i think this is right that you could during the design process get a planning grant from us and then have a hundred thousand dollars toward hiring a consultant who could then sort of pencil out what that renewable energy or renewables plus resilience project could look like for your fire department as well so just to i think that one of the things that um staff from our department flagged early was you know what do we do for places that aren't ready to apply for the project yet and then enable them to hire a consultant to make that plan essentially build what will become the application for the project and so that's what the planning grants are meant to be so um i'm gonna sorry to interrupt but as far as the upfront costs go we can award up to 30 of the grant funds um before the project is completed so that would be 30 dollars on a planning grant and three hundred thousand on a construction grant assuming they came in at the full grant values uh but yeah thirty percent up front is what the bill allows us to do um prior to construction or planning of the project great um i see michelle has her hand raised before we go to michelle i think we had just a quick um follow-up from alex if including resilience triples the cost of the project would it still be more likely to be approved over standalone renewable and i think james just kind of got into that a little it's really just a matter of like what the mix of who applies is just because we have to spend 50 percent of the funds on resilience renewables projects so renewables only projects it would just depend like if it was if we had if we had um that 50 criteria met then then it would be easier for us to approve that i don't think for us rob you can correct me if i'm wrong but does it matter for us if the resilience increases the cost of the project in our analysis of approving it is that anything in the criteria we have some general criteria around the kind of financial and technical viability of projects however we recognize that adding resilience is going to add a lot of cost and that accordingly brings a lot of points to an application in the competitive review so you know like christy said it's going to depend on the nature and number of applications that we get but we do have the carve out to spend at least 50 percent of the funds on resilience projects and those will earn more points in the competitive review and then final follow-up from alex and then i see now we've got we'll go to michelle next then we've got a lot in the chat so we'll get to you in the chat don't worry but alex just asked to follow up about would it require a separate application and my understanding is that it's yes you would have to apply separately even if you weren't sure which avenue you were going to go is that correct um i think if you were in the kind of the planning stage it just says would it require a separate application for renewable with resilience versus standalone renewable if both options are possible um so we would only be able to grant uh what uh one grant for the projects um i would say if you're kind of in the space and you are thinking about what your project is going to be we recognize the projects aren't going to be fully formed in the planning phase and if the development project that results from a planning phase isn't like kind of the criteria we're just hoping it results in a a proposal for developing a project in the end um so i would say if you're in the planning stage you might not necessarily feel like you want to put in two applications but if you're in the kind of construction kind of side of things um to get make sure you kind of have all the information in an application that will be needed to be covered in both uh applications you'd possibly want to um kind of submit both but i can kind of follow up on that as well yeah that sounds like a good approach michelle we're ready for you someone will get you off mute in one i used to be off meeting himself one of the projects we've been considering um after last summer so we operate the tillamook airport as well and for we needed we need new fuel we have fuel tanks over there for both hundred low lead and for jet a there was a fire up highway six we were caught in in a conundrum um with we worked to get with department of energy for an emergency fuel uh for air support for the fire um our tanks didn't they barely met the minimum of ten thousand gallon delivery um that was required for that um we're in the oregon resilience plan as one of the top airports for that would that type of project fit into this as far as rob i'm gonna direct that one to you so the cost of the storage tanks and would not be an eligible cost however if you wanted to have a pumping station for those tanks that were powered with solar and battery backup so that you could still pump the fuel in the event of a disaster those components that were associated with the batteries solar and pumping would be eligible costs so we can't buy the storage tanks but we could buy um the infrastructure to make sure it's operational in the event of a power okay perfect i just didn't want to spend all the time on something that wasn't didn't fit in the proper definition so thank you perfect yes and that's exactly i am we were pretty close to that jedi issue over the summer um as a department and um we actually are kind of looking at federal infrastructure dollars to be able to uh that that could be used for things like that so i'll um make a quick note that it's something you're interested in and if we see something going down the pipe that could work for that we'll let you know because it's definitely thank you i mean it's just looking at probably about a million dollars um before that updated system and it's just it's not in our budget anywhere and we were at least really stuck with the fire support for that yeah yeah and the same exact thing happened in southern oregon just before you two was two places over the summer with really similar issues so thanks for the flag",

agenda and the second thing is a roll call will the reporter please take roll here here Morris here here St here here and commissioner Zimmerman and commissioner we have excellent thank you uh next on the agenda is our public comment um the commission will now hear testimony from the public concering items not on the agenda is there anyone wishing to speak at this time all right uh being none we will now consider the approval of minutes from the last meeting which is dated November 16 2023 may I please have a motion to approve the minut that was Commission in Inman okay perfect and can I hear

and call for a vote all in favor of approving the minutes please say yay and anyone who does all right perfect minutes are approved all right um next on the agenda is uh public hearings but we don't have any public hearings we'll move on to action items uh the first thing up is the scan Heritage neighborhood designation and I believe we have a St presentation okay good evening Kimberly Mr our preservation officer for the City of Salem so uh tonight you're going to be considering a request by thean neighborhood association to be recognized as a Salem Heritage neighborhood so since um this is a new program for some of you I'm going to give a brief overview of the program and how it relates to our historic preservation plan and specific goals related to that and also share some of the cool projects we've done with some of our former associations so um for those of you that were involved in our historic preservation plan and yeah um which was adopted in 2020 we identified as our first goal a goal to improve public Outreach and Community Education with a specific strategy to educate neighborhoods within the Salem Heritage neighborhood program and really uh one of the reasons for this is we wanted to um create a good solid back foundation around understanding the significance of a neighborhood's history before really even introducing any kind Regulation and so I have a graphic I love which kind of illustrates that it's what I call the preservation pyramid and it was something I was taught in school so really what you can see here is we've got some building blocks and these are some of the tools that we use in preservation relating to education uh on the ground survey which uh reconnaissance level survey which doesn't mean asking people stuff it means looking at the the building Fabric and identifying what you have and and then um doing some Outreach to the community and that does involve helping folks understand about their history but also learning from the community about what their history is and then recognition which is really where the Heritage neighborhood program it's a it's a recognition not a true designation with any regulation associated with it but it allows us to then work with a neighborhood to to more directly achieve some these things so this also shows how this all kind of works in conjunction with what we do here at the Lark's commission so as you know or maybe you don't know um the City of Salem has a number of recognized associations um this Heritage neighborhood program was established in 2014 by city council I'll talk a little bit more about what um we did with the other neighborhoods but our first neighborhood association we worked with was the grant neighborhood association and we identified several projects that we did with them signage sign Toppers interpretation uh we developed calendars and book shures and guide books and in the past we've even worked on walking tours with markers so the goal really be projects that work to help um the community understand and celebrate their history so here's some specific examples from um the gr neighborhood which was all the way back I can't believe it in 2015 so you can see um the front cover of our architectural guide book the uh calendar that we worked with them to create and then the S Toppers and what's cool um we're still continuing to work with them even though they're not uh our our latest neighborhood uh Heritage neighborhood so just um just earlier this year the neighborhood association wanted to install some additional sign Toppers and you can see we and then our second neighborhood association was the sesma uh neighborhood association which we worked with them in 2017 and we did a calendar with them again that was really uh we also did an architectural handbook and and something that we really um worked hard with them was doing survey recis level survey was pretty big neighborhood and we used some um new technology was really amazing toble to use our cell phones to be able to access our rgis system to take pictures and document the condition and eligibility of our resources and you can see here we also developed some historics as well our most recent Heritage neighborhood was Highland neighborhood so we did some of the um similar projects with them they are now um revising their um their handbook I won't call it an architectural guide book because they're turning it into something else a little bit more um uh cater to what they need for their for their neighborhood which is cool we also did um the RLS surveyance talkers them so getting into the details of this the scan neighborhood association request so we actually have criteria so to be eligible um the neighborhood association has to be recognized by the City of Salem and of course in this case and is a recognized neighborhood association and they were established in 1973 secondly at least 50% of the resources within the boundary that they would like to have recognized have to be at least 50 years old Bolder and based on our initial PLL of data from rgis without the dates construction dates uh 73% are 50 years old old part part of what we'll do as part of this process is verify and confirm the accuracy of those dates because as you may know the assessor is right um and initially they'll talk to you all about um this in more detail in just a minute but they've ID Identify some key projects that they're interested in uh as you know the um the Gat Hill bushes pasture Park National register district is within this neighborhood association so that'll be excluded from the work that we do regarding survey but we could include it um for any projects related to C so um the landmarks commission has Alternatives uh this is an action item so you could after listening to their testimony tonight you could request additional information and don't do anything this evening and continue it um to next month or you could go ahead and um vote to designated as our next Heritage neighborhood association or you could determine that the criteria has so that concludes my staff report um for now um and unless there's any questions I will representes perfect um does anybody have any questions for staff Al righty um we can go ahead and have the representative from the association if you could please state your name and address for the record that would be L good evening voice seems to be going into heing for the record I Victor doer I'm the president of the South Central Association neighbors otherwise the scam and I live at 396 Washington Street South in Salem um I'm here with ad West SC vice president thank you for the opportunity to speak on designation of scan as a neighborhood our requests for designation came out of a long discussion long running discussion uh of uh that came out of the designation of mixed use zones along Commercial Street sou and the city council's U proposal to resend the overlay Zone within overlay zones within scan that had Reed the residential neighborhood uh from encroaching commercial development for many years some parts of our neighborhood are well documented historic assets well documented for instance the Bush Park itself Bush special Park itself in the gy hill Bush Park uh residential district other parts of scan are less well documented yet contain historic residences pieces of historic infrastructure like the con uh designed bridge over Creek Church Street uh and other bit of interesting history like the abandon proposal for three car line that went up electric street Electric Avenue and how various parts of the neighborhood were developed and became part of the city the work done for the Heritage neighborhood designation will go toward a better understanding of how the scan came to be as it is today that I'm going to turn over toest more detail to speak to thank you again for the opportunity to speak thank you thank you Victor thank you City staff members of the commission I am W as Victor mentioned I'm resent of 7 I actually work full time as a historic preservation specialist and I'm also happy to be a vice chair of the C Association I'm very happy appear before you all today so I Ur you to move forward with as aine in my view this designation simply makes sense travel Salem tells us that Salem is the most origin part of and if that's true which I believe that it is I would go further to suggest that scan might be the most Sal part of Salem particularly when we consider our City's historic resources the scan neighborhood is home to three of our most beloved hous art museums the Oregon Governor's house with and we share responsibility one of Sal's historic district within the neighborhood residents are working hard to nominate a second historic distt resources prible but importantly it's not simply the obvious that Mak SC an excellent candidate for designation as scan is home for wealth of diversity and we're excited to have the opportunity to highlight the history of people in places that have all too often been overlooked while many are already aare of the homes of Bri engineer or for govern catfield the understated and architecture stories of our commity as well we're particularly excited to explore the history of development near to the railroad L 13th streets and to expand interpretation of critical events and places in vious history perhaps Park the support of the Heritage neighborhoods program will provide tremendous assistance to my hardw workking scan colleagues who are already working tirelessly to devot Reserve while also bringing it into the future we have not yet formalized what educational project we want to complete with your support but the process of surveying our historic resources willable us to create Champion principles of preservation in the heart of our community I want to thank you all very much again for your consideration look forward",

this evening and wish to speak please fill out one of the testimony forums it's that blue card and submit it to planning staff and the chair will recognize people who wish to speak when you come forward please state your name and address for the record any questions should be addressed through the chair in reaching a decision on the application the commission must consider whether the application meets the relevant approval criteria in the city's land use regulations those criteria are identified in the staff report the staff report is available online and at City Hall the staff report was accessible to the public seven days prior to this meeting date and the testimony and evidence must address these criteria or other criteria you believe to apply to the decision please note fill your to raise an issue with enough detail to enable the commission the applicant and the parties an opportunity to respond to the issues precludes an appeal to the city council Orlando's board of appeals on that issue also failure by the applicant to raise constitutional or other issues regarding proposed conditions of approval again but without enough detail to allow the commission to respond to the issue precludes an action for damages in Circuit Court at this time I would like to ask the members of the commission to disclose any ex parte contacts bias or conflicts of interest please indicate the nature and extent of the ex parte contact bias or conflict of interest and indicate whether you intend to participate in or abstain from the hearing commissioner whiteola I have no ex

participate as well and chair Simpson take on contact but no bias no conflict of interest and I plan to participate the nature of my ex parte contact was a phone call Sunday evening from commissioner Vance he had he's working late this evening which is why he can't attend he had reached out to both Eric and Erica with questions and then was recommended that he he could call me with any comments that he had and on the application he his comment was that he understood the application completely and seized the need for the space that the staff had put in there this the for the um for flexibility within the project and the road space Road location and he did uh see that a contiguous sidewalk was would be beneficial and that's that's the extent of our now does any member of the audience wish to challenge any planning commissioner's member ability to participate in the hearings this evening so now I will turn to staff to present the staff report thank you Erica good evening chair Simpson Vice chair wydolla congratulations uh Eric Rutledge community development director here at the city um Mark I have my screen or the PowerPoint up on there we go thank you um so this is for lu2022-028 major modification for the Sherwood Commerce Center um I won't go over all these details but the proposal is to either remove or modify conditions of approval B3 and B4 this is a Type 4 major modification so the applicant received site plan um earlier uh last year in 2022 and there were a few conditions on there that are looking like it's going to be difficult to implement them and so they're requesting to modify or remove those conditions the application was routed to affected agencies we also did public notice um to date we have not received any public comments on the proposal the applicable criteria here for reference pretty short just limited to the scope of the conditions and the criteria related to those conditions the site is located south side of Oregon Street shown there in red about 38 acres yeah just keep going the zoning on the site is employment industrial you can see everything in purple there that has all been annexed into the city all of that zoning is employment industrial the gray area is in our talking employment area but has not been annexed into the city so a nice little block there you can see on the corner of Oregon Street and Tonkin Road of annex property in terms of the existing conditions this is probably early summer-ish or around the summer time it looks uh site looks a lot different than this now you can see the grading activity taking place on this Square property again my laser pointer here here's the site here this would be phase one of Sherwood Commerce Center so they do have a grading permit site has been graded this would be the phase two and they do have a grading permit for this site as well so things look a little bit differently than they do here but things are moving forward pretty quickly we do have two other applications",

        "text": " we will ultimately use and whether we'll build those 112 turbines or something less than that ultimately a mitigation plan will be will be implemented to address any impacts that our project has next slide please so additional impact assessments that were done relates to cultural resources not only identified sites that are outlined within our application but indirect impacts such as visual or there there's some sensitive sites and cultural sites around the product that we've worked with shippo to um to minimize decommissioning um there will be a decommissioning bond or letter of credit that will be posted to account for the cleanup of the project when the useful life is over we generally plan for 30 years on the on the wind farm upwards of 35 or 40 on the on the solar facility but a bond will be posted to when the site is reached the end of its useful life we will uh there will be funds available to clean it up and finally on the on the sounds you know we will comply with the oregon noise route noise rule uh regardless of the array of turbines that get built and the last slide has to do with agricultural impacts you could skip to 36 thank you um you know this is an important aspect while the majority of the site is grassland there are agricultural interests in the area and so while none of the site is irrigated so there will be no impacts to irrigation or water rights and there's no wells or ponds that will be impacted particularly on the uh arable land where the solar facility will go we've worked really hard to uh and will continue to work on on addressing some of those agricultural impacts which you'll see in exhibit k of the application and so i think one one key aspect of this entire project is that it's it's taking land that is you know perhaps less productive um and it's allowing the landowner to to realize some an additional revenues out of that so it can put towards some of its other operations in the area the cunningham sheep folks have do have a lot of agriculture culture in the area and what this will allow them to do is kind of reinvest on those other facilities and on more productive ground and the next slide is uh brings us to the questions and so there's you know phone number here an email address here if anyone's you know feel free to ask questions i'll turn it back over to kate in terms of managing that process but if you don't feel comfortable asking them in today's meeting please reach out to us via either of these methods okay well thank you matt last slide just like to queue it up um we're gonna open at this point in our meeting for public q a public comment so in the webinar you should be able to see how you can raise your hand to ask a question if you raise your hand the host call on you unmute your microphone and allow you to if you're on the phone um i'm not sure that we have anybody that's calling in on the phone i also have um just so you know we have todd cornett and sarah esterson with the sighting division who are on hand to answer questions for the sighting division and in addition to me so the way we're going to set it up is if you have questions regarding the facility the proposed project we're going to direct them to matt if you have questions regarding the f sec citing process and the application process for sarah and i can can handle those so do we have any questions i don't know does anybody want to raise their hand there is a question in the q a kate about battery storage and what's the duration of that that i can see and so the expectation is that it would be a lithium ion facility with four hour batteries so that 120 megawatts would be discharged over four hours thank you we're gonna leave it open to see if any of our web attendees want to ask a question or make a comment i am not seeing any hands at this moment is there any special instructions to give them on how to to raise their hand just be a hand in their icon there like that nancy just so because it doesn't look like anybody's got their hands up but just in case can you go ahead and uh unmute everybody just to give them that option in case somebody is having some difficulty in getting their hand raised oh thank you tom that's a good idea hey there is that this is cindy there is a question in the q a i am not able to oh there it is okay i was like where is the q a sorry folks i did not see that so let's see okay okay i can help you out okay so the question is is there a specific plan for disposal of spent windmill blades and solar panels landfill or recycled and what percent of each yeah that's a great question i can i can take that one so there is a you know decommissioning plan and and i would ask you linea if she knows what the exact exhibit is for that but um there isn't there's a decommissioning plan that kind of estimates what um the cost would be and part of that is salvage value of you know most of the salvage value on these things is within the metal themselves so it's a great question in terms of what happens to the blades in the solar panels because that's a you know that's a hot topic these days like where does fiberglass get recycled i know they're coming up with new and new um uses for it every day but that's not specifically outlined in that decommissioning plan decommissioning information is an exhibit w thank you linda and if anybody is wondering down in your right hand lower corner it says q a if you click on that box and you want to type in a question if you're if you can't raise your hand you can use that feature you can already mute themselves um what you want to do is unmute all of the attendees and we're going to try to unmute you all so that if someone's trying to speak yeah and while he's doing that i just want to reiterate you know when they had talked about exhibit w just as a reminder if you go on the project website um the entire application including all of the exhibits are already there and so they're available for your review and then there's a description of what those exhibits are kind of on the right hand side of each page to help kind of you particularly again encourage people to go look at the application that's already out there so wally nancy you guys are still trying unmute all of the uh so i'm uh i'm unmuting the attendees now unfortunately i have to do it one by one just bear with me a moment and if there is anybody who would like to make a comment if you could just let us know that and if there is more than one person we'll sort it out and get you in order we have a few more on that list that are still muted yeah well some afternoon muted them they're muting themselves too again all right so is there anybody on the line that wants to make a comment or ask a question this is dan doran and i i just want to say thank you thank you for the oh well thank you thank you for tuning in we appreciate it all right i think you can probably do everything back again i have everybody muted again now all right thank you for helping with so the last slide i'm going to show you for the evening is just my contact information um as the signing analyst that's leading this review um i want to make sure that you know how to get a hold of me so my email and my cell number which is my work number are um listed on this slide i am the point of contact for odo on the project as far as the application and the dpo if you have any additional questions or comments um about the information that we shared tonight about our process i would encourage you to reach out to me and i will make sure that i am able to answer your questions or get you your answers you know in closing i would just like to thank matt and capital power for presenting the information that they did tonight on the project um and encourage anybody who's tuned in to to continue to participate and engage in our process and and stay tuned for the issuance of our draft proposed order which will be coming soon um and it will be going out in a public notice and and it will get posted on the website as well so i don't see any more questions in the q didn't sound like we had any more questions or comments on the i would think that this concludes our meeting unless we want to hold it open for a few more minutes to see if anybody wants to comment just one more ask and then i think after a minute or so i think we can conclude okay i think we're good all right well thank you everyone for your time and your interest in the nolan hills wind energy facility and the epsic signing process so thank you thanks nancy for your help thanks wally thanks todd thank you capital power for for your presentation this evening thank you again thank you good meeting thank you good night",

        "text": " we don't want to have a situation where we put all the money in and then the project doesn't get complete so this is due to sort of a compromise measure there and that's is that for um both program or for both planning and projects or just just for both great 70 uh and then 30 is yeah but both um we had a question about forming a community cooperative model and questions about limitations on whether the applicant is a newly formed organization and i'm just buzzing through these here guys so like correct me if i'm missing something but i'm just trying to answer some of them that we can quickly the applications are required almost exclusively to come from public bodies the one and that's like government think about governments that's like what is meant by public bodies so this community cooperative that's being formed would need to work with um a local government for example in order to to put in an application um tribes are also considered an um eligible and then the one exception are co-ops so um essentially most consumer-owned utilities qualify as public bodies except co-ops so we just specifically added in co-ops to the language of the bill to include them as so um if that community cooperative is not a government then you would need to partner with a governmental body and then um let's see here's where we got a bunch of the questions about the application that i already went through and then okay here's what i i need help answering uh would a feasibility assessment be considered planning or is planning intended more for design and pre-construction activities that might be a rob it might be a james to you guys yeah i'm off mute um i would say that feasibility assessments would be considered part of planning but you know keep in mind that these will be competitively scored against other like projects and so projects that are really early on in their planning and doing feasibility might not have um as many opportunities to kind of score points in the in the scoring as a project that maybe has passed feasibility and is working on um development of documents and permitting and things like that that also happen in in planning but there's no there's no exclusion for feasibility that i know of within our rules or the the bill and james can correct me if i'm wrong i'll take one more from the chat and then i'll go to scott with his hand up and then we'll go back to the chat so um kristen was wondering about the timeline for a word version like a worksheet we i just want to be clear that um can put something like that together the checklist is designed to sort of have that function so that you can kind of like use the checklist to get organized ahead of time and that's already um and then uh but it's not in word and then the other thing is that the opportunity announcement directly follows the application so if you have the opportunity announcement you can kind of like go through it and figure out what you need to do um so we'll we'll have some conversations about getting some sort of worksheet potentially up and online but we don't necessarily have a timeline for that i think because we felt like the checklist might have checked that box no pun intended but stay tuned we'll make sure if we pop something online we send it out to the folks that are um that are on line right now and then scott i'm gonna unmute you go ahead presentation on the word version uh you know suggestion is even if you just did like screenshots of the online application and posted those just so people could uh you know know how to how to start formulating an answer to the to the questions the the opportunity announcement's great it's got lots of information but it doesn't actually ask um so my question has to do with uh we're looking at a community resilience the description of the community benefits number seven that we have to be located in a qualifying community to find the definition of qualifying community it it jumps you over to ors and a qualifying community is a community that qualifies as an environmental justice community as defined in ors 469a so when you switch over to 469a an environmental justice community includes communities of color communities experience lowering incomes tribal communities rural communities coastal communities uh et cetera et cetera i'm in grants pass oregon our project would be located in grants pass is i think we will qualify as a rural community but i'm i don't know what the definition of a rural community would be can somebody help me out to get point me towards the direction to see if we actually are an environmental justice community that is a and therefore a qualifying community yes so i just decided to share my screen so folks could see that list that you just rattled off of what the definition of environment is that slide yeah oh no it's fine it's you just rattled it off you found it your own way um one thing i'll just note is um we have that advisory committee that we were asked that we were asked to work with and it was wonderful to work with them we're really glad to have their and one of the things that they said was that um they wanted to avoid um being overly prescriptive about the definitions for this and that it made us a little i think us government types are like but we want specificity but it was what they had to say was like it's really up to a community to decide to show how that how they fit this definition and in the um so we're respecting that and so there's not like a hard set definition yeah um but i think i will let james and rob dial in but i think if in the application when it talks about how you these qualifying communities there's some portions that ask those kinds of you can explain it like why why do you think grants pass is a rural community and how do you also how will this benefit communities experiencing lower incomes or communities of color within grants pass and so on and so forth does that sound right james rob want to add anything yeah and i would just say we one of the resources we put on our website was a list of uh kind of data or indicators that people can use to kind of demonstrate how the community might fit into one of these definitions and how they might be able to demonstrate that so i would check out the applicant resources we kind of tried to use a variety of different resources depending on which one an applicant may wish to use to kind of demonstrate that yeah and i would reiterate what um christian james said that in the absence of a strict definition think about how a competitive review committee would view the project based on what you're telling us about the community benefits and like christie said if a project within grants passed is located in a location that can serve lower income residents or communities of color or under underrepresented communities in some way that's going to you know support that that argument that it's a qualifying and maybe as we get through the program a couple of rounds and we start seeing um things sort of congeal around definitions we might be able to tighten it up but right now we're letting communities essentially describe their thank you so much yeah thanks scott and one other thing i'll just say for those that are listening um you don't necessarily have to be a qualifying community we just have a role that 50 of the projects need to serve qualifying communities so there'll be like a kind of an automatic benefit if you can make that argument um and and you know have it be accurate of course um but um but just want folks to know that it's like a it's like a boon to your application but not a and then um this is one i definitely need robin james on what defines the end of the planning phase is there a requirement to be done within six oh i see there's a requirement to be done within six months is this equivalent to schematic design or construction documents phase i'm happy to take a take a stab at this one and um we don't have any specific requirements that come out of a out of the planning phase if you can demonstrate in the application that the planning is going to result in construction documents that is as about as far as you can go in and design before you start you know the construction phase so that would be certainly qualifying but we don't require that schematic design or construction documents be completed with that planning phase um again this is a this is essentially up to the community to describe what they'll be and uh there's no strict requirements great hopefully that means let's jump in and say yeah that all the application needs to demonstrate is that the proposed the app can the project will result in a proposal for developing a community renewable energy project so and then we have a question from zechariah um will you please share more info about the requirements of a letter of support from a governing body and just to be clear the applicants are required to be in most cases public bodies the one exception being co-ops co-ops generally have sort of a board of directors and then governing bodies tend to have some sort of board of directors i think zechariah might work at odot for you uh well i don't know that you're planning to apply but like maybe the the transportation commission or whatever so just to give an example so that's the the who we're looking for like essentially we want to make sure that there's a letter to clearly show the authority of the of the applicant to join the grant and generally speaking that comes from the governing body for me for for the state legislature for the for the state of oregon as an agency we have to get permission to apply for a grant from the legislature for example so just that whoever that body is for your for your um governmental unit if you will hopefully that helps with that one um i already answered brian's question and then there's april that has the same name as one of my favorite people but i don't think it's the same april april um we're wondering if you have a definition of public welfare for section six sure um so we don't have a specific definition um as such we're kind of leaving again that's something we're leaving up uh to the applicants to demonstrate how that structural facility is essential to the public welfare of that community uh because we realize that different communities are gonna use different buildings in different ways um however in general we would kind of consider the structure facility essential to the public welfare if it or would be finding an emergency kind of services to this to support the well-being of the community um so this",

        "text": ". And then I've got a few pictures, a very, very short presentation. Before I get to all that, though, real briefly, I do want to. At a high level, I think it is really important to understand that while we have a land development code, we also have a noise ordinance, and ordinances that deal with noise. And so at the end of the day, it's a. I don't want to get us down a rabbit hole here, but under no circumstances, despite whatever approval you may recommend tonight, could my client violate our noise ordinance. And our noise ordinance. Can I stop you for a minute? Yes, sir. They have not. Under no circumstances may they. But I'm going to get to whether they have. The answer is, I don't know that I can answer that question. But based on what you were referring to, which is the code enforcement snapshot in your agenda packet, there are. I had to educate myself about this a little bit because I'm not really clear on what some of these acronyms are. But as miss. Sorry, summer was. Summary, I wanted Miss Jamieson mentioned. This shows that at 10:00 and 27 seconds that the applicant's noise was 63.8 decibels. The code says at 10:00 but prior to 10:00 they can be under 65 decibels. So they were not exceeding the code requirement for noise 27 seconds earlier, apparently. But, you know, again, we're here. What I want to say at the outset is that under no circumstances, despite any approval, can we violate the noise ordinance. So I think that's important to touch on early on, again, just a little bit about Chris and Darren. So they have run several restaurants in town dating back to Golden Hills. At the golf course, they ran the country club of Ocala for quite a while. And right now really have three primary operations or restaurants. One is elevation 89 at the Ocala International Airport. So they're a tenant of the city of Ocala. If you haven't been out there, I'd encourage you to go. Done a really nice job with it. It's always packed good food. They didn't run it right. County line smokehouse, which is out in the southeast part of the county off of c 25, similarly completely renovated. A. What needed a major renovation and have done a nice job with that. And then finally, the anchor, which is the restaurant we're talking about tonight out on Sunset Harbor Road. As staff mentioned, they purchased it in 2020. And if you, I won't ask you to admit whether you had ever been to fat daddy's before, but the restaurant that was there, if you can call it a restaurant, was a whole different story. They did a really nice job. And I'm going to go forward a couple of slides here and show you. So this is the property prior to their renovation. And without mincing words, it was a drug den and a major problem. It was a mess. And they came in and completely renovated it during the course of those renovations. There was some comment earlier about those porch improvements, and I'm going to show you so now, and we'll run through some other pictures, but it's a much nicer and much more professionally run restaurant. During the course of those porch improvements, there was discussion about outdoor entertainment. I will tell you as a, I represent several government entities, and it is true that no matter what anyone is told in the permitting process, even if there's a misunderstanding or a mistaken communication, you have to comply with the code. It was my client's understanding, however, in working with staff throughout those porch improvements, which includes screening in and redoing a back porch and outdoor bar, that they could absolutely not have drums, but that what we're here tonight seeking would be permitted. I'm not saying that's accurate, and I'm also not saying it should have. I just want to tell you that, because if you speak with Chris, you'll know he wasn't trying to pull any wool over anyone's eyes or do anything that he knew was against the code. Under the impression until this all came about, that it was permitted and that no special use permit is required. Now that's because in our code, which sets forth uses and then uses permitted by right in certain districts, and uses permitted only by special exception in certain districts, outdoor entertainment cannot be found. So this is not a use. We're here tonight in good faith seeking your support and your recommendation of approval, but may arguably assume that playing some music is part and parcel of running a restaurant. And that was the misunderstanding that has led to all of this. So I want to tell you, before I run through some pictures and talk about the property itself, that one of the things that we did in preparation for tonight's hearing was reach out to the complainant. I won't name him because I think he's got some neighbors here. But I can tell you that I walked him through the buffering and the wall or fence that we're talking about. And he was thankful. He was supportive of those changes and we had a good conversation. I understand his concern. I understand if you live in a residential neighborhood next to a long time b two property that's been a restaurant, who's now seeking a permit to do what it's always done, but yet to play music, that. That can be disconcerting. Nobody wants to hear music late at night. But what we're here to do is to try to convince you that we're doing this professionally and with appropriate conditions of approval that address those concerns so quickly. I'm going to run through a few of these photos. This is the view. We got a few from outside. And then most of these focus on the back porch area. And you'll be able to see exactly where the proposed music is intended. This is a family restaurant. The music is only available Thursday, Friday and Saturday, and during the day on Sunday. And they don't. Well, we're going to get to this. But it's a family atmosphere. This is, if you look, this is looking east. And if you look over this man who's got a bunch of good food in his hands, his left shoulder, you can see what will be important in a moment. Because that is the booth, for lack of a better description, where a musician is typically stationed with the music facing back west toward the restaurant, not east, which would be across, you know, into residential properties. This is a view back. We're almost turning around now, looking back toward the restaurant. This is where the outdoor seating to your left would be, and the bar to the right. This is the stage that Mister Wayrock was referring to. There's a small, little, almost circular platform around a palm tree. You'll be able to see that in the context of the entire back porch area in a minute. But you can see the kids are having fun. That's a better view of. It gives you a little more context, especially as it relates to how much distance there is between this stage, which is also projecting back toward the restaurant, and that station to the left, and that rear fence in the back. This is before the screened enclosure was added, which would be over the porch here. But this is a view so that you can just see how deep we're talking about. And then this is essentially from the other side, looking southeast. Now, before you, Mister Wayrock referenced that, there's what I call a red line. So that represents the conditions of approval that were proposed by staff, which substantively we agree with completely and with some changes that I made or proposed suggested changes. One is this has been done. There have been music played at this location dating back to fat daddies, and now for three years under my clients ownership. So we're asking that while all the substantive requirements, like the installation of the buffers and everything else be baked into this, that a site plan would be a little heavy, a site plan would require us. All these permits are in, or physical improvements are in place. It's all there. That would just be going and hiring an engineer to draw it at a more precise location and take a bunch of time and money, when all what we're talking about here is managing noise and actual substantive requirements that will remain in here. So we are 100% on board. Other than that, with all of the recommended buffers that staff came up with, I think Mister Wayrock covered those pretty well. But if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them. I'll just point out that the third, which is now should be two c, although it looks like I've crossed through two. That's a type c buffer. So that's a 15 foot buffer, but it's also. It's a landscaped buffer with a six foot opaque fence or wall with shade trees and understory land, shrubs and ground cover. So I do think that is located in the portion of the property which is actually the back wall. If you're looking at the photo right now, that's up. So that's the most substantial buffer because it's the one most likely, it's first, the closest to the residential properties to the east, and also the one that needs to absorb the most sound. So what we've recommended, moving on to the next one, is that the hours of operation for any outdoor entertainment be limited to four to ten. Getting back to our code of ordinances and how it treats sound and noise, that 10:00 is the hour where the requirements change. So to the questions earlier about what those noise requirements are, there is essentially you exceed the noise ordinance if you spike and over a certain level, which is like, you know, do not cross this line, that sort of a level, and then that average",

they treat as that they come and drink they do drugs they um come onto our properties a lot of times they'll come down onto the just without the dock there they'll swim over right in front of the dock get on our Dock and they'll walk up into our property we've had theft you know I can just say numerous things that have impacted Our Lives block driveways people Park in the Summer where they're drunk and they sometimes come over from the store some people could be drunk and they'll walk over a meander and one lady just walked into our driveway just stumbling there are times where I am so fearful if he's ever out of town where I see a a people come in drive 2: or 3 in the morning you can hear them partying you can hear doors closed my boys are right there they're I am fearful honestly genuinely fearful of who's coming in there sometimes their cars and you go out there and you see them doing drugs one time I had to come out at late at night and I we stopped calling the cops because honestly it is it's i' we've done it 45 minutes in a minimum and then even if there's noise or anything it's like you guys and I get it the budgets are restricted how are you going to send cops out for like things like that but one time it could be just a really could be the wrong person it could just be that one time so this is when we're talking about intensification of use I want to know why why when there are there is access there is access to the wamit river there never that hasn't stopped but why the dock why the recreational dock right in the middle of our houses when they could go two miles down the road and they can go to shampoo Park they're going to say because oh it's free access it's free that's the benefit but is it a benefit to us it's free so anybody can come at 24 hours a day no protection nothing it does it just doesn't make sense why why this has gone on for 5 years at a cost to us where they can just get donations it's and we're sitting here fighting I can tell you I'm not rich but we have fought so hard to say that this is not right because this is and when you talk about a limited a RightWay There are rules and there are rules and we're our fee title owners and what the RightWay is is a right away if it is a right away what does it mean is it limited Limited in use and Ben Williams in one of his minutes even stated before because initially he stated he wanted a park want Park when he found out through Maring County in one of the minutes that it cannot be a park because it's a roadway they say and that's why it's open 24 hours a day but it's being utilized as a park and I have ample evidence to show that so that's why we're here and I appreciate your time I really really hope you hear this thank you appreciate you being here Scott name is Scott putam um it's my lovely wife live on 2372 Street I'll keep this real short I know you guys are very focused on the dock the gang way um and I don't know if you've seen the photos of where the dock will be adjacent to our dock but it looks about 5 to 10 feet away I got young boys I'm moving the country to experience freedom I grew up in between s and Silverton my dad served for Maran County and law enforcement but my grandpa was a fire chief if you're in Salem I still live in Marian County I support this County I support what it's about like I said I moved the kids out there to get away from this and excuse my language they've seen drugs they've seen I've used worse don't worry about so I I apologize it gets me heated for 5 years I will tell you the honest truth we have a neighbor that moved sold her place um there's one gentleman here that has been driven this thing since 2017 her first comment to to us is he gets what he wants and he will not stop we are here 5 years later because he has not stopped he wants to put put a dock in it doesn't affect his life it doesn't affect his property it affects ours and it affects Julie's I'll give you one story why we don't call the cops there was a trailer parked in our rideway or whatever you guys want to call it parking lot it's a park they moved out the picnic tables because they're like oh yeah it can't be a park this gentleman we called the cops on cuz his trailer was parked there I knocked on his door he never answered never saw that guy aable trailer like an RV trailer like an RV trailer okay 45 minutes hour later the mar County Sheriff shows up guess what he tells me oh we know this individual don't worry about it he's never assaulted any other any he's a known beath addict drug addict he's never assaulted anyone other than his girlfriends don't worry about it he want he want to assault a other private citizen so he he I finally cop leaves finally the guy comes back I see him come back and knock on his trailer again he leaves cuz I told him was like look our property you need to leave 2 weeks later what's he do comes back with a girlfriend in the in the trailer we're not home Julie was home beats up his girlfriend in the trailer the cops come cuz he runs down and hides in our property in the berry bushes that's one example we sto calling because they don't come you're going to put a

be to Arms I don't want to have to be in that position someday that I face major consequences that's it I appreciate your time thank you both for being here today apprciate it thank you good right okay um Julie and then we have one person after Conrad welcome back thank you it's nice to see you yeah my name's Julie Kramer I'm at 23717 first or what is my address 23707 First Street Northeast sorry I'm not judging you I can't never mind either I'm Delirious um I would like to thank you all for accepting our appeal and we appreciate your willingness to hear us um this has been a long expensive Battle of many years for my neighbors and me with no end in sight because as you know we have a pending Maran County Circuit Court case filed regarding this matter um as I think you all know I own the William Riley Shire house at the 1890 Queen Anne Victorian located in Beville across from the store and as you also know I think um Beville has a population of only 265 so it's really small um and I've lived here for 25 years now I'm here today to as you know ask you to deny the friends application for further development of a property that apparently neither FB nor Maran County legally own which they've acknowledged they've acknowledged that we're the fee um WR Shire was in case you don't know this was a successful grain Merchant and steamship Captain who stored wheat grain corn and hops in large W houses that he buil next to the home he was also my great-grandfather um unfortunately he lost his shipping Fortune when the railroad became active in 1908 or so um and the home was lost to our family for many years but I was fortunate to buy it back in 1999 so the home and and property mean a lot to me and he in addition to the warehouses he built a commercial fairy dock known as but landing for shipping the grains directly from his home and it's those uh remaining concrete remnants within the narrow strip of land that were the fee title owners of that um and my neighbors the putam who just spoke their property um is the historic Alexis aashan home was located on their land so um this all this land goes way back to the 1800s um and that's the so this um the remaining remnants of the Ferry Landing is where the FB is now trying to develop a recreational boat dock and gangway and the subject of the dispute so that's just a little bit of History um due to the park and commercial parking that have already been put in place by the FB I believe believe they completed that in around 2018 the following problems are now allowed to occur 24 hours a day in our once quiet safe and peaceful community we're experiencing trespassing theft vandalism homeless camping drug and alcohol abuse we found discarded IV drug needles loud fights and altercations parking problems accumulation of trash and debris blockage of access to our our homes by Store and park visitors loss of privacy and loud noise in violation of Maran county code ordinance on a regular basis until fall of 2017 but landing consisted of a natural Ivy and dirt trail with tall 40 to 50y Old native Oregon big leaf maple and fur trees um the natural Trail was used by bville Loc primarily I returned from a trip to Disneyland with my grandchildren to find the Shaded area completely clearcut and along with it the a wild life habit was destroyed we no longer see owls Osprey Hawks nutria bald eagles or quail in the area that we used to see no written notice or permits were provided prior to the fb's clear cutting of but landing the Beeville General",

was I the one that the I'll tell you in my presentation why it's your fault I wrote it in there did you yeah of course I did hello we're now ready to go and it is 5:30 uh my name is Jim Brewer I'm the hearings officer for the city Salem uh this is going to be CC 23-01 I'm going to quickly go through the uh outline of the procedures for proceedings uh we're going to take a staff report by Jacob Brown uh we'll take an applicant's presentation that'll be limited to 15 minutes a neighborhood report if any but I don't see doesn't look like there was anyone here to do that then we'll take General testimony beginning with testimony in favor of the application that'll be limited to five minutes testimony in opposition limited to five minutes testimony that's neutral also Le to five minutes if we have any testimony then we'll go to rebuttal by the applicant Limited in scope to issues raised in opposition again we'll limit that to five minutes that point we close the public hearing I want to direct your attention to the applicable criteria found in that notice the testimony and evidence for the public hearing should be directed towards these criteria because they're what I'm going to make a decision on anyway uh a Zone changed re this is a Zone changed real line boundaries between mu2 and mu3 uh zones along the center line of a private Street on a single unit of land for the 2900 block of cubler Boulevard Southeast Salem Revise Code 265.0 5 e states that a quasi judicial zone change shall be granted if all the following criteria are met a zone changes Justified based on existence of one or more of the following uh sub one a mistake in the application of the land use designation to the property sub two a demonstration that there's been a change in the economic demographic or physical characteristic physical character of the vicinity such that the proposed Zone would be compatible with the vicini's development pattern or sub three a demonstration the proposed zone is equally or better suited for the property than the existing Zone a proposed zone is equally or better suited for the property than an existing Zone if the physical characteristics the property are appropriate for the proposed Zone and the uses Allowed by the proposed zone are logical with the suril land uses excuse me B if the zone change is City initiated and the change is for other than city-owned property the zone change is in the public interest and would be of General benefit C the zone change complies with the applicable Provisions the Salem area comprensive Plan D the zone change complies to applicable Statewide planning goals and applicable administrative rules adopted by the department of land conservation and development e if the zone change requires comprehensive plan change from an industrial designation to a non-industrial designation or comprehensive plan change change from a commercial or employment designation to any other designation a demonstration that proposed zone change is consistent with the most recent economic opportunities analysis and the parts of the comprehensive plan which address the provision of land for economic development and employment growth or be accompanied by an amendment to the comprehensive plan to address the proposed zone change or include both the demonstration and an amendment conference Plan F the zone change does not significantly affect transportation facility or if the zone change would significantly affect a transportation facility the significant effects can be adequately addressed through the measures associated with or conditions imposed on zone change G the property currently served is capable of being served with public facilities and services necessary to support the uses Allowed by the proposed Zone and to the greater the impact of the proposed Zone on the area the greater the burden on the applicant to demonstrate the criteria satisf uh so with that I'm going to open the um a couple of other things that I want to tell people about uh before we begin I to raise an issue accompanied by statements or evidence sufficient to affort the city or other parties the opportunities to respond to the issue precludes appeal to the state land use board of appeals based on that issue isue failure of the applicant to raise constitutional or other issues relating to proposed conditions of approval with sufficient specificity to allow the local government designated to respond to the issue precludes an action for damages in circuit court so this is the time and place to bring something up may not be able to later are there any objections on jurisdictional grounds for the holding of this hearing not seeing any this is CZ 23-01 2900 block CER bullet over at Southeast did we have staff report we ready to begin good evening here officer my name is Jacob Brown I'm the case manager for the propos zone change 23-01 the proposed zone change is located at 2900 block ofar

requested the subject uh subject zone change to realign the boundaries of the existing miuse 2 and miuse 3 zones along a recently revised Center Line of an internal Street land uh I would also like to note that the such a property also received a comprehensive plan in zone change the uh under CPC zc 21-04 with uh wherein the pre-existing single residential designation was changed to mixed use and the underlying residential agriculture RNA Zone was changed to the now mu2 and mu3 Zone the uh this this uh previous approval also had five conditions applied to the property uh these conditions

properties neighborhood association uh which is the Southgate weight neighborhood um in addition notice was also provided to the abing neighborhood associations as a property uh directly abds these neighborhood associations and these neighborhood associations are warning side and Southeast mil Creek at this time no comment has been um been received by neighborhood associations or from the public the Oregon Department of Aviation did provide comment uh they indicated that future development will require aeronomical evaluations um prior to any building permit approval oav um also indicated that they may advocate for highight limitations depending on the locations of structures the Department did provide a comment indicating that access and water supp will be required at the time of development uh building a safety alongside with Public Works did not provide any concerns regarding the approval criteria for the zone change uh the zone change is Justified uh due to the proposal uh being equally or better suited uh to the subject property than the existing zones as previously noted the existing uh the existing alignment uh was intended for the proposed treat however following further analysis by the applicant looking at the topography and the natural features the uh applic identifi that the current that the previously proposed alignment of the street would not uh be feasible furthermore the proposed uh the the existing zones M2 and M3 zones would remain and thus be consistent with the comp plan designation of mixed use uh analysis of the uh zone change uh consistency with the comp plan and state by plan goals are within the within the staff as the property is outside of the urb service area the Urban Development um area permit uh would be required Urban growth area development permit there we go would be required um however existing facilities such as sewer water and uh storm War infrastructure are available are currently existing along the U along the existing streets and areas which are adequate enough to which are appears to be adequate enough to serve the property staff has provided the following U recommendation in addition to a recommended condition of approval uh the subject property shall meet all conditions of approval within CPC zc that concludes my presentation okay I really have one question and since the applicant sitting pretty close they make want to address it uh when we look at then thank you for having this slide up when we look at the uh there there's not a lot of change in the fractional part of an Anor that gets exchain but is would that area be developable at all uh what area are you specific so we well we've got the area where as as the road has moved we're actually uh slightly increasing the M2 Zone slightly decreasing the mu3 Zone but it's I I don't really have a sense of scale for how much the increase of mu2 zone is and whether that would be a developable fragment or not I know the two both I believe the appc represent I can prob help Olivia DS current planning manager so I it is a fractional um area but I think that the overarching goal is that there's two sets of of design standards and development standards and so to meet the standards of the mu3 on the south side of the road versus on the north side of the road for mu2 because it goes across the street right right so it's just it was more for consistency of the design standards and development standards and it was the overall intent of the Planning Commission to apply those standards to those standards to that street instead of to the those public streets and so",

It. Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to the board of county commissioners in Marion County, Florida, workshop to discuss transportation capacity projects. And if you'll all please join with me in standing for the pledge of allegiance. Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you all. And madam clerk, I'll ask you to please call roll Chairman Stone here. Vice Chairman Bryant here. Commissioner here, here. Commissioner Zalick here. Very good. Well, again, welcome, everyone. We have a riveting meeting set before us today with a lot of opportunity to talk about the future of transportation here in Marion county. So to get us started and to bring about a lot of the description and background is Tracy Straub, our assistant county administrator. So good morning, Traci. Good morning, commissioners. I'm in front of you today, of course, because I was your acting county engineer, your previous county engineer, and a lot of the groundwork on this has been laid before our current county engineer started with us. So he is hitting the ground running, though, and has done a lot of work helping us prepare today and will be the one implementing the decisions that are brought forward. With that, I'd like to just make sure that you do recognize we do have Stephen Cahoon, our county engineer, in the audience. Good morning, Stephen. And Doug Hinton, our deputy county engineer who has been involved with these projects from day one. Good morning, Doug. And thank you both for being with us. So we are here today to discuss, per the workshop heading transportation capacity projects, looking out into our future. Our available budget does impact much of our decision making here, but we're also going to touch on our pavement maintenance program in general, which capacity is adding capacity to roads. So you're adding lanes. Pavement maintenance is keeping up with our rehabilitation projects as well. So when you look at your budget decisions, you have to take both of those into account, even though the workshop is title capacity. So we're going to show you some maps and to help you with what you have in front of you is I have a presentation, but we have also given you a handout because we've updated some of the views for the maps. And then when we finish with the work, with the PowerPoint presentation itself, we are able to flip into a live map that you can see quite a bit of information overlaid together. Your traffic counts, your development projects, all of that as you contemplate any decisions that you might be still considering or have as we go through in your packet. At the end of your packet was a reference document, and I just want to pause and make sure that everybody knows that's there. We want to make sure any of our public that reviews these materials online has access to these, ready access to these. These are the types of documents that, whether we're building our program and putting it out for our actual management of our, of our programs, or whether we're referencing the data that, the back end work that we've been doing all along, it's very ranging from your 2045 long range transportation plan. And just so that you do know, that plan is already moving into the next update. Your TPO is starting that update. We'll be part of that story and we'll be using that data to build out to the future as we continue to roll out of. You have a congestion management map that's important. And knowing visually what are we experiencing out there. Our traffic counts. Your Office of the county engineer participates with TPO and that traffic count data, as well as the city of Ocala and FDOT traffic counts are a good indicator of what's happening on our road network. Marion County's documents. Of course, we plan on those five year windows. Our transportation improvement program and our current tip that is adopted is on the county's public website to view. We continue to roll our five years out and that's where you're going to see at any given time. You could ask staff and we tell you that we have a window of lists of projects in our mind rolling out ten plus years. And you're going to see where when you build in your tpos long range list, when you look at the growth and development needs, you see how we can continue to build a map, a road of improvements way out into the future. And that's what we're going to share with you. You also have the approved residential development projects that our office of growth Services has been keeping up with. And then of course, there are dots, own separate traffic counts. You know, we talk about I 75. So this is a map of Marion county. The county boundary roads are classified by their level of use and connectivity. So that's what a classification map is. The map shows the road makeup countywide. It's just a visual to give you an idea. It is available on our county maps at any given time to look at. For the purposes of today, what's important is what we are looking to plan in our road maintenance programs and our road capacity programs through the office of the county engineer. So there are 2559 centerline miles of paved road in Marion county. Throughout this presentation, I'm going to refer to miles. It's important in your mind to sometimes recognize centerline miles is different than actual lane miles. It's not going to differentiate for you if it's a two lane road or a four lane road in the overall number of miles. We track it by centerline miles. And then when we do our funding and our program funding, you'll see that why a mile of a road is going to differ if it's a two lane versus a four lane. Yes. And Tracy, for anyone in the public who might be following along, can you please give the definitions of each one of those roadways that you're identifying and going to be talking about today? I will with some help from my team. Can you all look up a proper definition? I can give you a non formal definition. Non formal is fine. Okay. But they're going to look that up. You're also going to hear me drop to using terminal terminology. Office of the county Engineer I'll start saying oce. I'll try not to, but it will happen on occasion. And occasionally as we talk about work programs, we refer to our tip, our five year work program, and that's that five year transportation improvement program. So when we talk about the major road network versus the subdivision road network, hopefully subdivision roads make sense. That's what our MSTU program helps us provide for. If you live inside a subdivision and it needs to be overlaid, that's where we use that MSTU program to come in and do it. Your office of the county engineer provides routine maintenance on all the roads that are accepted into the county maintained network. There are private neighborhoods that are not part of that. There are roads that are simply out in the county that are not part of that. So that routine maintenance is your pothole, patching your tree trimming signs and striping shoulder drop offs, that sort of thing. What we're talking about again today is that bigger picture, more costly maintenance, whether it is overlaying a road or if it is building new lanes and new roads. So subdivision local, inside your subdivisions, your arterials are going to be more of your major network connectors. Do you have those? STephen CahOON, county engineer so typically, when you think about an arterial, it's going to be your major road. Think of I 75, anything that goes from outside of the county through the county to another county or outside the state. Those major roadways, that's your arterial. When you think of a collector, that's typically a road that connects an arterial to some of the minor roads. It's a way that traffic goes from arterials to places of residences within the county. Those collectors are typically contained and isolated within the counties. You've got major and minor local. Definition is minor local. Think about your rural CR roads, some of those very low volume major local. It's going to be more of your subdivision type roads. And then the subdivision local is an extension of that major local as well. I brought up the map again, and so to help orient you, those arterials, we're talking about your 441s, your three hundred one s, and then from Marion county it's going to be 484 on the south end of the county. It's going to be county road 25 out there and it's going to be the 92nd loop around the Bellevue area. Those are some examples of your arterials, your collectors. And when you view this map, I hope it makes sense for you. It's going to be your, a lot of your three numbered roads, your 315s, your 316s, your three hundred eighteen s, three hundred fourteen s, four hundred seventy five s show up on that. As well as 80th street is a great example of a collector road. Today you're taking a lot of other roads and you're connecting them back to your major, more major road networks, your major locals. If you begin to look, you've left kind of the arteries that you're going to drive from the city of Ocala maybe out to a major part in the county. And now you've started to thread in and thread your",

        "text": " to be contiguous with the Metro UTV so does that cause any management problems with land use and organization it's it it's really it this is done per state rules um I don't know if it really causes any problems with land use it's just kind of the the system that we have where maybe my question would be better is there any concerns with infrastructure Supportive um we we have consulted a little bit with um the Metro uh area uh the regional government there to discuss you know Transportation things of that um but and as far as our Urban growth boundary expansion goes and the the infrastructure to service that that um it'll essentially be um North Plains working with the development Community to assure that those facilities are brought in with uh each development proposal um and in terms of identifying what that need will be in terms of streets uh sewer water the capacity for those that'll be addressed during the concept planning phase of this process um so we will be updating our sewer and water and transportation Master plans as a result of that to show where um those those facilities should go and the size and uh so forth of each facility whether it's a arterial or a collector's treat a sewer or water line Etc that will all be identified through the concept planning phase okay uh on slide 12 can we look at the ramp for that where we have residential designations and uh constraint areas can you describe a little bit more what the constraint areas include is that uh um so in the Southeast quadrant that constrained area is McKay Creek and the floodplain and wetlands associated with McKay Creek um to the north there in the 90 Acres uh that is a reservoir that's on that property right now um that could potentially become part of a um a park feature um and then in the Blue Area the 29.5 29 295.5 Acres that that constrained area is a tributary to McKay Creek and so again it's uh wetlands and floodplain okay and then my last question I guess uh timeline for development I'm sorry I missed that last one uh the projected timeline for development uh I'd hate this turn see this turn into something like Oregon City where they ugb area to a competing area because the timeline was too long yes well I mean that all depends on the public process and then the time to get it acknowledged by dlcd and and so forth so in terms of uh bringing this land on to uh the city it could be it could still be two to three years out before there's even any land available for annexation uh you know anticipating that there could be an appeal there could be some other type of uh situation that we have to navigate through before uh we can actually start annexation it's a really hard one to anticipate but you know two years it could be more could be okay thank you yes so we have commissioner Kaiser commissioner Potter and the commissioner Bido who thank you sir Kaiser um could you could you ask answer a question for me uh to what degree do we uh subsidize or or work with uh the city of North Plains on uh planning um and uh inspections and building we do manage city of North Plains Building Services processes at Washington County because North Plains doesn't have their own building official Washington County's building official is de facto the building official for North so that leads to my my next question I I know also from a planning standpoint I think you guys uh in North plains have had to use uh Consultants to do your some some planning I don't know if that's still the case uh especially on current planning issues talking about adding more ugb land here what is the plan for Staffing up to handle that because I I'm involved and part of that process right now on the current planning side and it's it's not speedy let me put it that way so what's the plan for that I'm surprised to hear you say it's not speedy on the current planning side because that's uh my role um I'm not sure what development you would be speaking to there's only been a few that I've come through in my one year at the city of North Plains and we got that done pretty expeditiously um so uh I'm not familiar with what you're referring to but we will ramp up as needed as the city grows so that means you're going to not use you're going to be hiring more in-house people you're going to stop using the hey Steve I'm happy to take this one as city manager since I do a lot of the organizational governance and hiring um like like any organization you know we'll we'll assess through the budget process and assess the revenue projections and staff up or staff down as needed depending on how the how the how the the economic situation is going we will for sure have to step up the planning uh Department that we have to accommodate the activity that we uh foresee coming um and yes the county does provide the Building Services um service for the city of North Plains um I understand that the county went through an extensive um kind of fee restructuring to help capture maybe some areas where that may have been lagging over the years it seems like uh they have done that so I'm hoping that a lot of the building activity coming the County's way may also help with that bottom line with the county but as we grow the the PSU population projection is for North Plains to be about 7 500 people over the next 20 years that's maybe a function we consider taking in-house as we grew over the next few years it's just been like from my own at some point as you grow and you get bigger here we got to get as a city it's time time maybe to move on to your own on your own uh group and I'm interested in that from the standpoint of adding more land if that's where we're going uh then I want to make sure that uh the city is being as self-sufficient as possible and the county is is doing less and less of that work as possible yeah and that's a great Point that's that's one of the that's really one of the foundational pieces of our Council and pursuing this Urban growth boundary expansion is to provide more services and more facilities to residents here so thanks for that comment just from my perspective I also know hey look you gotta you gotta have some of that in order to get some of that right that's how it always goes I just want to make sure that if we're going to you know approve this or or uh uh or if I'm going to be in favor of it anyway that that we have a commitment from you that that's that's a priority that's all I have thank you commissioner Porter thank you may I please refer to commissioner BIDU first and then I'll all right we should video thank you chair Lockwood um I was wondering um if uh first of all apologize for my ignorance on the process but if you could describe the process of you know what the steps are first we would approved the ubgx or ugb expansion and then at that point would um the areas within it be rezoned and then do the concept plan or can you just explain that process a little bit and then the timeline in which you hope to achieve that I have a couple other questions after um in terms of um the process you know we we've completed our process as Todd mentioned we're now moving over to the county because it is required to have this proposal blessed by the county before it can be acknowledged by the state so uh sounds like we'll be getting through your processes around the end of this year um and then that will move the proposal over to the state where they will have their own review process um once they complete their review process and acknowledge our ugb um there is the potential for that to be um and if that happens it's really anybody's guess on how long that could take uh well that is moving forward with the state uh the city is going to be working on our concept planning to identify where the zoning would be placed onto these lands as well as the major transportation corridors like I mentioned earlier we'll be updating our sewer water and transportation Master plans as a result of that to identify what type of facilities are needed to grow these areas so there'll be work that will be happening even if there is an appeal process going on so when that is all completed we're ready to move forward but um it's really a tough guess really to to say you know how long this all could take but again as I mentioned if everything goes smoothly it could be two years from now maybe a year and a half from now where we could potentially entertain an annexation request to bring land into the city limits but I think that would be best case scenario and I'll add on to that as I mentioned in the presentation um while North Plains is going through its process um once all appeals have been um uh have been finalized at the stage should the state decide to uh should the county decide to move forward in the state approve it uh and acknowledge it and appeals are gone we'll introduce we'll Begin work on an ordinance to update the urban planning area agreement with North Plains and then after that we'll have another ordinance where we will be uh basically applying the urban land use designation so similar to uh what we've done on on standard um egb expansion projects like the one that you uh you viewed recently for for Tigard um only we'll be applying a fd-10 land use designation to that but those uh would probably not begin until at the earliest next year so okay thank you out of curiosity all of this area that's not shaded blue or yellow on this slide 12 um are those being uh looked at further for uh best use in the future or um what's the plan for those areas yeah I think I appreciate that question I should have clarified that in my presentation but the the Green Boundary line is the study area that I mentioned um and so that is the undesignated lands that surround North Plains right now and of that um that is about 1500 plus acres uh we're proposing 855 of that to come into the city so uh in the future when the city would need to grow again that remaining area to the north there would be where we would be allowed to uh look into future growth would that happen in 20 years or or more or less it's it's hard to anticipate but right now we're planning this as a 20-year Horizon um giving the type of growth we've seen in the",

        "text": ", could it be developed? They are going to be. I don't think anybody's arguing that it's going to be developed. I just want to make sure that we're keeping in mind that we have an existing residential area there. I mean, what we have done in the past, Commissioner Bryan, on cases like this, and is with staffs. Okay. Because, you know, the viburnum hedges that grow tall and maybe, you know, give you some more comfortable feeling about buffering, they'll grow tall really quick. However, they're not an approved species on the, you know, Marion friendly plant. Right. We had to do that over at the. What's the farm. Yeah. Now I can't remember where angel lives. Bradford. Bradford. Yeah. Up against that, we planted the code minimum or the code required viburnum, and it, like, you know, wouldn't grow tall. So we took, ripped all that out and put the viburnum that goes tall. I mean, it's, it's doing really well. So that's. How big is that bumper? This one is 30 foot wide, the one that you got. And you can kind of do. We do less. We just do the, we just do the hedgerow then, and we don't even worry about the trees then. In that case. Right. When we do, you still put the trees? Still put the trees. But if we're sure, if that competes, that's if you fill in the gaps with. And it's something that we could work out with staff as well. It's just if you're looking for a taller hedge, we got to be able to go to something that's not necessarily on the species list for Marion friendly. I think those people would appreciate it. I mean, I don't, I don't, and they really don't. Last night, it really cost more. I mean, yeah, I don't think the cost was much more to put that, but they give you that. I mean, I've got them on my property. They're great. All right, so can we just put that in, switch that out there for the viburnum? Yeah. I don't think those neighbors will have more privacy. Okay. And that's going to be on the southwestern property line. Just to verify, or did you want that it's on the south property? I would. I mean, I would consider all of that. Okay. Where there's resident. Okay. Just wanted to make sure. Whatever. Ask the developer in DRC to put that in first. Okay. For the. What's that? Okay. Tell them to put it in first, please. Yes, I will. Okay, Paula. That's the problem is that we don't get that stuff planted early enough. And right. Comes an issue. You just need to get. What do you mean first though? We're not touching that area. I mean, if you're phasing it, that's fine. Yeah. Right. As soon as you go into that phase before you start site clearing and. Right. Get it, Flanna. Yeah. Because you've got 30ft there, so it shouldn't affect the rest of your development, what you're trying to do there. That's it. That's all I've got. Thank you. Is that okay? Yeah. Any other questions? I've got two questions. This has been coming up on a number of developments. And that is the time of construction. Like when they're pouring concrete, they'll show up, they'll put lights on in the morning, 05:00 in the morning, when it's cooler, particularly during the summer, it's very disruptive. I don't know what the answer is. I haven't made this a big deal, but to people that live around there, it will be a big deal. So if there's any way during the course of construction you can do two things. One is try and get a reasonable time to start in the morning. Most of us don't get up at 435 o'clock. Secondly is the dust to make sure they have water trucks out there. I had one subdivision that was a major problem. Their water truck was broken down. The winds came up in March and just covered the neighborhood. So if you could somehow factor that into the plans to make sure that that doesn't happen. Does the county have thought the county had like an ordinance, do we? Not on hours of operation, we don't. I don't think we do. No, most we don't. And Germans being generous, most construction pours are starting at 02:00 a.m. yeah. Two, three. Two or three in the morning? Yeah. Yeah. The plants, the concrete plants started at midnight. Yeah. They're up and starting to go. And you have to pour it early so that you know, you're not in the middle of the day. Right. I think what you could do though, is that if you're pouring early in the middle of the project is probably not that big of a deal. Right. But if you're pouring early, and you're on that last row. It may be something that you asked them to do later. I'm sure as we get through the process, we'll make a comment, and we'll. That's more for the contractor to address it. We've had to do that in the past, but that was more so on a special use. All right, any other questions? Yeah, anything. All right, bring it back. I'm sorry. Yeah. Is there anyone in the audience that would like to speak to this project? Okay, back to the commission. I'll move for approval. Second, a motion to approve by Commissioner Zalak. Seconded by Commissioner Bryant. Any comments? All in favor say aye. Aye. Those like signed? Okay, that motion passes. Unanimous. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for still letting us eat at Latinos. Okay, we got a lot. We've got a walk on. So, commissioners, before Tracy comes up, I just. I've been working with Mister Gooding and his client on bringing this forward. This kind of got delayed, and so when we do this, if we can move it forward as far as. As the plaque goes, we need to have that subject to. Or. I can make the motion if you want, but subject to DRc approval and everything being put together. Okay. Motion to walk on or to consider a walk on item. Motion to approve by Commissioner Bryant. Seconded by Commissioner Zalak for the walk on. Any comment? All in favor say aye, like sign. Mister Chair, is that walk on just for the plat right now? For both of them. The plat and the. For both of them. Okay. Yeah, the plat and the agreement for the surety bond for the road. So, commissioners, Tracy Straub, assistant county administrator. You do need to take the surety bond first and then the plat second. Two separate motions. And that's why they're written as two separate walk on items. That is, typically they would have been presented to you in your board agenda as two separate items. The improvement agreement comes from the office of the county engineer. It's a direct approval by the county engineer. The final plaque comes to you as an approval of the development review committee. And like I said, they're typically found under those DRC items. So the first item is the improvement agreement. And what this does is acknowledges that the applicant has not fully constructed all of the improvements that are responsible with this phase of development. And so the improvement agreement says that they will construct them. We do have the signed agreement here. The copy in your package is not signed, but we do have the signed agreement that they will construct it prior to any additional platting beyond the plat that's in front of you today, and it will include an off site road improvement. The bond covers a portion of that road. There was a previous bond approved in June of this year that covered another portion of that road. So that's what the improvement agreement does. With the improvement agreement being approved, then it's okay to approve the final plat? The final plat is their ability to sell all the lots. They have an identification agreement that allowed them to partially sell lots, but not completely sell lots. At this time, they are ready to move on the rest of the subdivision, and that's what this does. But this needed DRC approval as well. It is coming to you out of order. So with DRC's approval on Monday, your motion reads that you would approve it subject to DRC's final approval, which requires delivery of the mylars, signed and sealed copies by the surveyor. And subject to the bond. The agreement is subject to the delivery of the bond. Right. Which is also en route to us, but it gets overnighted from the bank. So both of your motions have those separate items being subject to question applicant. So the bond one is to be executed upon receipt of the surety bond, right? Correct. The chairman would execute it upon receipt of the surety bond. But you want the agreement first and the plat. Well, technically, you're accepting. You can approve the plat because of the bond. Because of the improvement agreement and bond. So they go hand in hand. Jimmy Cooney, 1531 Southeast 36th Avenue. It's a long story in terms of how we got here, and I'm not going to bore you with it, unlike most of the times when I'm standing up here. Commissioner Bryan, if you'd like for me to go into the whole story, I could, but we appreciate staff bringing this forward. The delay was caused by some prior misunderstandings between my client and the county, and we're grateful that staff's letting us proceed. The plat's been ready for months,",

        "text": " going to be east on 118th Avenue and then west. And then there's our signposting there. In the middle you've got a view of the front of the church. The cemetery is the picture on the right. And that's that commercial area just to the south of the church. And to the left you can see just across the street, more horse farms all around. There's the rear of the church. The middle picture is the area between the church and the single family residence. And to the right you've got a picture of their building in the back. All the way to the right you can look down southwest 60th Avenue. As you can see, just a small rural road, a lot of agricultural type residences. The summary of the analysis, staff felt that it was consistent with the land development code for sections 282 D and 283 B because it complies with all nine specific requirements consistent with the comprehensive plan. Ultimately, staff recommended approval. The next few slides are a review of the conditions as proposed and as appear in the staff report. If you don't want me to review those, I'd like to skip ahead to the conditions that staff was able to discuss with the applicant and that are at issue today. I will ask the board, are you good with that? Skipping ahead to those conditions that have already been proposed and the applicant is good with. Okay, then please go forward. So again, staff recommended approval. You can choose to today to approve it with the conditions as they were approved or recommended approved by the PZC, or you can choose to do the amended conditions. The following slides are those amended conditions as staff was able to discuss with the applicant. I have darkened or grayed out the conditions that staff and the applicant have agreed on. So kind of to make them fall to the background. And the issues are the bright white conditions in orange. You're going to see some of the material changes. I just wanted to highlight those before you. Items three and four are essentially reordered but the subject of them are not changed from the original proposed. They're just numbered differently. So you've got a number one and a number two. And number four was part of the original three. I just wanted to make sure that you understood there was no change. This is the part where we get to where we've got a difference in language between what staff was comfortable with and what the applicant had proposed. I think it's fair to say and Mister Gooding can correct me when he comes up if this is not true. But I think applicant would like us to look at just the blue area of the parcel. When considering modern standards. Staff, as it approaches every application looks to bring the entire parcel up to code. So before you today you're going to have to decide if that's appropriate for the site here. So the staff language number nine and number ten is talking about this yellow portion here. For number nine that's this border between this whole parcel and the agricultural use to the south. Okay. It does not touch the project area proposed but it is part of the. It's one of the boundaries on the subject. Parcel number ten is addressing this boundary here between the single family residence that sits here and the single family residence over here. So we had proposed an e type buffer because it is a single family residence parcel currently in use. And to go to the next parcel we would propose the e type buffer. Again you can decide if that's appropriate or if it's not. Applicant would like to not ultimately have to provide those buffers and to be credited for the existing landscape that's there. That was a summary, if I have that wrong on the next page. Really the only condition that we differed on was number twelve that any required buffers would be per the LDC and the applicant would like to be able to seek waivers. We'd like the board to decide that that's what the board should do. Not staff. Again following up we've got 19 and 20. Number 19. Most if not all I think, of our special use permits. Staff would recommend that they run with the owner of the land. The applicant in this case is also the lessee of the property. There's no ownership right there. It's just a possession. Of the property. Currently the applicant would like it to run the special use permit to not just run with Miss Lynam. It would also include the existent tenant, which is RSJ Real Estate LLC. We were provided a right of first refusal, so I've included that in a handout that should have been on your desk when you sat down so that you could look over that. Essentially that gives the lessee the option to purchase the property. And number 20, this condition here says that the special use permit will terminate upon division, subdivision or transfer of the subject property. The applicant proposed that we put an exception in there that if the property transfers to the lessee that it would be allowed to continue with the lessee. So staff would like the board to be able to decide that and number 21, with just the addition and the modification of the timing and how long the special use permit is in effect. We had discussed the first renewal being for a period of ten years. So you're going to have almost three years until they come up for renewal. And then the applicant would like that first renewal to be for ten years and subsequent renewals to be for periods of five years. Again, staff would like the board to tell us what to do in that situation. Now here at the bottom we've got number 22, that is a new one that's proposed by the applicant. Staff does not agree with this. We've never done this for anyone else, but ultimately it's allowing this to renew administratively if they don't bring it forward. And staff would like that burden to continue to rest on the applicant to bring it forward again. I also have this provided it's what the LDC proposes for buffers in case that's helpful for reference. But otherwise, if you have any questions or concerns, I'll hand it over to the applicant. Any questions or concerns at the moment from staff or staff? If not, yes. Quick question. Right now they're asking for it for their private use, correct? Right. And they're asking for the buffers to be nothing, move forward with. It's in a historic area, so I think the applicant would like to continue that. There's been no complaints from the neighbors. However, it's not been used as a church and staff had a hard time imposing conditions on the use of a church. Ultimately, I think our concern was that it wouldn't be a venue for special events because this would not be an appropriate area for that in staff's opinion. Well, that was my question is if it moved from private use to more of general use for weddings and receptions or whatever, I'm sorry, Jenner. We were very careful to make sure that private use was a part of this, however, because staff was not sure how to maybe approach how to condition the operation of a church, whether private or public, as long as it's restoring to the original use. I think staff would be agreeable to that, as long as the board finds that appropriate. Mister Gooding, 31 southeast 36th Avenue for the applicant. Little background. Robbie Roberts is the principal behind this, and this is a sad story, but a person died in Marion county, and the family contacted the WAC and said she was a big black person and wanted to be buried in the rural area. So they started looking around for a private cemetery, and they came across this one. And the lady's not buried here, but Robbie saw it and saw the church there. The church is, as staff correctly pointed out, this is a big part of Marion county history for that part of the town, which is Germantown. The church started. The community grew up around the church, and so it was a big deal. Robbie saw the church. As you can see from the staff pictures, it's dilapidated. It's been used for storage. It's a mess. So Robbie signs a lease for that corner piece with the lady that lives over in the east half the residence. That gives him the right to renovate. The church goes down to the county to get a building permit, and they go, you can't get a building permit because church use is not allowed. Hence this process that we've started here today. So we file the application. We've worked out these conditions with staff, and really, if you could. If you could put them back up, there's really only two that we. That we disagree on. I think, as you can tell from staff, one is where these buffers are going to be. Can you show them the screen that's on the picture here? If you look to the right, we're proposing. The staff is proposing that the overall parcel be buffered, that the buffers be along the south there on the yellow and the green over there. And their position is it's all one tax parcel. And so we want to bring the whole property up into compliance. Not questioning their good motive here. But the fact of the matter is, we're not doing anything on that parcel. We don't even have the right to put the buffers there. But that's. Y'all shouldn't consider that. The only question for y'all is what buffers are appropriate. And we think that you ought to only look at the blue piece, because that's where this. That's where we're doing our work and we've put in here our conditions, that we're going to buffer the east side between us and the house. Unless Miss Lyman gives you all a letter that says she doesn't want to buffer there. She's already told us she doesn't want to buffer there because she likes to look at the church. But we're going to have to get that. And then we're proposing no buffer to the neighbors to the southe.",

have every opportunity because that's another public yeah that's the point of order Brad we used to and I I still think it's in our procedures and we can't take the same topics repetitively is there anything do you know Rick off top of your head so we'd have to do exercise or anything to do I don't think that was in the rules of procedure no it's not in the rules or procedures it's just a practice yeah and it's um no comments are allowed on items that are already on the agenda type of thing okay all right well that's all yeah well and so that's the other question for the uh let's see time place and manner sorry I need that I'll just clip this uh that's just a first reading so do we take public comment in a first reading I'm not even sure it's the first reading is it yeah yeah yes you don't you don't take public comment at that time so for what do you want to do for people who are signed up for public comment for the meeting of the first reading do we want we've let people speak before on other first but they're not part of the public hearing record right should we be telling them yeah I mean you have time let us know yeah you don't you don't need a public testimony at today at tonight's meeting on the first reading that's that's not a requirement but they can still we can't tell them not to talk about that issue in the public two-minute time frame you could I'm not sure I would go that route I you know that's really up to the but if they wanted to be in the pub in the yes it's not going to be part of the public record for that ordinance yes correct but it is in our meeting public record we will have heard it you will have yeah yeah and I have a question we cannot limit the five-minute time period at the end of the meeting can we say that that is a 30 minute time block as well yeah in fact in your rules it says at a maximum of 30 minutes total okay so I think Republic comment both periods close periods total yeah already in the front and 30 in the back 30 minutes total 30 minutes so we could oh right it says right on the agenda for the first one 10 minutes total yeah I know that right it does so it it's specifically States at the conclusion of all regular business limit to five minutes per person and a maximum 30 minutes total oh just for the five minute period for five minutes right yep okay right okay great so just one word verification yeah yeah but in my right we have two people who are going to talk about time-place so far yes so are we going to put them up front because we're dealing with time place the manager later we just hear what they have to say I think so and that's what I was planning on doing the uh Cornelius okay I'm okay with that okie dokie I don't I just wanted to tell my fellow Commissioners I appreciate this time of planning before we enter these meetings I think it it really it really helps the the way the meeting flows so thank you are there any other questions that Commissioners have on any of the items on tonight's agenda since I do a crummy job of checking that every single week inconsistent that way okay great well then good thing we have a shortened work session agenda because we needed that yes that's why I'm looking for my work session agenda now thank you the oops I clipped it in here anyway so as commissioner Phi was intimating uh at me we have the letter that was included in the packet today would anyone like to speak to that so this is a letter this is a letter in support of a grant that's being led by the city of Tualatin and coordination with a number of other jurisdictions they're looking to go after some federal funding for charging infrastructure and in particular uh getting that located at housing locations and their community and trying to partner with some other adjacent communities as well for a similar purpose and they were just looking for a letter of support from the county and support that I'd like briefly I wouldn't live in DC the jpac group went one way and there was a few of us went to another room in one of the participants was I think illuminate from uh to Alton and uh this was a an exciting proposal because there's where they're citing these are interesting low-income and multi-family locations I think there's either four or five counties who are signed on and but 14 to 15. maybe I misunderstood I think I think they were made by the cities they may be partnering I believe with Clackamas County and Washington County as well too oh that could be yeah yeah I thought he said Marion but maybe I misunderstood oh maybe oh shortest five minutes I've experienced today uh commissioner Rogers and um and board I was also in that meeting where um the city of Tualatin presented this they had someone who was representing the office that is focused from a joint usdot uh and the U.S department of energy they're working with a number of cities specifically in putting the application in those cities represent five counties um along the I-84 and IO I-5 corridor from Portland all the way down into I think Woodburn is the Terminus so it's throughout that Regional area that's what this grant would be supporting is putting in charging stations at those multi-family focused on low-income pursuant to the Federal grant requirements and they're just asking us to provide a letter of support of their Grant application as they beef up the number of letters of support to boost the um support for the grant so we can bring this Federal money in there's no other further request from us yeah it's a good project they're not asking for us for any money at all just to be a participant with them I think city of Portland is on that letter is that right they are on the grant yes yeah yeah okay 16 neighboring okay not the counties themselves yeah I think it's a great idea I just have one uh question uh in the second paragraph Washington county is a member of the partners for sustainable Washington County community group and very much supports these efforts from our members I I support very much support the efforts from member jurisdictions that will benefit the entire but I don't know why we're speaking to the partners for sustainable Washington County as this board's never received any information uh over the years on the work of the group so I don't see any reason why okay our board letters should be referencing that okay yeah I think it was just a nod to the fact that we do coordinate on some of these issues certainly on try to try to help do the right thing but we'll we'll take that I just don't see how it strengthens the letter unless you and your team need it mentioned for some reason like would this effort have really come about through that group and this engagement um no I mean it it extends Beyond but certainly I think having those relationships built uh certainly helps facilitate when opportunities like this arise getting engaged with the partner partner jurisdictions I'm neither here nor there on it doesn't in fact it just notes that um if you're going to put something on our letter you might want to make sure we have some engagement with it that's an easy enough amendment can deal with that either okay super great all right thank you all righty for one and only one Big Ticket agenda item I haven't a clue what it's going to be about transfer of administration of special non-tax assessments whether he has a a tree planted in a park in Eugene his honor because he's died asking that you're asking that I am not a clue what you're talking about you want to ask some ask it pre-planted in his honors you have a tree in a Eugene planted in your honor for your death so I I so I had some I had a my high school reading is coming up here pretty soon and so somebody reached out to me and they said we're so glad that you were and we had thought you had died and I end up getting contact information from a bunch of people in high school with and they even planted a tree in my own so the death the reports of my death are greatly over yeah so they sent me a uh a snap of the the death notice and everything was right except the middle name yeah same age everything yeah wow so at the reunion I was like Mr Rogers that I thought I might just go as Lazarus uh okay well thank you that's a little bit of humor before we start here uh so chair Harrington Board of Commissioners thank you for some time this afternoon my name is the County's treasurer and she and Chief Financial Officer I'm here today with uh Joe Nelson director of assessment Taxation and Courtney Duke audreyson our Deputy County Council so you might be wondering why we have all three of us up here it's essentially just the transition of a relatively small task within the county but because of the complexity and history of the county and our state law it requires that we bring us to you so that's why all three of us are here purpose of this presentation is to provide the board with background information on historical management of the local improvement district assessments those are our non-tax assessments and other liens in favor Washington County staff will provide the board information on a proposal to transfer the administration of these assessments from our assessment taxation Department to the Department of Finance the desired outcome is that the board will authorize staff to proceed with necessary changes in the Washington County code by two separate ordinances to establish procedures for the management and use of a centralized Washington County lean docket by Finance consistent with Oregon state law to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of tracking and collecting certain judgments assessments and liens in favor of the county and to allow the documents entered in the lean docket to be recorded in a county lien record maintained by the county clerk and I think I'll hand it over to you so um I think Greg just went through these questions that they will return to these at the um at the end of the presentation just essentially should we move this function from departments department and what other information does your board need before we bring you those action items who's our County Clerk and what position does the person hold County Clerk Jones thank you",

        "text": " it could be sustainability targets that have to do locally sited generation or locally manufactured components in any of these benefits could be valued by the customer in the price that they pay for that for that generation the customer would be able to contract directly with the generator receive that power so that so the green tariff options that are facilitated by the utilities right now we have the voluntary renewable energy tariffs for large customers under house bill 2021 there's also the pros the possibility as was mentioned by an earlier presenter of expanding this to municipalities and community green power options so that would allow the potentially would allow a small-scale renewable energy project to set the price that is necessary to make it whole and if the community is willing to pay that price that would be a way to bring that additional compensation to that project so in terms of rate impact of small-scale renewable energy generation acquisition of new energy can can cause an increase in rates but when we look at the rate impact we're kind of depends on how that compensation is being paid by the utility how the generation is being compensated by the utility customers and how that compares to an alternative way to achieve those same benefits to the utility system utility customers will typically pay rates that cover the cost of acquiring and delivering that energy in a reliable manner and in compliance with state policy are ways to realize the additional societal benefits of community-based projects and some examples of those include include the department of energy small-scale renewable energy grants so state state funding to help bring down the capital costs or low-income loan i'm sorry low rate low interest rate loan programs the community solar program offers these rates higher than avoided cost rates and does have capacity in the program for that's carved out for small-scale projects so that presents an opportunity and then the green tariff option that i mentioned i'll also note i think it was eric in his presentation noted that under house bill 2021 the utilities will be creating clean energy plans that describe how they will comply with the greenhouse gas reduction requirements that the state has set those include an element of assessing resilience and so i'll just mention it's not on this slide but the docket number for that is um and there have been a couple workshops staff and some consultants particularly national labs are working to um to assess the non-energy of the clean energy plans and also a risk-based examination of resilience in the plan so um 2225 would be a docket to engage in if you're interested in tracking that so i think that is all that i will mention i didn't include a slide with my contact information but i am on the email distribution list and i would welcome um follow-up inquiries from anybody via email great thanks keisha um i think we mostly have comments um okay versus questions in that spot um there was just a note from angela that i'll read additional context for rvos she says oregon's value is lower than any other state because it does not reflect the full value solar brings this is in part why it's not currently being used as it actually undervalues solar then james adds it's also his understanding that technically the only current statutory use of rbos will be at the end of the volumetric incentive rate program for the ongoing generation those um and then um eric anderson from pac um just mentions that the 2.2 megawatt solar facility is actually owned by investors and is participating in the market in california and there is also a 300 kilowatt net metering project at the airport so he was just adding some details there um any questions for keisha other than those comments people are excited to take their break thank you all right thank you so much keisha um so we'll go ahead and take that 10 minutes um why don't we just if that works for you stephanie reconvene at 11 35 sounds good okay we'll see you all then all right it's 11 35. i still have a few bites in my lunch lot so hopefully you had the time you needed stephanie i think i'll turn it straight over to you sounds good all right now we could do like a little like hey give a thumbs up or whatever if you're back kind of thing just to like see that we have a good number of people because if we're going straight to breakouts i want to make sure we have everybody so yeah do some sort of like indicator that as long as we see a good number of faces or thumbs up we'll go ahead and get started oh maggie has a maggie's raising her hand to tell us she's here okay sorry i was like oh my gosh a question sorry i'm just excited all right i think we're good all right so now we're going to move into our breakout groups like we've done in the prior workshops um we're going to do two of them today so the first one is going to focus on benefits so in within your breakout group we want to focus on benefits that are unique to small skill renewable energy projects and we're going to break these into categories um the direct economic impacts indirect those kind of trickle down economic impacts that um you know we talk a lot about like the multiplier effect type of stuff um health impacts climate impacts resilient impacts any other impacts to the community at large however you guys want to view it we're going to come back and we're going to put it into a table that we can then utilize in the final report and the next workshop we're going to do the same thing for costs after this so linda whenever you're ready to break us out into our groups it's gonna be about 20 minutes christina sorry grampies i didn't see a we're almost done thing i should have worn it all right am i getting this right that rob's gonna moderate and stephanie's yes so i'm trying to get my screen back up here um so here we go so essentially we're hoping to have each group um share what they came up with and i'm gonna try in live time we'll see how it goes um to insert them into this uh little graphic here so each group will present on the benefit that they identified which category it falls into if it's unique to small scale or not um who the beneficiary of this would be and then any other comments that you might so does group one want to go if anybody remembers if they're in group one hey stephanie i was in group one i'd love it if somebody else in the group wanted to um kind of give an overview but i'm happy to do so if uh if needed yeah and also maybe i think it might be self-evident but um i just got a chat from someone that was in one of the groups that just got in they were like late coming back somehow so you might just want to see what we're doing again okay yeah just each group is going to be presenting um and i'm going to be typing in the benefit that they came up with the category it falls into if it's economic climate resiliency other if it's unique specific to small scale or not who the beneficiary of that benefit would be it can be the community at large state of oregon the world that kind of stuff or any other comments you have about that benefit that you'd like to mention all right jessica did anybody volunteer from your group or is it you i think it might be me i said dan briefly up here but then he turned off his camera which i think is the international sign for please not me um so i'm happy to report back uh so in our group we talked a lot about that it may appear and to be determined if we can get enough data that resilience has um some of the biggest impacts and several of these are uh really focused on the the help that local communities are gonna need and outages and um it was it was pointed out that even in some relatively small events like ice storms and wildfires we've had people without power for considerable lengths of time um and so in a major disruption like something like the cascadia um that kind of thing would become very that were um you know there's some as a part of that there's some indirect economic impacts that go with that which is when you lose power you can lose goods for instance um corvallis had a local grocery store that was affected by a substation disruption that took it took four or five days to get parts in so that they couldn't fix so the you know indirect economic impacts are those things that could as a result of not having power excuse me direct economic impact um there's a lot of communities that are interested in the jobs or the um effects that having local generation could have on them for example when you are when you're putting in your own local generation that might be creating local jobs to help maintain and install that generation or uh when you have um businesses for instance that are small businesses and tend to operate during the day having solar could offset quite a bit of their power needs um especially if that's when they're the most active that variability of solar not being available at night might not be as big a and then um i'm kind of looking through the notes here um in economic direct economic opportunities and as renewables become the standard across the country and around the world um those places that have invested in renewables um businesses renewables development businesses will be the leaders and therefore have the jobs associated with it was mentioned you know oregon was a loss for the timber industry there was a lot of jobs lost with that and this could be an opportunity to help regain some of that footing that we lost there and then as you know the costs go down for solar uh this is sort of an indirect cost as a cost go down for solar this may be an opportunity to help offset other um fossil fuel generation needs and um i'll ask grant to um correct me if i'm wrong because we didn't directly discuss this but i think he was referring to things such as um maybe you have backup power that's through um fossil fuel generator and maybe solar and storage would be an opportunity to help offset that or potentially fuel your vehicle if you have an electric vehicle or something like that and i think as far as direct benefits that is the and so i'll ask dan grant and theodora is there anything i've missed that you want to flag for the i think you got it i think you got it as well thank you",

information reports so we are adjourned thank you so much call this meeting of the Salem City Council for Monday July 10 2023 to order if the recorder will please call the counselor Stapleton I'm here councilor nishioka here councilor Phillips here councilor Gwen here councilor Gonzalez counselor Hoy here councilor Nordike here councilor Varney here bear Hoy here all right uh Vice chairs or council president Stapleton do we have any additions or deletions to the agenda not tonight wrong meeting thank you it's time for Council and city manager do we have any I think the city manager wanted to lead off with a couple of items so I'll turn it over to see manager Staley I would love to it is my honor where is uh Chief still in the room uh it is my honor to introduce uh two new Deputy police Chiefs they were sworn in earlier today I was honored to be at that presentation and excited to be able to be here and be part of presenting them to the community I was lucky enough to participate in the interview process a couple of weeks ago and we had an impressive group of candidates present their qualifications for these two positions and frankly I think we could have chosen any one of them and they would have succeeded we're fortunate enough to be able to choose the best of them and I'm excited where they're going to take this community and organization and the the support that they're going to be able to provide to the Chief and moving forward he has not had a full Command Staff for nearly his entire time here as the police chief so this is is an exciting consolidation and I am just thrilled to be able to turn this over to the Chief and have him introduce these two or two Deputy Chiefs thank you city manager yeah mayor council thank you for a moment of time to talk tonight as uh Mr Staley talked about it's a very exciting moment for the police department and our community with the promotion of two new Deputy Chiefs from within the within the police department they went through a pretty rigorous competitive process this month in the making each one had at least four months to serve in an acting deputy chief role before they went through this competitive selection process which included outside assessors outside of organization and several community members were involved in a selection process so I know they're well deserved well-earned promotions for these two I have with me here today if you'll gentlemen step forward deputy chief Brandon ditto he's here he served with the police department now for over 17 years his last assignment was within our Support Division and that's the division that he'll now be leading as a deputy chief he oversaw our personnel and training section so all the training for the Department administrative internal investigations and so forth and our agency accreditation so he's very very familiar with our department and that side of the house and he'll be leading that Division I also have deputy chief Trevin upkeys with me some of you may recognize him from his past work as our Pio so he was a public face of the department for many years Trevin serves has served for over 19 years in law enforcement he started from California for a bit before he came back to his home state here in Oregon to work for Salem and raise his family his last assignment was in our field Operations Division as a shifts commander and that's the division he'll now be running at the deputy chief level we have three divisions within the police department so two of your Deputy Chiefs new Deputy Chiefs are here now not too long ago I also promoted a third deputy chief Jacob Burke who couldn't make it tonight but he's in charge of our investigations division so we have a completely new executive team as part of my executive leadership team at the police department so I'm happy this team's in place I know we have the right people and I'm excited about the progress we're going to make together so thank you both and I'd like to welcome them to their new race yeah I'd like to take a moment too uh to talk a little bit about assistant chief skip Miller is here in the room other side where'd he go there he is in the corner over there skip thank you for all your service so one of the reasons we have one of these vacancies here is that I'm feeling is because a long-term member of our department uh skip Miller is retiring Thursday this week's his last day so we'll be having a retirement ceremony for him uh thanking him for his year service he's uh served with Salem Police Department for over 25 years so he's one of the longest terms or if not the most senior member of the department very close and notably he served at the executive leadership level as a deputy chief for now as an assistant chief for about almost 10 years so most of that was over our field Operations Division so all sorts of complex emergency responses and incidents he's handled over the years and for me uh now after chief here for two and a half years Skip's just been an invaluable asset with his institutional knowledge helping me transition in as the new leader of the organization so skip I just want to give you a heartfelt thanks um and and thank skip here too for his years of service thank you thank you Chief and congratulations Deputy Chiefs Deputy Chiefs and congratulations especially to assistant chief Miller congratulations on your retirement do you have anything else no sir all right are there any other any counselor comments counselor Nordike thank you Mr Mayor good evening one and all the Salem public library teen Advisory Board is accepting applications and that normally doesn't sound like a big newsworthy event but the Future Leaders of Salem most likely have been were born here and Will are raised here and will become our future leaders and so I encourage everyone especially to the kids out there who feel that they don't belong that this is one of many opportunities out there for you to build leadership and once upon time I was on the Salem youth advisory commission myself a different entity which no longer exists but it helped Inspire my passion for public service so believe it when I say that there are opportunities out there for young people to start sharing to start participating government to start engaging so it may seem like a small thing but that's how things often next I see on our information reports tonight that we have a request from our Planning Commission the Planning Commission is requesting that we fund a feasibility study for renewable energy at the Salem airport and I am fully supported this concept I serve on the airport advisory committee and we know that there is tremendous change of foot at our airport and at this one sleepy little town that I grew up in is rapidly growing indeed and I'm proud to support the effort to bring commercial air service to Salem I also note that we have unanimous support from the Planning Commission it's an esteemed group of folks from across the city of Salem who dedicate a lot of time pouring over our documents much thicker than the stacks that I have before me tonight so I encourage my peers on Council to be supportive of this request I think it's well founded and investing in renewable energy at the airport makes perfect sense to me and last but not least on a personal note I recently helped celebrate my father's 78th birthday he has been an attorney and small business owner right here in Salem for well over 50 years so happy Birthday Dad thank you counselor any other comments counselor Vernie thank you very much mayor Roy a couple of things here in West Salem has a new Street mural um and it's on the corner of Kingwood and 2nd Street it's called Water's Edge and it depicts depicts it's beautiful it depicts a circular River with salmon swimming in it and it has native Nuku roses an osprey and a tree and swallowtail butterflies and I wanted to say thank you very much for the thousand dollar Grant from travel Salem the Edgewater partnership the West Salem neighborhood association artist Kristin Coons and Stephanie juanio for make and many other neighbors for making it um and another thing uh mayor Hoy and counselor Stapleton and I attended the Women's Suffrage marker unveiling last Thursday at the capital state park and there's a marker it was to commemorate a marker the content on the marker notes are State suffrage history and Oregon's ratification of the 19th Amendment which gave women the right to vote Nationwide I was surprised and it was wonderful to learn how persistent oregonians are it took six attempts for women to finally achieve full voting rights in Oregon and that occurred in 1912 the first attempt was in 1884. so I thought that was very very uh persistent definitely and then lastly I wanted to mention an encounter I had it safe way in West Salem last weekend I was standing in to check out and there was a man in front of me who was disheveled and he had his backpack in a cart and he had a a bottle of Mountain Dew and a banana that he wanted to purchase and he set them down there and then he he dug this crumpled dollar bill out of his pocket and a bunch of change and he didn't have enough to pay for both items and uh so he paid for his bottle of Mountain Dew and he had started to move out and then I leaned over to the cashier and asked if I could go ahead and purchase the banana and he said sure So I did that and then the guy left um headed out of the store as I was actually headed out of the store after checking out this man who was obviously disabled he'd probably been using the cart to help hold him up as well as carry his backpack he was coming back into the store and he put his card away in the um said very neatly and I was just amazed because I really thought about that when I walked out in the parking lot there at Safeway and saw eight shopping carts scattered either in empty spots or in the landscaped areas or on the sidewalks and it made me really start thinking about people who claim about others being irresponsible or not held accountable or whatever and you I look out there and I really wonder how many of them think about that if they're the ones that are leaving their carts out there so I just wanted to say that thank you thank you counselor any other comments counselor nishioka thank you mayor Hoy um I just",

corps and idaho power we're not sure if pge was on the line or not also there are representatives of independent power producers and and members of the public as well so we received some good input but i think we probably will get a lot more input once we have some kind of draft rules for people to evaluate at least that was our assessment so next week we have a specific meeting with the coquille tribe about this rule and then we'll be coming back to council in the near future with some um proposed ideas or proposed language so i think this one will take some time but you know we don't have any draft uh rule language yet council member condon if you had any thoughts based on the meeting please share them otherwise um i just have one more item um my only comment is uh chris um leads a great meeting i mean he he leads really quite well and um is really respectful to everybody and so it's always a pleasure to see him thank you for the and lastly the next council meeting uh dates are the february 24th and 25th we've determined that we will only need friday the 25th and currently i have all council members listed as being available for the friday the 25th but if you have any conflicts um that you didn't know about have any uh between now and then please let me know but right now it appears that we do have the ability to have a hi this is marcy and as long as my contract gets passed by then i have no fingers crossed thank you madam chair that concludes my secretary report unless any council members have i hear no questions so thank you mr secretary we will move on to agenda item b which is the annual financial assurance update we have cecily fleming odo fiscal ready to present sicily the floor is unfair this yours wally sicily are you able to hear us looks like she is not muted let me try to message her thank you can you hear me now yes now can you hear me or a messenger no i can't hear anything we can hear you but we can't see you any thoughts wally can you hear me now yes yes just got you back you can yay oh my gosh i do not know what's happening can you hear us he told me i can and now you can hear me yes good fantastic i have no idea what happened all of the test things told me that it working and it was not so i apologize for that that was a fun little um way to get your heart beating before presentation it's all right we are all used to this by now so not your fault don't worry about it all right so wally if you wouldn't mind running the slides for me so i don't have any more technical difficulties i would appreciate that there's only a couple here all right well good morning terrible members of the council for the record i am cicely fleming the fiscal analyst for the sighting division i am before you this morning to present the department's recommended financial institution list and bond and letter of credit templates for use in 2022 as you are aware before a facility may begin construction a bond or letter of credit must be on file with the department to ensure the state has the resources to return the site to its non-hazardous pre-construction condition should the site certificate holder fail to comply with the retirement standard the bond or letter of credit is to be issued from an institution and in a form satisfactory to counsel to satisfy this requirement and for the convenience of the site certificate holders council considers a list of financial institutions to pre-approve his issuers in the form of the bond and letter of credit templates annually these documents can be found in your meeting materials the next slide wally please the proposed list of financial institutions includes the issuers that were approved by council for use in 2021 with one edition as part of its preliminary application for site certificate west end solar energy project submitted a letter from sumitomo mitsui banking corporation expressing a willingness to issue a letter of credit for the project so we've included it for consideration in credit rating credit ratings were researched earlier this month for all of the firms and further evaluated by john hobbs project development officer from the department's loan development division who concluded that each of them demonstrate sufficient financial strength to act as issuers for coverage required by the state and just a side note for the benefit of our newest council members in order to meet the retirement and financial assurance standard an applicant must demonstrate their ability to obtain a bond or a letter of credit which is typically provided from a firm like or excuse me typically a letter provided from the firm like the one we received for the western solar energy project this letter may be provided from an institution that is not on the council's pre-approved list and still meet the standard of approval however if a site certificate then holder then seeks to obtain financial assurance from that prior to beginning construction they must must first request and receive council approval to be in compliance with their site certificate conditions so are there any questions on that before i move on to the proposed template updates all right next slide will you please uh this is cindy conden uh just a quick question related to the statement you just made about um if an uh site applicant um includes an institution that is not on the list they may be approved um what's the that we do with respect to to those i mean those institutions i know they may not provide the financial instrument but is their background check yes and that's we do that actually annually as well and whenever a new institution is proposed to be added so we research the credit ratings with each of the four major firms s p moody's and best and fitch i think i'm recalling them all properly there um and then so we research all the credit ratings there make sure that they have um the top three categories of ratings and then john hobbs who's our project development officer he further evaluates all of their qualifications um as well their long-term credit ratings all of the more in-depth um criteria and qualifications if you will to ensure that they have the coverage or the the financial strength required okay and just a quick follow-up to that is there is there any information related to bonds or letters of credit which have been issued when it came time to act on those to affect them that they were declined or there was um there was a refusal to do so no we do not have any experience with that at this point we have not had a call on any of the bonds or letters of well i mean as a part of the background check i mean it may be private oh i see i understand what you're saying there there's never been a time that we have went to call on something and deemed that it was unviable but we have i think it was maybe three or four years ago when we did this evaluation one of the firms um we did drop from the list because their credit ratings were no longer satisfactory fortunately at that time we did not have any um i believe it was a bank so we didn't have any letters of credit on hand that had been issued by them when um we removed it from the list but had we had anything on hand at that time we would have been asking the site certificate holder to find a suitable yeah and i'm sorry i don't think i'm making myself clear when we review the financial institutions is there any information asked for or received with respect to of the bonds or letters of credit they have outstanding or have had outstanding when the beneficiary when a beneficiary has made a claim have they refused those um that is not information i've okay thank you but i'd be happy to do some research and get back to you on that if you'd like um thank you i'm guessing it's it might be private information but to me it's critical given these are long-term bonds and letters of credit i realize are annual but um it's for an event years out so it just strikes me the experience of the financial institutions and their refusal to to meet the obligation might be an important piece of information definitely i will look into that and see you know if that's something that actually impacts their long-term credit rating and everything else because those are pieces that we evaluate but whether or not what the scenario that you speak of plays into that is a really great question and i'd be happy to do some further research okay thank you appreciate it okay so for the templates get back to my notes here the first update is for the bond um so next slide while i have we're on the bond template i've moved my screen so i can't actually see what we're looking at here perfect actually just back one i think we have the bond first there we go perfect all right back to my notes so council last updated its bond template in august 2021 to provide that the bond will not expire but may be cancelled by the surety with 120 days and that the surety will become liable for payment if the certificate holder does not provide an acceptable replacement for the bond at least 30 days before the cancellation date based on council discussion during that section 6 of the proposed bond template for 2022 displayed in part on this slide requires that a certificate holder must provide an acceptable replacement 60 days instead of the 30 days before the cancellation date this change affords this affords 60 days for the certificate holder to secure and provide an acceptable replacement and then 60 days for the state to draw on the bond if necessary which should be sufficient time for both parties to take action and that's the only change that's proposed to the bond template right now so if there are any questions on that we'll move on to the letter of thank you um this is cindy and i did have a conversation with um todd the other day about this and i i think this is great a great a great change and one we've talked about at length but i wonder if there will be opportunity to talk about some other issues related to it that we might address later yeah i think before we move on to the letter of credit um yeah i don't know if there's a quick and easy way if",

        "text": " in that order in the pcco the alj ruled that the county setback is not required by Statewide planning goals since it's not required by Statewide goals the setback is not one of the applicable substantive criteria that Council must require an applicant to comply with in this exception the county argues that the alj was precluded from making that ruling because of an offhand remark that the first alj had made in the issues the county is referring to the November 2nd order on petitions for party status and issues for a contested case the purpose of those orders are procedural not substantive those orders established whether people seeking to participate in the case meet the requirements for participation did they sufficiently raise their issue uh uh on the record of the DPO those orders established whether partition petitioners participate in the contested case as a limited or a full party and they established the phrasing or the framing of the issues for the contested case they don't serve as rulings on the issues the main issue in this case is whether or not this uh the Criterion three the setback is required by the the hearing officer made an offhand remark the issue before was not before her she wasn't being asked to address whether Council has jurisdiction that was not an issue that the county raised no one talked about that before that order was issued she made an offhand remark when you make an offhand remark that isn't necessary for you to resolve what's before you when a judge does does it that's called dictum and it's not binding in the case that's what happened here that's clearly what the second alj felt because she proceeds she didn't act as if the contested case can't proceed she proceeded analyze the substantive issues ruled against the county as far as the appeals quickly that rule says this the hearing officer's determination on a request to participate as a party or a limited party is final unless it's appealed within seven days that's what has to be appealed within seven days a ruling on a request to participate as a party or limited party that's not that's not what's at issue that's all that's the extent of that of what needs to be appealed within seven days thank you Nancy can you put the slide the next slide back up or is that um yeah it should be yeah the next one called uh Council straw poll excuse me before you continue uh Patrick just because will you please um tell me the word that you used when you said she made the offhand remark victim thank you yes and uh with uh the applicant uh not addressing this issue at this time it really is an opportunity now for the council to um whether you have questions first of all about what you've heard um and whether you're you you know based on what you've heard you feel that it would be appropriate for to make any um changes or you know as an option indicated there number two any specific changes with regard to this exception um if you're comfortable with the conclusions reached by the alj and the proposed contested case order which agrees with the proposed order recommended by the department of energy thank you if the if the elj hadn't made their is there any difference how the case would have proceeded it seems to me that it would have proceeded exactly the same is that counselor Condon thank you for that comment Wendy Killington for for Umatilla County the the determination was a jurisdictional determination which the rules require and so we expected that a determination on jurisdiction would be made so it's not dicta and so the case would have gone very differently had the the alj determined that the scope of F6 jurisdiction included making that determination as you know are our our motions or summary to the County's motions for summary determination explained in some detail that the council doesn't have jurisdiction to review a determination made by the special Advisory Group regarding the identification of the applicable substantive criteria that only the Oregon Supreme Court has that Authority that that part of the case had the alj ruled otherwise not been there it just would have been different council members Tim McMahon for the record uh procedural question are we going to have back and forth argument after the presentation of each exception I don't think that's within the anticipated process that was laid out in the agenda for these proceedings and it's going to take a very long time if we're going to argue back and forth on every single single exception so I do object to that happening here yeah I think at this point it certainly is an opportunity for the council to ask questions and if I as counsel to the council can provide any clarification regarding you know what you're considering that is what I'm here for I would ask in the future that uh we pause before anyone else jumps in at that um so with regard to the the this exception does any any member of the council have a question that you'd like well we'll kind of consider the order globally at the end of this process and so you are not that we're not asking you to in the straw poll you know make that final uh determination about whether you believe any specific changes are are necessary throughout the whole thing but just on this exception is there anything that that uh anyone has concerns about or should we move on um okay the straw poll if you can facilitate that that would be helpful if I'd check secretary Cornett yeah so just to clarify again sort of three options one you agree with the proposed test a case order findings in fact conclusions of law with regards to this one issue um you know agree with the proposed contested case order with potential changes or do not agree with the contested case order um in this matter so just to get your sins moving forward as was indicated we can you know broadly revisit the proposed contested case order at the end but I think this will get a sort of piecemeal that way it's um you know another couple of hours you know it'll be hard to go back and sort of sift through all the details of each of these so I think in this incremental way of doing the straw poll helps us sort of establish where you're where you're at um at these these particular so any thoughts on what your I agree with what you just said as far as the procedure and from the standpoint for straw bolt do you want us to verbally do that do it yeah I mean I can I can read it but I want to know where you're going so I can read the correct one oh I would be in support of agreeing with the findings of fact and so forth for the right code counselor buyer I would agree with the findings effect and conclusions of law in the proposed contested case order as Cindy Condon and I would agree as this is Jordan Truitt I agree Marcy Grail I agree this may sound like the most unusual response but I agree but I want to keep my options open based on further testimony sure um yeah so I think verbally I heard from everybody essentially uh your straw poll is with number one I will make note of that and I don't need to call roll thank you for that uh with that we can move to the next slide um this grouping relates to you Matilda County's exceptions B sub 2 and B sub 3. I'm going to read each of them Criterion 3 is an applicable substantive Criterion ors-469504 and oar 345 22 30 sub 3. and the proposed contested case order erroneously asserts that it is not an applicable substitute Criterion because it is not required by the Statewide planning goals that is the first exception in this grouping that the county presents the second Odo and fsec do not have jurisdiction to review or reverse the special advisory group's identification of Criterion 3 as an applicable substitute Criterion these are grouped together because as you can see they both relate to the issue of Criterion three and it's uh whether it's an applicable substantive with that we can give the county an opportunity to address these two Wellington again representing Umatilla this exception has as grouped by the department has two pieces who gets to decide what the applicable substantive criteria are and then who reviews that determination and then there's a third part and then regardless of who reviews does goal 2 require the county to adopt ordinances including Criterion three and our answer to that is yes with regard to the first again your PowerPoint that we've provided the statute says the elected governing body of Umatilla counties the special Advisory Group it says that when they go to the trouble of identifying applicable substantive criteria that the fsec is required to apply it and the first alj of course is we just went through got it right that said you know under that scheme under statutory scheme epsec doesn't have authority to review that determination rather the sole authority to make the determination at this level is with the governing body and of course here the second scenario that applies says that once the once the governing body's done that they've identified a standard such as Criterion three it must be it shall be applied so there's this particular statute Oris 469-5048 that says that the County's identification of the applicable substantive criteria and I quote shall be subject to judicial review only as provided by 469-403 and that's the Oregon Supreme Court but instead the pcco wrongly purports to review the governing body's determination accordingly under orus 469-5048 that was improper with regard to the merits the alj the plcc correctly says that the two-mile setback established by the governing body is not an applicable substantive criteria but what is the description of an applicable substantive criteria the administrative rule says its criteria from the affected local government's acknowledged comprehensive plan that's the county and land use ordinances that are required by the Statewide planning goals and that are on the effect in effect on the date the applicant submits the application State statutes are the same the two-mile setback meets that description the two-mile setback was in effect when the application was filed and it is required by at least goal two whose purpose is to establish a land use planning process and policy framework for the basis of all decisions affecting land use goal to expressly requires counties to hold public hearings of evaluate information from the public in public hearings and make ultimate policy choices based upon their citizens social economic energy and environmental needs and then to reflect those local determinations in plans that and I quote shall be the basis for specific implementation measures I.E Criterion 3. Criterion three the two mile setback does exactly what goal 2 requires the county",

        "text": " you to number one of the alternative conditions in table one, the south pod. All right, the south pod setbacks. If the setbacks are a concern, where we change those south pod setbacks from 10ft to 50ft at the southeast corner, which is the. See if I can make this work. I can and you guys make. So you are recommending from ten to 50ft, we're okay on that south pod, only on the west side you are concerned. That's all. It's. The north pod's too small. Right. Which is that north. Right on the highway. You can't see it now. This is now the south pod. On the north pod, we would like to stay at 10ft because obviously it's very small. And that even though it's adjacent to the greenway is a commercial corridor, the greenway has a billboard adjacent to it on which that there's a line. So he's going to help me now. He's going to judge me while he's doing and he's going to judge me while he's doing it. Now I don't feel as bad. So the north pod we would prefer to leave alone the south pod now, which is being shown, what you can see where it says no green, no buffer to Greenway and no buffer to Greenway. Those two legs. Those two legs on the greenway, we would be okay with and make sure I'm correct, the setback of 50ft. So we would acquiesce to that condition for sure, because it doesn't impact us. It's really in that portion. It's only the buffer that we're concerned with, not the setback. And the reason for, just contextually, why we're concerned with the buffer, to buffer in that portion, even with staffs, recommend. Well, our conversation with staffs today, which was like a reduced buffer, the bill for that segment for the south pod is $65,000 for canopy trees, $22,000 for shrubs, $9,000 for mulch and $15,000 for irrigation. It's $111,000 to buffer that little segment along the greenway, which is essentially never to create any benefit, on top of which it creates a long term maintenance issue for the property owner to maintain buffer. The buffer is the greenway. That's our purpose. And the buffer shall be and remain that way. And pardon parcel of why this is such an attractive site for this type of use. There's no security issues, no noxious use issues. It's strictly going to be this and this forever on both sides. Fortunately, now it's working. I did it, Chris. So the 50 foot setback is not. They're not backing off. Setback is different than the buffer. What I will notice out of the comprehensive plan, it says having setbacks along the greenway, the lander on code then establish that it would be a 50 foot setback for all structures. There are exceptions for historic parcels of record, like the single family lots and silver spring shores. And it does note that someone can seek variants for hardship, for instance, for particular property. But as a pud, they can propose an alternative setback arrangement. Which staff has a concern about the ten foot setback, especially around the notch area that's between the north and south pods, for instance. And that was hesitation from the greenway staff in discussions with them. That's why I anticipated that maybe some more discussions with them, maybe bring us all the party's clarity. Let me be clear, Mister Rosin. Staff's recommendation was the connecting strip only had the ten foot. That's y'all's recommendation. So all we're really talking about now is just the south pod in which we will, we acquiesce, we concede, we'll give the 50ft. And I'm going to give this to staff just so they can. I mean, it is labeled alternative condition number two. So changing in the south pod going from ten to 50ft. And just to let you know what he's referencing. Yeah, please. Is this boundary here not showing the map up again. This boundary here, that's 50. Then that boundary there, both those boundaries are 50. Correct? Correct. That's what he has marked here. As we go through the little narrow piece that connects one to the other. Never done this before. We're going to give you a hand or change. We just gave Mister risen the same one. And we'll give it to the clerk's office. I got it. There's that. So that you guys can just see that. So going right back, which matches staff's recommendation. Okay, interject something incorrect. And your staff has a ten foot setback on this little narrow piece. Correct? Correct. Because we do understand a larger setback there would rendered pointer unuseful. So now on the south side they are green for 50 and 50. So the remaining is only one boundary. Right. So basically what we're, what we're really concerned about is that north little section up there on the highway. And that's where again, your input is, is what part of why you're here now. Yeah. So mister, and I don't mean to interrupt you, but you're okay right now, that 50 foot set back on the south. So Mister London just corrected me. So it's on the southeast side of the south pod going from 10ft to 50ft. So I marked two things. I marked the northeast side and the southeast side, that is to say the southeast side, which is the facing the larger section of the greenway, which is showing right now. 25 is that. That's the one right there. So now it's a 50ft. 50ft, yes sir. Then next one is that one. That's going to be. That's 10ft. Yes sir. And then the connecting strip is ten. And then north pot is ten. But those are all the portions. There we go. The connecting strip is this small strip that connects them only with a driveway. Yes sir. And then the north piece is only the portion which is. That's. That's already got a b two. Zoning. It already is used for a commercial purpose. It's proposed for commercial purpose and has to be correct. It's only the southeast portion of the south pod is what we're talking about. He's going back to 50ft. And the rest others along the greenway would remain ten per our requested alternative condition. All right, anyone else have any additional questions? Have any more questions? I was getting kind of convoluted. Let's bring it back to this board for discussion. Danny, if you have a question, my personal opinion is get back with staff between now and commission meeting working out. We had it one way and then Mister London had to correct you. It's not the whole south. Because when you said yes, when I asked is it 50ft on the south pod? And then we changed that back to 10ft on the one side of it. But with all that said and the difference and everything, my personal opinion is you guys work it out between now and the. Well, mister, appreciate that. However, the kind of recommendation comes from this board. Staff makes a recommendation to this board and to the commission, and seldom does that change between now and the commission. In fact, very seldom. Right. However, this board is going to make a recommendation based upon their own conditions. So the proposed alternative condition, which we're kind of doing on the fly as a concession to make. That's not to be corrected. It's simply to say we'll acquiesce. I mean, we will acquiesce on that south pod to say that there is that southeast leg, which is the one of the largest concern. It's the longest leg. It's the leg that faces the predominant portion of the old growth greenway. Right. That's the one at issue. And that's the one that we will acquiesce and make it 50ft. No doubt about it. And in fact, we're going to probably try and put all the dras there to create even more attenuation in the 50ft. So all respect, we appreciate it, but that's sort of part of negotiating at the podium here as we go through this, which is not our preference, but when we're doing this the day before, the day of these meetings with these conditions, is just how it goes. Also with the 15. I'm sorry, I. You're requesting the 50 foot setback but no buffer. Yeah, that was correct. No buffer along that segment at all. Because the buffer is the green one. Okay. But the proposed trail going through there was a. Was the reason for the buffer. Buffer because of the proposed trail extension that's going through there. The reasons for a buffer are because it's publicly dedicated lands and public lands, which that requires the buffer requirement. Actually, if you can actually look here up on the aerial, if we can get it back up on the screen again, this is actually the Florida trail route through the site coming up this way here. Oh, I see it now. And then the trail that we're talking about is the paved trail that will extend from the baseline intersection down to Santos. That's going to be further to the east where it comes underneath Baseline Road and then will extend down and work its way down towards the southe. And that trail that mister Reisen just pointed out is actually gated and locked and behind Hogwarts. I mean, there's no access to that trail. The access point to that trail actually cuts across this property under a small corner of this property that is used to access this little new pine stand under a billboard. So that's not part of an actively used trail system. And I don't believe that is intended to be part of the trail system to be farther south. Space between the",

        "text": " you really want to be sure that we for the legislature in our report and two uh almost maybe more importantly uh what's missing you know again we asked a lot of questions but we didn't ask everything um so i'll i'll throw those two questions out and um i'm happy to uh just cold call people but i i know the folks here have a lot of thoughts and perspectives and opinions on this so i'm happy to just uh open up the floor and uh any any thoughts adam and sarah you may have noticed that uh portland general and pacificorp submitted comments together we coordinated uh submitted upon us labeled as joint utilities one of the themes you'll see in our comments um maybe ad nauseam is whether or not we see a net benefit is largely going to depend on the specific market design that's related to that regional transmission organization there is not necessarily one market design coming from the federal energy regulatory commission delivering rto design there's quite a bit of variation and i think some of the work we'll be doing in this committee is to explore some of those issues but which way the pendulum swings in terms of benefits will largely depend on that design it makes this effort especially challenging but as frank said there's a lot of opportunities buried there as well and i think things that are complex that couldn't possibly be handled thoroughly in the scoping questions one thing that i would put on that radar is the complexity around how to allocate transmission not just for new assets that we might identify as being beneficial to the footprint but what we what do we do with the cost of the existing transmission voltage lines how do we spread those costs among our hero participants in a way that is balanced that represents benefits but also lets the rto move forward thank you great i appreciate that and certainly that feedback uh you'll see it when we get into the to the responding to the written feedback that was certainly one of the one of the major things we want to flag yes is that certainly it's challenging to answer some of these questions in sort of the hypothetical without a concrete proposal um so certainly certainly uh understand and appreciate that feedback so adam adams this is oh sorry no go ahead please adam this is this is adam this is ravi from bonneville um uh i don't know what you uh what your expectation from the next official members are but if i had to make a i would probably suck in the comment that sarah made i think uh bonneville being a pma so i'll i wouldn't speak as an ex-official but as a bonneville member but you have a unique actor in bonneville's presence in the region as a for the federal pma so cost allocation and how it's allocated of existing transmission would also be a very important point to be considered or a principle to be considered in the formation or discussion of the rto thank you but at the main the same time adam it would be good for you to clarify what role you're looking from the ex-official member i don't want to be intervening way too much so please do let us know oh no you're you're totally fine uh we we want to hear from all of you on this advisory um so thanks for that feedback frank thank you yeah thank you adam so sarah's comments about the handling of existing investments sort of really kind of dovetails with some of my thoughts about the importance of facilitating investments that are good for the region um you know one of the things that you know a bilateral sort of market and transmission system gets to is that that you have to find investments that are that are good for your utility and so it's unique to your to really leverage the benefits of a region which is really it's especially going to be needed given the fact that we have multiple states with different kind of carbon legislation or renewable to look at this for the benefit of the region and try to find ways to facilitate investments both in transmission as well as in resources given some of those sort of legislative changes i think is really an important aspect that that needs to come out in this plan if you look at it individually as utilities you won't get that same degree of investment and at some point that's going to box us into a corner and so i i would want to emphasize how an organized market across the region can really not only allocate the existing investments but really facilitate the investments that we probably know need to take place you frank adam this is nicole i didn't know if we were if you wanted us to be raising our hands in the thing or just to hop in but you know let's just uh we can do a hop-in for now um okay if it gets too out of hand we can use the the hand raising okay thanks so i want to say that i um i really appreciate the comments i've heard so um you know as i looked at this question the question is one primary issue that you'd like for this community to surface i think about what the purpose of this study is and it's to inform the legislature and i think what is it that we want them to know and one of the things that was concerning a little bit to me when i was trying to answer the questions is that we are getting into the weeds a little bit on the technical when we don't have a concrete proposal to look at so i really appreciate sarah's comments on that um that that being said i also don't want this to be presented as if these are all of the challenges and all the problems there are some technical challenges that are going to have to be overcome but they're not and that's the purpose of coming together and getting them out on the table and just having conversations about them so i think you know let's try and keep in mind what it is that we want the legislature to learn about this process and what some of the things are that we need to when we're answering these questions going forward and i just want to say also that i really really do appreciate everybody's detailed responses i've already learned a lot and i'm very excited to be part of the conversation absolutely i can't thank you all enough for that um don't be shy i'm sure others have comments hey adam i'll jump in this dispenser um i guess building on nicole's comments there i think it would be for your first question here what primary issue to identify for the legislature to surface in the report coming up with a broad value proposition that's informed at some level with the details that we can help flesh out and you and your staff can as well seems really valuable to me and i think about that in the context of why have other parts of the country formed rtos at different parts in time in the past 30 years what was the purpose of attempting to form an rto in the west multiple times in that same 30-year time span and kind of what's different today and as i think about it the commitment of the state of oregon state of washington and other states in the west to decarbonize um not just the power sector but deeply decarbonize the whole economy which means other sectors increasingly that seems to me to be a primary difference today compared to the iterations of rto discussions nationally and in the region and so to the extent a report could look forward to that commitment in the region and what the good looks like in five or ten years if we go down the current path of our current system versus one that's drawing on geographic diversity to bring more low-carbon resources that would be a really useful point to illustrate to me in the value proposition in 2021 of forming r2 thank you spencer for those comments this is travis siri some of the things that because i i need to learn a lot more about where where this has been in the past the the past efforts to form an rto and what's been the obstacles with our utilities things that came to mind when i was going through the questions were the process of potentially trying to reduce rates overall for consumers seems difficult when we're trying to maintain transmission assets we wouldn't want to create any scenario where transmission assets are not getting the investment that they're right now i think we have a lot on the on our plate to try to make sure that we're taking care of what we already have in place and trying to create an organization that can i think tackle you know reducing those overall transmission rates is going to be difficult in creating a new entity in itself while continuing to invest in our current thank you travis any other responses or thoughts on these prompting questions commissioner tony i should kind of go ahead i can go next thanks mike you can call me uh lisa uh please in this forum um yeah please uh you know i i reflect on how much time the commission has spent on on some of these questions about regionalization over the last um 20 odd years you know our focus has always been and i think will continue to be how uh how the what that value value proposition is and how it delivers to oregon customers or reduces risks for i think there's some ways to think about that even though we don't have a steep design in front of us so i appreciate the the conversation about identifying that value proposition in broad terms i mean this is why we pointed to the value of a of an rto or more wholesale markets in our sb 978 report in terms of improving competition and reducing costs potentially think the countervailing challenge to bring forward for the legislature is that an rto is of course not a panacea it doesn't solve and in some ways it relocates some of the challenging conversations we have in the region into a new forum but it doesn't necessarily resolve those those arguments and you know where we have really struggled in the past uh around cost allocation or giving up local control i think remains a challenge and and that's where governance and and really sound transparent um proof governance becomes really critical to any solution that comes to the table and really ensuring that it will provide value for oregonians over the long term and that's a that's an issue that just has to come forward i think front and as we engage but i really look forward to learning a great deal from from other folks like nicole enjoying the comments and learning a lot so always more to unpack on this topic all right thank you thank you lisa and just one comment i want to mention i mean i have this",

I didn't put the picture up here but it's just a fenced in area with grass and there is a pop up camper park there, but it's down so it's in stored mode. That's the only thing that's in the grazing area on the site. Plan commission gold, do you have any questions? No I don't. And I'll email Mister miner if I do have any questions and also to verify the vote. So mister mentor, if you'll be looking at your email and you're coming through a lot that are now commissioner gold. So thank you. Okay y. Thank you. I'll ask the applicant if you'd like to come forwardman. Tillman Associates engineering. 1720 Southeast 16th Avenue, building 100, Nocala, Florida 34471. So the site kind of give it a little bit of a background. It started as one thing and it grew and grew and grew and, and it got to where it was. Something that's pretty large right now. When you ask about the aG, there's nothing going on there because they don't have power to run water or anything out here on the site right now. So the site'kind at a standstill at this point until we get through the special use permit process. All they were looking at was raising a cow or two in the portion of the area that's not being used for the recreational facilities. So very limited agricultural activities would occur on the site. It would be something like a four h project cow and those types of things that they would be looking at. Mister Tillley, how long has your applicant owned the property? I don't know how long they've owned it, but it's been. Can you show me with fingers? Since 20, since 2020. So about three years. So it started off they really didn't have enough public space for them to go and practice at. So their kids are in ball and play baseball. And so they started kind of as a practice facility for the kids. Did the batting cages inside the barn that was already an existing structure. Then it just, it morphed into more and more. And then they started having the whole team come over in practice. Then they started hiring coaches to help improve the kids in their sport then. And that was when the county was like, hey, there's more going on here than is allowed without you coming forward and getting a special use permit. So that's the impetus that brought us here today, as well as some of they wanting to. They were going to build some bathrooms on the site, so there'd be a bathroom facility for people that were there. And so it's kind, it's morphed into more than it started. And so as a slow transition occurred, they did the lighting, they were running the lights via generator because the lack of power out there on the site. And then they applied for the power. And so all those things brought us here. I got a lot of the background. There'so, much of it. That's the summarized version. Unless we make this a public park, then we need a special use permit. And a private park run under guidelines established by the county probably makes more sense than turning it into a public parking and it being free reign to some extent. So we want to be. So we're here to ask permission. We think that the guidelines that were established with your staff and with the PN Z board, we're pretty good. There were a few things we wanted to go through. A couple of the criteria that we may want to see modified, if you're willing. And Mister Minor and Mister Wyrock gave us kind of a list of questions that they felt were pertinent to the special use permit that we potentially should have answers for. And so I'll kind of go through those real quick because I think that they will answer potential questions that may come up. One of these. Absolutely. Mister Mter, just while Mister Tillman's up here, wanted to give him the opportunity to respond to this, but Mister Werock indicated and his staff recommendation was for denial, but they had alternate approval conditions. I'm not sure if, when we were adjusting the staff recommendation report, if something got changed, but in roman numerali, it says staff recommends denial specified in section roman numeral six B of the staff report. But that doesn't really specify reasons for denial. And roman numeral seven says recommendation, but that doesn't necessarily say the reason for denial. So I wanted to give Mister Tillman the opportunity to hear from. From Ken, what? What? Your reasons for the recommendation for denial were specifically so that Mister Tillman can respond to those. Whatever. Well, there were so many places in here that says approved his condition that I thought y'all changed your position. I admire you. Mister Tillman were the optimist. Mister Raroc, would you like to go ahead and address. So our recommendation of denial is because we believe that this application will adversely affect the public interest and is not compatible with the surrounding area. And it's mainly because of the adjacent residential uses. This not being like an amenity to the residential community. It's a standalone baseball park. Next to residential. There are unpermitted structures on the property and the stadium lighting and glare noise without a buffer we believe will adversely impact the neighborhood. Thank you. Mister. On item number one, when you say adversely affect the public interest, can you elaborate on that? What specific impacts on the public interest there are? Yes, it kind of, kind of falls into the same grouping there because it's one of the compatibility with land use surround area, but also the public interest of having a standalone baseball facility adjacent to a residential area and the glare and. All right, thank you. Mister Tillman, your applicants don't live out there? That's correct. They were on site, but they do not live there on site anymore. Okay, thank you. How far the Wa do they live from this site? Have maybe answer that question. 25 miles. 25 miles away. Thank you. Are they still in Marion county? Yes. Ok. So one thing I'd like to point out is in the a one zoning, one reason that I think this is a compatible use is because public park facility is allowed in a one. So without any request from y'all, a public park which includes baseball fields can be added to the community in a one anywhere. And so this facility is coming through as a special use permit as a private park. And the difference in between the private park with a special use permit and a public park without one is I look at, I view one of them better than the other as far as controlled use and compatibility when we come through and we do special use permits buffering the conditions that are put on the use or what make it compatible with the surrounding neighborhoods. And so that's why we're in front of you here today with what we think the conditions that both Mister Wyrock requested as well as a zoning board, we feel like those have made this. It will be a compatible use, especially compared to a public park that could run all hours of the day. There's no limitations. You look at rotary, I mean Rotary, which is a public park, the baseball facility. You do tournaments out there, you do practice out there, and it's open. There's no limitations to the hours at which it can run into the evening time. And here we're asking something that has limitations. And at 08:00 lights are off. And once lights are off at 08:00 it doesn't matter if you're summer or winterime, you can't play in the dark anymore. And so that's one of the biggest conditions. It was one, we do have a neighbor here that lives next to it that did come and speak out about that. And that was one of the things immediately like, let's limit the time of the lights because the lights will. Even if you do the cut off lighting, you try to limit off site when you're doing stadium type lighting, it is going to project into other people's yards. There's no way to avoid it. There's no question about it. So we're not trying to argue that it wouldn't cast light into an next door neighbor's location, but the type c buffer that they've requested will provide a break of that light. It will also provide some separation, help create some separation for the noise as well. We are not proposing a PA system on the site. And so it is literally something that we're looking to. Let me go through my list of questions and answers that we had, and some of those will shed some light on it. We're planning on this being set up as a non for profit organization because people do pay to participate because they're paying for the coaches that are being hired to come and work on the skills of the kids that are here. So that's what they pay for. And it will ll be run through a nonprofit because she's not looking for this to be a money making thing. This is something that she started for her kids and for her kids teams, and that's how they want this to be run, as a not for profit organ that is being run to benefit the community. There won't be any employees on the site. It's going to be run by volunteers, the families and parents of the kids that play. Number of participants at one time on the fields. We're looking at about a maximum of 36 the hours of operation. We were wanting to do PL or training from 10:00 a.m. up to 10:00 p.m. maintenance to occur between the hours of 08:00 a.m. to 08:30 p.m. they would like to be six days a week during the school year so that kids have the opportunity after school to be able to come and participate there. There will not be any parking fees. There's a membership",

        "text": " portland and diane is in corvallis we have staff in washington and montana and we engage in policy and regulatory work in all four states and speaking of that policy and regulatory work uh regulatory work is really our bread and butter um we do a lot of engagement at state utility commissions um probably the oregon commission most of all but also the the washington utc the idaho puc the montana psc and a lot of that tends to focus on the sort of central regulatory process for electric utilities of doing integrated resource planning where the utilities assess their their needs and come up with plans for how to meet those needs on a lease cost least risk basis then flowing through to rfps where they actually go out and try to get the resources to meet the needs and finally looking for rate recovery for those investments after they've gone through the rfp process um at our organization tend to engage less with the rate processes but the irps and the rfps are a big part of what we do we also do engage in policy work we help develop the 100 clean electricity policies currently in place in oregon and washington um and have worked on their implementation we're getting close to done with the implementation of the clean energy transformation act up in washington and are just kicking off the hb 2021 implementation process at the oregon commission and we do engage with other policies relevant to renewable energy um such as citing including f-sec rule making so uh we appreciated uh your consideration of some of our suggested edits to the um protected areas rules um that were discussed earlier today then finally that last bucket that you'll see on this slide here markets and transmission is a growing advocacy with multiple efforts on going in the to try to stand up an organized west wide electricity market or possibly even transition to a regional transmission organization one quick caveat is that we very rarely engage on specific projects we will only get involved in anything relating to a specific project if there is a likely strong statewide or broader we often try not to even pay too close attention to what's going on with specific projects um our developer members are competing with one another and we like to you know keep a pretty strong arm's length from everything that's going on in that space and work it on things at a more kind of systemic or holistic level so that's kind of what we do and i'll pass it over to diane to head into great thanks max uh so as mentioned we're hoping to just give a broad overview of the renewable project um just to give some ideas as to what is really happening outside of the fsec process that influences how the projects are coming to you maybe for amendments or extensions but first what i'd like to talk about is why there is so much development give you some ideas as to what we're that's driving this um then we'll dive dive into the timeline focusing on some key areas not the whole thing there's a lot to cover and then we'll of course have time for questions at the end but i would like to flag please feel free to jump in as we're going through the the points if you have any questions along the way so first some thoughts on why we're seeing so much development right now kind of looking at this in different buckets first the policy drivers for that we're seeing for development uh of course house bill 2021 which we talked you all talked about earlier today setting some benchmarks for non-emitting electricity in the state within that there are some there is language about preferring in-state builds to see local benefit and economic and so forth as practicable so that's also influencing the amount of projects we're seeing in state or in the and then also neighboring state policies are also requiring clean energy as well uh all of this ties back to climate change mitigation efforts and we have before we had these policies in place and these still exist the voluntary renewable programs so this could be pge's green tariff or for example the blue sky program at um at pacific core as we're thinking about this it's worth mentioning that yes we're thinking about replacing these emitting generation for organ that serve oregon customers but also to recognize that as we're trying to move forward in mitigating climate change impacts that it means electrification of other sectors so as there's greater adoption of electric vehicles or as industry moves more towards this is going to greatly increase the demand of electricity in the region and in oregon and more broadly as well over the years we've seen a not just pretty and a noticeable decrease in the cost of renewables making them competitive and in often cases the last least cost resource in many situations so that's just a bit of the background and i'd like to dive now into the timeline and put together with input from our members kind of these different we can put these into buckets recognizing it's complicated it probably involves a lot more nuance than what i've captured here on this slide but i thought this was a great starting point and we're not going to talk about every piece of this at depth today as some of these you might be familiar with because they appear in the afzec process but there are a couple areas that are really impactful on the projects especially right now with some current um some current uh um happenings around the world and locally so we'll stop on those so first i'll look at this first line right here um on the next slide more in depth as a developer is thinking about developing a project we're going to start here at assessing the market and understanding the resource so you know todd did a great job of showing kind of the the market how it might have shifted over the years with the wind and the solar um so we're going to be looking at what is the demand what what's the situation on the ground and then also looking at where can we find the best quality resources so where is it the sunniest of course that will lead us most likely over to eastern oregon where we've got some great solar potential out there and then also the windy areas but we'll also be considering the technical specification specifications uh what's the slope or pitch of the ground is it going to be a difficult place to install things um are there other considerations that need to be taken into account for the technical aspect of it and then of course the transmission feasibility how far is this site from a transmission what are the cost implications for trying to connect is there even space on these lines that we could connect to so there could be a great site in terms of resource quality and maybe not requiring a whole lot of cost on the technical side of things but it may be far from transmission connection possibilities making it less cost competitive so once you find that site that takes us to the next step of securing the site control and local so this could be with private land or even public land we're seeing some projects that are using pieces of or parts of public lands but managed by the bureau of land management certainly we see this in other states as well in the southwest it's also worth noting that sometimes these agreements with local landowners it might be speculative in nature a developer might engage or establish agreements with multiple landowners but not necessarily end up using all of those leases or agreements to develop in the future so there's that aspect and then of course starting to talk with the local uh local government the planning um or maybe trying to start um thinking of what other considerations they need to take into account as they move and this will change be site dependent of course and then that naturally rolls into starting impact studies and assessments and of course all of these it's not a discrete like one ends the next one begins it's all kind of uh ongoing and trying to get things done in most efficient manner so impact studies and assessment environment and wildlife aspect and cultural resources are part of this um among other aspects that might come and then as todd mentioned we we're not necessarily going to dive into the fsac process but this is where it would typically flow in the timeline when you start putting together your all of your requests your noise and um consulting with f6 staff and getting things together for your the next slide these are two big areas that we thought it was worth focusing on because this is typically happening the after you see the application uh what is happening in the interconnection and transmission space and then also this big piece of securing off take so i'll talk a little bit about the interconnection transmission and then i'm going to pass it over to back max to talk about the securing off-take piece so first when we're talking about interconnection and transmission we're talking about the process of getting permission and negotiating with the owner and operator of the transmission and distribution lines so typically um pacific core or pge or even bonneville power um so this is a separate process even from negotiating the sale of the electricity that's going to be generated from the from the facility and while not uni not unique to oregon there is limited availability uh when we're talking about there is a finite amount of space on these transmission lines and many of these lines are subject to the ferc jurisdiction federal the federal energy regulatory commission or council sorry which i'll show you a flow chart on next on the next slide to talk through that a bit but in general the process starts with a request from the uh i guess in this case it would be the applicant so the developer who's going to be generating the electricity there would this would initiate a study and this study process would determine all of the different parameters or costs that would go into an interconnection agreement or their transmission rates here is a flow chart and i will mention that this is for large generating facilities partly the the facilities that you'll be seeing in the fsec process are these large generating facilities that will be connecting to the transmission uh versus smaller ones that could connect directly into the distribution system which doesn't necessarily fall under for jurisdiction and the point in showing this flowchart is more about there are a couple different places where projects can kind of fall off of of this interconnection process first it um these are all sorry let me just go back to my notes here for a second so interconnection requests are governed by what work we call oats or open access transmission tariffs which in this case doesn't mean but it means in how a utility interacts with and charges its rates to the customers so it's determining the relationship that it will have here between the utility the or the provider",

        "text": " some of the fish and wildlife habitat conditions we've talked about some of them before i'm going to start with the bottom here on my screen in conditions 15 and 16 there are a lot of fish and wildlife conditions a lot of have timing restrictions seasonal but 15 and 16 are the conditions that specify that certain surveys must be conducted according to the this final biological biological survey work plan and it's attachment p1 um that is attached to the um uh final order or proposed order correct right and so that has and the reason why that's important is that the survey protocols are agreed to and worked with odf and w where odf and w says this is an appropriate methodology to go out in the field and conduct this survey all of those protocols for all of the the habitats and species that we've looked at and that we've kind of talked about under threatened endangered species and for other in other habitats are kind of absolutely set out in that plan and so these are the conditions that say do those surveys according to these protocols you know in your of your fine of like based on your final route what um and your final all your surveys that you have to go back out and do um there is fish fish and wildlife uh condition one has a reclamation and revegetation plan which um i is says what it is it is also attached to the order and this has um success criteria for um how what what reclamation and successful revegetation will look like this is also done um in conducted and con generated and reviewed in conjunction with odf and w um and then as well as as counties same with the noxious weed plans we work with the counties and their weed supervisors as well as odf and w and um oregon department of agriculture as applicable in the development of that and then we have the the fish and habitat wild uh wildlife habitat mitigation plan um or the hmp this is the plan that that says and outlines um how and how and where they're going to mitigate uh for the impacts to those different categories so and we're kind of this thing seems to be the theme of the day is that aside from that biological survey work plan all of these are draft plans um be cut that will be finalized and and i think it's a really good example of going through that for 4 400 acres of temporary and permanent impacts those include right because everything is a maximum worst case impact scenario those include the proposed route and the alternative routes but we know let's run the scenario where all routes are approved but really only one route is going to be selected these routes are going to drop off therefore there will be no impacts to those to the habitat under for those routes so your actual permanent temporary impact number is going to be reduced which then will reduce the revenues it's going to impact all of these so all of these are going to be reflected and finalized based on kind of the final location and details associated with those plans and these are all based off of the surveys that they have to go out based on the final route they're going to go out re-survey because then they're current and new and that'll all be reflected in these and um i will uh stop there okay so we have several fish and wildlife that were part of the contested case that have filed exceptions we're going to be starting with fish and wildlife seven the women parties are ann and kevin the issue statement is whether the applicant's fish passage plans including the 3a and 3b designs complies with the fish and wildlife habitat standards category 2 mitigation also whether the applicant must revisit its plans because threatened steelhead reds have been identified in the and a note on this when it's referring to identified in the watershed what we're talking about here is a part union county where the line would cross lad creek streams near i-84 issue arises in part because the department of transportation completed a culvert project not too long ago a few years ago which opened fish passage resulting in potential increase in snake river basin steelhead in the locations of the watershed species of steelhead is a federally listed threatened species it's not a state-listed species so the hearing officer the way she approached this in her opinion was to break it into two sub-issues first a question on the adequacy of the fish passage plan design and then second a question of the adequacy of the habitat categorization and mitigation so with respect to the fish passage plan the hearing officer noted that the applicability of fish passage law and these are oregon department of fish and wildlife laws that the council is charged with implementing as part of this process that those fish passage requirements are triggered by the need for construction of an artificial obstruction the hearing officer concluded that the applicant has not proposed or requested approval for any construction of new road crossings or major replacement of existing road crossings on any identified streams in the upper ladd creek watershed the company will rely on existing bridges or culverts for road crossings therefore fish passage requirements are not triggered and the proposed 3ab 3a 3b design for proposed crossings do not apply in this area with respect to the the second issue um concerning the adequacy of habitat categorization and mitigation the fish and wildlife habitat standard requires the council find that the design construction and operation of the proposed facility would be consistent with the odfw fish and wildlife habitat mitigation goals the first step in figuring out the the mitigation goals is categorizing the and uh the applicant um i categorized all potentially fish bearing streams in upper ladd creek above the i-84 culvert within the site boundary is category two habitat um this something that the applicant and oto consulted with the fish and wildlife department on and the hearing officer found that the presence of state or federally listed threatened and endangered or special status species does not automatically elevate the habitat categorization in this case that would be from the only one to go above two is one so and the reason for that is that um uh fish species the habitat that they exist in um you know it can vary um and uh in you know many cases the fish themselves can exist their life cycle requirements can be met within habitat that would be categorized as a lower category than category one importantly odfw was not able to affirm that uh definitively affirm the non-fish-bearing designation of five non-fish road stream crossings and so you know they're they're out there trying to make sure that there aren't any fish in these the standard doesn't obligate the applicant to definitively show that streams labeled non-fish bearing within lad creek watershed do not in fact bear snake river basin steelhead or other fish species to establish compliance with the standard however the the proposed contested case order recommends that the council adopt a department recommended amended fish passage condition to require that these five road crossings within lad creek which were not able to be affirmed by odfw is non-fish bearing have additional evaluation prior to if the streams are identified as fish bearing and require construction to support a crossing and fish passage approval in that case a site certificate amendment would be required um so this uh is not kind of a review and approval by the department situation uh idaho power would have to come back in and request an amendment if fisher identified in those streams okay so that is a lengthy summary but a lengthier issue and that is the summary of the hearing officer's proposed contested case order opinion on this issue we're ready now for the march's oral argument in 2015 when odot completed the first part of a nearly 50 million dollar fish passage improvement project on i-84 to open up 86 square miles of high quality habitat in the upper lag creek watershed for snake river basin the year following that excuse me uh the upper watershed had been blocked to migration since the freeway was first constructed in the 1950s in 2016 odot documented a steelhead red which is a spawning bed above the crossing odf and w didn't know about that and neither did idaho power until we notified fsac in our letter in 2019 odfnw has since acknowledged the presence of steelhead in the watershed yet idaho power continues to assert that the presence of this listed threatened and state-sensitive species is alleged they're not alleged they are present in the watershed this is the basis of our argument that idaho power's application was based on out-of-date faulty and inaccurate data in its analysis i've spent more time the last three years working on this project here than i have at my business we did five hours of cross-examination pages of testimony and 27 pages closing brief yet as we pointed out in exception one in her ruling the judge quoted idaho power's closing argument and mistakenly attributed it to us her analysis is incorrect you'll hear idaho powers state that no new fish passage plans are anticipated because they're not constructing anything new in the water this is allegedly true yet they've only studied streams they labeled as containing resident fish as we've pointed out from the beginning many streams and parts of the watershed are labeled as non-fish quote unquote by idaho power they stated in the asc that they wouldn't study those streams then and they fought us for three years to not have to study them now odf and w stated that they don't have adequate maps to ascertain where the crossings are in the streams labeled as non-fish and that they don't have the capacity nor is it a priority to study the watershed they're not out there studying them right now yet odo will state that these details we brought up will be taken care of by odf bin w in condition one how can that be condition one will be satisfied by the agency that doesn't have the capacity to do these studies that makes no sense northwest steelhead are in big trouble 2021 was by by far the lowest recorded migration in yet as a species they're inquisitive and they'll explore new habitat for spawning and rearing when it's open to them just as they did in 2016 after being blocked from this historic and important habitat for 70 years the year after they went up oregon our organ rules are in place to protect species such as these this in just this kind of case please remand fw7 so that complete and accurate studies can be undertaken before the application is approved so that these iconic fish can have every",

        "text": " number four is sort of uh again the intent for us for staff and was not to change the process but to make clear process and uh if you you know if every def fights about whether the process a or we're making it clear it's the if you wishing aange you want to be right uh but all of these clarifications we feel pretty good uh having you know carefully reviewed the statute and looking at all of what were languages being introduced here uh we feel very comfortable work but on you are I suspect going to be hearing from a very public Le period concerns about this category changes so let's go through some of number which is the defition sufficient specificity so in order to participate in contestant case process you have to the issue during the uh draft propos order with sufficient specificity so that's a sort of term in and ition so we are as it say as you can see on the slide here if a person does not raise an issue at the public hearing with sufficient specificity to afford the C Department the applicant adequate opportunity to respond to the issue the hearing officer may not consider the issue case proceeding so uh in in press 469 37 sub it says quot issu shall be raised in sufficient specificity to support the council department and the applicant inadequate respond so you can see here language is just copy of the statut language so the question is what does that mean uh what does it mean to afford the counil depart and the applic opportunity uh we felt pretty Comfort langu obviously we were there FS about this members they want additional CL so what so we added all this language in GRE so we're saying to have issue specificity the person must have identified the recommended findings of ta inclusions of law or conditions of approval to which they object specifi the council standard other appable state requirements on which their objection is based and presented facts or statements supporting that objection on the record of the dra order so again here is not to raise the bar or more difficult to participate in case process but to make it clear where the bar is so people understand what they needed to have done to preserve their right to participate questions any questions I have com this is chair gril and um I was trying to count how many years I've been here I could do a happy dance over C well I don't think it will make some people happy because I think it's going to feel very legal and a higher F prove for them it is providing us as council with Clarity and I think it will help the hearings officers and eliminate any need because these people have ideas my understanding staff repeatedly regularly would provide explanations give examples and try to provide that g guidance but this is putting it out there I could not be happy thank you I um just a quick question and my guest is no there legic that's just sure uh there is a lot of there is a lot of legislative hisry with respect to sort of raising issues but it's with respect to similar statutes s sister statutes like Sera um but not so much with respect so language linking this back to our standards raing specific issues I think that create some push back public others changing the interpretation I think in the on it should help FOC those issues have a more Rob kind of discussion and allow us as council members to really understand what is the way for thank you for clarify thank you mam chair so for the record talk coret um just to kind of put it more broadly in perspective you know and I absolutely agree with everything that's been said here but I also want to kind of reflect on what it means so it's not just related to the contested case but this information then goes backward when we you know do a complete you know information meeting and when we're providing information to the public during those meetings this is the language we'll use when we're having to draft opposed order hearing when we're initiating that this is the information that will be part of that draft proposed order hearing to again make sure that it's you know as clear as it possibly can be you know what the requirements are to make sure that people are aware of when they are commenting that the draft proposed order they're not just thinking about that but if they then want to preserve that right and they don't feel later on that you know the changes that have been made in the proposed order as a result of those comments still aren't sufficient to resolve the issue because I just want I want to go back and sort of reiterate you know the contested case is a mandatory part of the application the point isn't just that it's an opportunity to challenge a project it's an opportunity to make sure that the project is consistent with the standards that's the point you know going back from the beginning at the notice of intent completeness draft proposed order comments proposed order this is all refining trying to get it to the point where if we're recommending to council that you know a project meets all of the standards those are all sort of times to refine that point it it it provides us the opportunity to evaluate the information on the record provides the applicant an opportunity to refine their application in the contested case the intent is there's still something wrong there's still something that a standard has not been met that's the point of the contest case is to resolve those issues if they still are or to point them out thank you for that Clarity cont um just comment um very soon after I um came on the council this um issue um came up as part of theed case um where um somehow I was one of the decision makers with respect to people who were challenging their um limited parties to limited party status for being denied limited party status and one of the confusing things was what is that for asset Council was what is sufficient on specificity and so this to me um I smiled when I read this because I think it is um so clear as in the DPO we have findings it's very clear findings of that conclusion the book okay great we have the standards that are very very clear and so the person that brings forward an issues just knows that they have to they have to prepare the the problems that's the only way we can we can evaluate that what so me very very very very to certainly hopefully the public but certainly to us as we make those decisions thank you council member just another observation I think this system also gets the applicant unno in a very specific way that these are real issues that they need to respond to I think I think it will actually it may not feel like it but it may end up in the applicant being more specific issues and I think it willit or something but I think it allows us to hold the okay uh yeah let's go to the next slide here sort of have some it ISU perspec making um that green text may have seen sort of like legally Le but as you pointed out it's a it's very scen in order to raise in order to raise an issue to meet the stat to meet the statutory language of affording uh the council the department and applicant respond you need to have identified your concern what standard is related to and any sort of statement or facts that support that concern other than UNC concerned so if you are having a problem meeting one of these three criteria then it will be very difficult if not impossible for the council or the applicant to do anything about it and the system is sort of designed to say this is the efficient time to take care of this problem so if you aren't going to give enough information at this point resolve your issue then why would we preserve the right to sort of raise it dat if you're saying you're an expert on this issue you say you have additional information that will help Council potentially come to a different conclusion or require actions by the applicant the DP phase is time for that information to come out so we aren't going to reward people for sort of way sitting St and then bring later um so yeah I wrote here to remind myself to say but um you raised your concern not to PR waiver but to resolve it during the draft order the application process the contested case represents a failure to Res concern not an opportunity to oppose a project so we need that all right so kind of Hit the two big ones start and sort of but uh the second big issue was sort of defining limited party status and again sent here is to the extent you have information the extent that you are sort an expert on area um and you're aware of facts or information uh that will change the ofation process either you know potentially I guess block a project but certainly Maybe conditions or you some change the outome of the The Sting process then we want you to be invol but to the extent that you are not that person we don't want tool and that's sort of what this definition is saying here uh in be 415 subsection 6 clearly defining that a limited party is a pro Center home hearing officer Grant standing to participate in one or more but not all of the issues to be addressed testing case as established in a preing order part issues so to the extent that you were aware something you raise that issue you unable to solve it you get to parti you get to continue to participate and but it's only to that if someone else rais an issue you don't get to then say me too I also concerned about that because if you really were concerned about that um so it's not it's not sort of like uh you know a vote at the end uh do you have information or don't because we're coning the best okay so chair gr I I hear what you said and I understand what you said from my previous life um deal with the Regulatory Commission there's a thing called an intervener and what I don't want the public to believe that that they have to be experts at everything and that they can't partip iate and I would encourage them to find other ways like our process here may not be the that pathway for the me to because maybe they didn't know they got educated about something I want them to understand there's ways to still be involved may not just be that way you're say that proper ways Tod please clarify but I don't want people to think that you know they learned something and now there's no opportunity it may just not be that term in that way I don't in her head so she must understand yes sir kind of I don't know again more reiterate that point but you know our",

        "text": " and I would hope that you would use it so yes $62 million is a lot now and it'll be a lot in five or 10 years um but maybe I feel like maybe we've missed the opportunity of communication to help create the timeline to get to where we even are with the m city Gates expansion right I mean Mary County doesn't have 50 or $60 million to give if we did we would have done it um and I think that we could do a better job of um just communicating what we are doing and what we need your help on because I I don't want to just be the Board of Commissioners tamping a local ask I do think it's really helpful for Senator weiden and Merkley they're going to be here uh my understanding sometime in the next 30 days we should invite you you should come down they kind of do a co- Town Hall type effort commissioner Cameron usually moderates it um and let's make sure they see you and hear from you uh because I do believe that that's where we're going to get this money we did get money from the state legislature but they got that money from the feds right so it's just kind of this pass through process and um um we go out in February you should join us to knock on their knock down their door maybe for the dollars uh so I'm grateful that you're participating in all of it and that you you know I know you're at the table with Kelly and her team and all of that so we're I I really think we are trying I do have a couple questions for Kelly on this contract though I just want to make one more comment Denny you are a great Advocate you are because I was in that meeting with the governor and at the end of that meeting at the end of that meeting she says hey how can we help and you said $62 million you said it right to her okay and that's all we need to keep doing together and it came it was better coming from you than it was from me but she knows it they know it so I mean there's a lot of people that are aware of it and we've got this short session coming up next February we got the long session we're working on our agenda for the feds we we will stay at this and I I really appreciate your advocacy and I thought you were the right person in the room that day when you said when she says well how can we help you and the last thing you said was $62 million remember that yes I do good job and and thank you but I I I have to say I didn't mean to suggest that I doubted your engagement your enthusiastic support of everything we've done because we see it dayto day through your staff mostly we don't get the opportunity see I I see commissioner Cameron once in a while um we're absolutely blessed to have have the team we have beginning in this room with the rest of the folks in and around Detroit so I'm just fearful about our future I'm fearful that we won't be able to reach our potential if we don't have a permanent system and so you're going to hear me say that if you're around me frequently because I'm going to beat that drum until um until that first toilet flushes well we'll just keep inviting you into the places to keep saying that and I do have a for the city council that maybe you could take back to them and it's uh aside from the fact that we don't have uh the the schedule to be able to come to your Council meetings or the conversations you're having within your community about uh your progress nor does the governor and or your legislative delegates and so it might be worth quarterly just sending uh you know the squeaky wheel kind of gets the oil type of a thing and just be providing them progress reports is to uh and I believe that our economic development team could help draft something as a as a model that you could just kind of fill in the blanks every quarter and we can also show you where to send that there is a new Regional Solutions team uh that the governor brought on when she took her seat and they are definitely taking a different approach but they are worth annoying regularly so that that way when they're reporting into the governor as to what projects are going on around the economic development concept because we as taxpayers pay for their existence um they have those updates and they are top of Mind constantly because they're coming from the locals straight up to them and I'll sign any letter or walk with you to any meeting to make sure that they understand that we're invested in this we'd be happy to provide updates and and by the way I'm on the North Anum Sewer Authority board as well yeah so um I'm pretty plugged into to what's going on and the funding that you all have provided us the 150,000 for administrative support yeah which we're actually having conversations I think about later today um so everybody will do what everybody can do uh I think it's just leadership's responsibility to keep pushing that button to go forward and that's our responsibility and and we'll live with that thank you one thing D I wanted to add to is and I'm sure you know this is there's a regulator regulatory element to this as well so we we were working on the mil City Gates portion of the of the sewer project um since before I became a commissioner and there's a whole bunch of regulatory Hoops we had to jump through in addition to the funding so unfortunately we're kind of in the same place with Detroit where um we basically still need permission for some place to dispose the effluent when we're finished with it right and so that's that's a piece of Brewery it's yes it's not separate you know like when we're asking asking folks for money they're aware of this regulatory piece and so um when you're pushing on our federal delegates it's also important to push on US Forest Service and Army Corps because they're they're just an important part of of that um so anyway that's part of part of why it's taking so long and then um the other thing is and I know you know this we when we did this contract um I I was really insistent that the local communities lead it not Maran County so I'm glad that Marian County is is supporting you and you're happy with us and I have a lot of confidence in our team but if at any moment for whatever reason even if it's a mistake the city of Detroit feels like for something is not reflective of your values and your community the direction you want to go please let us know because everybody here is intending for this to be a Detroit Le thing even if we're paying for it so I just want to make sure that that's you can depend on that as you probably realize I'm not bashful I'm happy to hear that okay so Kelly I have a couple questions on this contract just for clarification for myself page one of the standard Professional Services contracts uh talks about a plan and I'm curious if that plan is the framework that the board W you know we I don't know who did it who performed the work for that it was originally called a plan and we had shifted it to be considered a framework because we didn't want we do not want the local community to feel that Maran county is giving direction at the local level is that is that what it's referring to so the downtown planning work was a project that was recommended out of the Strategic recovery plan I cannot remember his exact title that was Pro that was done by better City in 2021 it was commissioned by Mary County okay so that it's not the framework then that you know what I'm talking about Chris is shaking his head yes no back there it's within the framework okay so I I just want to make sure that we're very clear with Sarah on uh the their job which is to make sure everything that they provide going forward is a permanent document is coming from the locals and that any promise for or any hope for funding is driven from the local ini itive with obviously support and interest from the county but it's not a count this is not a county thing yeah yeah the the scope of work and our RFP very much reference Maran County on behalf of the city of Detroit and the scope of work includes review and approval of everything through the city of Detroit um so all the documents all of the deliverables will be through the city of Detroit and our project management team is here that's our two representatives from the council um and then we are having regular work sessions with the city council as well and we'll likely pull in the Planning Commission when we get to the zoning codes so okay good so for the counselors in the room I I really love that Maran county has the opportunity to support these efforts regardless of the impact of the fire I think we would have done this anyway if a community had come to us and said hey we need support to be able to just grow uh but I don't want the perception to be out there at any point ever that the county is trying to reach in to an authorized Incorporated body to do this so we've talked about this a lot I want to make sure that that is very very clear thanks Skelly yeah okay thank you again all right I'll take a motion I'm sorry I said I'll take a motion I move to approve the architecture and engineering standard Professional Services contract with Sarah design and architecture Incorporated in the amount of have $116,000 for the city of Detroit downtown Vision plan and Zoning code update project retroactive from June 21 2023 through March 31 2024 I'll second the motion good motion a second is there any further discussion just Mr chair again I just want to uh declare potential conflict of interests as I do serve on the Detroit uh Planning Commission and I am a resident of Detroit noted any further discussion just thanks for coming today it's great to see you both here and maybe we can get you to more meetings in the future as we're planning these things any further discussion seeing none all those in favor signify by saying I I I I the motion passes thank you thanks for being here okay uh Katrina not Ryan uh we're going to consider approval of the incoming funds intergovermental agreement at the organ Department of Human Services the amount of $ 3,827 545 for the can oversee and provide services for individuals with developmental disabilities retroactive from July 1st 2023 through",

or early october and will then hold a meeting in mid to late october and if needed mid to late agree on what our recommendations should and then we'll go back and we'll do final modeling on the scenario that the commission is recommending which just to remember it could be one of the two scenarios we have or it could be taking some assumptions and actions from both scenarios and blending them and then hopefully we'll get the report all wrapped up by mid-december so that it is available um in advance of the legislative session so that's uh our what we what we anticipate happening uh this has been a big and complicated uh project and so um some of this may shift a little bit but uh hopefully we'll be able to stay on and get our our report wrapped up so that we can submit it to the legislature in december any questions on processing next steps not seeing anything in the chat hands raised great well let's go ahead and take a 10 minute break be back at um or as close to that as we can get back and then we'll go into public comment linda if you could send me during the break uh how many people we have that are interested in doing public comments uh and if you haven't signed up yet please do that right away and then we'll come back and have discussion about where we are in the process and where we need to go any preliminary reactions from commissioners about the choices that we have to make and how we should be thinking about all of this i propose we go into a 10-minute break thank you kathy sorry about the technical difficulties in the beginning no worries it took a while for me to get used to the lag yeah it was definitely i don't know whether we should try and always have somebody at odo presenting yeah that we could we could do that it's just everybody can try it actually the odo system works doesn't work as well as the home ones yeah we could uh try we could try and move through though see if we could move through a little bit um i'm not sure if it has anything to do i'll ask it if it has have anything to do with how many people go online too because it seems to have gotten better as we had a little bit of a reduction in um people turning off their their visuals like their their uh video so it kind of got a lot better when we did that so um we did have nora abner and she said hi linda are we still doing public comment periods today i'm just asking because remember the public are chiming in to her asking if they can talk okay so we've had oh go ahead i'm sorry you go ahead um yeah and we had a couple people raise their hand and then they put their hands down because they weren't getting called on so we may want to addre say something to the effect that we've saved for the we save public comment and consider them their attendees i should have said that that was during the public comment period so it's kind of kind of my fault i should have said for the public comment period in there so no that's okay and i think last time we uh let some people make comments so um i think uh and you know if during if we get through the commission discussion you know we could certainly allow a little bit of public comment after that if we have time i'm having trouble finding the place to mute and unmute uh mutant unmute okay not showing up on my screen she said it was down at the bottom at the very bottom of your um information there should be a kind of a menu bar across the bottom yeah there isn't mute start video share yeah there might be go take a break let's see we have we have two currently um we have just a moment i'm sorry uh jake stevens and i will unmute him there you go check your unmuted thank you jake welcome if you could keep your comments to about three minutes and and maybe um before we go to public comment for others um ask after the public comment period we will have um the commission will have a discussion if we still have time on the agenda and there are more questions that the public has that would like to ask questions um we're happy to try and accommodate that but we'll have kind of the commission discussion first and then um see if there's time so with that um jake welcome and i love to hear your thoughts about our work yeah hi my name is jake stevens i'm the ceo of new sun energy and we are an oregon based developer of renewable energy uh primarily solar and battery storage and um so i'm a couple quick comments uh just high level as well as a couple specific ones on that great presentation we are at in the uh you know renewable energy space and incredibly active in a variety of venues throughout the state dealing with the decarbonization effort particularly obviously on the electric power segment it have been for about seven years so i was surprised to learn of the existence of this commission within the last week or so um which is both delightful as well as a uh concerning that um you know there's probably not some sort of connection or back and forth or mutual and i'm guessing that that's probably representative for a lot of the rest of the renewable energy development community obviously a lot of the policies and efforts involved in decarbonization have a bit to do with renewable generation and its proliferation so i'm simultaneously completely impressed with the type of analytics and the body of folks that is gathered here um that we just saw and has been going on um and very impressed uh as well as obviously you have to wonder about what might be falling in the cracks relative to the opportunities as relates the renewable energy piece of things um so i figured that was worth at least flagging and and bringing the folks attention and i'm happy to connect with people in the future and and talk about how that stuff fits in uh we have several thousand megawatts of generation uh under development in the state and recently commissioned the first ever bonneville directly connected solar projects in the pacific northwest four projects built across lake and harney county at four different locations they're probably paying about a half million bucks a year of property taxes across those two at this point we have maybe uh over a dozen permits and a dozen half a dozen counties across central and eastern oregon um and thus a pretty extensive experience dealing with a lot of the issues involved in legislation and as well as the agencies i think at a high level i think it's what seems to be absent in our relative to state agencies is sort of proactive efforts to look at how agencies might actually facilitate the decarbonization efforts as relates and facilitating renewable energy and we've actually seen quite a bit of the opposite from agencies and uh sort of direct counter flow and using precious resources to sort of work against those efforts and i probably should leave it there but you know that's resulted in literally having to take issues to the court of appeals um and so forth to help facilitate and avoid adverse policies that are being advocated by agencies as well as you know dealing with uh many of these things which i think really beautifully have been put forward here in terms of like what are the benefits of the state of oregon at hb 2021 has a policy statement that it is the state of oregon's policy to the maximum extent possible all this new clean energy in hp 2021 i.e 100 of the future for pacific corps and portland result in direct benefits to communities in the state of oregon in the form of labor income creating and sustaining living meaningful wage jobs and reducing burdens on environmental justice communities we've had the public utility commission explicitly state that they don't have to do anything related to that to the point that we've had to now take them to court to get them to potentially give meaning to those words and their procurement policies as they oversee the procurements for the utilities so i think there's a broad base of opportunities to help remove those obstacles in the state and potentially just also look at you know what the agency should be doing to accomplish the major scale goals you know how many thousands of acres do we want to have successfully permitted in these timelines to facilitate the decarbonization that i think all this good work depends on in many cases wanted to flag one nexus recognizing that most of what was just presented really wasn't about power generation um but i you know new sun is particularly expert in the transmission system bonneville in and that's you know that's the fatal flaw in the decarbonization efforts we're massively short and there will be 10 and 15 year delays and the permitting process alone for the development and construction of transmission to solve those problems for you know billions of dollars new facilities are and uh as i've been contemplating and diving deeper and deeper into that um you know the i keep coming back to realizing that the energy efficiency implementations that might occur in the portland area potentially have pretty outsized impacts in reducing the actual new transmission builds required to succeed because they effectively will take the edge off of the peak demands of the entire portland area when energy efficiency reduces the peak draw that'll actually mitigate the peak transmission needs and so there's some other pretty major co-benefits that you know may have decade-long benefits and billion-dollar sort of avoided costs associated with them that i think would be you know worth considering incorporation and some of this modeling so anyways i'll pause there and happy to ask answer any questions or you know sync up with folks in the future but i think there's some some big pieces there that again just continually having become aware of this this group uh hopefully fit in somewhere in this yeah thank you jake uh glad you found us and uh we did uh have a focused conversation around transmission needs storage needs associated with one of our recommendations in our 2020 report to the legislature which was the 100 percent clean electric sector um recommendations so uh we did follow up with some deep dives certainly i think would be beneficial to um to circle back to that uh as we start to look at how we implement these these programs and and understand a little more about what the utilities are proposing so thank you linda i have lost",

        "text": " by in Southeast Salem as part of writing Public Works building and we got a million dollar Grant from the Department of energy renewable energy grant program to do that it is a resilience project because it says that although it's connected to the grade that can store energy during emergencies it said it'll be able to supply our Department's building six apartment buildings 34 homes four government buildings and one business this will be calculated so that's underway right now so do you see a time maybe that we can use a carrot as an incentive for some of these commercial developments to consider a rooftops because it just seems like an idea that people can get their heads around pretty easily yeah absolutely I think I mean we have a climate action plan and just um calling for this and and so far the city hasn't we don't have any money right but towards it which I think goes back to your question about grants and and um and commissioner Slater is being appointed to the climate action committee as a kind of commission representative will be the only non-city counselor on the committee um so I think that would be an opportunity for the city to talk about if they want to start putting money as an incentive um I know there's been um some State bills you know like requiring Apartments to put in an electric vehicle charging and doing other things so there are um I think right now we're required to make sure large apartment complexes have the conduit that they don't put in the right the Chargers and so there are certain things so the city you know the state of the city could start making these requirements um versus you know trying to incentivize it I think from the zoning perspective we don't really have any prohibition on yeah and as part of the um uh climate-friendly and Equitable communities rules for our parking lot so we have to make some changes and so parking lots over a certain size will have to include either certain amount of tree canopy coverage or solar panels going forward so we'll be working on that Amendment later this year to bring um and and there's an option that the city could allow people to not install the solar and instead pay into a fund and then we could create a grant program to give to people that want to do solar we're exploring that because the we don't currently have staff that would run that grant program but we do run other Grant programs so we're trying to talk everybody to say that runs a grant program they'll be like do you want to do this and would you want to run this grant program for us yeah it's not really the planning Vision can't really do it so we're looking at um what that could be and we plan to gather information on how that could work and bring it to the climate action committee for recommendation before we would put in a code Amendment commission and it would be great I don't know if you I could change a second when we've had other Representatives off of Planning Commission serving on special groups they generally report back to this you know like once a month which would be great if you could do that it's it'll be wonderful two years later you got a comment you know I have a couple more questions I don't know which page it is on that but I I saw some place that the state was setting a goal that the utilities at best around utilities had to purchase 15 of their energy from Community Based renewable sources is that correct Rob um there is a carve out for small-scale projects and um I believe that right now it's actually eight percent with a bill proposing to take it to 10 percent although I could be mixed up it might already be 10 percent okay so uh so at some point here or maybe there is today there is an actual market for Community renewable energy is that right there so there's someone that actually has to buy a certain percentage of this correct yep the utilities will have to demonstrate that they're getting some um eight or ten or whatever wherever they land from these small-scale projects now that Bill just defines small scale as 20 megawatts and less or less so yeah I mean 20 megawatts um is is you know 120 Acres or so yeah it's not necessarily what you think of as a small project um but it's not 150 megawatts which is what some of the larger ones are so um what what I'm trying to understand maybe and I think that what Salem has we don't have five acres that we would want to put for six acres that I think we would want to put a solar facility on we want a different kind of building on that but we do have all these rooftops and and parking lots and so I can't imagine we're gonna put it you know at 20 megawatts facility but you know someone could come along and say I want to rent the rooftops of your buildings into go Crest and Cobble together a one megawatt or a two megawatt system and that seems to me where Salem could go in addressing some of this um and so so I guess my question was if someone someone were to take up that opportunity that they they actually have someone that has to purchase their utilities have to purchase some of that product right yeah and um if they were designed strictly as projects that sell electricity to the utilities then you could get them to qualify under this small scale category and there presumably will be a premium for the for that energy once those um eight percent or ten percent requirements kick in I think it's in 2030. now again if if that same project were connected on the customer side of a meter and they were able to use it all on site they're probably going to get somewhere around 8 or 10 cents a kilowatt hour for the generation of that project because it's going to offset their local utility bill if it was designed to sell directly to the utility it's probably more like four cents plus some Adder because it's small scale and we have yet to know what that market is but the financial benefit is still probably higher to put a rooftop system on the customer side of the meter and offset the local load um unless it's just very small loads on the site and some warehouses are like that they have a little bit of lighting load and they they can get more solar than they have load and then you could sell it and presumably get a premium for it so in my two acre um we go across Warehouse that I now own I mean right now would be my financial interests to put solar on there behind the meter I could then defray my existing costs that I could sell and not only could I sell but they would have to buy the rain the Surplus energy from my two acre system is that right well if it's net metered and this that would be several hundred kilowatts of solar that would be a significant system if it's net metered you're able to roll a third plus of energy forward to Future months and so summer Surplus can cover winter months when there's less solar however for a net metered project at the end of a year of billing and the solar year ends in March all of that energy that is Surplus at that point actually gets donated to pge's low-income assistance program and is not reimbursed by the utility go ahead no I I think you understand it I think you use it or lose it where's your debt so your choice is net metering and you offset your costs or you sell it okay yeah you don't do both although if it's sale of electric you do get to sell the Surplus at the end of each month but that's at sale of Electric's avoided cost and that's probably closer to two and a half or three cents and so it's really hard to see a project pencil at that very low avoided cost I don't think I do I think that was all very helpful then I'll move straight because thank you a couple of things I think we may need to distinguish between Community solar project and small scale as Community solar as a single particularly defined as opposed to the small scale I really think that the opportunities for solar um involve two things one is a high degree of partnership and working with utility uh either develop the grants or identify opportunity and identify and essentially come to fruition possibilities for solar met so I think it really requires a high degree of partnership with the the second thing is because of that and because the bureaucracies and I I know from the resiliency project and from early efforts to try and get a focus on community solar project in reading the grand applications that's a lot of your offers there is a to current application that is pretty um you know I think it's going to be important and I believe the council is going in this direction or at least the budget committee is I think it's really important that you have a city a staff person whose job it is to implement climate action plan sorry you're picking up my voice in um so I I think it's going to be really important yeah I mean the council is in the process as I understand it with the task force setting setting priorities and picking out the most practical strategies the reality is the most practical strategies of those ones that generally that will involve working with the utility but having a staff person I believe is really critical someone who can uh identify this and work through that identify projects and help work through the bureaucracy and use the agility I mean if it's in the utilities interesting you can util you can get the utility to write the grant proposal but it really works it it really needs someone who is not uh distracted by other duties and it needs someone who can focus on those issues to do it so that I think there are opportunities in solar I think it's a good thing for us to continue to explore and find out the things that the city is already doing to learn what other cities might have and to identify some of the opportunities and then maybe we can have a two-way street through it's my goal with it Council task force and planning commission that I think this is one of those areas where we should try and figure out the best way to exercise our advisory capacity as well and utilize that too uh gather information and explore different options good point other yeah I have one more question for Rob sure I can wait if other so Rob given some of the financing challenges that people have right now and the administrative burdens uh that people are facing to install some of these projects do you",

        "text": " of fires associated with construction activities um and then so the department took those representations and compiled it into what we call a fire prevention suppression and emergency management plan which is attached to the dpo so part of that plan has a construction component and then there's uh also the operational component because as we are aware this is a big complex facility there are facility components generally that have an electrical component so we have transformers transmission lines um the battery storage components um the the wind turbines all of these have some electrical component and there are fire risks associated with them so in this plan we basically break out and talk about the potential fire risk from certain facility components and then measures the applicant would do to reduce those risks um the applicant also uh provides um oh it's like a table of contents from an fire management plan uh and that includes those and so that basically a finalization of this final plan would include all of the details from the application and then a more a bigger build out of that table of contents that they provided which has a hazard risk and vulnerability assessment training and exercises um how like information on how that plan itself would be updated um and then it includes tactical response procedures for structural fires evacuations medical emergencies etc okay that was public services going on joyce minimization um council has a waste minimization standard it's pretty straightforward um it encourages reducing and recycling waste so that waste actually generated from construction and operating of the facility is as minimal as it possibly could be um very typical of ethnic energy facilities um is a condition that has a construction waste management plan which functionally um provides an updated list of the the quantities that waste that will be and identifies methods how the applicant will reduce and recycle waste and ultimately dispose of the waste the disposal sites and this is that nexus with public um the disposal sites are columbia ridge and findlay buttes landfill which over in the in the application in exhibit u public services there they provide correspondence with both of those landfills that indicate that they have um more than sufficient uh space to handle what estimated weight waste generated um there's also uh wasteman condition three which is related to um the potential for concrete washout and whether or not a deq exemption permit exemption would apply to the facility um further under wasteman which is um interesting right because we have a solar facility and a wind facility and as an op as the operational aspects of of those of that facility um it includes um sometimes the solar panels need to be replaced sometimes there's wind facility components that would need to be um replacing these facility components um on a cyclic or ongoing basis as part of the operation of the facility and so these conditions are really intended to make sure that the solar facility components and when facility components are going to be um recycled to the greatest extent practical practicable and then where they're disposed of the disposal would be in a licensed or certified facility or method and method okay council has uh division 24 has we kind of move out of division 22 of like the standards now we're looking at standards that apply to certain types of facilities and we have a wind facility so there's the public health and safety standards for wind energy the impacts or risks that we look at underneath the standard is specific to the wind facility components but so what we look at and are evaluating are structural failures mechanical failures um we also look at collapsed turbines or a blade blade fro the first part of the standard requires the applicant to demonstrate that it can exclude the public from close proximity to the wind turbines and electrical equipment and so the evaluation in the draft proposed order you know says this the facility is going to be located on private land um you know trespassing is a thing but the public is generally supposed to stay off of of private land so that in itself is a way of precluding the public access to these facility um there would also be fencing and gates a lot of this depends on what landowner preferences are and where they would want them but there's going to be fencing and gates um excluding the public also like on the winter by doors um they would be locked and the substation is going to be fenced um and then there's also for the uh the wind turbines there's um setbacks from public roads which is talked more under the land use section the second part of this standard requires the applicant to demonstrate that it can operate the facility to prevent structural failures and also um there's this component that requires safety devices and testing procedures um and this was kind of a cool like a cool condition to work on um because i think that we have a really interesting condition here help the department um track when there's issues and also if there is an issue with the wind facility the the reporting aspect and understanding better why something went wrong so um this condition one just to save you from reading that whole long thing so we're we're recommending um that it'd be required to develop and implement an operational safety monitoring program um the office operational safety monitoring program includes elements um such as conducting inspections and testing of the wind facility components consistent with the manufacturer recommendations but also on best engineering practices um and then maintaining records of those inspections and tests those records would be available made available to the department upon request um and then those that uh those results would also be uh provided in uh the annual report that is that is also submitted i thought that i had another oops oh my gosh what happened where'd it go oh gosh nope okay that was it okay um and then there's also part of this also is if there is actually an event the reporting requirements and what we what we look for to be included in that as well and now moving on to the cumulative effects standard which is the other standard that applies specifically to wind energy facilities requires the applicant to design and construct the facility to reduce cumulative adverse environmental impacts including but not limited to the list of items that you see here so really the emphasis is using existing roads to the maximum extent uh practicable um using existing substations we're minimizing the amount of stub substations um constructing the facility to avoid impacts to wildlife minimum lighting this standard is limited to environmental effects that an applicant is capable of reducing and does not require the council to find that a wind energy facility has no cumulative environmental impacts um and so under this section in the dpo and i'm sure a lot of this kind of looks familiar to council members but we we point to or reroute to findings of facts and recommendations in other sections that really focus in on this specifically like reducing risk to wildlife we kind of re-route to the fish and wildlife section the minimum light necessary for safety and security purposes um lighting's talked about in scenic and protected areas under the and same thing with the visual features under visual features but ultimately um the faa is is the agency that determines the lighting for the wind facility structures and those met towers and so that for like those for the wind facility components that is the lighting that's necessary for safety and security and that's talked about under the public services traffic safety however to be consistent with the standard we do recommend this condition um underneath the standard which really requests and it requires the applicant to really take a look at existing roads understand what existing roads are on on within the site boundary what could they use um and then basically to provide a map set to demonstrate that um that that for the new roads that those new roads do avoid um resources that are protected under council standards um this is going to be a fast one deciding standards for transmission lines we've kind of talked about the various transmission line routes and but there are several transmission line components including the um collector signing standards for transmission lines um has a nine kilovolt per meter at one meter above ground surface an area is accessible to the public that is the standard here's a table from the dpo all these numbers are less than nine it meets the standard we recommend the standards bet all right um everybody doing okay all right we're almost there you're doing great okay noise control regulations gets a little bit complicated but i'm gonna try to keep it um not simple but just straightforward and easy to understand i'm gonna try i'm gonna try it um so these are other applica applicable regulatory requirements under council's jurisdiction so the annoyance control regulations are actually rules that fall under um the jurisdiction of the department of environmental quality but deq does not admit administer or fund this program so d-e-d-e-q is like not helpful however these rules are on the book on the books so that's why council evaluates deq's noise rules because they are applicable rules to the facility in deq noise rules we look at the rules that are specific to industry and commerce um to apply and evaluate um always a noise assessment for a large energy facilities also underneath the underneath those noise rules and the vast majority of the noise analysis all about the potential noise at what are called noise sensitive properties um so they're noise sensitive properties we also call them nsrs noise sensitive receptors i'm going to call them nsrs a noise sensitive receptor you can kind of see them in the map here's an nsr and there's these are all nsrs nsrs are basically houses they're is normally used for so that's some terminology um you know quick cut is that there's two standards that are really that are are looked at and evaluated one of them is the maximum allowable noise um and that's 50 dba that is the maximum that your energy facility can generate without not meeting that standard the other one is an ambient noise degradation standard and this is where a uh an energy facility in any one hour cannot increase the ambient um noise level by 10 dba so asp 10 or lower to meet the standards so those are the two the two standards that are another interesting thing with this is that we are talking about a wind facility and the deq noise rules does have um a carve out and kind of specific rules for wind facilities um and some of the aspects that maybe differ from if we were just looking at a transmission line or a solar facility is that the what differs for wind facilities are some assumptions you can make about baseline uh baseline or ambient noise and then if there is an exceedance of one of these noise standards that there's a there's a waiver process in that too those are just some of those differences so um underneath so the maximum allowable the 50 dba we",

that time so um just makes it simple because in division 15 we're gonna it's it's up for gain did anybody have any questions I mean this is gonna the scope and objectives is going to be the whole the whole rack so I don't necessarily want to get two to the weeds here but does anybody have any questions any kind of high level questions about what this rack is is all right so it is oh we're we're ahead of schedule which is great uh so to keep this orderly I I basically what I want to do is sort of similar to uh the way we introduced ourselves is I want to just kind of go through I'm just going to call on you one at a time uh and if you don't have anything to share um that's fine um but I'm gonna be calling on each member of the rack to affirm that they don't have anything or if they do do to to uh give you time to share your thoughts with the rest of the rack uh kind of to launch us off on this process if everybody has something to say you have about nine minutes uh uh if if everybody wants to talk so just kind of keep that in mind I'm not I'm not necessarily going to call time at like nine exactly um but please do respectful be respectful of others uh and you know keep an eye on the clock once you get started uh if people are kind of go on too long then I probably I will eventually cut you off just to make sure that everybody has their has a chance to uh speak up um and I just want you to remember this is kind of rock one so my goal is to kind of raise the ideas we're not going to really get into the into the debates about whether they're the merits of them just yet I'm my my intent is to is to gather everybody's suggestions from this first uh rack here and put it put together kind of a packet that I will then distribute with the group and then uh we'll be looking for comments and thoughts from rack members about kind of everybody else's ideas uh so this this time period is just really uh kind of explaining your ideas to the group so that um people can know where you're coming from and understand your uh when they're providing comment so uh we're gonna just go in the reverse order of what we did on the introductions so starting with uh friends of the Columbia Gorge you win uh take it away uh I will make this very brief because I don't really have anything to add at the moment I really came to listen today uh the materials that was provided were mostly orientation materials so I'm really hoping to get stuff out of today's meeting so I can come back and confer with other folks in our org that's me thanks no worries no worries uh Jim um I do have some questions um they may not have sufficient specificity at this time to really flush out clearly but um just want to share some things that I've run across um one is um that defining or examples of specific um agree to which one has to comment um in the one docket that I was in um we had to appeal to fsac to council itself to overrule the administrative rules judge and you know it might behoove us to take a listen to the discussion of how the council members were able to understand what was being brought up but how the alj did not and there was a fairly robust debate over whether the party made themselves clear enough for it to go into the record to be contested so I think some some work around that specific specitivity um would be helpful another thing is party a full party versus a partial um there was a lot of discussion on that as to how do you become a full party so that you can question all individuals in the case or how you uh become a limited um that's something that I think the rules could work on to clear up a bit with my notes Here oh there's a section here the order on petitions for party status it talks about that how that may be issued before or after the pre-hearing I'm thinking it might be worthy to discuss that because when we were involved we're trying to sort out all the issues and set a schedule at the same time which kind of put the cart before the horse sometimes is that we were looking at a schedule before we knew all the issues and the time frames it would take to address them so the order of that might be something for us to discuss as we go through another thing to go through would be good um on typical contested case schedule motions for Discovery orders and how exactly they're done and then how that Discovery has to happen I know for us for myself being new um how you subpoena somebody who won't answer your questions um that was kind of tricky and I think some clarification in that area would be also get getting into sir rebuttals and sir sir rebuttals in the case we were in we had cerserve rebuttals that most of the attorneys that we knew and worked um that was a relatively rare thing for them to see and hear and to maybe better clarify how that back and forth goes on in a contested case and that's kind of the highlight of of my notes right now I've got more details in here I don't know how deep to go but I think I've hit off with three or four key things that I'd like to see us discuss and clarify a little bit more okay that was a great I mean that was a great list we've definitely those are key areas for sure and yeah those are those are some great okay uh Irene the floor is yours yeah yeah okay I do have some things and actually some of mine is going to probably over you know that's fine it's gonna already been spoken to but one thing I'd like to do is compare the Attorney General's rules with what is being proposed in terms of uh the uh contested case process of one of my concerns is that I would like to see some time frames included in the rules where a when a hearing is held there's some time between when the hearing is held and when decisions happen with fsac I know the last time I commented we were commenting on one day and the proposed order came out the next day where a couple of the con of the council members themselves said that they really weren't going to have the time to do a thorough review of what the comments were so I would like to see us have some um some requirement that that the council has provided an opportunity I mean time wise to really consider the comments before they're making a um another concern that I have is I know that the department is the staff to the council but there is no opportunity really for the public to have anything to say about um about the recommendations that come from the department and sometimes those recommendations don't thoroughly describe the the concerns of the public so I don't know I when we get to that section I'd really like to have us have some discussion about about that process for presenting information to the I'm with with Jim as far as I'd like to see specificity clearly defined um does that mean that people have to reference specific rules I know there are some you know um there's there have been some court cases and things like that about about is included in a comment compared to what appears as a contested case issue but the the issue of specificity seems to be one that catches a lot of people uh by surprise I'm I'm very concerned about the party status issue and I'll give you an um we were in a in a contestant case recently and all of the public members were given limited party status and the department and the developer were given full party status so what happened is during the hearing there were um requests for summary determination from the developer and nobody from the public could argue against them because we were all limited and so we hadn't specifically commented on that issue thinking that it wasn't even going to be discussed and then all of a sudden there were conditions in the site certificates that were removed without any input from the public so that issue is a real uh sore spot right at the moment um the other the other thing that I know that is in the hearings rules it specifies three divisions that people can reference I think it's 20 uh let's me must be 21 22 23 something like that at any rate I I don't think we should be saying these are the only divisions that can be talked about or commented on or a contested case request made on because some of the rules have pieces that are really significant that are kind of spread out in other rules um so like the for instance the as I recall the requirement for monitoring is in a different rule number than the ones that are listed don't quote me on that but I think when you say these are the three rules you've got to be addressing in contested cases I I think the contested cases probably are broader than just those three rules when it comes to to comments I think there needs to be some clarification about what it means to have stated your issue and and what brings this up is there's some there's some court cases that say things like if you bring it if someone's brought up the issue that doesn't limit the arguments regarding that issue and I think that there have been hearings officers who have said well you didn't talk about that that part that how that influences this issue therefore you can't uh include it in your arguments so I think we need to look at that I guess that's probably enough for me right now um maybe more than enough for you but okay let somebody else talk sure and just uh on that note thanks so so much Irene for all of your suggestions uh and thoughts uh um well I'll look at you in a little bit so uh when everyone's finished Renewables uh Northwest if you have any we'd love to hear them thank you um yeah I I think I'd like to start with some context and I won't have quite the same list of specifics with some of the folks who have commented so far um so we kind of come into this rulemaking against the backdrop of having worked on passing and now trying to implement House Bill 2021 from the 2021 legislative session which uh requires Oregon's largest utilities to move to 100 clean electricity by 2040 and also included in",

on that on this this uh energy auditor Grant um the latest we heard from the federal level is that the announcement will be out in December of 2023 um it's one of those that keeps getting pushed a little more all the time um everyone's suffering but from a lack of uh folks that uh can process funding uh and design programs that's sure uh let's see the next one on my list is uh solar for all if you haven't heard about this one is this one's a very large program this grant opportunity can provide funding over a five-year period of performance the opportunity is focused on providing benefits from solar energy to low-income households and disadvantaged communities the grant funds can support financial assistance to individual households for solar and Storage technology as well as enabling upgrades necessary to install solar techn technology on the residence the program can support various aspects of solar technology including Community solar programs Workforce Development and high quality jobs in supporting critical facilities that serve low-income and disadvantaged communities oo's application for solar forall came in at 138 million we submitted a coalition application with Odo serving as a lead and etto and bonnaville environmental fund as Coalition members it's competitive so we may not be awarded or it's possible that EPA will negotiate the award amount even if we are selected however it's anticipated that EPA will make initial Selections in the spring of 2024 EPA anticipates W agreements to be in place by July 1st of 2024 and Blake if you wouldn't mind uh just mentioning a few things about the building codes piece of this yeah sure thanks Roger so um organs involved in a few of the the various U federal grants that are available for building code adoption and implementation um kind of the first round of that funding was was under the um the bipartisan infrastructure law the ijaa and Oregon's Partners on two different um successful grants that are going through the contract negotiations now one of them and we've talk we've mentioned these in some of the the previous stakeholder panel meetings but um the first one is a partnership that we've got with ashray and ICC and nazio to um and this is a national scope so certainly not just Oregon but for development of um training materials for building officials to help understand the codes um and to kind of roll out that training on on national scale and we're just a state partner on that um to provide input and kind of act as a state level consultant there that one's just still moving forward through the contract negotiations at the national level but um we expect that contract to be you know potentially complete before the end of the year but ashray is the lead on that one um and we're just a sub a sub recipient kind of subc consultant on that and then the other one is more orgon specific and Earth Advantage is the the lead on this one um and it's for development and support of the Oregon building performance standard um program and I'll talk more about that as it relates to the specific legislation um kind of coming up next but um that I think there's folks from Earth advantage on the call if anybody wants to to speak up but um certainly feel free but um that that contract is still under negotiation as well with the with the usdoe these these things seem to take time just kind of the nature of the the federal contracts and and the way that process works a bunch of bunch of back and forths there um and then the only other one that I wanted to mention some folks might have seen the recent uh alrd for the the next round kind of the next big bucket of energy code related funding and this one was funding that was available made available under the inflation reduction act and um just for some context there was $1 billion dollar of available code related funding under the IRA and the first round of State formula grant um totaling $400 million was um kind of released under that alrd but the um kind of the it's a very prescriptive uh kind of list of eligible activities that can happen under that alrd under that scope of the Grant and I mentioned it's it's formula based so it's not competitive so every state was allocated a certain amount of that $400 million um Oregon was allocated about $4 million of that um and it's generally for either adoption of the latest or zero model energy codes so the latest model codes on the residential side is the 2021 iecc on the commercial side it's Asher 90.1 2019 so one of the challenges that states like like Oregon and and a few other states have is that you know our current codes are as efficient or more efficient than than those latest model codes so it almost kind of precludes States like Oregon from using some of the money for adoption when we've already adopted those codes um and then there's there's lists of available um or kind of allowable amendments that are included but um it's kind of a prescriptive menu of items that can that can accompany that adoption so one of the things that we're kind of going back and forth with with USD is just trying to understand the applicability and like if and and how we might be able to use some portion of that that state formula funding so the near-term deadline is submitt of a letter of intent to use the funding that's due in a week on November 21st and then States actually have about two years up to September of 2025 to actually scope out the projects that they want to do Under This funding so um the first step is is a pretty light lift just the middle of that letter of intent and we've been coordinating with Mark and Kelly and and building codes division to get that letter of intent submitted um and we'll do that before deadline um and then we'll have a couple years to figure out if and how we we can actually use some of that funding um although we do know that there is another round of more competitive kind of allowing for more unique uh potential projects to to be uh proposed um if if we aren't able to kind of fit under the the very prescriptive menu of items that's that's in the Al Al Rd kind of as it's described so um it's kind of a summary of the the related codes funding that's happening at the federal level if there's any questions happy to happy to try to answer any but looks like there is uh Jim Edon yeah yeah hi Blake can you hear me I can yeah great yeah so yeah the the there's two two two paths within section 50131 of Ira one of them is for the current codes you mentioned and also the zero codes which in some sense align with some of the executive orders I'm wondering you know is do you think that Oregon is well positioned to work towards implementing and and you also have to achieve 100% enforcement so I'd like to know how BCD plans to you know propose by 2025 a plan to achieve 100% enforcement potentially with a you know a zero level code or is that or is that what's in in your in your playbook coming up yeah I think uh I I think some of that right so that that's kind of the second option is the adoption of the zero codes um you know if you're familiar with the letter of intent template that they've put online you kind of check the box of which areas of code that you might want to um to use some of the funding for and we you know we plan to check the box with the zero code to kind of leave it open um in case that's a that's a path that that we W to that we want to follow you know we think there's potential but you know kind of like you mentioned there's some challenges there like what is 100% compliance you know what does that mean and how can any state really even guarantee that you know that's a that's a huge hurdle that I don't know that anybody would be able to um you know overcome if if that's truly the truly the requirement um so or at least just documenting it if if it is um so it's I think it's a potential but I think us like like a lot of other states are just exploring how to how to potentially make that make that work got Mark or Kelly you want to if there's anything to add uh like no for the division nothing else to add yes there's a a lot to be figured out and we yeah do have until 2025 to try and see how we do make something like that work and yeah get a little more feedback on what the real requirements are yes there's no such thing as 100% compliance yeah yeah they wanted to avoid the problem with 90% compliance you know way back from um you know the hour days I know that's why they went to 100% but I know it's going to be difficult for you to demonstrate that so yeah look forward to working with your team you know and all of us the stakeholders you know to get that prepared right very good any other questions for Blake about uh energy codes the funding support from the federal level lots of dough going around yeah yeah Kevin Rose Nia again so this one is as much about the uh this topic as the reach code that we just talked about um in the the IRA information um for the not the zero uh code portion that we were just talking about but for the 2021 iecc equivalency section um they they pretty prescriptively outline which types of amendments uh in their eyes are are uh allowed for a a state to be eligible for uh that funding um so I'm curious um in general about uh thinking on that acknowledging that you know we've got two years and and and even more time than that to",

        "text": " it so I may be absent a little bit because I'm I'm gonna stick my teeth into this good we'll see thank you for doing it yeah I'm excited it's been interesting to see how you know it seems like our policy has just been to make sure that the government doesn't harm people who are victims of the fire and it's been interesting how much work it takes right like the government system is just not set up to hold people harmless right and and it's set up to work when you don't have emergencies it's kind of a funny thing right though kind of where government's most valuable is when you have an emergency but but it's set up to work not in emergencies and then all of a sudden you apply those sort of non-emergency rules to emergency situations and people get harmed unless unless you know you intervene and say hey this this isn't right this isn't just we shouldn't have people priced out of their homes because it got burned down that doesn't you know you don't want tax refugees simply because you burn down your house right um if if you're uh you know if you made a lot of money and you want to build a brand new house then I have no problem with you having to pay a little bit higher property taxes because of that but if you're a victim of a fire and you're trying to rebuild why should you live there why should your tax rate jump up you know because you're a victim right and uh um being in the building some things I went in fact I was sitting next to Lisa uh from state parks she had oh yeah I was sitting next to her and I looked over and I said some things never change there's a lot of lobbyists that I knew and then uh after Senator Gerard and I got done and the Department of Revenue got done um Jody Weiser did you know who she is if there's a revenue bill that's like she's always there right and you know one of the comments was Well everybody's going to come in when their house burns down or whatever and you know that that this isn't this isn't fair because it's you I just I want to say you know life's not fair but this is a blanket disaster that impacted a lot of people in a lot of ways and uh you know and because the government failed by the way right it's not because like a lightning struck a house in the in the environment did it this happened because the government didn't put the bloody fire out so like I don't know who I don't know who that is whoever that is but I'd be happy to explain to her my position on that and also the 18 cam home owners who we went to that dinner for last night who are predominantly seniors people who are retired they're live they live on a fixed income and they've given their all in their lifetime back into their service of whatever kind into our community and they will explicitly be harmed by that fire and the tax increase on their new home because the government thinks that everything should be taxed at a higher base over time and I appreciate that to a point but it's I well I think that the the important thing here is it's not the case we're not arguing that people who lost their homes in the fire shouldn't have the three percent increase in assessed value that everybody absolutely that's what everybody has you're going to have to do that just like the rest of us are the question is should they have to basically double their tax rate because their new assessed value on their home is essentially twice or three times with their old one and they get assessed at market rate as opposed to what they were under measure 50. that's the that's the problem the problem is that it's not we're not talk we're not trying to uh give uh victims of this fire a better deal than everybody else we're just trying to make sure they don't get a significantly worse deal to everybody else just because they're housecomfortable right yeah well Department of Revenue has some good things this may be in uh legal counsel May understand this better or somebody in legal counsel the the issue of special assessments with assessors and stuff so if we can get the bill scheduled for a work session and get it someplace then we can put a group together and say okay what's your challenge what's your challenge and then to get this done and then hopefully we'll have a chance to adopt it here yeah I think so we'll see that's great well I also just want to say last night that it meant a lot to me and also to the people that attended did the dinner last night last night we went up to the community Gates Community uh church and had dinner with Christian Aid Ministries which is an organ a Christian based organization who came here in the fall of 2021 to support homeowners who had a significant Gap in their ability to Christianity Ministries brings individuals in from all across this continent it's not just our country there was folks laborers from Canada there last night also and what they do is they recruit these folks in and they stay in our community specifically in the gates or Detroit area is where they've been for the last 18 months and then they give their skills with no charge to building homes and Kevin dial who's the director of the long-term Recovery Group shared last night that Christian Aid Ministries invested 2.5 million dollars in labor for the 18 households that are getting homes and the how the homeowners have to pay for the materials and or the community Through the different organizations that are donating goods and services Goods materials and then cam facilitates the the labor the construction folks to do the actual building and what I learned last night um there are a variety of different uh organizations hundreds of organizations throughout Marion County that have been helpful and instrumental in this recovery but specifically they're they named off three I always send myself a text message so I don't forget Kaufman homes Thatcher homes are two contract organizations two contractors but because of the restrictive organ laws you have to have a CCB number to be able to sign off on a building permit and cam Christian Aid Ministries is not from Oregon lots of the folks were from Tennessee Georgia Arkansas so forth so they're not licensed in Oregon and these two building organizations gave of their licensing number and like a at arm's distance oversight to allow Christianity Ministries to be able to file those building permits and then our planning department specifically uh Brandon and and Chris I know for the from the very beginning helped walk this over the bridge because it was new unique for us in the county on how do we explore this and it was Chris and Brandon who actually said here's what you have to do to be so instrumental in that that process and then Rubio's Plumbing is a plumbing company who's actually super new it's a new business and I just want to shout him out because everybody needs a plumber uh these days he's not been in business long he met Joe Nichols from Christian Aid Ministries at Home Depot in the parking lot while Joe was loading for carts full of materials and he said nobody from Home Depot was helping me but here's a random citizen Mr Rubio who said hey can I lend you a hand to load your truck and then in conversation Joe shared with Mr Rubio what he was doing and then miss Rubio said hey I'm a plumber I'll come Plumb all these homes which means he donated 100 of his labor is a plumber which is a big deal to 18 homes in the canyon and they're going to be finished at the end of April for all of these homes I just I normally I don't like say businesses and so forth is a big shout out but it's a big deal and I know that this morning we also received an email Nick Harvel from sedcore you may have not seen it yet but there's a need for a big box cargo container to be moved and you know Eric from k e responded and said absolutely we'll come and do it I just I I I'm exhausted I just want you to know it's like getting that 12 million dollars and kind of getting to this point really is um maybe brought my emotions to the surface but we have so many amazing companies in this community that are really putting their best foot forward and not even asking for a financial return and because of them we are the fastest recovering Wildfire impacted county in the state of Oregon from the 2020 fires and I couldn't be more proud there's an organization called after the fire that's a national non-profit that is tracking trying to figure out how we in our community are doing what we're doing at our pace and it's because of people like this so I also want to take a minute though and recognize the county too yeah and and Brandon in particular who runs our building and planning division they're in public works but also us and the leadership here because one of the things that um I learned last night is this Christian Aid Ministry is the only Community it went to in the state of Oregon was Marion County so it visit you know we had fires up and down the Cascades visited lots of different communities and I think it's actually a really important um the way that we interact with religious organizations private businesses because I think there's some confusion out there about what it means to uh not like pick a religion or have a government religion right it doesn't mean that you have to be anti-religious and I think one of the things that was that came through last night is these folks are motivated to help because of their faith in fact that's why they do what they do right yeah and I think um Sometimes they come into jurisdictions and the jurisdictions are like well we don't that makes us uncomfortable we don't we don't want to partner with you because you're very Faith forward we don't like that right and I think it's important that as a government we don't have to pick religion or espouse a religion to partner with religiously motivated groups and if and if we had taken a a view that was like we don't want to do that or or we that makes us feel uncomfortable there would be 17 families that wouldn't have homes built for them in the canyon you know and so I think this idea that we welcome anybody who's willing to do public good in Marion County regardless of your motivations and that were very supportive of those institutions and organizations that are willing to help and do the good work for people in Marion County is really important and I think specifically to Brandon and his team one of the things that they do so well is the although it's their",

        "text": " should be able to help great well with that we can go ahead and move on to the next slide Thanks James and everyone for the good questions in the comments um so other proposals uh and there were kind of uh proposing in uh for Amendment uh include increasing the number of low or moderate income residential customer or low income service provider reservations a contractor can have at a time from 20 to 25. we're also proposing to increase the amount of time a reservation for low-income service provider can be uh for one from a one-year reservation with a possible extension of 180 days to again that one year reservation with a possible extension of an additional year um this is again due to the feedback that low-income service provider projects have been delayed due to supply chain and Workforce constraints um that would be like a an extra 180 days there to get those projects complete uh but again looking for feedback whether that is um would be helpful um an additional rule change being proposed is to reduce the residential rebate rate for customers who are not eligible for a utility incentive uh and I'm not low on moderate income um from 50 cents per watt down to 30 cents per watt um we would maintain the current rate of 20 cents per watt for those um that are eligible for utility incentive and are not low on moderate income and again the same we're going to maintain uh the rate for the low moderate uh income uh rebate as well um and we're also proposing to remove uh some language in rules that was written when the program was first established and relates to kind of the original budget timeline so it's kind of pulling out some of those original dates um a book kind of maintaining same allocations they're just kind of doing a little bit of a clean up from when the program was first established um well I've got these proposals up on the screen and any questions or comments on these uh rules now Christy Army uh looks like Frankie G had their hand up first cool uh I think it's pretty the court uh the causation the link is pretty clear why the reduced but I wanted to hear it from you you guys you you too or one of you too is that it's pretty obvious the amount to will be reduced for non-lmi is because you want to kind of allocate more the money to the LMI residential customers from 20 to 25 it but is that why there's just not enough money to increase LMI and keep the residential rebate right um I think to somebody read the kind of the landscape for utility incentives has changed a little bit since when the program was first started um so imparted to kind of take account for those uh changes as well as to kind of increase the longevity of the the program and sustainability of the program that makes sense yeah and I think um Frankie the thing that I would add just quickly is one of the things that's changed a lot is there's a federal tax credit and for a low to moderate income populations that federal tax credit isn't always available but for someone who's above that income threshold they'll qualify for that federal income tax credit that wasn't there before so so it basically says like we'll still give you an incentive like a rebate incentive in addition to your tax credit but like you're gonna get more than you were going to get before from a different place so kind of leveling that out and then the other piece is that we want the incentive to to last longer to go further and so if we're continuing to incentivize at the same level despite the federal tax credit adding to someone's you know off the bill in the end that's called a coupon overall like how much different they'd pay with the combination of their rebate and tax credit kind of went from this to this so if we kind of ramp it back down and keep it keep it more aligned about the same benefit we can then give more people rebates overall oh nice yeah I knew there was more to it than that simple uh simplified link that I came up with thank you that was exactly the answer oh sorry for adding another question this is actually not related so you could just say pass or no comment but uh I was wondering can people after this program are do are people allowed to sell uh electricity back to oh shoot this is Oregon Department of energy but here in Eugene I I'm serviced by eweb um do is there any more or maybe I should ask broadly does anyone sell electricity back to their uh public utility yeah most people that have solar are producing that solar and through what's called that metering that power kind of goes back and then you get a discount on your bow oh nice cool thanks you can Google Map metering it's kind of complicated to explain yeah but then you can learn about it through like a video that somebody made to help you understand versus me doing a bad job of it and you call it net metering is that what that's right okay cool thank you so much yeah no problem all right so next up was Lara for Lara we'll see you're off mute administrator I submit the rebate applications I work with Dale and Katie on a weekly basis um and thank you for this opportunity to share some feedback and our experience with this program since it's begun what I first want to say is that enr would would support increasing the number of reservations per contractor but only if we reduce the rebate rate so what we really want to emphasize here is that we fully support reducing the non-income restricted residential rate for both solar and Storage and since the beginning of the program a r has expressed that the non-lmi rate is unnecessarily large and wasteful since 2020 we have experienced stressful Cliff events and significant uncertainty regarding what expectations to set with potential customers and this has led to some oregonians to not move forward with so we find this policy hampers with the state's ability to meet climate targets and our ability as a contractor to train and develop a Workforce and is ready to tackle the energy transition so reducing the incentive rate and cap is the single most effective way of achieving the Department's stated goals and expanding access to more oregonians and increasing the life and stability of the incentive program we call this a cost-effective approach and it provides the biggest bang for the state's Buck effectively doubling the number of non-lmi customers who can actually use this program doubling the amount of clean energy deployed doubling the amount of CO2 offset and creating more more jobs so we don't we just want to make that clear that we fully support reducing the non-income restricted residential rate thank you thank you so much you just added the answer to Frankie's question too thank you all right I don't see any other hands up I answered a question in the chat no changes to the LMI rate at this point we are applying for a federal competitive grant that could have us revisit that conversation in the not too distant future so stay tuned on that and then um I was just writing in the chat but to Matthew's question we'll post the slides and we'll also post a record a copy of this recording on our website right where you were looking after this meeting today thank you right I don't see any other hands or comments other than the ones I've just addressed you can go on to our next and essentially this is more of like an open time so while we asked you to specifically comment on some of the changes we're already thinking about there's something that didn't come up or if you have general questions this is a chance to to ask those so feel free to raise your hands hit something in the um and then you'll see um some of the next steps here as we're chatting too so if while we're chatting you on a jot down James's um email address or I'll put that link to sign up for email notices or maybe I'll make James do it because I don't have the PowerPoint open to grab the link but maybe you can put the link to sign up for email notices for this rulemaking into the chat for people to sign up while they're listening in or thinking of questions or asking and we'll do the awkward silence thing I'm going to tell somebody raises their hand or ask something in the chat Patricia got the link in The Exchange okay so apparently our draft ideas are looking great and no one has anything to add this coin yeah I would just saying yeah I'll let you know when you're off oh great thank you again um yeah I wanted to also share that you know we haven't needed to use the reservation extension uh request more for more than two requests at a time so the third extension has never been necessary I don't feel like we don't feel like this change is as significant or important compared to reducing the non-income restricted residential rate shoot that and then Frankie can come you're off I might have misunderstood uh Laura from a r solar because it doesn't make sense why would a contractor want non-lmi rebates to be reduced why would a contractor want say someone like me to pay more I mean disregarding the federal re uh tax credit it makes sense from uh odoe standpoint as you have a limited budget but why would it make sense to an A R yeah I don't know if Laura wants to answer that I can I can take a stab it if Laura wants to each she can raise her um what I would say is that having the what's happened in the past oh I'll go ahead and let Laura go in to get why not yeah thank you that's a great question I can understand why it might um not seem economical but the the way we see the a r is that if you reduce the rate you're extending this program to more oregonians and creating a more stable clean energy economy that way so it's um really about uh it's what we've seen is very large rebate and incentive amounts that could actually be uh spread out to more people and last longer rather than what we've experienced when I said Cliff events this means like the money is getting is running out fast and we're all scrambling as contractors to fill these cues quickly and if the rebate amount was reduced that can slow down the cliff event reduce the impact of this instability and allow more organians to go solar and Frankie to give you a little bit of um I've been around our agency for a few years and in the time I've been here this program kind of came online and the money went almost right away and then the program closed down and we actually ended up having to",

        "text": " to pull you in have you talked at all with the hospital or Willamette University not yet no but that's been in the back of my head my Hospital participated in a program that we've looked like energy management that the Energy Trust in others offers but that's kind of an internal change in policies and things to Synergy so there probably is quite a bit of conference with the Energy Trust folks and I have a meeting with the people involved in Municipal and multi-family and they had a lot of information about projects here in Salem as well great so they're a good place to start I hate to be a downer but I do have a hard stop at 11 30. I have a constituents meeting downstairs so we're moving quickly comprehensive the Energy Efficiency and municipal buildings um I think a great first step I hope for this there's an Energy Efficiency and conservation block grant program a non-competitive formula grant the City of Salem is eligible for it's almost 250 um the purpose of those funds is to do just that is to kind of work to create energy plans um audits you can use the money for equipment rebates so the first step in that process was to submit a pre-award and some information so that was done that was to the end of April so that has been submitted we now have a year to complete the grant or voucher application there's a couple of options but I'm hopeful that that 215 000 can really help us my understanding is energy assessments and audits can be fairly spendy so I think we'll convene a work group with staff to kind of work through different options for looking at our own buildings but hoping that that money will help and we'll certainly get started I I don't intend to wait until the end of the year to submit information but we have will that come back to this group before it's the win it certainly can yes yes it would be interested okay work with PGE Salem electric ETO for that network of renewable microgrids and the update that I have on that so it's like you guys all toured the shops staff are working on the performance agreement with Odo presently in hopes to have that finalized soon The Next Step will be in agreement with PGE so they can start the um and it's my understanding is still anticipate completion by the end of this year so if I can add one thing I know the mayor has to go so I'm going to speak quickly here um the FAA is supporting solar installations in airports they put out a report in 2018 on that um and I talked with our Airport Manager a little bit about that and he thought the idea of adding a micro parade in solar at the airport would be a wonderful way to to move forward we're currently doing an airport Master Plan update it doesn't include a solar feasibility study in it but it could if we choose to do that about 20 percent of Municipal airports around the country have solar airports and Chattanooga Tennessee covers their entire operations from solar I think given the size of ours it would probably be an easy thing for us to do and I think given what pte was talking about there seemed like a lot of potential there and that could just expand on my intergrid yeah I agree thank you I had understood that there was an issue with the reflection reflectability of the panels and have they resolved that yes okay yep yeah it has to be south of the airport Traffic Control Center and they do have to do a glare study yeah okay all right en30 PGE joined us this morning and touched briefly this speaks to that um umbrella tariff program that has been under Discovery for some time but is still under development it sounds like we'll learn more they did provide us very draft framework um towards the end of last year but it sounds like we'll get some more information later this year next one en32 promoted incentives by energy thrust and this hits on multiple strategies within the plan Energy Trust was initially hoping to be here today I was sorry that at the last minute they were unable to join but I hope to bring him back um I've met with their public relations staff to start talking about different and creative ways to help share their information they're planning to send me some printed materials for outreach events for our desks here we're going to work on digital information that that we can supply via social or through our um through our planning staff through their pre-app conferences so there's a number of different options on the table in addition a number of website updates that I can do I've seen other cities that have really fleshed out pages with their programs so I'm hoping to just dive into that here in the coming months not a huge update for this create and environmental screening tool um still reviewing what the potential next steps would be but I think several here in this group have seen that Transportation flat staff are indeed working on a what's called a socio-demographic equity scoring tool beta version very early form but it's something that I'm learning about and as potential option to kind of expand and to pull in some of that environmental justice data as well we may need to collect some of our own data I think moving forward Urban heat islands and such really get a good tool but we're still figuring that out go on the left I did some public engagement activities over the last couple months including Earth Day event presentation to the master recyclers program planning to do Public Works day I did do one quick news story on our greenhouse gas emissions as well last month so Outreach effort we're just getting started getting underway terrelson weighs 21 Ryan mentioned that I think one of the next steps for this is potentially solid wasted five job committee to appoint members to doctors Hazard mitigation plan is still underway efforts on that with dlcd and it should be finished by the end of the year and the only other thing I wanted to add a pretty cool Grant opportunity came my way it's called the charging and fueling infrastructure grant program from U.S Department of Transportation very competitive Grant Nationwide projects Awards up to 15 million and the applications do the end of May but I do have a staff report drafted that I'm going to try to get into the system next or this week so that a staff report can be presented to council May 22nd and I can move forward and try to apply for funding to expand publicly accessible charging stations throughout on city-owned properties to start great excellent thank you for the update I apologize I do have to run so we will see everybody again in July okay sounds great thank you thank you thank you I might need to move the July date meeting it's currently July 10th um I'll be out in the week to be yes",

        "text": " that and when you look at things like historic Properties or like wetlands and things like that and I encourage you to take a really careful look at these Maps because whereas the route may have been you know a th000 ft from a wetland now the route may end up being 2 feet from a wetland and at least in Union County it means that the route can come right up next to um lad Marsh Wildlife Area it can come right right up next to some uh protected areas that are mitigation sites for the Columbia River dams it can come right up next to Morgan Lake Park um and the public is not going to have a chance to be to be a participant in deciding if that really is okay um Miss Gilbert thank you for your testimony I gave you a couple of minutes extra we've got other people that want to testify tonight and another hearing tonight does this mean I get to send in the rest of my there were several speak ises that I did not do written comments because your rulle say that I can make public comments so can we resolve that the public comment closes at the end of the hearing um that's going to be a problem no I don't I have notes I I have I have little notes here um but I clearly have issues that I intend on taking to contested case that we not in writing because I also ran out of time um so you are denying me access to any kind of new process if I don't get an opportunity to come back that's what I'm okay thank you Miss um Sam Meyers hello could you please state your name and address Sam Myers 68453 little Butter Creek Road have we are at the edge of the site boundary uh if I had this diagram shows uh B2 is the red comes across Maro County uh design this in a 18 survey of the county as a oh sorry as a Wildland or a yeah Wildland Urban interface right so at the time this thing was cited um this thing was on the map the line comes away from the green Energy Corridor that everybody fought for got to have the screen after that nobody cared it zoomed right over to this Wildland interface right that's the next place it headed to they're supposed to be citing constraints uh that that designation carries as far as projects this so apparently that didn't happen now the site boundary wants to expand potentially impacting this even now I have a couple options a couple things I want to drive home to me this expansion and the complexity tells me that Idaho Power doesn't have the operational organizational expertise to pull this off and this is a step because they couldn't figure it out before it's very confusing can't figure out what's going on now we have what appears to be a Amendment appeal process this type A which is like even easier to get citing approval for more amendments I'm like where's this going to end so this is close enough to my house it kind of makes a difference and IID hope power hasn't talked to me in any way shape or form since opu ended so they have in my opinion a lack of interface with land owners and I see that a I heard Kellen talk about a little interface I don't think there's enough because I think it's out of their wheelhouse they don't have this the the Manpower they don't have the dedication to deal with land owners in a real way why would you have so many options up on the board I'm gonna go here I'm gonna go here we got this site boundary bubbles off on the this side or over here what the heck there's no way they can just like talk to people figure it out months ahead I've been talking to next era for over a year on a road revision we were able to figure it out we stayed with it but this group likes to do this use amendments so what am I to expect ultimately at some point this thing crowds into this 500 fet and then they want to go more I don't know so some I wake up and they're like putting a line what 500 yards from the house or something and they like well we got another amendment that we did and we got that pushed through and so here you are Mr Myers we need to carve out some space here this is going to be uh you know it's kind of close but you'll be all right I don't know this is so confusing Miles and Miles okay I'm gonna I got a minute left here the other thing is okay Helen you talked about a road being like 50 feet wide I talked with the Marl County weeds guy and he was having a fit because there's all these roads and idah power doesn't care they just dump responsibility on Marrow County just dump hey you take care of all these roads we're going to make but now in some places we're going to make them even wider okay what you just took a road made it 40 50 feet wide really how's that going to impact the noxious control you just doubled or tripled the miles you make them wider they they're way harder to control you turn an area of the of the edge of the road from three or two feet maybe on each side now you got to control what how much okay where's the plan where's the where's the where's the impact of Marl County weeds got they're just like oh well marrow they'll take care of it right but they had to negotiate for months to get a plan for the old site certificate now it's like what you're going to carve off a off a mountain somewhere and make it 50 feet wide and so you got a bank there that's like 30 feet Rock and crap laying down is somebody going to get down there and spray all that this is a mess and it makes me it's really frustrating really frustrating because we're on the ground right there in the middle of it and I don't know what they're going to do and I'm in a wild this is like a little bit of a populated area okay it's not like a city I get that but what's all this Road expansion going to do in that area and are they even in the end are they even going going to stay in the original site boundary okay thank you for your testimony Mr Myers yes and I I do have a this in addition to a a email so I would appreciate you read that yes and I I guess I would like to call for a contested case and I would love to uh reserve the right to talk about the uh oars or the 's in that at that time so thank you so much thank you Myers yeah I just want to make sure you understand if you want to reserve the right to uh request to contest a case you need to make your comments before the close of the hearing today so if there are still issues that you want to raise that you didn't raise in writing then you should bring them up now have you raised all the issues that you want to raise yeah plus the O and that's where that's where I'm getting lost when you say plus the O well i' like to bring up those those rules as well yeah I I think I think we only have five people that are that are wanting to testify just in general I'd like to be able to reference those rules is what I'm saying are you prepared to do that now no I'm not I'm I'm prepared to reference those in in in time okay you have until the end of the hearing that's that's the deadline you understand that I can't reference that I want to use those right now without going into detail about we we would at least know need to know which oars and 's you're alleging are potentially not being with right yeah I get it I don't have that for you okay uh we have thank you Mr Myers for your testimony we have a Joanne Harris Road sure good continuing um I've been called the conservative environmentalist by friends of mine and um one thing I didn't comment on was the eagle surveys and the problems that with eagle surveys and I just wanted to say that uh the surveys are not adequate they're not a wide enough area and what I'm submitting today and writing for you to take a peacat is um surveys that were done for the analou Ridge and elorn um um transmission sites that where they did uh surveys for Eagles and the first one is copies these areas overlap with the B2 uh Site Area first one is is some nests that they found the second one is a map of some Eagles that were uh they tracked them and they're basically uh flying within a six mile area so it shows some of those Eagle flight areas the third one is some of their results from uh site studies of Eagle U visual uh visual encounters with eagles they run between two and like 35 uh sighting per location and know for locations are on this map with the numbers uh the other one I wanted to comment on is cultural surveys this has been a big deal for a long time and I noticed that you're planning on removing the uh requirement for cultural surveys that are required by Oregon rules and statutes which require not just the review of the federally listed uh uh protected sites for Oregon on private property they're also supposed to look at um locations and objects in addition to just the registered like historic properties so um that's going to be a big issue because you're not complying with Oregan laws it's always been a big issue the Reliance on the federal rules as opposed to uh kind of ignoring the state rules uh it's been a problem because uh the developer is looking at just where the transmission line is damaging things as opposed to um the indirect impacts and I know at one meeting they uh I think it was um you Cynthia were told that when the transmission line goes directly over the old Oregon Trail it's not considered a direct impact um those kinds of things are problems I just read that the problem apparently goes beyond just here um the federal uh Department of interior is going to review and take a look at the to project in terms of problems with their cultural surveys it just came out um I would say that probably people like me saying we want to see what the feds are going to do with this um programmatic agreement hopefully has gotten the attention of somebody in Washington DC because they are going to review it um the other thing I wanted to comment on real quickly is um the um anyway I could go on and on with cultural surveys there are problems",

        "text": " so and uh we we had a big hearing about it we had farmers in here and and um you know it's obviously a situation where some Farmers wanted them because they could make you know money on uh issuing their land the challenge was uh really high uh value Farmland was being taken up with these and I think and I'm going to speak for myself I I was the legislature won't let you build a house on 80 acres or less unless you can or whatever the number is unless you can produce so much income but yet we're going to start taking away farmland for renewable energy that um uh you know could be could be a problem so you weren't here yet were you okay so it was Janet and Sam uh yeah commissioner Carlson and and it was unanimous we had a big hearing about it uh and uh we we voted to because the the legislature allowed us to opt out of this okay so we said go put it in efu land on the east side where your trucks or whatever so basically we we stopped it from um back in 2018 and um I don't know that we've had others since then this might be the first one that's gone this far at least I'm sure there's been others denied that just haven't been appealed to us yeah to my knowledge this is the first one that's that's gone this far yeah and I've in my time here in three and a half years I'm not sure we've had an application for one so so much chair for me I mean it'd be up to the the two of you I I'm saying I'm going to deny it but I mean that's where I would go today but if you wanted to uh have somebody come in and go through the facts and do all that stuff you know I'm I'm open to the board's desire I actually agree oh yeah I'm not I totally support the decision from 2018 I just think it's important to have it on the record stated today and then also just for my own information I did do some research prior to today and had conversations uh with different residents throughout Marion County specifically some in North Kaiser who are pretty pissed off about the fact that there is a solar farm just north of the volcano Stadium on efu land that demolished a bunch of um well some long-term crops there I think that it is there's mixed emotions around this sure and I understand that but I agree with you wholeheartedly that if we can't do more practical things on efu land like supporting housing and families and the expansion of farms um I don't know why we would put solar Farms there and there was a a discussion that we had had my first year in 2021 where there was a solar farm that was causing us quite a bit of Havoc it had been code enforced on their you know um the grass and the foliage around it was a fire hazard and it took public works I recall this Brandon probably who was here trying to get us through this enforcement process but because they become quite a burden because they're not you know technically managed they're just out there so I don't I I do support the denial of the appeal and want to uphold the 2018 decision so for me it's less I mean I I support the decision I have friends on both sides who are farmers but for me what this is about is it's a legal interpretation dispute okay and so I don't think we're going to provide any Clarity on this legal interpretation Luba is the one that will do that so I think from our from my perspective as I look at like Marion County interprets the code in the law this way their attorney interprets it this way it's like that's something for Luba so so if we deny this appeal in a pulled the hearings officer decision that allows the applicant if they want to keep going on this thing to go to Luba and say hey Luba who's right in interpreting law here I don't know that us having a hearing is actually gonna do anything other than make that process take longer not provide any Clarity on that so I I would just as soon deny it and if they want to keep going they can go ask Luba what they think yeah Jane were you here when we did this hearing do you want to add anything that there are a whole bunch of conditions that the board added to the solar farms and they were just really confusing and it was hard for applicants to figure out if they applied and that was all part of of all the testimony that's that's what I recall and I also recall that there was some discussion about going to the Planning Commission but that's well I think I think the discussion was I mean there may be some efu land that can't be it's dry land it's Hills out South Salem or something that that we were talking about okay well go ahead and you know put a solar farm on this hill that you maybe you can you can grow some sort of grain on it or whatever but we were just like how do you get to that point where the soils are are not high value in discussing it but the challenge was these things were going in really close here in the valley to the infrastructure where they you know pgd needed them so okay Mr chair if you're ready I'm ready uh I will make a motion that um Let me let me go back here and look at my where I'm at so this is the make a motion that we deny the appeal and uphold the hearings officer decision denying the request of cu-22041 all right second the motion we have a motion a second is there any further discussion seeing none all those in favor signify by saying aye aye aye aye the motion passes okay thank you Austin thanks for your work on that um okay so that concludes our uh agenda for today is there anything else that uh you'd like to share with us commissioners look I went to jail last night and then you got out that's the important part is getting out of jail yeah the sheriff walked me out actually uh and he said this might be the last time he walked me out of jail he might have to come visit you next time yeah yeah as a citizen as a as a citizen uh it was great to see um those people those you know employees that are serving Marion County Citizens and what they do inside that that facility and it was it's always humbling to go and and well when we do our tour and see what's going on in their yeah and the good work that they do to keep the place clean and and treat people with dignity and um there was a couple of the deputies I was talking to and they just said they had a an individual in there that was going through alcohol withdrawals last night and they said that that is the worst it's worse than drugs to and and they describe this individual and and it was like his they know about his life outside and it was really interesting so they they not only do their job but they care about you know people that that come there and they they have a heart for what they're going through so that was a always a good thing to go out and celebrate Corrections and nurses nurses week and uh um to see everybody and they had instead of barbecue they had well they had barbecued like uh smoked chicken with rice and it was it was like Hawaiian right yeah it was like it was like a Smokehouse Hawaiian thing is that what you had yeah for lunch yeah yeah and then they had um drumsticks ice cream drumsticks I missed the drumsticks I hadn't had one in a while yeah it was good yeah it's good to see everybody it seemed like the morale was high and people were you get about themselves when I went so and I was at the Oregon garden yesterday afternoon with uh Oregon Department of Forestry and it was really interesting because I walked in there and you've we've met some of the people that have been at our meetings like up in the canyon and there was a panel up there that was giving their their talk about what they went through in the fire and making decisions and how they've taken one of the guys was talking about how still today he will be criticized because he pulled everybody back in a certain spot and he said you know he's talking about making decisions as a leader and taking the consequences as a result of that but he said all I could think about was people's lives and that's why he made that decision and there there was hardly a dry tear in the place when they were they were doing it and here we are almost three years later them talking about what they went through that night that day um so that was pretty cool yesterday to be over there but the organ that the garden Resort needs some work that air conditioning wasn't working it was hot in there that's not our issue but um well thanks for being there no sir okay done with that we're",

        "text": " agricultural land from wildfires and grasslands in eastern Oregon uh being that there are grass are fairly common in EAS ggan uh council member Devin yes uh we are distinguishing in two ways uh one is that the fire risk data which is pulled from the community Wildfire protection plan tool uh which is itself based on uh quantitative fire risk modeling prepared by the US B service um is the current kind of publicly available um fire set that is most commonly relied on for local planning efforts and other fire planning efforts in the state and the way that that model treats agricultural lands uh it's crop stubble and fields are treated as particular fuel models and I can't remember which one off top of my head is uh shows up as unburnable one of them shows up as unburnable one of them shows up as low risk um in part because the fuel loading is different than what's on Wildfire lands um I think in eastern Oregon uh we we are aware and and the certificate holder should be aware that there's typically a 2-year rotation cycle for dry land weed farming um so that looking at a static GIS map of what was in production and what wasn't in one year isn't the best model and we should probably assume that um those areas are not totally unburnable but there is some risk but uh that the the more conservative fuel modeling of low risk is is probably still applicable um whereas yeah more uncultivated typically show up as as higher risk areas they're at just they're in places that can are more likely to result in a uncontrollable fire or a fire with larger flame laks and all that stuff so I hope that makes sense um the other difference is we are looking at um getting enhanced requirements for containment of the fires that could affect agricultural land different than um uh grasslands just to say that if the certificate holder needs to go out and suppress a fire when they're thinking about where containment lines or where efforts should be focused um we think that those efforts should be focused on first I mean preventing Hazard to the public and and people and human infrastructure um and then second looking at all the other resources at the site uh including agricultural operations and private property um biological resources such as fish and wildlife habitat and threatening dangered species cultural resources all those things as well when they are uh coordinating with the local fire responders to kind of um put out the fire or keep it from spreading thank you chair how yes um councelor ases thank you I'm sorry I think that this um this uh particular matter that we're talking about kind of is a good example of a previous topic that we were talking about and that the data and the standard and our goal to move them together a little closer um because I'm curious about the fire risk data here and um how it is classifying it as a low significance in the area so um with the combination of high winds dry um grasses and Dryland wheat um in my opinion I see those as highrisk areas so um I think that this is a good example of how our rule making process could be improved upon um for this these kinds of situations um it was also noted I think in the comments about um the National Weather Service data was that utilized in the analysis uh thank you council member IMS um so the uh the comment regarding data well so I'll take your comments in in two and and maybe your first one was just a comment and not a question so um as far as what the data is and how it is repaired um it's not perfect it is a model but um it does um the fuel on the site in the raster you know it's a little goes by scares it's all based on GIS data so it looks at that it does look at other things like topography um and uh um I don't know if it considers like the wind patterns in a specific area but it would look to see if there's factors that would increase the intensity of the fire or the spread of fire um it kind of runs those through a statistical model and says How likely is this to be a bad fire or a harmful fire and I do have that map um I can pull up which kind of shows the granularity of that data um on a slide later so um those things I think are incorporated into that fire modeling um the fire models are not uh super up to date that's 2018 data that's being relied on for this um we are expecting uh Department of Forestry to release a new wildli risk map um based on legislative changes that are occurred 2021 um after uh Oregon had a couple of really bad fire Seasons so uh when there's updated data released we do expect them to be incorporated into these these plans but um that's just I guess where we sit with the the data and um why question real quick yeah the the forest data data that's um being compiled or renewed um that's on you Forest land only it would be Oregon Department of because I'm not familiar oh yeah uh thank you council member I'm so it's a legislative directive to the Oregon Department of Forestry to provide a Statewide Wildfire risk map that would be all lands yeah um yeah so this is uh because the forestry departments often have subject matter jurisdiction over Wildfire issues I think that's why it's sitting within but it's not specific to Forest lands or um public forests um to answer your answer your second question about the The Weather Service data um I don't know if that was specifically incorporated or how that's incorporated into the data modeling um climate data and precipitation data uh is reflected into the models um the uh as far as like the frequency of uh red flat warning events and I think this is something we'll address a little later to um I don't know if that is particularly because those things are responsive to events um they collect that data though they collect that data I did look for it and um wasn't able to find it that doesn't mean it's not available it just means I I didn't didn't find it uh readily packaged in a way that I could present to you all I I would have but um uh I do think how that is dealt with in the Wildfire mitigation plan is that um the certificate holder and the Department's revised wmp included some Provisions for um maintaining uh fire weather watches during uh red flag warnings and and red flag or in the other the the pre- red flag event uh which is like a fire weather watch I think it's called um and whether or not those Provisions are adequate I think we can discuss on another slite because that is an issue that we think does uh warant more conversations thank chair just for the record this will be an ongoing discussion this is a fairly new standard for the C so the science I think is evolving and we're getting smarter but I bet we have these discussions every time we have a big facility I think it would be helpful maybe to do a work session with Department of Forestry regarding the data that's available um I think when you outlined this as you know we have several aspects of fire mitigation onsite then we have the offsite and there are priorities and human health and safety is probably at the top so knowing what structures might be at risk agricultural structures at risk agricultural productivity at risk there's kind of a hierarchy and we're going to learn more and figure that out I think some of the weather data can be used to trigger on-site Behavior so maybe if there's a Red Flag Warning you may have more people on site there are lightning apps you can know if there are lightning strikes in the area those are things that change the risk so I think part of this is just educating ourselves and coming up with conditions that make sense both onside and then offside I think the the plan that was originally submitted deals with onsite pretty well but now we're asking our applicants to look offsite and to really do that coordination with the local um fire people and emergency responders so that's what I think we may be looking for as we review these conditions knowing that each time we do one of these certificates we'll come up with more conditions on this as we become wiser and um I certainly appreciate the public comments on this topic because they're the neighbors and they will deal with this so thanks for your work with the applicant on this but I think it's going to be a process for all of us thank you thank you council member Byer yeah it's a learning process for us as well and uh a think in an evolving field in general um and something we all take very seriously and have lived experience with so U not something to be taken light um okay we'll come back to Wildfire again I guess before I leave this slide um one thing in response to council member buyer's comments is that because this facility um was originally approved prior to the adoption of the Wildfire standard there is still some bifurcation of um items related to public services and items related to Wildfire um I think the way it's currently structured most of the prevention and risk mitigation strategies were really incorporated or intended to be incorporated into um the Wildfire plan so again we can talk about the merits of that plan and and what if it needs further Revision in a minute um wildfire response in coordination with local fire service providers was really contemplated to be addressed under this other Emergency Management plan um we did provide you a copy of what's been submitted as part of preconstruction compliance that's not something that was attached to the DPO but we will be attaching it to the proposed order um in addition to any uh further conditions um that that we find to be necessary councilor HS I just want to reiterate that um with the language presented here today um that the department is stating that the risk of wild widespread fire in agricultural areas is low I disagree with that I just want to make sure that's clear on the record thank you first cond um Cindy Condon um like um councelor Imes I too was surprised by the low and I Dar it me is what is the um is the modeling based on is it a wildfire assessment you know 20 years ago or is it a wildfire assessment looking forward giving given what we know about drought climate change um where does the low come from and I I understand what you said that agricultural land are considered but I can't answer that question with a lot of specificity but I'll do my best and so it",

        "text": " all necessary infrastructure in the area we expect that Tiger's planning effort will be consistent with all the provisions in our adopted urban planning area agreement oh and actually I wanted to point out on this slide we do have the concept plan graphic up there you'll see the tile Flat Road Extension is included in there um city of tiger staff when we met with them last week specifically requested that we make make sure to add the legend onto this map which shows that they considered the tile Flat Road area as a future study area so they were also flagging that this is something that possibly needs further study and that was a real focal point when we went out and met with those folks out there was making sure they understood that that was we're talking about a study area and everything else is a city of tiger correct correct tiger will complete the comprehensive planning for the area within their ugb expansion so a lot has changed since we initially filed this ordinance a lot has changed since we were conducting the urban Reserve Transportation study some areas came into the urban growth boundary sooner than we thought that they would I think that we all thought the urban reserves might take a little bit longer to be brought in and that hasn't been our experience in recent years and so the blue area on this graphic was brought into the urban growth boundary in February of this year that means that our ordinance as initially engrossed by the board no longer needs the exceptions findings associated with with the piece that's within the Blue Area additionally because tiger is moving forward on their comprehensive planning effort and they will be the land use Authority for that area within blue we see the benefit of changing this ordinance as filed and turning it into refinement areas so that's our proposed change for the board we don't need the exceptions corridors then we don't need the exceptions findings then we're saying something's changing in this area we'll have more information about that in coming years and when that happens we can go back and Recon our plan documents and consider what we need to have adopted in there so the proposed engrossment will remove the goal exception analysis and strategies it will replace the functional classification map Amendment and exception corridors with the refinement areas and it will more clearly label the proposed refinement areas I want to talk a little bit more about refinement areas so refinement areas are a part of our transportation system plan objective 7.2 and refinement area definition or the objective says to identify as refinement areas where new arterial or collector connections or other improvements are necessary but the specific location mode and or function has not been determined we sometimes call these steady areas we're basically putting a flag in the map saying something's going to happen here we don't know what it is yet we're going to study it in the future we have 11 existing Road refinement areas and eight Regional Trail refinement areas in our tsp today so in this particular area we have ident ified the need for multimodal Street connectivity through previous planning efforts the proposed refinement areas would allow us to do additional evaluation of the specific alignment and function of the multimodal street connections we will continue to collaborate actively with city of Tigard as they move through their comprehensive planning effort when they're done and they've adopted their comprehensive plan we will update our transportation system plan to match what they've adopted for their planning effort and then future planning efforts for the undesignated areas to the west and the south of the River Terrace 2.0 areas will affect what happens there so generally I would expect that that would happen as a part of a future ugb expansion request while the undesignated areas are pretty long-term consideration for addition to the regional ugb it could happen within our planning Horizon so we're saying when it happens we'll do the study that we need to do so the specific change to our tsp would include these General eneral designations of refinement areas again these aren't intended to be alignments they're intended to be broad they're just showing what these areas look like and there will be a brief text description that goes along with those there was an attachment to your work session materials that contained the proposed text for these three there will be some revisions that you see for your packet for the 24th those revisions are based on conversations that we had with city of tiger staff we gave them the um the files and asked them to go ahead and edit and add any additional information or propose any changes to that text so they had the opportunity to do that and we're still working out some final details with them so you will see the proposed um engrossment text next week just for reference so the in the river terce 2.0 map from their concept planning there's the upper part that's labeled West and the lower part that's labeled South so this middle one mountains Side Way Extension that would pertain to the West one and the right one to the South one the southern right yeah okay terrific thank you okay does that make sense okay yeah I'm following so we're all on the west side of Roy Rogers Road here we'll probably have some further conversations about they're planning for the east side of Roy Rogers Road as well in coordination with King City so but not Forin area that's the they're both West that part is just the southernly part and that part is the upper part the undesignated area um specifically that we want to have the longer term refinement areas we have some maps that we'll show you on the 24th for the hearing I follow you I'm all good okay so are those three refinement areas yes are they all combined into they are three different refinement areas and we're treating them that way because we think that they're three different types of areas um in the middle obviously that is within Tiger's new urban area so we expect that will be sorted in the next few years as tiger finishes comprehensive of planning at that time we'll adopt what tiger has adopted and likely remove that refinement area from our tsp because we won't need it anymore um now on the left we have the undesignated area that is at the intersection of tile flat and schules ferry to the west of vandermost we stood there when we did the site visit with the community members that area and then the refinement area on the other side the mountain sideway Southern extension may come into the urban growth boundary at some point in the future but they're rural undesignated so it's probably a pretty long way off I get it okay thank you so I want to talk a little bit about some of the community concerns that we have heard and this has been a um pretty important part of our efforts in recent weeks have been to really communicate more directly with some of the affected property owners and people who are really concerned about this ordinance and explain to them the process that we've gone through and how we got here to the current staff recommendation of the refinement areas but throughout this process we've heard pretty consistent messaging from the community and so that summarized here initially a lot of the concerns we heard were about bringing Urban Reserve Land into the urban growth boundary or about planning for urban growth in an area that had been rural this has been resolved when the area came into the urban growth boundary so there is an urban Reserve out in this area anymore it's now within the urban growth boundary we still have the undesignated areas of course but those were planning for a longer timeline there were a lot of concern concerns about the width of the proposed Street and I think as commissioner Willie and I experienced there was some confusion about what the exception Corridor meant and how wide the street would be and so we had a lot of conversations about what a collector Road looks like and how wide those typically are but that's no longer a part of our ordinance because we're talking about a refinement area we don't have a street type we don't have a street WID we will resolve all of that when we finish our study effort a lot of concerns about environmental impacts well and I just remember back when you and I first walked onto that property and they pointed it out would they have 150t wide 375 ft yeah measured hug area that they thought we were going to put a road in there that big yeah so yeah so that was just a really good trip I you did a great job Aon and I think they really understood it better when we got done so I I think it's so important to do that and have that conversation and really understand what they were thinking we meant when we set a 375 ft exception Corridor we just meant we'll fit a 38t collector paved colle elor roadway in here at some point in the future we don't know exactly where within the 375 ft but people see 375 ft and that was really really stressful for the community to think that's what we were talking about we'd be putting in an i5 or something I think that's bigger than I5 actually so yeah it's it was significant and that's not what we were planning for um but clearly a lot of misinformation out there so it's really helpful to go out directly and talk to the community about these things um there's a lot of concerns about environmental impacts of growth in general not just with New Roads but particularly with New Roads and Bridge structur so that's something that we'll continue to hear as this area is developing and being planned for um people were concerned about growth occurring in the area after a new street is built um we expect that the growth will occur within Tiger's planning area regardless because it's now in the urban growth foundary uh people are really concerned about housing affordability and you'll hear this with city of tiger on the next slide as well so people are thinking a lot about how infrastructure affects housing affordability this is a really challenging problem we working on this at the County as well we'd like to find a way to make housing more affordable the concern is doing it on the back of necessary infrastructure or doing it on the back of our existing community members and our existing countywide transportation system so I think this is really challenging and something we'll continue to have conversations about with the community um the community had heard city of Tiger's comments and so they brought back a lot of those concerns to us as well people are really concerned about timing and funding and I think it's really difficult to explain to the community why we have a 20year transportation system plan and that we are required by the state to think 20 years in",

agency plan and moving to work thank you director Harrington would anyone in the room like to provide you public comment on this public hearing Mr delfi on the table we need to make way for a member of our community to testify in this public Harrington and Commissioners and hate to move out two of the very important people that made this happen today so thank you very much I didn't plan to make

comment on this public hearing for up to two minutes give you just a moment to utilize raise hand not seeing any additional Hands director thank you clerk moss and with that I would like to close today's public and see if there are any other board comments uh and if there aren't I would also like to floor open the floor up for a motion to authorize the chair to execute the public housing agency or PHA certifications and direct and authorize the executive director that would be Mr Calabar to submit the annual public housing agency plan and moving to work supplement to the housing of Urban I I move that we move forward on on the the motion on the table not going to repeat that whole thing because that was uh thank you we have a motion from director savaro a second from director Roper uh any last comments or questions no seeing none uh if you're in approval of this motion please raise your hand or say I any opposed the motion carries unanimously seven to zero thank you very much Stafford contemplary work and now moving on to the action items uh we have another very important item to help maximize the opportunity for uh safe and stable housing for our community members we have a proposal before us to uh authorize and execute as the formal language goes all of the documents and whatnot so that we can provide funding for one of the Metro affordable housing Bond projects clambeck garden apartment so please staff take it away good morning to Harrington and Housing Authority board of directors we are very very excited to bring the plumber Gardens to you this morning it was formerly called the basalt Creek it's in Tualatin and they had a change of name the developer is Community Partners for affordable housing CPA they came with our 2020 notice of funding and so this is the last of that group to get to this point the rest of them are either completed or under construction and so with much excitement that we bring this last one forward from the RFP so with that we have a PowerPoint to present and Melissa daily will do that for us for 10 board of directors I'm Melissa daily housing program coordinator in the Housing Services Department uh we're here today to ask for the final approval for plan back Gardens the signing Authority for our executive director on behalf of the Housing Authority as well as later today at the Board of Commissioners on consent asking for approval of the County Administrator to sign the closing documents on behalf of Washington County we were last before the board on March 7th for final approval of the 14.7 million dollars of Metro Bond funding and as Comey mentioned we're here for plan back Gardens formerly called Basalt Creek in Tualatin of note it is directly east of 6.7 Acres of the new Basalt Creek Canyon property that was purchased by the city of Tualatin with funds that were from also from Metro so before you is the unit count and I want to point out that of the 16 three bedrooms five of those will have project-based vouchers and of the six four bedroom units three of those will have project-based vouchers next go ahead 47 of the units will be at 30 percent of median family income that's 41 of the units of the eight project-based vouchers those will also be permanent Supportive Housing there are additional recreational opportunities provided at this property and a service partnership with Centro the total amount of funding for this project the total development costs are 67 million dollars the closing date is later this month on April 20th we anticipate a 14 to 16 month construction timeline and Lease up would start in the fall of 2024. a summary of our roles here up the the Housing Authority is providing a partnership for an annual property tax waiver and also the eight project-based vouchers Washington county is providing 14.7 million of Metro bond funds 1.2 million dollars of Home funds and five hundred thousand dollars of housing production opportunity funds and that's it for our presentation we're open for any questions directors do you have any questions go ahead director sabaro I just noticed in the in the briefing packet um you talked about the eight listening sessions and I think it was unite War again they moderated a community feedback session I just wonder if you could tell us a little bit more about like what what that was like if you have any you know just just notes from from you know partnering with unite Oregon I know they do a lot of great work around Washington County to support folks and um just curious if you had any you know specific direction from from those feedback sessions well to be honest I did not I was not part of that that work we did have a specific staff person at that time who was devoted to that work and actually um call out from Metro on the work that we had done call me did you want to talk about that right so we had a American volunteer at that time so they they did a lot of the community work for us but with United Oregon we started working with them during the pandemic to reach out and we've used them even for our portfolio and many of the larger bedrooms is because of their work because they Advocate when you do development you know the big you know three or four bedrooms the marketplace doesn't do them because they are costly to build and costly to maintain and but we as a public we we try to incorporate some of those larger units and unite Oregon and and their group was very big in advocating for those larger units and with our portfolio rehab we actually talked to the to the the interface because people don't like to move and even though the rehab is going to make their living space better they still don't like it so so we have United Oregon be the interface within those conversations Bonita Villa was one of our portfolio properties in Tigard 96 units I think anyway High number of units but that was very challenging and unite article really stepped up in working with us that's that's awesome I I really I really appreciate that we're uh we're partnering with community-based organization like them um you know get feedback and and insights from community members that we we might not have come to a public hearing if we just posted and and sort of went the typical route so I think it's so it's great that we're being proactive in our Outreach posture and also partnering with an organization that has the trust of so many community members so um just echoing the the um yeah look like that's awesome that we're really thinking about how to reach community members that their voices aren't always in government processes they're not always able to come to the table so um thank you for that all right thank you director savaro for uh bringing that question forward and and for the conversation that brought this to life I'm challenged at the moment because I can only contribute that I know that we have documentation on our website that enumerates uh how our staff did put together these exemplary programs for Community engagement uh I'll phrase it of nothing for us without us and so with all of the affordable housing Bond projects but also the rehab projects for the existing portfolio our housing team both with the development of additional affordable housing units through that Bond but also through the Supportive Housing Services has ensured that we have that level of community engagement with particularly with our historically underserved community members working with community-based organizations and our staff continues to represent that in in small mentions such as here right but also in the annual reports and quarterly reports that they have to provide to the oversight committee but we have not uh highlighted that for example to our advisory Council on racial Equity to date so that they see how we in fact have been operationalizing Equity through all of this work so we are challenged to do a better job there to represent the good work that our staff is doing so and and I'll have to go back for example to see where we have those posted so that we can remind ourselves when we get to these final phases right these punctures to continue to tell that story of exemplary engagement so thank you so much for your question and bringing that to light are there any other uh questions and comments go ahead just one comment I call me a nice job to you and your staff it's very complex the financing and these things just don't all of a sudden happen with a little money from the source of that you cobbled together a whole bunch of different resources so thanks I know Tualatin when I've been talking with their various electives and around their various groups they're very proud of this particular development occurring so thank you to all of that and I hope you come to that opening in August of 24. even though you may be retired by then I hope you come back and take a few bows because you certainly deserve it so you're going to be there on the 24th of August or whenever it is I",

        "text": " a city meeting that was posted Etc so it might depend a little bit on the on the content question I think part of that could have been a quorum rule or something else but making sure we set it up so we're not adding a to of work for you all it's probably ideal so trying to keep our numbers in check I think will be important so then we can quum is five a quorum is five um I think uh so so it could be part I I know three you're definitely okay and I believe four is okay three will be our plus that's a good small group if you start getting bigger than that then you can start to uhing become harder and each individual Community like well the other three are taking care of that so becomes more personal responsible fewer you have so okay um with that let's yeah let's do bring up the the six ideas you have from the climate action uh research topic so these are things that Rob just to clarify these are things that you and jul I have discussed Juliana mostly say that would be useful for us to dive deeper into just some some thoughts we had that would make made sense to us and we can elaborate on any of them if you have any questions great thanks we'll take a chance to to look at these um so uh do you maybe want to you want to come sit up here maybe chat real quick please thank you sorry we're kind of sort of putting you on the made um so the first one um using anything other than cars has really beneficial for the climate action plan and so um we were thinking how it could be kind of smaller plans for each individual Park so how can people get there if they aren't using personal vehicles and have just like a plan for alternative transportation and and the committee could be looking at a framework for that plan and then staff could maybe Endeavor to do one or two parks a year that was the idea there something like that um second one Bike Share hubs uh so this one's explicitly in the climate action plan um but having some type of a location would be really helpful for this so it would be where there would be charging for ebikes or if it's um if there's Bike Share programs where there would be physical location for so um area that the city owns is benefit IAL an area that people want to go to like a park is great so just bot on that and I and I that my vision there is more a research toward the development policy relevant to that if you're going to build a a bike Hub that you're going to encourage or and allow people to charge their ebikes at that's an expensive piece of equipment you're not going to run away from and leave unintended for very long so provision for it being able to Locked Up is inter goal to making that work sure yeah and um uh chariots is working on Bike Share programs but it would it would be like Rob said like a policy for how it would interface with the parts okay current currently there have been a uh one at least one company doing uh ebike rentals from I thinkt I don't know if they associated with Courthouse or if they were just near Courthouse but they' had a station in West Salem and one downtown that you could uh do your e charging or uh but renting from if that could be incorporated in a hub a rental system I bet a company would be willing to share the cost of installation and stuff let me tell you I just got back from Europe and they're all over the place so so I think that my thinking here Al is those are all brilliant ideas for and thoughts for if and when we set up a committee on these things for the committee to bring forward as as considerations for that idea details now glad to see it happening uh I'll take parking design standards this is a this is a you may all remember the gear Park Master Plan update there are no um there are no minimum requirements for us to provide parking in our Parks uh it's a it I we don't also have we lack tools to help us guide and plan how many parking spaces we should provide in Parks so again I'd be looking for any direction or thoughts uh the board would have on on what's that right amount of parking to provide uh based on use based on amenity of type type um and and then you can even expand beyond that you know how do how do we make parking a multi-purpose space or you know how do we better utilize uh on on-site perking Jan you want anything else I missed on that would that sorry yeah uh one of the things that we were talking about was um kind of like energy there are times where there's Peak demand for it and if you had ways of managing the peak demand so people are using the parks more over time and less at one specific time you could kind of get away with having less parking spaces so it it could be something that goes beyond the thoughts of just parking what would be the possibility of using parking lots that were painted for pickle ball room um just the thought I I I don't have me reaction other than I have observed that in Eugene they have striped basketball courts and some of their parking lots so so there certainly other have thought about it yeah okay next just my only com be that if you don't provide enough parking people will park places you don't want to so that's only you want to take next one um yeah so agree yeah yeah so again we're looking a lot at energy and um one of the pieces of energy is um the main energy provider in this area uh Portland General Electric is working on um a program called Community green Terrace they also have state initiatives regarding um cleaning up their grid substantially and um one of the pieces in getting a clean grid is having local Deployable uh renewable energy and so one of the thoughts that Rob so graciously is helping on is um we've been working with University of Oregon sustainable City years on one such idea for this on uh where microgrids might play a role in parks and so again not looking at doing that but looking at policies around how my micro grids could interface with parks and by micro grids you mean like a small solar array that that would be an example yes all right winter next um citizen science projects so uh one of these that could happen um we're uh trying to monitor specifically ash trees for um the Eastern ashore Emerald as thank you sorry G I get that wrong all the time I got the letters right though um but it didn't come from the East okay close everybody knew what I Wasing um so one of the things would be could we have there be volunteers that are able to um learn about what they need to be reporting on and being able to engage the community around different issues so one of them was talking about uh using I naturalists and doing different inventories in Parks um or even kind of expanding from that like getting them interested enough to maybe use IR naturalists and identify trees near their home or if we do have a community outreach on um the ash trees or um another one is we're looking at the possibility of doing Urban heat mapping so having kind of a volunt group and fostering them to do some of these citizen science projects and I'll just be explicit on the urban heat island mapping I think the Nexus there was sprb is uh we're we're we're trying to develop canopy in low canopy areas and and that that's simply it it another tool for us to hone in where are those priority areas we should be really uh you know planting trees both in the RightWay and Parks but also where we thr putting our efforts toward programs to get uh trees growing on private properties as well and that effort um we are trying to do a regional study for 2025 in July so there's time but um if there is assistance available I will happily take that um urban forestry resiliency framework um so looking at that was more canopy right so looking at what types of trees and where um obviously we have tree canopy goals but in some parks it makes sense to have a lot more trees than it does in others I believe someone was talking about how they have to sweep the tennis courts maybe that's an ideal place to have a lot of trees versus other parks that are less uh play oriented could be a great place so just having those policies establish for each individual Park um and potentially canopy goal for each Park so it's for that Park you know specifically what's our goal for that Park you can most lik plant your larger canopy trees in parks instead of on streets related to that a little bit is the preservation of some of those trees that are being assaulted by English ivy is there in another invas invasive perhaps is there any consideration in the parts that are pro are problematically hit with that to have it I know at one time there was a removal effort on Wallace Marine for a while is there anything being done with that yeah uh the parks uh volunteer coordinator Amanda sitter and I are having a lot of conversation about how we can promote uh return of IV pool events um and we're looking at doing one at Fair viiew Park specifically but broadly we're thinking about how can we support groups to get back to helping us uh address that issue throughout our CES you're right it is Insidious yeah and it's everywhere yeah everywhere across state um so I spoke with rob a little bit about this and um if your parks and wck department is kind of more Capital Parks lowercase wreck um one of the policies that works a bit better than in cities where it's much more Recreation than it is Parks um is zero waste uh Park event policy so if there are events in the Parks um they could say you will have no single waste single use plastic waste um sorry I took um and no balloon relases things like that could could be part of policies that would go on around that um in terms of climate action that is definitely more of what's seen and less of what's impactful but it it does play a big role in um kind of um how Parks operations goes and zero waste events are much better on Parks operations staff so if you want to think about longterm having less work for staff that's a a good one to look into yeah and I think I still the thunder on the next one already but I think the idea is just look at materials that are available that we utilize in our our",

        "text": " did that we'll know who to reach out to if you indicate that yes you want Odo to follow up with you Max did you have some GNA ask Steve does this that have a fuel storage yard or you just go to card lock be okay so what we're going to do now is move on to preliminary results of a few other categories so we're going to start with Stak holder engagement feedback and we're going to have a rhythm to our engagement and and a flow to um the remainder of our time together so starting with stakeholder engagement information I'm first going to tell you who it is that has been giving us information thus far I'm going to give you some highlights of what they've been telling us what their feedback is and then we'll do a quick check-in to see if you agree with what other people have been telling us then we'll move into preliminary results for the risk analysis we're going to approach each of the sub sectors individually so electricity natural gas and then liquid fuels and we'll follow this same series of content where we'll start again with the respondents um their final vulnerability rankings in the form of a matrix I'll dig in a little bit to Adaptive capacity and then we'll do a quick check in again to see um what your initial response is to these preliminary results and then finally we'll get to our risk mitigation measures and here we're going to start with a very high level approach um mitigation measures that can apply across all systems and then we'll go into a little more detail for the electricity natural gas and liquid fuels sub sectors and here you're really going to be doing the heavy lifting so I'm going to be speaking less and we're going to be giving more time to each of you to take a moment and give us your feedback so I'm basically going to tee up the risk mitigation measures for you and then you'll go into slido and what we're going to have you do is prioritize them let us know what's most important for your region so starting with stakeholder engagement this is a snapshot of the folks who have participated thus far this is before the road show began we had 144 individuals um giving us feedback and they're distributed um based on this map on the left where each of these circles represent the number of folks who have engaged with us colorcoded by the region located in a specific County for each region and you can see that the Portland metro area and the wamit valley had the highest representation but we did have folks from all six regions engaged in the top right you can see the categories that um participants are associated with so so most of the folks are from government that's that big yellow box and then the dark blue and light blue boxes are for the private sector and consumer owned utilities we also had a good number of folks from nonprofits as well in that yellow and then to our knowledge 15% of the folks who have engaged with us have some association with environmental issues so what have we've been asking them one of the most important things we wanted to understand are the types of threats that are impacting Energy System across the state and that's what this map summarizes for us so each of these pie charts are are located in each of their six regions and they're sized based on the number of threats that were cited within that region and then each of the slice of the pie is colorcoded based on the type of thread that was referenced and this is where we start to see a trend emerge you might notice that the slices of the pie that are pink red and purple tend to be largest across the regions in the state and those represent wildfire in red Windstorm in purple and winter storm in pink and these three threats continually rise to the top for um the highest level of concern in general so we also asked which Subs sector is most often impacted by these disruptions by the different threats the most common response was electricity sub sector you can see that in the bar chart on the left that's followed by the liquid fuels sub sector in this case specifically petroleum and then finally natural gas something important to note about this figure is that we did have a higher level of participation from the liquid fuels private sector so they could have had a disproportionately high reference number of um disruptions relative to the other sub sectors the figure on the right is summarizing for us the length of the disruption so how long does it take in general to restore service the mo most common responses that it takes a matter of days so we're looking at really less than a week's time across all three we asked a number of questions related to preparedness what I'm showing you here is just the responses related to backup generators and you can see it's roughly divided into thirds the dark blue represents folks that do have a backup generator present yellow there is not one present and gray it's unknown with those that do have a generator available there's a big variety or a big spectrum of the operational capacity offered by those generators so there are some that it could offer full operational capacity but it could also be as little as just providing a safe shutdown our last topic that we're summarizing today for stakeholder engagement is related to environmental justice the pie chart on the left the left is helping us understand what the highest um communities of concern are as they relate to EJ issues so the most commonly referenced Community is a low-income Community that's in the dark blue and that's followed by rural communities in yellow and then tribal communities in Gray and then on the right hand side we have um a summary of the issues that are of highest concern for these communities so the most common reference is power supply disruptions and this aligns with what we saw earlier where the most um the the sub sector that's most often impacted is the electricity sub sector and then the second most common reference was for toxic fume exposure so at this point we're going to go back to slido um this is going to be the the largest collection of questions we're going to ask you to answer in a single um increment the first question here is question number two and what we're asking is just for you to help us understand what resonates with you so what everyone else is telling you I'm sorry what everyone else is telling us do you agree with what they're saying um does it align with your experiences and your understanding of the system and you want to affirm that in contrast question three is asking about anything you disagree with something that doesn't align with your understanding of what's going on and then questions 4 through eight all relate to environmental justice issues so again we want to improve our understanding of these concerns so giving you an opportunity to to share that with us here so we're going to give you a couple of minutes to work through these questions and then we're going to move into our preliminary results for the risk assessment and so as you guys get started on these questions if there are any um questions or comments that you'd like to share please feel free to come off mic if you're um joining us online or anyone in the room just let us know and we'll pause for just a moment I have a question yeah so um I know Rob and Moss from Jo Jose County there's me and then there was a Melinda it appears to me there's only maybe four members of the public that are participating in this meeting because I I I heard the Oregon Health Authority Oregon Emergency Management participants is that that because I'm not logged in right now I'm just wondering you know we all start participating you know you're G to have two responses in this meeting or you know am I track is that so reality of this I mean we would like responses from everybody who's attending oh are there more attending online than who identifi themselves no everybody who identified at the beginning is currently loose right um but they can always share the slider link with their colleagues and we could continue to just collect feedback that way as well okay yeah we have had other regions if you're um you know those of you online and and if you want to share we'll be posting the slides online through on the ESP website and a recording of this presentation as well and you guys can go on there folks can watch or walk through the slides themselves and then um share the slid the slid will be open through the end of the month so as long as those responses are provided um by the end of this month we'll be able to incorporate them into the framing of of the final results for the ESP and if if something um strikes your fancy later um we can definitely incorporate that into a revision of the plan since we're going to be updating this every year um if we miss something we want to hear that we miss something okay I know that you said you already had had contact my corporate office I just I have to see uh this me I thought oh I think I'll go sit in now you know there's an assignment all oh no how do well I think we'd love to get the best feedback we could and if you feel comfortable participating uh to represent a Vista that'd be great uh if you don't and you want to talk to folks in your office and if you ask somebody else to answer I think that's okay too oh yeah we'll keep the open till the end of the month yeah I yeah I I might yeah do that and for context I I live in the Valley region so I attended the meeting yesterday and did a slido as myself as a citizen who lives there not as necessarily agency version yeah I I could I could do the citizen hat and not the utility hat because I'm answering on the half the utility they resp thinking I confer internally um a s back you said that um that there was the second what is toxic fume EXP exposure so any any type so for example I'm in Houston Texas and oh Big Oil and Gas and there's a lot of fumes that are associated you know in in that area and so having a high level exposure we have like cancer alley type two potential liquid fuels or yeah basic anything that could be related to the energy sector so it's not specific here they're not specifically calling out there was power that was nearby suspect many of those answers in the north Portland area at the industrial zones yeah okay there's a lot of heavy yeah if your question was also in relation to like other input y'all did do a survey before this right to gather input from the region in addition yeah so this is like a second layer yeah so this is our initial information this you know that what I've",

        "text": "-based renewal renewable energy projects often are so just bear with me but my name is christy split i'm the government relations director for the oregon department of energy and when i think about my favorite small-scale community-based renewable energy project i always envision a coos bay fire department that has solar panels on the roof because it provides resilience benefits and it's in a community that i really care a lot about so i will leave it at that and then i think we can just to the extent possible i will just call on the people alphabetically from this list to make things go a little bit smoothly you can just come right out turn your camera on if you know you're next and go and that'd be awesome too and i haven't checked to make sure that um to see who's who precisely is on right now so um hopefully we won't have too many awkward moments where i call on someone and they're not there i'll try to keep tabs on that but with that i hope ali is okay with being in the hot seat and being first up uh from world climate hi good morning um can you all hear me we can great i have to keep my video off because my wi-fi is a little rough at my house um hi everyone i'm allie rosenbluth i am the campaigns director at rogue climate um based in our uh our rogue valley office but we also have an office in coos bay um one of my favorite small scale renewal projects um actually not one that we've worked on but that lake county resources initiative worked on um at the 4h uh the the 4h stables layer where they have uh solar setup with the the pigs so it's pretty cute and just what we're looking for for future of small scale renewables love it thanks sally angela hi everybody angela crowley cook i'm the executive director of asea the oregon solar plus storage industries one of the problems of having an a name going early i think i'll say one of my favorite projects is the community solar project that's going on in the ashland rogue valley area rogue i love it because it's totally community and community-led and i also love it because it's really demonstrating the challenges of building uh community solar and we're learning a lot from that project and and hopefully paving the way for better things in community seller thanks thanks so much i don't see bob here so i think that'll bring up dan next and i feel like dan and webex don't get along so we'll see what happens all right dan's off mew but i think he sometimes has trouble so i'll see if he can put something in the chat and share it out with everyone if that works and hopefully we can figure this out at some point sorry dan uh let's next up is going to be diane everybody diane hankles i've got my video going i think but i can't see myself so um thank you diane henkels good morning happy friday uh i am the lead council in oregon for small business utility advocates representing the interests of the small businesses in oregon in um energy regulatory proceedings basically uh i do have a favorite uh uh community energy project and that is sort of a pre call it a project assessment effort it was uh one that was started a long time ago in lincoln county where the county undertook with help of energy trust and some others do a a wind energy feasibility study and have uh put up an anemometer gather some data uh that's where i know of it now so thank you so much that's great thanks for sharing thank you um i just i i don't think dave mobile is on but if dave i if you are just feel free to speak out uh next up will be eric hi yeah my name is uh eric anderson i work with pacific corps as the strategic manager for renewable energy mostly my team manages the voluntary renewables programs like blue sky and community green tariffs as they are developed over the next year and community solar so work in a lot of these same spaces i think the uh one project that i i really like that i've had a portion of was a project in walawa right at the base of walawa lake where they put in a device to capture the energy from a pressure reduction valve so rather than just wasting the energy and turning it into heat it's actually turned into and used to power some facilities so i really like projects where we're just not wasting energy and really figuring out how to creatively use it so that's one of my favorite projects recently thank you so much for sharing eric next up we have james valdez hi everybody great to be here uh james valdez he him pronouns and i'm organizational development and policy manager for the portland clean energy fund which is housed within the city of portland's bureau of planning and sustainability where i work coming to here from north portland and it is so hard to come up with a favorite um but i guess i'll go maybe back about a decade uh to a project that was i think really inspirational to me that i saw in germany outside of freiburg which was a a kind of solar and wind cooperatively owned project on a small farm um that was on a building part of the solar array was on a building that was over 300 years old it can be done in all scales and um all over the world and glad that we can keep building great ideas and projects here in oregon too great thank you so much james i love the aspiration from another place jimmy good morning everyone uh pleasure to be here my name is jimmy lindsey and i'm a manager our renewable initiatives team at portland general electric and my team's responsible for a number of things including a lot of our renewable procurement and also contracting with smaller scale renewable projects throughout the state um you know the the project i'd highlight for the group and one that i think is a good example of what can be done with community scale renewable energy is the beaverton public safety center it's an it's a facility that houses the beaverton police department but also um is sort of complemented with solar and storage equipment that allows the project to operate independently to provide some resiliency benefits for the community in the event of a grid-wide outage and i think it's pretty cool so great to meet everyone and great to be here looking forward to it thank you so much next up john good morning good morning i'm sorry bobbled a little bit getting uh getting on the screen i'm john jennings i'm the uh community services specialist for the department of land conservation development i've been our lead on several uh renewable energy rulemaking efforts and and also just just uh you know thinking through this subject in in general i guess i don't know if i have a if i have a favorite from a small scale project if i if i did i think it would be uh there's a there's a hydro i guess would be micro hydro or small hydro project that was uh constructed by the central oregon irrigation district several years ago on i think it's a private butte between band and redmond um and just to really seem to fit right there uh quite well and um it helps to provide some power and also augment the the cost of delivering that water and as as a customer of coid i appreciate that so thank you very much thank you so much next up julie hi good morning everybody i'm julie peacock i'm the oregon liaison at the bonneville power administration i might broaden mine to say my favorite program is the one i first learned about uh when i came to oregon which is the ashland um solar pioneers program so good to see everybody great thank you so much nice to see you next up is keshia hey good morning this is keisha brockman i'm with the oregon public utility i am about to change my role from utility analyst to policy advisor but my background is largely in renewable energy and more recently that includes storage as well i think similar to john jennings i'm actually pretty excited about the irrigation modernization effort that is going on throughout oregon including that central oregon water district i the fact that they work with the irrigation district means that they're bringing together a community of people to support this project and they're providing both water efficiency and energy generation and i think that's thank you yeah my name is tom mcbartlett i'm the director of the electric utility for the city of ashland um i'd say one of my favorite small renewable projects is the fact that we about 12 500 meters and we have over 400 rooftop installations in in our service territory which has led us to be able to offer virtual net metering for those who don't have good solar access to partner with friends neighbors that may be better have better solar access and take advantage of that and still get the rewards from that great thank you so much for sharing that example we all hear a lot there's already been how many ashland examples this morning all right next up uh let's see i think we're we don't have on the line yet so we'll go to mark oh mark patterson because we've got a few got three on the line actually hello this is mark patterson with idaho power i'm in the tnd strategies group and um one of my a small scale renewable projects i like it was installed about 10 years ago what i like about it's a wind project they took some older wind turbines out of california that had been mothballed and they put them to use in this new place in oregon where they um refurbish them some put some new blades on and so rather than just have these go into the um into the trash bin we'll say they were able to put them back and they've been running well now so it's sort of inspirational for me great thank you so much and then i'll um go to mark nystrom and then i'm going to break the order to keep alphabetical we'll go with representative owens after mark you actually sound a little bit like a charlie brown parent that's fascinating so we might i'm gonna have maybe we'll circle back to you oh you have one second okay we'll come back to you in a second okay representative owens thank you so much for being here today yeah thanks christine thank everyone mark goins a",

        "text": " uh was able i was able to piggyback underneath some of their resources that they had already in the in the area to to provide maintenance to my facility i made this as not just not um you know defining you know fixing a fault on the universe that's tripped it's it's doing the periodic maintenance it's providing basically upgrades to blades and generators as required and then the other factor which is absolutely critical too is the is the 24-hour seven seven days a week monitoring other of the facility edf was because they're already in the area were able to to do that but etf left the area vestis was able to pick up that contract best has had uh similar contracts with montag and khan in uh condon in uh bigelow canyon with uh portland general electric um you know i would not be able to do this without those assets being in in place case in point you know i lost a um i lost a 1.5 hitachi generator um about a month ago um i was able to mobilize cranes out there to pull that generator out of the cell within within about a day i was able to get crews into the area within about a day also these were all local crews maybe not all living in the the wasp area because there's a housing shortage there but living in the any places from goldendale to arlington to the dalles condo and border men were all around the area this this is this is a resource i had to have thank you that was great awesome thank oh sorry um this is grant from sbua um i just had a couple questions for you orman about um kind of like the model that you have i saw that you said that um you had about seven million in local investment and i was wondering uh where that investment came from was that from community members was it from local i was just curious about that that's that's basically 7 million that we had spent in the local area during the construction side local investment was really it's myself and my brother we had another local investor from the food river area and then we have a minority uh outside investor that's that was this this is basically the the equity structure okay that that's good to know and would you say that um this is kind of like a model that perhaps um with better regulation could become easier for businesses to kind of band together to create these projects or yes yes in fact i i look at i i would hope that eventually you know structures within oregon on a cooperative basis could could do this type of work um i think you know i know of at least probably enough you know private individuals uh who are looking at who have looked or talked to me about developing upwards of 100 megawatts if you add everything up to together could be done if if this type of structure could be could be replicated for the future uh it's difficult to do it's not going to fit in every site but it can be done uh that's great and just one last question um i did also recall from your presentation you mentioned that um sometimes with the intermittent nature ppas can be difficult to navigate for projects like this especially if you're not um generating for a utility so um have you looked into perhaps uh battery storage options well i i i have and and that's one of the areas that we want to go down you know we as as i mentioned you know everything i have is built out for 10 megawatts but you know i have a net capacity factor around 36 so that means 65 of the time you know my my build out my below ground distribution line my substation my transformer my interconnection with wasp with law school electric my bpa transmission is not being utilized to its fullest capacity why can't i put in in 10 megawatts of solar with a storage capacity on a on the battery gives me maybe two hour of a battery shift then all of a sudden my power becomes much more valuable to grid but there's no there's no ppa in the oregon puc right now that i can that i can do do that um underneath the new fur rulings with ferc should be in northwestern versus broadview i think out of canada i know it gives me some insight in how i could do that if i wanted to do that on a negotiated basis i really don't have the skill set to do that i really need to work with the puc get get a firm ppa with firm tariffs established for that type of dispatchable capacity that's what i want to do perfect thank you so much orman all right thank you so much i don't see any other questions from our committee oh no dave has his hand up now great dave go ahead thanks i'll make it i'll make it quick christy dave mullah energy trust orman thanks for the presentation you had mentioned the success of small or community scale wind energy development in minnesota now taking into account of course the in some respects different wind regime availability of wind resources throughout minnesota what what do you see are the main differences why the success they're not here what are the market forces at play what has happened in minnesota to drive that industry forward i think one of the things in the very early on and i'm sure it has changed the last 10 years but very early on minnesota was one of the regional states that initiated what was called the minnesota flip model where basically farmers and local landowners could cooperate with the developers where the developers would provide the initial financing you know maybe finance it for a 10-year period run it for 10-year period and then it would flip to the local land owners after after a set amount amount of time this is all all within the you know the minnesota legal system i'm not that familiar with it um myself but uh it was it was very successful there in the in the initial uh stages like i say i'm sure that's changed um and you have to be a nimble on on your feet to keep up with the local all the law change changes but that's that's sort of what got it going in the very thank you okay and then we did have another question from grant in the chat i'll just ask it really quickly he wanted to know ormond how many cobid firm workers certification office of business inclusion and diversity so how many cobit firms worked on the i'm not quite tracking on that on that term but itself maybe you could explain yeah um grant i know we're supposed to just be having this conversation with our with our worker members but grant can we get grant off mute again and we'll um we'll have him ask hi thank you i i appreciate it and um i just wanted to make the panel clear that i'm uh here on behalf of diane hinkles uh she is a work group is listening on the member but she's not able to participate right now um i should have mentioned that earlier i apologize yeah no problem we'll go ahead and elevate you to a panelist i just want to make a quick comment with you know the the project was completely it was it was a union built project from the very beginning uh you know 10 years ago 12 12 years ago we really really weren't looking at you know the dei um objectives back back in 2010 uh but i but i know as you know seeing the union work workers out there um i think we had a pretty good rep representation but can i say that we met all the current dei goals right now no i can't but we're definitely 100 perfect thank you okay um is that it christy i don't see the chat sorry yeah no more questions okay great so now we are going to move to our next presenter from the california public utility commission focusing on microgrids roseanne i see you're online are you able to unmute there you are hi can you hear me yes perfectly thank you hi my name is rosanna kevich and i am a senior regulatory analyst on the grid resiliency and microgrids team in the energy division at the california public utilities commission next slide as part of this team my one of the main issues that i have been um charged with working with is determining and discussing leading discussion groups on the valley of resiliency in an attempt to understand how to integrate resiliency issues into our grid planning processes into our tariffs and how to where those where this topic influences some of the other um preceding work that we do so the graph that you're looking at is what i started with in terms of in in trying to understand what we're talking about with resiliency on a official proceeding level what we are how we approach this is resiliency is a subset of reliability so if you're looking at this graph that blue line that comes along is our reliability line when that drops in response to a disturbance the magnitude and the speed at which it drops so the time and the speed represents the magnitude at which that reliability drops to a significant level at that point we are in a respond and phase of of this resiliency trapezoid we are there for as long as it takes before our response or recovery systems start kicking in to bring us up back up to the level of reliability that we began with our attempt to improve resiliency would be represented by that dotted line where we're trying to raise the floor of our trapezoid and we might raise that floor by either reducing the magnitude of the disruption in the first place or ex or reducing the length of time that we're in that response and adapt time or responding to uh improving our systems so that we can reduce the time before we're back up to speed in terms of reliability this is this trapezoid was uh developed matthias pantelli as he studied distribution and transmission line outages um in response to wind events in the uk the system can be and looked at from different systems as so this might reflect disruption in the energy system but we can also look at it from the just perspective of other interdependent system functions for our waste and water system potentially going um being disrupted the gas communications transportation all of which you can potentially even use the the disruption that occurred in texas as an example where energy disruption caused some of these interdependent systems to also be disrupted we can use this as a as a",

        "text": " applicant or this project in this location these are all the requirements that you have to meet meaning you have to submit all of this within your application we will review that we'll give you an opportunity to review that the next stage is the preliminary application so you can see up there there's a preliminary application for site certificate and an application for site certificate that's what the pasc and the ASC preliminary means that when they submit that to us we evaluated to determine whether or not it's complete did they submit everything that we had requested now that's not a public comment time frame when the application is deemed complete once we say you have submitted everything that we need you to submit that doesn't mean it's ready for approval a lot of times people equate one with the other it's not that it just means that we have enough information to evaluate at that point once it's complete we will do another full notice like we we will have another public information meeting like this in a bigger location and not during Harvest time so we will do that better but that'll be an opportunity for you to again it's not a com public comment time frame it's really getting you all set up for the next stage which um and and we have a bunch of funny terms but I'll just they are what they are so the draft proposed order is the next stage which is really it's us the department of energy looking at their application and evaluating that and saying you know Chase brought up the slide before with all the standards we go through it standard by standard and say this is what the applicant submitted did they meet the standard do we believe they met this standard then once we issue the notice on the draft proposed order that is a public comment time frame again Chase talked about our standards if you're commenting we you don't have to do that today you can say whatever you want you can say whatever you want throughout the process but once we get to that draft proposed order stage our Authority The council's Authority is limited to the council standards so if you bring up something that's outside of the council standards we really can't do anything with that um so that's why we want you to be thinking about what are our standards you know whether this whether you like this project whether you don't like the project whether you like us don't like us it really is the standards that's what I want everybody also to walk away from today is be thinking about did they submit an application that shows that they meet the standards did we write a report that also you know recommends to the council that they met the standards that's an opportunity for you to agree with us or disagree with us um and again again we encourage that also Chase will talk about this later throughout process we're not proponents it's their education we are the review agency we're here for them we want to run in a fast efficient process for them but we also want to run a transparent and open process for you so any of you you know we have our contact information on the notice on the website if you have questions throughout this process contact us that's what we're here for um so with the comments that we receive on the draft proposed order we write another document which is the proposed order which is really just taking into consideration all the comments we've received from the public from State agencies local governments tribal do we make changes is there anything that we didn't get right in the draft proposed order that based on those comments we want to change so that's the proposed order the next stage is if you commented during the draft proposed order on a council standard and you still think that we didn't get it right in the proposed order then you can request to participate in the contested case kind of like an appeal it's a bit of a legalistic process we won't get into the details of that right now again once we get into the completeness stage we'll get into a lot more details of these this is just sort of a giving you a heads up as to where we're we're going with this and then ultimately it goes to the energy facility citing Council and they make the decision on the project whether they meet the standards or not I'm just going to do a check because we've got a couple people who've come in and probably a couple people online to say that um we had a lot more people show up than we anticipated we were planning to start the formal presentation at six um didn't want to have a lot of people sitting around until six so we kicked it off if we get through this and there are still people that kind of came in late we can restart this um so we'll do it again if anybody's missed anything and they want us to go again so just anybody who's just come in just to make sure that you didn't didn't miss anything um and then finally what's not on the slide is if you're familiar with the local land use process so if a county issues a decision and that gets appealed it goes to The Landing sport of appeals that gets appealed it goes to the Oregon court of appeals and if that gets appealed it goes to the Supreme Court ours is different we go directly to the Supreme Court so if somebody participates in a contested case and they still you know don't think we got it right or don't think Council got it right they can appeal that decision decision directly to the Oregon Supreme Court next slide please okay I talked about state agencies local governments and tribal governments collectively in our process their reviewing agencies that's the term that's used for them and so we have you know me and my team we come from varying backgrounds we have different expertise but we don't know everything and we're not experts in everything and so our process heavily relies upon these reviewing agencies so um agriculture which is going to be a big deal here and we we know that we're going to rely on the Oregon Department of Agriculture and the department of land conservation development commission staff to say what do you think we are going to work with them for fish and wildlife we're going to work with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife so with the local land use requirements we're going to work in County so we rely heavily upon other um other agencies to help us in the process because our process is a Consolidated review so the way even though they don't have authority in our process they're functionally like staff in that they will we seek their input they will review information and provide their comments to us do we understand everything do we get everything right so you know you can go to us you can go to them if you have different thoughts and ideas as well next slide please uh we are the department of energy so no this is Chase uh and I'm Todd you're um so this slide one of the things in the notice of intent if you if you read the notice of intent it will talk about study areas and so um study area in the notice of intent is defined distances for the different resources and it says you the applicant have to do an evaluation at the notice of intent stage is desktop level um you know from the site boundary by a certain distance and so you can see for historic and cultural and archaeological resources it's the site boundary which is that Center bullet then for fish and wildlife they have to do whatever is in the site boundary and then go a half mile out recreational and threatening endangered species they go five miles out Scenic resources 10 miles out protected areas 20 miles out so that's what they've already done that's in the notice of intent now the importance of this in this conversation is you know I go back to the project order the document that says what they have to in the notice of intent they've already done that evaluation based on these distances in the notice of intent nope you're fine um so that's already been done but the importance of this is when they submit their application they have to do an evaluation of the same resources and it's called an analysis area it's a different sort of term but it's the same um and if you know we can either expand those or Shrink those so what we say in the project order is you the applicant have to go out and do these studies but some of these are going to be on-site studies so if there is an issue of historic and cultural and archaeological resources they may have to do you know in-ground studies fish and wildlife they have to do field studies so what are the distances of those it could by default be the same things but they could increase or decrease so if say for example you know of a Scenic resource that's really important that's 10.5 miles away that you think is going to be impacted by this facility we want to hear about that because we might be able to change then the analysis area that they have to do in their application to you know go 10.5 miles out or if we look at the notice of intent and there's nothing out there we may shrink it down so be thinking about that in terms of your comments during the notice of intent if you are aware of any resources that are Beyond these distances that you think are important next slide please so land use is a big kind of deal again our process is a Consolidated review most state agencies local governments their permits their requirements get folded into our process land use the applicant has the ability to make a choice so they can choose to go to Lynn County and have Lynn County run the conditional use permit or they can choose the energy facility citing Council because our process is a Consolidated review every applicant so far that in our history has chose that as a Consolidated they bring it to fsec but it's their choice in their notice of intent they've indicated that they will have the land use reviewed by the energy facility signing Council they can make that choice they can change that choice up until the time they submit their application so that's still their choice to make until they submit the application if Lynn County does it then their final decision will fold into our process a little bit later on if they continue with their election right now then we will review the land use requirements and we will work with Lynn County to seek their input on if they were going to conduct the review what are the requirements if there's anything that's unclear how they would interpret and if they would issue conditions what kind of conditions so we want to seek their input on this as well next slide okay I'm going to turn it back over to Nancy could you could you skip ahead to the applicant slides please I'm gonna I'm gonna",

        "text": " that are being provided, but the residents of this community on top of the world do have concerns about, again, sound, light, car headlights and intrusions. I took a look at what Marion County's because there was some talk about that, about what your sound ordinance provides. And you guys don't have a decibel meter standard. I know that could be tough to enforce. We had to deal with that issue down in Lake county previously. It's a plainly audible standard at night. And if basically, if noise emanates from this new development into on top of the world, I don't think there's any question it's going to. And it's plainly audible between 10:00 p.m. and 06:00 a.m. then that violates your code. So it's not somebody with a decibel meter there at the community. It's going to rely upon likely that residents of on top of the world or any other development that's impacted by this to make complaints to law enforcement. Bring a law enforcement officer into their home in the evening in order to enforce that ordinance. As I read the ordinance, I think that's. That's pretty accurate. And if there was going to be a buffer, the residents feel that it's more appropriate to have perhaps a. Again, a wall as opposed to a broken chain link fence, as I understand it. And again, I've not physically viewed this fence, but I think you're going to hear from some of these folks that it's broken in parts. It's a chain link fence. And it would be appropriate to have some sort of a buffer if this is going to be approved. Sort of like what you see on other projects where there's definitely going to be noise and other impacts to the surrounding community, and that it should probably be borne by the developer as opposed to passing that off to the folks in on top of the world. 99th Street Road is maintained by the residents through the Circle Square Ranch association. The spine road to RT 200 will be used extensively by the apartments. And on top of the world will not pay for upgrades needed, per the report. As we understand it, the county must install these upgrades not on top of the world residents and continental must share in that upkeep. And we think that's appropriate. We think this road also is going to cause some issues for this community. The multimodal pathway that's been discussed forces the on top of the world seniors to traverse through the apartment complex to publics, pharmacy and other essential services. Residents don't feel safe going through the apartment complex and for many reasons. Proposed path discharges carts on the spine road, we believe on the wrong side of the road in front of the hotel, which we think is dangerous for the community. The zoning should require the spine road to be widened, incorporate a cart path lane from resident on both sides of the road for safety. We think that's appropriate for the community. I think it wouldn't be unreasonable for that. And that should be the widening should occur at the expenses of the property owner and or continental, not from resident funds, which again, might be what happens going forward. There's also a question about where these amenities, you know, how that's going to impact the folks here, and I think that was part of what was brought up. Zoning should require those amenities such as the pool, any playgrounds, dog parks, pickleball courts be placed near the front of the development along the spine road to diminish the noise generated from these activities from the on top of the world residents, especially those in Friendship village, which are going to be right next to where this is at. There was some talk, again, also earlier, about how lease provisions could potentially address issues with some of the residents. If you have loud people there, if you have other people there, I can tell you, being an attorney that's handled many, many evictions over 25 years, it's not that common that folks are evicted for a breach of the lease for a lot of reasons. The typical evictions tend to be, at least in my experience, probably 90% or more of them. They're associated with non payment of rent. That's usually when the landlord is concerned. I mean, they can be, you can still go forward, but it's actually a different framework, even under the floor statutes, to evict someone for a breach of the lease, regardless of how this lease may be worded, you know, so there is legitimate concerns from these folks here about what's going to occur in this community. And with all due respect to everything that's been presented, we think that that's why this board is here. This board has the ability to approve this proposed development or to disprove this proposed development with obvious. Again, as noted, there could be litigation on both sides of that from different folks that are impacted. But the board is here for a reason and to make a specific finding of whether or not this will adversely affect the public interest. We think you're going to hear from a lot of folks. They're not just opinion, but how it actually, without looking at, not to be offensive, but something from Star wars about how this, you know, these, these, this foliage, which as I understand it, is not. Not in some areas it may be very thick, but other areas it's sparse. You can see right through it certain parts. And that's why, again, without. I don't have high tech to show you that, but residents can see it with their eyes. They show photos of what it looks like and what is going to be in their community. That's the buffer that they're going to potentially have is this, you know, this sporadic chain link fence. And best we can tell, yes, it may have been there for a long time, but that doesn't mean it's adequate to provide this buffer. And we think it'll absolutely impact the public, absolutely adversely impact the public interest to go forward with it, certainly as it's presented and whether or not it's compatible with the land uses in the surrounding area. Again, we think primarily it goes back to this is, regardless of whether this is viewed to be by any standard, multifamily on top of the world. That's not really what's there. These are single owner, these are owner occupied homes in an age restricted community. And it's going to be right next to an apartment complex. No way around that. We could have experts here for two or 3 hours talking about that. You're going to see this whole room here today. A lot of folks here talk about how that's going to impact them, what that's going to mean to them going forward, and how it's going to change what they bought into. Many years ago. I maybe saw some of the videos, like online I was looking at, there was a video from on top of the world about how they were a green community. There was reference to, again, to the circle square ranch being right there, and the residents could look out and see cattle. That's what these folks bought into. They bought into that community and that's not what they're going to have in the near future. It's going to be quite different. And I think you're going to hear from a lot of folks here today, and we appreciate the board taking the time. I understand this might be a bit unusual for this type of a hearing, but we appreciate the board being here and allowing these folks to be heard. It was important for these folks. I don't know if some of them, because we had a multiple meeting, I think there was even a large return out the last time we were here, but these folks want to be heard. They want to talk to the actual commissioners that they voted for that represent their interests, and they want to tell you how this is going to impact them. Now, I think, as county attorney did note, this is not a plebiscite, meaning this is not just simply, we're not here today just to vote to say, look, there's a whole bunch of folks that don't like it. That's not really what the purpose of the board is, and this is not what this legally what this is. But there's no question that their voices are part of that analysis. There's case law that we can certainly cite to, and I could present cases and all the rest of that, but that's not why we have county commissioners. We have them to listen to the voices of the people on things like this and to make those important decisions for the benefit of the entire community, not just, again, a few folks, not just for business, not just for the residents, but to balance that and make those decisions. That's why we have you folks in these chairs here today. This is politics, and it's America at its finest. And all of these folks here today get to be heard to the extent they can. We understand there's no way that everybody here can have their voice heard. And we certainly appreciate, again, I'm not here today to testify. I can't really. It's not really, I'm not a witness to these various things. I'm here today to provide an overview. What I think you're going to hear from all these folks here today. And we appreciate the board's time and allowing us to be heard. And again, we did everything we could do to sign up and get everything in front so that we could do that. And I think most of the folks that want to be heard are signed up, but there may be a few folks that are not. That's fine. And Mister Shoemaker, I'll assure everyone in the audience, whether you signed up or not, after we go through the list of those that have signed up, I will then open it up for anyone who had not signed up but still wants to speak. But you can only speak one time. Those that donated their time to you gave their time to you to speak on",

        "text": " This is an update on the states of 24 of them. Basically, abortion can happen up until the day of birth. The ones in black, those can be aborted after beta birth. That's the state of our world here. And, you know, everybody would assume that the worst ones would be California, New York and whatever. But you can see, and it's not California or New York, but some states of we thought were more humane, but they're not. I'm hoping and praying that someday we will have no abortions allowed except for incest or some problem, health problem. Okay. Because you show the other one. So that's just an update, a yearly update of what's going on throughout the country. But this is what some schools and the planned parenthood demonstrate for ten to 14 year old kids. We all know that a ten year old can go and have an abortion without of parents knowing about it. Somehow we allow that. So anyway, when you go there, they make nothing out of the fact that you're going to have your baby aborted. My sister many years ago had an abortion. She never got over it. One of our two daughters had an abortion days three or four years ago. She never got over that. Her husband basically forced her to have an abortion or talked her into it, and that destroyed the marriage of 15 years. Abortion is a big thing. It's a shock that people never get over or most people never get over, but they don't know. Especially a lot of people don't know what they're in for. They don't really think of overall. You know, in the case of our daughter, we offered to take the baby. We'd be glad to have a fifth child, but her husband didn't want to see that. And you know, your husband has more control over our daughter than we do. And I don't see any problem with that, except that we wound up with an abortion. And all I can say is, I know you folks don't seem to be too into thinking or talking or saying anything to Tallahassee, but I know that God'keeping an eye on us. And there's gonna be a point where you better get you build the an off or something. Because sooner or later he's gonna give up on us. I can't believe he hasn it already. Thank God he doesn't give up on us yet. But over a million babies a year aborted, and yet we bring millions of people through the different ways to get into this country. All these million babies would be Americans. Whatever you think of that. I't know what else to say. The preschool or the school that they fellow was here before. Thank God for that. Those kids will not see this type of stuff. Maybe we all should be. One of our daughters is as her doing home schooling besides working for the church, doing schooling twice a week. Well, anyway, that's it. Thank you. Thank you. I know you're passionate about it. I appreciate it. Mister chair, could I just spend a moment and just say the women's pregnancy center here in Marion countyes, which is on Silver Springs Boulevard, does a tremendous amount of counseling and work with women who find themselves in the situation as the two that you noted earlier. And I'm not sure if you're aware of that, Mister N. Is that the one that Roscoe started? I don't know who originally began. Yes, but it is on Silver Springs Boulevard next to the. I believe it's life south. And I would encourage you perhaps, maybe to visit with them and maybe your daughter as well, to find some healingeah. Because Roscoe started that about 20 years ago. He spent about $40,000 a year. And originally there was an abortceion center right down the road, which about two years ago they closed up. We're blessed to be in this country and mean Barn county, but we can't stop and say we're doing better now. We went from 15 weeks to five weeks. It's still a baby from the day of conception, no doubt about that, and so I appreciate your passion for it, but again, there are some wonderful resources available. Yes, God bless you. God bless you too. Especially you, Mister Curry. I mean, I'll be honest with you, I don't have any time. When you took over, I said, oh God, thisg guy's the polished politician. I was 100% wrong. Whoa. You have no passion and common sense. God bless you. And you're not a politician yet, like the other four. I'mnna say you're a great statesman and well, thank you. I think that's a compliment. All right, Pol, our next statesman is Bernie Little with horse farms forever. Bernie? Uh oh. Double tamed Bernie Little. Let's see. 4899 Northwest 90th Avenue, Oala, Florida. And thank you so much for allowing us to address the commission today. I've learned some new strategies. We will not come here again without children and horss. But my role here today is to reintroduce the commissioners and the county staff to Sarah Fennessy s who has rejoined horse farms forever, and to not only the delight of our members, but especially the delight of me, as she will be joining me in representing horse farms forever. Our Facebook account in five years has never received so many thumbs up and likes as it received when we announced Sarah's return. So I just want to introduce Sarah and let her speak. Thank you, Bernie. Good morning, commissioners. It's wonderful to be here with you again this morning representing horse farms forever. As you know, I am a passionate believer in our mission and vision and have invested many years in its progress. The farmland preservation area is so much more than just a line drawn on a map. It is symbolic of our global brand as horse capital of the world. Within it are some of the rarest soils and purest aquifers in the world. And how blessed are we to have this in our backyard here in Marion county? It is so worth protecting and I thank you so much for all that you have done and will continue to do to uphold and maintain the integrity of the farmland preservation area. And I look forward to working with you. Thank you. It's good to have you back. Thank you so much. Before you leave, could you please give your name and address for the record? Yes, ma'am. I'm so sorry. Sarah Fennessy. 10805 Southwest 186 Circle Danelln. Welcome back. Thank you so much. Thank you for your time. Yeah, appreciate yours. Okay, Steve, let's see. Stephen Burch, regarding gazebos, and Kim Bell. Also. Kim, you wa want toa come forward? We got two podiums up here. You can be on the ready and looking at the addresses, y'all might know each other. Oh, yeah. Are all of you gonna speak? We're all, yes. Okay. Well, the next one, if you'll just go over to the other podium, you re read it there and name and address. Good morning, commissioners. My name's Stephen Birch. I live at 3208 Northeast 101st Terrace in Silver Springs. That's in the preserve Est states rv resort. That is a deeded lot where we all are lot owners. There it is, the newest or the third resort within the wilderness rv resort, just across the bridge on the Walahaa river. We're here because last week now seven of us, the residents, received notice from the Marion county building department that our store bought or kit bought gazebos required a building permit and that they must meet the state standard of 130 miles an hour winds as outlined under the Miami date. The problem is that three of the seven lot owners who were notified had already talked to the building department prior to purchasing and installing their gazebos, and we were told they didn't need a permit. A fourth, myself, went through a landscape contractor who never mentioned a permit sold. A rather expensive gazebo actually is rated on video on the website as meeting 150 miles an hour winds, and that same contractor has bragged about installing these gazebos all over Marion and Levy county without a permit. So we were quite surprised to learn that we needed a permit. We've talked to an engineer and discovered there's no way we can get to a certified engineering rating for these permits, and many of us have resigned ourselves that we're going to have to take these permits down. One is already done so and probably have to go to a engineered design gazebo. The issue, though, is in Flida in the spring, two things happen regularly. One is allergy season, so if I cough, that's why the other is in every big box store. From big lots to Sam's club kit Delt, gazebos are on display for sale. No one tells these purchasers that it requires a permit. They may notice that when they start putting the thing together in after purchase. And the issue really is that if we're going to have the state of Florida and Marion county follow that building code, we need to do a better job of informing our residents of these requirements. One of the things you may consider doing might be passing an ordinance to require retailers and installers to post the win rate rating of their kit built gazebos and the requirement for a permit and what the win rating must be before that purchase is made. Another option might be to work through your legislative delegation and follow the lead of several other states that if we're going to have this requirement, the ban the sale of gazebos in the state of Florida that don't meet it. It seems rather ridiculous to have property owners spend anywhere from 1700 doars to $6,600 on a gazebo that can't be",

        "text": " seven briefs published on our website right now which you can access either through that qr code or through the simple url below where you'll be able to access these educational research briefs they're about six to ten pages long that describe the topic of concern this might be burden bad interactions with offshore wind turbines um describes the topic what are some of the main risks and effects how can you monitor or mitigate this type of effect and then what are some of the research needs so we have these this written documentation that we're about halfway through publishing the rest will be published and available on the website by the end of this month um the second product we worked on was a webinar series that covered the whole series of topics webinar series concluded at the end of all of the recordings and slide decks are also available on this website if you scroll down to the bottom and lastly we want to make sure that this project not only summarizes what we know right now based on the current research but what else do we need to know uh moving forward to help make the best permitting citing and scientific understanding of this so that's where this third product comes into play which is generating the list of research recommendations and jason let's go to the next slide and do an overview of the topics we're looking at these are the seven topics that the research briefs and webinar series cover we selected these topics based on comprehensive stakeholder outreach which we led about two years ago key agencies scientists and community members based on what's important to understand these topics include underwater noise effects on marine life burden bad interactions with offshore wind energy so this is both collision and potential behavioral effects like avoidance or attraction risk of marine life to marine debris and floating cable systems so this is focused on how marine mammals and sea turtles may interact with mooring lines or inner array cables from floating offshore wind the fourth topic area is benthic disturbances from foundations anchors and cables this topic covers both floating offshore wind which is relevant to the pacific coast and then also fixed bottom offshore winds so that's why we're talking about foundations um and that's really more relevant to shallow waters i'm typical near shore on the atlantic the fifth topic is introduction of new structures and how this may affect fish ecology so this may this includes information about artificial reef effects and how offshore wind may contribute to that the sixth topic is vessel collisions and how offshore wind may increase or change the effects on marine life there and the seventh or last topic is electromagnetic field effects on marine and this talks about how electromagnetic fields generated by subsea cables may influence behavior of marine life and so just i saw one question come into the chat and i'm happy to clarify that when we talk about benthic disturbance what we're really referring to is organisms and habitat on the sea floor so the benthos is broadly described defined as um the the habitat on the sea floor and even underneath the sea floor and then the wildlife they use and live in that all right so information about these topics is was covered in the webinar series which the recordings are available online as well as the slides and then we're publishing the educational research briefs around these and these really provide an opportunity for everyone to kind of get the same basis of understanding about what do we understand about these environmental interactions and what do we need to know going forward so let's move on to the next slide this one should just describe our future activities that will happen over the next several months and really what we're we're shifting our focus at the national labs now is to understand what are some of the research needs so we're hosting a workshop on the pacific coast to bring together industry state and federal agencies scientific and key community members to understand what sorts of environmental research can we address moving forward what are the data gap what data do we have what are the data gaps and how can we collect the data to help make the appropriate environmental permitting decisions so that will be occurring throughout the late spring early summer and we will be publishing the the findings from that workshop event as so please visit our website and of course reach out to me with questions or my colleague rebecca our contact information is is on the next slide and here we just have our contact information so feel free to send us an email or drop a question in the chat and also the url for for all the information we're collecting under this project hey thanks so much mark i do see a question that just came in about whether the studies contemplate the potential effects of sea life on the underwater equipment so not necessarily the impact of the underwater equipment on marine life but the other way around marine life on the equipment does it does the study also look at that i'm trying to think about which brief that information may be included in but it's not an explicit focus of the research um certainly reading some of the briefs i think will provide insight into that so in particular the introduction of new structures and fish ecology we talk about um those interactions and then also in the brief describing benthic effects or sea floor effects on those communities there's also a lot of interactions there but we don't explicitly discuss uh corrosion what's called biofouling fouling effects in the briefs but thank you for that question thanks um nadine if that answers your question great but if not feel free to add a follow-up in the chat um another oh great another question from bill is will there be any effort to consider cumulative impacts from arrays and relatively close yeah i think that's a great question and within each brief we do have a at least half a page or a paragraph focused on that particular topic it's different for each kind of environmental interaction and species but it is a key consideration we include really though the cumulative effects um it's kind of like taking a higher level view that kind of looks at all the different topics um and incorporates how they may interact between one another so while we're able to to capture the individual interactions and make some reference towards what the cumulative effects could be i think it's really like a follow-on piece of work that we can approach um to think through holistically how do these things great thanks thanks mark bill hopefully that answers your question but if you have a follow-up please do add it to the chat um i do want to go back to an earlier question from about 10 minutes ago from james asking if any permits have been granted um at least from oregon department of jason and i don't think so but i did want to just double check with our colleagues whitney and andy on the line to confirm that are you able to come off mute and confirm uh whether any permits have been granted for james question hi this is this is whitney i'm just confirming um with respect to offshore wind that's how i um understood the question okay yeah so um boehm um has not issued any lease for offshore the west coast um but i can note that the packwave south project is a wave energy project with oregon state university and boehm did issue a um in 2021 for that project for that test facility thanks uh whitney andy did you want to add anything yeah no there are no permits that um i'm aware of except for what whitney mentioned with the pac wave okay great thanks for the question james um we also have a question from walter how will impacts to esa listed species be monitored and address and i'll also note we have a hand raised from karen that i'll go to next great um if that question is directed at me i'm happy to take a first pass but effects to esa listed species happens it's through an environmental assessment process and consultation with noaa national marine fisheries service and other regulatory agencies that's not really um my wheelhouse um i'm more on the science side about understanding environmental effects and i think um whitney and andy um might be able to clarify or correct um my question if i was misguided this is whitney i can i can add on mark and you're um in agreement in that um for for boom there's an environmental review and with esa listed species we consult with our with our other partners so you reference the national oceanic and atmospheric with the national marine fisheries service as well as u.s fish and wildlife are the two i believe main federal agencies that we would consult with thanks for that question walter um i'm going to go to karen if you're able to unmute or perhaps you're already muted go ahead and just a reminder um star three to raise your hand and star six to unmute yourself if you're on the uh did you hear my introduction or did i just get unmuted i just started hearing you now so you might need to start over wonderful karen brady oregon department of fish and wildlife i manage the marine program and and work with many of you on the line on this issue and um appreciate that presentation from mark my question is about emerging research coming out of your europe on wind shadow effects of uh offshore wind and there it's not floating offshore wind but but essentially the disturbance of typical air flow patterns at a very large scale and how that affects the ecology and i'm just flagging that that i'm very interested in understanding that new research and wondering if that is part of your issue briefs at this point for thanks karen that's a really great question and there's actually a lot of really interesting research um being conducted there both in europe and it's not explicitly included in the current set of briefs primarily it's primarily through the we we identified the quote hot topics through stakeholder outreach and that topic was included but it was ranked fairly low at the current time when we were doing that outreach um so it's included in the sense that we're and gathering all the literature from it and we plan to investigate how to best implement any research recommendations coming out of type of work but it's not a current part of the the synthesis effort that we have a educational research brief about i would add that as part of the work that we're initiating now which is generate is understanding the data gaps and generating research recommendations is this is a really nice place to information like the wind shadow effect and how that may um coincide with upwelling or other nutrient distribution patterns offshore and if that's an item that is of interest for additional research recommendations whether it's just doing desktop review of past work or actually doing field work or lab work it's something that i think is worthwhile including so um karen",

        "text": " inadequate and so once you have a good plan really you're just looking at are is management enforcing the plan and are people are there consequences when people don't do what they're supposed to when you come to a situation like this where for years this wind farm has been spewing bolts and nuts and pieces of the all over the ground and oil leaking that tells me that pge did not have a good plan for maintaining and managing their equipment um so i'm concerned because this development was approved by this and the plans were developed by the oregon department of energy so now you have a development here that not only i'm sure has inadequate plans but there hasn't been any monitoring to show that they're actually following those plans and i just bring this up because there's been some discussion about the fact that the council tends to approve basically site certificates that are not complete because you can't approve a standard without knowing what the plans are that are that are going to be implemented in order to meet that standard so when council turns over the development of a of a draft partial to the energy facility citing council you're basically turning over the responsibility for an adequate plan to a group of people who are funded by the the people wanting to develop these these energy facilities i believe that's contrary i know it's contrary to what the statutes and the rules say because to comply with the statutes it says council must review plans determine they meet the standard requirements and be included in the site certificate those are statutory requirements so when you turn over the final plan another entity you are not meeting your commitment to have approved final plan and actually while the statute does allow for delegation to the oregon department of energy it does not delegate it does not allow council to delegate the decision about eligibility to the council and that's what is occurring when you do all these reference the council is being the only entity that is able to issue site certificates approve site you need to be taking responsibility for that final approval of any kind of plan in fact if you read the plain language of the rules it says those plans are supposed to be in final form before you can even issue a site certificate because they're supposed to be attached and included with the site certificate so anyway that's sort of my smeal about my concern about how how the council is their responsibility for approving final plans that are required for um for a site certificate to be issued a couple other things that i was going to um to mention and it kind of goes i was thinking about this because one of the prior commenters because i sat in a um in a legislative uh meeting where they were talking about wind energy and the discussion was how many acres of land would it take in order to meet oregon's renewable energy standard if we were relying on wind energy and of course the figure was huge and one of the one of the representatives said it was asked where are you going to put all these wind farms this is this is you know hundreds of thousands of acres to put in these wind farms and she said and this is virtually a quote she said well there's a lot of land in eastern oregon so you know when the comment about about conflicts between energy and what's happening in eastern oregon compared to what's happening in the valley um there is really a lack of understanding of the value of this part of the world to the people who live in this part of the world another just a brief comment is that when developers are not supporting energy that is location that's being created at the location where it's used and avoiding the need for high voltage i don't believe they're meeting their responsibility to the public and right now i know idaho power has before the puc a a requirement or a request that they not have to reimburse people with root roof top only half of what they're reimbursing other people who who are getting who they're getting energy from so the the headline in the paper was that that idaho power um undervalues or believes that rooftop energy has less value than than any other you know than the other resources so so i i encourage you to encourage developers to be supporting these kinds of things that really are important in terms of of minimizing the need for these for transmission lines or for mega developments of any kind as far as as renewable energy oregon right now is producing more renewable energy between the dams and the wind farms and the solar than we use in our total use of of energy a year so we are net exporters of renewable energy and this is in the the oregon department of energy's report to the legislature that they're required to do bi-annually so it's not something i'm just making up here when we keep creating energy in oregon and sending it to other states we are we are agreeing to destroy resources in this state and so it i think makes it even more important that that the mitigation that's being required of these developers who are using oregon resources be reasonable and actually address the impacts that are happening and part of that is going to show up in these plans that are being shuffled off to the oregon department of energy to complete so that's my comment thank you very much thank you ms gilbert is there any other public comment come forward please good morning all my name is uh jim 603666 marvin road lovely legrand oregon i'll be quick today i just have a front and back double spaced first i'd like to welcome it to legrand and i'm here to talk about environmental justice and the public process in oregon as i believe you know in 2008 the oregon legislature passed senate bill 420 creating the environmental justice task in 2022 the legislature again passed house bill which renamed the task force to the environmental justice council and broadened the scope of its work the environmental justice council is to work with the state's natural resource to develop environmental justice odoe was added to the list of natural resource agencies in hb 407 in 2022 now the scope of the commission's work is outlined in the bill and that basically is to advise and provide by a biennial report to the governor on environmental justice issues advise natural resource agencies on environmental justice issues including community concerns and the public participation process identify in cooperation with natural resource agencies environmental justice meet with environmental justice communities and make recommendations to the governor the needs raised by these communities define environmental justice issues in the state and f upon the request of a natural resource agency provide consultation and review of the natural resource agency's proposed administrative rules under ors 183.333 and two the council may form work groups or consult with stakeholders as necessary to carry out the duties of the council additionally the council is to develop an environmental justice mapping tool that documents environmental health and other factors that affect environmental justice communities now an environmental justice community includes communities of color communities experiencing lower incomes tribal communities rural communities coastal communities and communities with limited and other communities traditionally underrepresented in the public process and adversely harmed by environmental and health hazards including but not limited to seniors youth and persons with disabilities now i submit to you that in my opinion odoe and the energy facility citing can do a better job of meeting the intent of senate bill 420 and house bill you do a very good job of outreach and public meetings and coming to the public but like most state agencies you don't seek out the environmental justice communities that will be significantly impacted by your decisions the proceedings of the department are inherently skewed in favor of the simply put the developer has the money and the lawyers and the department and the public have however the department bills the developer for all their work the public cannot now i lost my place if the working public wishes to have a voice that is truly heard significant technical research and representation representation at all meetings are the usual avenues to be heard this requires specialized technical skills in most circumstances and that requires money to hire experts something the general public does not have a lot of i'd like to suggest that the odoe and their billing to the developer include an intervenor fund that the public can request funds from so that they can retain the proper technical experts and attorneys to meet and engage the developer on equal terms consider the public's considerable time effort technical research and fundraising required to participate in this multi-year marathon that you're considering today and i can speak from personal experience it is life-absorbing it is you you have to be dedicated and the public have kids to raise they have jobs to go to if it wasn't for us retired folks he wouldn't be here today discussing this so the public needs to have the ability and the funding to express themselves to you with the technical expertise and to play on a level field now the oregon public utility commission is in the process of implementing intervener funding with uh with community organizations and i'm involved in that process as a member of the environmental justice council i would be more than willing to assist ogoe in developing such a program and those are my comments thank you thank you mr kreider is there anyone else that wishes to provide public comment good morning my name is peter berry my family property where we grew we all live was nearby we also have property in what county and baker county and we're happy to call this place home and thank you for coming to listen to us i would totally support the comments by mr being a member of the public in dealing with you guys and dealing with this is is unbelievably frustrating and we feel like complete underdogs completely outgunned and like the system is truly and i'm not i don't say this lightly but truly corrupt we know a local lawyer that was here who then worked with the state legislature that helped rewrite the laws in oregon that favor the developers as jim just and so and this is of course common across the country across the nation and other that the people with money the corporations they rewrite the laws to favor themselves that's the case i don't think there's no argument about that and the system is not only corrupt in that sense but that we somehow have abdicated our to let corporations that want maximum profit at least cost to themselves they get to make proposals and say oh we're going to put this here where to put that there and then we all have to jump through these endless hoops a decade of hoops because they make a proposal and in in the b2h case i know i'm supposed to talk about it specifically but this is",

        "text": " these legislative slides because we already talked through a lot of it but this was just an effort to try to um take what the bill says and what we would need to do through 2024 to make it um so uh the last bullet is the one that is kind of up to the Commission in terms of when it thinks uh their an evaluation report needs to be done on the goals based on the best available science there is a minimum threshold but the commission also has the ability to provide a report as needed so that's why that one is in italics the rest are things that we would very much um we would be required to do and then also might need to have some conversations around in particular the um the fourth bullet the discussion of regular agency reporting and review of reports that something that came up in the road map and uh wasn't fully defined and might need some more conversation with the commission about frequency and what the structure is obviously leveraging existing uh reporting that the agencies are doing and not trying to reinvent the wheel there and then uh a big bucket of work uh potentially coming with uh SB 530 um again we walked through these earlier so I'm not going to go through each component of them but there's um things that will require Consultants to help with and then there are reports that were required to do potentially rule makings um determinations around funding allocations and of course uh continuing to support and um helping appoint natural working lands advisory committee so taking all of that there's a lot of work to do just um potentially in what we have in statute and then or what may be coming in statute and then there are these policy topic Focus areas that I've heard through uh chair McDonald's and others that folks wanted to dive into one is climate impacts covering some of the most recent uh science that has come out around climate change and then also uh the work of the ocean acidification and oxia Council which has been very involved in doing great work on mitigation and adaptation efforts another bucket that um folks have expressed interest in is energy planning uh generally energy decarbonization planning uh the state energy strategy that uh commissioner um director Benner uh mentioned during the conversation on the climate pollution reduction Grant work um and then all the integrated resource plans and clean energy plans that uh are coming out around HB 2021 and the overlap with those with the climate Protection Program implementation uh to round out that topic area uh somewhat related was uh interest in talking about renewable energy citing um the orisa project that uh the department of energy did has been done but there was interest in getting a report and a Showcase of some of the technical abilities that that project provides for folks who are interested in renewable energy sighting talking about transmission and then also the national working lands interface with renewable energy sighting and then uh there's particular interest in transportation sector emissions and strategies so uh talking about progress on the Statewide Transportation strategy and the transportation emissions dashboard that um ODOT and a number of other agencies work together on that uh came out earlier this year and talking a little bit more about the every mile accounts work that has been done through the multi-agency partnership there then the last two that we had uh one was talking about the building sector emissions and strategies uh we heard earlier today about the buildings the legislative buildings package that may be coming and there's just uh hasn't been as much attention on building sector emissions and strategies at at this level and so there's um interest in continuing that to have that conversation and to be able to uh dig into it a little bit more there are a number of recommendations in the roadmap related to buildings related items as well that could benefit from having more conversation with a commission and uh the last one but certainly not least is equity um the commission was really strong during the road map conversation around uh wanting to understand um the Equitable um benefits and impacts of uh climate actions and to explore those a little bit more and there's efforts underway at the city state agency level to develop an environmental justice mapping tool so um there's a lot to be able to discuss and and dig in on there more and then of course other there's probably many other topics that folks are interested in so just uh put that bullet there to say that this is not an exhaustive list at all and um we can add and subtract and prioritize as needed so I'm just gonna end here with some resource considerations to tee up then the discussion which is um we're potentially looking so right um you know we're currently staffed with 0.3 FTE there's a potential for four new full-time positions related to the work that we talked about in the legislative side and so Staffing is a question about you know how much staff will end up with which then plays into how much we can do or not moving forward or how we need to there's also um a number of Contracting needs uh related to the um the forecast of emissions and some of the natural working lands related items and again uh some of that is dependent upon uh how the legislative session shakes out and then if um SB 522 passes the commission may be expanding and so there may be some uh there'll probably be some onboarding and need to integrate folks into the work and also potentially provide some room for new priorities from the voices that are coming into the commission and so those are kind of big picture things that um would affect our ability to carry out the work and to what scope and scale we can do the work so just planting that seed and there may also be other considerations which we would love to share from you all so with that um think would love to open it up to discussion these are the you know questions that we thought of but there's probably others and maybe just uh before diving and if there's something that uh folks wanted to connect on about the climate pollution reduction grants um just because we didn't have a chance to field questions on that well exactly first step I we kind of I forgot to call for any clarifying questions maybe just password clarifying questions from what Zach just presented if if folks have questions from from that presentation and then we then I think we can go and see what the if there are questions on the grant any clarifying questions and again oh there we go commissioner sure um so Zach in you know you had a very long list of of topics um of potential interest to the I mean some of those are topics that you know um I could see the commission digging in on maybe producing recommendations work research you know work of subcommittees others you know sound more like this would be a good agenda item to have the right people or you know organizations come in and present on is there a way in in the discussion we can sort of distinguish between the two because obviously the resource needs and and everything are going to vary widely you know considering that's a great Point commissioner Sharon you know something that I think we should give more thought to as we build out a draft for review um and and then as I was looking at this um I think we don't want to necessarily duplicate although there might be times when duplication would make sense but we don't want to decision making and recommendation development that would be happening in other parts of state government for example you know thinking through the IRP that are submitted that's more maybe a focus on the topic of is there are there lessons learned that we would want to think about as we developed complementary recommendations if that makes sense but I'm not sure about it yet and I'm getting an echo um so um but Zach if you've got if you want to add to that please do I think that's great and a good point commissioner Sharon thanks and I think um you know to the to the extent folks want to weigh in on how to balance that now and uh would be great and we can also um give some more thought to it too well since I started the thread and and I think uh you know uh the chair was sort of you know uh heading there I mean there are some of these for which you know there could potentially be duplication of efforts so you know for example the irps and the ceps clearly that Authority rests with the Oregon Public Utility Commission very extensive processes guidelines and rules in place and so that would be a great example of one where it's like you know having utilities come in and present on that work and explain it and um uh you know for informational purposes would be great but um certainly not replicating the work through the global warming commission or creating parallel processes that would be confusing for stakeholders because you know there's already a process of place where you know those stakeholders are are intended to participate to effectuate the outcomes of the IRP and the clean energy plan yeah a really great point I in my mind it's would be you know honoring kind of that first recommendation in the road map which is how can we make sure that the policies and programs that are already in place are operating as well as they can and you know Gathering any Lessons Learned through those other processes that that you know might inform um how we educate folks or might inform you know as I said kind of complementary recommendations I think would be the way I'd want to see that Focus other uh director Bateman thank you on that note I think related um I would hate for the work of the um the interagency work that was completed uh recently to get lost in in Translation so we have the climate change adaptation framework which is you know not only a response to climate changes but also you know feeds back in and helps with mitigation as well um when it's seen all the way through and we have um you know more than a dozen I think it's 18 or maybe 21 state agencies that worked on this together um and and as have and has a really nice series of recommendations in it so maybe a featuring that or presentation on what's in there might be helpful as well but I think it goes to not duplicating effort and making sure that we've gone back and picked up some really good ideas that are already on the table my cat has joined the meeting I'm sorry um you know one of the discussions that's come up from time to time from that staff interagency staff group is you know is the global warming commission a place to kind of hear that integrated and identify needs because there might not be",

to provide a council member update so i have an update on phil stenbeck's replacement governor brown has appointed ann beyer to replace phil stenbeck and buyer is the retired crook county planning she had also previously worked at the department of land conservation and on june 1st will be the senate confirmation hearing so that's the uh the senate subcommittee that evaluates all board commission members so she will evaluated by the senate rules committee on june 1st if appointed on either june 2nd or 3rd whenever the full senate meets then she would be available for next council meeting which will be the june 23rd and 24th so ann is actually on the line today she was on at the last council meeting as um so like to say hi and thanks for uh jumping on and and watching how things go so keep our fingers crossed for the uh the senate rules committee next on my list uh are project updates so first i will start with the state line win project um on april 19th of this year we received a request for amendment number seven of the project so the project is an existing operational wind energy facility consisting of two geographic units state line one and two and band sickle two projects is located in north umatilla state line one and two is composed of 186 wind turbines has a peak generating capacity of up to 123 megawatts and sickle 2 consists of up to 45 wind turbines with a peak generating capacity of up to 119 megawatts and nextera energy resources is the parent company amendment number seven is a request to amend the site certificate condition uh related to turbine dimensions for the van sickle wind turbines um so if they are repowered and there was a approval to repower the that portion of the project under amendment number six so the dimensions uh related to this amendment would include lowering the minimum above ground blade tip clearance from 59 feet to 50 feet so as the blade sweeps down to the ground and increasing the hub height from 295 feet to 315 feet so included in amendment number seven is a request for type b review on may 2nd i'm sorry may 12th the department determined that the amendment request was complete on may 13th the department determined the type b review was justified and issue its type review adr determination including a email notice also on may 13th the department issued the draft proposed order for the the written comment period on the draft proposed order extends through june 6th because this is a type b amendment review there will not be a draft proposed order hearing and there is no opportunity for a contested case so just a written comment time frame which is currently going and then council's review and possible final decision on the amendment will likely be at the june council and chase mcveigh walker is the project lead on the amendment are there any questions on this amendment before i move on okay next is an update on a new project we received a notice of intent for the echo solar project on may 10th this is proposed as a 1 250 megawatt solar pv project uh with 1 250 megawatts of distributed battery storage associated with it on 10 900 acres or 17 square miles project will be located in morro county just southeast of the the boardman bombing range so you know we're we're all pretty familiar with boardman if you know where tower road is if you go down tower road several miles past where the bourbon bombing range is the project would start sort of at the very south east corner of of that location the applicant is echo solar llc which is a subsidiary of pine gate renewables llc since we've just received the notice of intent we've not yet created a project page or sent a notice yet on this so it is still really new we'll be doing both of those shortly we will also be holding a public information meeting on the notice of uh still figuring out the dates and the location of that but those that will likely be uh in july so more to come on that and chris clark is the project lead for that project any questions okay next we've given this update i think annually for a while so there are five wind facilities that have long-term wildlife reporting so this is the annual update on those so these five facilities which i'll list in a minute in a minute implement the wild life monitoring and mitigation plans which include a requirement to provide an opportunity for public comment and a review of ongoing wildlife reporting these five projects consist of the bigelow canyon wind farm the klondike 3 wind project the leaning juniper 2a wind power facility the leaning juniper 2b wind power facility and the stateline wind 2021 annual reports which every facility has to submit an annual report the 2021 reports were received by the in april of 2022 which is consistent with the and it included 2021 wildlife reports these reports are available for public review and comment through july thirtieth twenty twenty two so that would be a sixty day comment period they're available on the project pages and comments may be submitted to kate sloan senior sighting analyst by email so ongoing wildlife monitoring for these five facilities long-term raptor nest surveys washington ground squirrel surveys and incidental wildlife reporting the long-term wildlife surveys are conducted every three to five years depending on the facility long-term raptor nest surveys are on a five-year schedule and long-term washington ground squirrel surveys are on a three-year schedule all five facilities are required to participate in the ongoing monitoring and reporting of fatalities under the wildlife incident response and handling system and report annually on those brief update summaries are provided with the details and i'll get to those in a second so for bigelow canyon and klondike 3 reporting requirements were limited to incidental wildlife and reporting for state line reporting requirements were limited to monitoring and artificial nest or the use of those nest structures and incidental wildlife response for leaning juniper 2a and 2b reporting requirements include raptor nest surveys and nest success evaluation and incidental wildlife response the leaning juniper 2 a and b information we did not receive all of the information so we're still waiting to receive more information related to that so we are reaching out to the site certificate holder to get more information related to that those two so specifically for bigelow canyon the wildlife incident response and handling system there was a report of six avian including one bald eagle this facility maintains an incidental take permit with the u.s fish and wildlife service and is implemented implementing additional fatality monitoring studies and mitigation associated with that permit the klondike three wind project in 2021 operations personnel recorded one common raven fatality and then for state line in 2021 that was the last annual monitoring year for the five-year artificial nest structures installed as habitat enhancement all five artificial nest structures were monitored for maintenance needs in february of 2021 none of the artificial nest structures needed to be refreshed or repaired there was no activity or observable use of the five artificial structures moderating frequency will now be every five years and the next one will occur in 2026 also associated with the state line the certificate holder reported one carcass observed within the facility which was an american white pelican so that concludes my updates on the projects and monitoring requirements are there any okay last thing on my list is the next council meeting which is june 23rd and we will be having rule making hearings the evening of the 23rd thursday and then the regular council meeting on the 24th currently we are planning for the meeting to be in salem and so if anybody would like to travel please we will be reaching out to you so we can make appropriate reservations for you otherwise you know we will be",

        "text": " so agree with the findings of fact conclusions of law and conditions of in the proposed order pertaining to the scenic and protected area standards that are not related to the issues in the contested case and in the proposed contested case order pertaining to issue sounds good okay very chopped hanley jenkins yes kent howe cindy condon yes in buyer jordan truitt yes thank you council members are scheduled to take a break at 3 15. how are folks doing do we want to try to go through the recreation standard first or there's r2 4 and 3 let's get started let's keep going then and um we're ready to start on recreation standard r2 i guess or maybe yeah recreation standard for the record kellen tardy weather oregon department of energy we're now continuing into the recreation standard and i know one of the last issues kind of bundled how to mention in the issue statement of also recreational opportunities so you know council's trick these are all very very related so i think it's good to just kind of like power through um so when we're looking at um recreational opportunities um we the applicant and department evaluate recreational opportunities and we you know consider factors such as special designations or managements the degree of demand outstanding or unusual qualities availability or rareness irreplaceability or um my brains my brains i'm not going to pronounce that right now because i'm going to bumble it anyhow so that's the analysis that we go through for the the analysis area is the site boundary and two miles from the site boundary so we're now kind of coming in um from protected areas and we're going now out um out but however it's still along the transmission line and now we're looking through the lens of recreation still quite a few um recreational opportunities oh yes so in the proposed order too close and i'm i'm doing my presentation this way because i wasn't able this gives me a better ability to kind of toggle in the presentation so i apologize if it's kind of small i'll do my best so there's 21 important recreational opportunities that's within the two-mile analysis area that are evaluated in the proposed order when we're once we identify that a recreational opportunity is important then we go through what is evaluated underneath the standard so we look at direct and indirect loss now we've visited direct and indirect impacts under cultural right a direct loss as there's being there's going to be a permanent you know facility footprint impact or construction impact that is going to directly impact that recreational opportunity indirect would be something like traffic noise or visual impacts which are evaluated underneath this standard there's four recreational opportunities that are crossed the proposed facility and um however the evaluation recommends that because even though they're crossed it doesn't neces it doesn't um a lot of times was talking about spanning and with the recommendation is that even though it is crossed the transmission line crosses the recreational opportunity it does not impact uh it's not a direct loss of that recreational opportunity because the overall use or importance of the resources maintained so here i had mentioned so these that was direct loss and so these are the indirect loss evaluation that's done construction and operation noise traffic and um visual impacts over here i just took a snippet the the um of the exhibit that goes through and there's an entire each recreational opportunity in this example and i'll make this a little bit bigger so maybe you can see it each recreational opportunity has an entire narrative in the exhibit that goes through you know a a narrative assessment and also applies um you know quantitative measures um for each of the aspects that is evaluated and this is i just plucked out a summary table for each of them so this is just an example of some of what it is looked at and what the department pulls from and then summarizes and evaluates up in the proposed order to make its i'm going to remind council the kop is a key observation point so that is if there was a a photo simulation associated with the potential impacts at that site i'm gonna take a minute so i'm gonna pause with my notes and i wanted to go over here jesse is going to talk about it but i just kind of again i want to be helpful and orient what we're going to be talking about um now i can't find anything okay so i can't tell if this is exhibit c i just wanted to show and now my computer's thinking okay well i just wanted to point out to council um that morgan lake park um which is uh here uh you know in union county right outside of legrand is a park that is managed by the city of and it is identified as an important recreational opportunity um it's at the top of morgan lake road which there it which is this is this here is morgan lake road and this you take that road and then morrigan lake is on a different map i don't want to freeze anything but i just kind of wanted to show to be able to get to it i can't get to it okay um morgan lake is known for bird watching viewing there are campsites there there's fishing there's actually two lakes associated with the recreational um the proposed facility and the morgan lake alternative are cited to be outside of the boundaries of the park um however there are some facilities uh structures that would be visible from the park so there is an assessment um of that in the proposed order that um takes so the morgan lake road is a related supporting facility okay never mind okay so i just because one of the things we look at for recreation um is um traffic impacts and so morgan lake road is a very kind of like switchback steep windy road um that would have to be used to um if the morgan lake alternative was cons would be constructed um and um so that the the construction impacts are discussed and evaluated our construction traffic impacts are evaluated in the proposed order and that is also underneath that public services condition of that county specific traffic management plan once the final routes are selected those plans are going to be finalized with the city of legrand and with union county in identifying if any improvements need to be made what those need to be made making sure they're up to applicable if there's a road that isn't proposed in this application to be substantially modified the and the applicant may need it and proposes to substantially modify it they would need to come in for an amendment to add it to be included into the site boundary um i will stop there and pass it over to our first issue under the recreation standard is issue r2 uh limited parties are lois berry and mr mcallister and issue statement here is whether the visual impacts of the proposed facility structures in the view shed of morgan lake park are inconsistent with the objectives of the morgan lake park recreational use and development plan and should therefore be so the hearing officer concluded that the applicant's not required to demonstrate compliance with the morgan lake park plan because there are no proposed project components located within the park however the applicant considered the objectives and values of the morgan lake plan in determining that scenery is a valued attribute of morgan lake park and incorporated that determination into its analysis of the potential park potential project impacts to the park and this is a function of the way that council's recreation standard is written council is supposed to be evaluating significant adverse impacts to important the determination of the importance of a recreational opportunity depends on a series of factors including any special designation or management of the location and so here we do have a special management or designation of the location um via the this recreational use and development plan um and one of the attributes that the plan is looking at is is scenery um so that's how we end up um it you know with a visual impacts issue uh under the recreation standard so in response to the limited parties claims that the applicant did not sufficiently consider the proposed facility's impact to recreational in undeveloped areas of the park the applicant provided additional evidence addressing dispersed recreational opportunities in the undeveloped areas some of these opportunities included bird watching and nature study the revised analysis acknowledged that the proposed facility would be visible from approximately 16 of the park and that in those areas of the park where the towers are not screened the visual contrast would be high hearing officer noted that the department that both uh the applicant and the department um included that impacts to the parks overall would be less than significant and that the proposed mitigation including the proposal to expand the use of the h-frame structures to all tower between mile posts five to eight would further reduce the potential visual impacts in that sixteen percent of the park uh finally the hearing officer concluded that the recreation standard does not require the council to find that there will be no impact on a recreational only that there is sufficient mitigation to ensure that impacts will be avoided minimized corrected or compensated so that the impact is less than significant although i noted at the outset that the parties who were admitted as limited parties for this issue uh were lois berry and mr mcallister mr mcallister did not file exceptions um on this issue and so the oral argument on this would be from ms barry for the reasons that follow i request the judge webster's decision on issue r2 be reversed for almost 50 years the morgan lake plan has maintained the maximum of natural forest and lake areas to encourage solitude and isolation with little change or interference from man's 50 years there are only 12 modest campsites in a small area on the lakes west shore near the dock most of the park's 204 acres are natural forest and grasslands first time visitors are stunned by 360 degree views unmarred by man's judge webster said that idaho power had considered the morgan lake plan they're great at considering not so good on carrying through in her opinion she stated the project would not be inside the park boundary idaho power has repeated that so often that she seemed to think it was relevant the recreation rule is that the area two miles from the project site boundary should be evaluated she ignored the fact that one tower will rise only two-tenths of a mile from the wetlands of little morgan lake and that will be only one of 13 130 foot towers visible to the south and west describing its proposed mitigation idaho power refers to lower towers but in their exceptions they have never mentioned that four 150 foot towers they first proposed will be replaced by 13 130 foot towers the historic group who wrote",

        "text": " have to speak it exactly but yes we can be part of the catalysts to start the perfect conversation especially if we think about the neighborhood associations such as 17 trying to find a way we have to try to find one way to reach them but we believe that It is a valuable conversation and we have to think about the people who live in eh in poverty on the line of the poverty this can impact many people in Salem who will need this help if we have this natural disaster so part of why I say that is that we have to find a way have these conversations because it's not about if it happens, it's about from when as he said boss it's like how we prepare for this and how good that we are in this conversation Thank you the only thing I want Add to that the classes are free. there is no cost and we also cooperate with different partnerships strategically throughout the city with uh some uh medical supplements emergency and what they need to how first responders to help your local community So we are trying to be as prepared as possible possible without being overprepared if the general public can uh take care of this and take interest in There is a lot of information regarding this available on website in these courses I think there was actually an article issued. about two years ago about how to prepare your kit for the kit for your house has There is a lot of information available good excellent programs for learn everything you need to assemble your kit how it is prepared and good Well, we will be very happy to share it. with the community and I think we have about 3,500 people who have already taken the el course There may be even more Yes we have about 30 40 people who have taken the course Thank you Philips member question, doesn't that cover everything? I guess the specific thing is that I very much appreciate the work that do I agree with what you said Boss Ne Black I think it's important talk about it the specific question does not I need an answer it's just yes there is additional funds needed And if there are way to obtain funds other than through the general fund we have sufficient staff resources to review it and give priority is about storage uh supplies doctors right now we are we are depending a lot on volunteers that is vital but there may be a need to well-established leadership okay excellent administrator Well I want to respond with regarding the parties to the problems but from the perspective of physical infrastructure each project that we implement now including reconditioning This building has been designed to this purpose and by building future we are thinking about the implications eh to build the stations Firefighters all these types of facilities must be maintained foot even after an earthquake Let's continue with these operations and let's go to continue seeing our needs be aware of and aware of our capabilities course emergency management is one of those needs Thanks one of my associations neighbors have done an excellent job coordinate neighbors towards a program and to help them so that they do not see how difficult it is to be ready for a emergency I have already been working with Joe hinson a coach and really we are trying to make the association Neighbors are excited about having Y obtain training and support colonies in the colonists' association or of neighbors to do it is difficult Let me tell you it feels so hard being able to coordinate a couple of blocks of people to collect things to know who can do what What capabilities has someone who didn't know and really decide finally I think it was the last week instead of me continuing asking other colonies to do it or I'm going to do the neighbors and train them others and it is a community thing where we have to focus and we have to have supplies at home but there are many efforts to ensure that the neighbors are well and that the people who cannot be changed go or They can't move, we can support them It's difficult it's difficult thank you huh president any other comments member Curtis something I wanted to share no CFO a little more than his team Okay so many many Thank you for your presentations and obviously we have much more to do and on the agenda we want uh bring bring a couple of emotions last week member coen told us presented, we will return to comment on them and before that, the narrator is going to read the motions for us to make sure we're ready I don't want to lose no detail and one thing that does I want to tell you is that when we are in this camera discussing uh important points and jobs I want us to take into account What is the life of people and when we think about salaries and who has that job and that person does not require this job we have let's be careful with language people see us listen in this space or at home so be careful what We share the words have power and we have to be careful that we have some grace for the people impacted by what we are saying huh then uh rapporteur could I share the first emotion was refinancing the parks and Okay that's the motion someone who supports the emotion mayor in the line of conversation previous on the same topic I say that let's leave this emotion for the next one Thanks Okay then hey I heard it let's leave the discussion in light of the previous emotion because everything low point eh thanks that makes sense another emotion is seconded emotion the eh So let's do this discussion I just think that when talking about the same topic we must wait to have the decision until we have all the information this week Incoming we will have all the information and we will take the best There is no point in making this decision. because we don't do them all at the same time time member geyer the discussion i don't I know if you heard this one but it is possible that one of those motions would be implemented for this summer it is possible because I know that there is an obligation to sponsorship So when talking to the community is a theme with each of the neighbors go to one of these three things and They try to see a way to solve it I resolved for this summer and we are entering putting them on the platform Hey, I'm the vice president of services. community Thanks for the question and we think there has been conversations about concerts movies and restore them and I appreciate the opportunity to solve it because we are behind in planning agree with we are waiting for the programs were not going to happen and with that type of programs We cannot give you the return so quickly for this date A where we are we would have already been working on this for several weeks or two three months at least and even more So the movies and concerts all these are after no They are around the corner but yes I think we can do something so seems something like the community unaccustomed to viba we will be able to solve it but the races They are probably in a moment of not return we have sponsorships community support clubs of service and we work with the District schools to plan to put them So I would require or whatever I would say no I want to say no you can't do but what I would say is Me I would love for next week we can have one more answer definitive and we can do something that is an amended version is the best I could tell you but certainly if the emotion or an action for us to do this we will be able to do everything possible but this race is going to be a great challenge for us Thank you first the mayor then the person hey I'm worried about how they look impacted these races in this budget these funds were approved on last year they didn't already support each other the year past and very good point Let me talk with my staff I think I got ahead of myself but I think we have than having conversations that is the next year tax and concerts and movies come later at the beginning of the fiscal year and forgiveness but the movies and the concerts have an overlap with the Fiscal years And that makes it more complex But in terms of career let me give you one more answer definitive and determine what it looks like sir is my may tax question for the race and Another question I have is that we are speaking of the meetings we are going to take 75 and refound and do that and do it I have everything in my head and it doesn't work times so much all in my head so It would be very nice if we could have one like an accordion of we had to find 4 million dollars and we could continue with the services and those of people in street situations we have to find 4 million for him fiscal year 2025 is the figure I have seen that has been mentioned and mentioned for all reductions of the fiscal year I don't think it's that level but I can give you next week the number we have to find an x number of dollars and we comment 1 2 3 4 5 It's easier for me to understand that we are financing from where to difference from having a motion in the table and come back and it's hard for me follow up personally I think I and your staff might not the next meeting but when is it to talk about it I'm going to talk with him and we have certainly had visibility of what reductions recommended and We can add the context for financing give everyone an idea of \u200b\u200bthe sources of financing so that we have them in one place and we have it in the same page I appreciate it because there is we have many things to follow up on motions are postponed motion is postponed members ofon only one follow up you mentioned that the School district pays for these races I am worried about their budget cuts due to imbalance in Oregon And what is it like today if That also impacts their careers. for next year I could give you follow-up to ensure that all we are going towards the same address to your question what I was referring to is that We coordinate with the School District and I I don't think it provides financing but the resources are part of your planning efforts what they can or cannot do I will do find out for the next fiscal year but I was referring more to the coordination of bringing school children to event and there are costs of personnel and transport trucks Yes there are some budget challenges we have to check with them because I just wanted to be sure that no there was a",

I most people would understand and I think the money circulated it comes back into the community anyways dealing with some of these things that we have to do you know but I think it would just really make it proportional you know if it was I mean that's all we're asking is just for the money that comes back to the cities part of it'd be proportional to the amount of property they use so I I don't see this as something impossible but I agree with you it could take 10 years I mean I don't know you know but I think if we can move it forward and start putting on people's radar then um eventually I think you know that's what we're talking the five or ten year goal you know that maybe they finally step up you know um any other questions any other any thoughts on that part Josh is because maybe there's maybe there's been some action on it but I don't know if there's anything else so I think uh mayor Hoy is working on it uh actively with the legislative committee um I'm updating some information right now uh just on the state value of the property that they have here in Salem uh I will say that I have a file here in my office of efforts that go back to the 70s for a payment with taxes you know different um so it's not a new idea but it's definitely worth the effort to try to get it put in place I I this is Keith uh I think it's unlikely that uh you're going to see a bill introduced uh but that doesn't mean that uh uh a special appropriation could be made to recognize the impact of having the state capital here on our on our service delivery so that that's the focus in Target right now and you know Josh and uh Chief Womack and chief niblock are working on those numbers to help us communicate that to our legislative delegation in a very thankful I agree with you and um I see nothing is impossible you know morassa wouldn't be here and the um I think if the if if people knew this was happening if this was part of our what we're presenting to the city council then they become public then hopefully someone writes about it and then people would realize wait a minute I'm paying more because the people were at the state capitol don't you know and I think if people knew about this I mean it's I don't think anybody's oh happy with this happening I haven't met anybody this you know so I think you know just like um you know I had I read I was watching the story this morning where they it was really interesting it was just but it reminds me it says um they had members of that survived the Holocaust and they had meetings with of German descent whose parents Grandparents were involved you know um there was not optimism on behalf of the Holocaust survivors of anti-semitism and the children said you know we understand that but the only ray of light the only ray of light that we have in reducing anti-Semitism is through education and just making people aware because x amount of people don't don't know about that now that that was really um uh impactful to me and and it just reminds me as we go back to transparency sharing things with the community and then letting them go out and see you know what they can do that way it's just not a finance committee that's trying to make this happen you um and that's why I think to have that as an option even if it's whatever we can do to um raise its profile you know I think the people sort of need to know what we're dealing with here because it's a huge disadvantage for the City of Salem and our staff and here we are talking about budget cuts if they're even you know if I mean we're talking about it you know whether that happens or not but anyway week any other thing we can do with regards to that option the payment in lieu of taxes anything else we can do other than just maybe move that forward for consideration to the council which then puts it to the legislative committee like what's the process there uh you could certainly include it in your recommendation to the city council that can talk about it at the work session um and probably the full Council you can have a better uh feel for where it could go next besides a legislative legislative all right neither thoughts or comments from my committee it's been a great discussion yeah go thank you um yes thank you um Josh could you go back to your spreadsheet where you get to play with the numbers I like to play with the um so and and what I'd like to do is see let's say we um not include the local gas tax but the option Lev the Publix or a levy um whether it's geared Public Safety which I think is a very good idea to do I think it would be far more accepted and those are the big money um items of course uh fire and police you know there they need a lot of support so I think directing it specifically to that would be an excellent idea um and so if we add something with the levy and then City uh the city operations tax could we kind of see what that is and then maybe add the payroll tax in at a low amount and kind of see where those numbers lie uh with or without the unsheltered um let's see at first without and then with because we're we're not going to be able to stop them we have to continue I think just go ahead and put them in and include uh include Staffing we don't want to you know basically give us the whole ball of wax with those fees and not the gas tax so just to be clear this includes uh a quarter of the Deferred Staffing so it doesn't include the full ask from across the board but it's a fourth of it and this year just skating by so it's not it's not quite enough so you want to you know anybody something to give you a little bit more buffer there and a five percent on that'd be like 250 dollars somebody making um fifty thousand and then for the operations it would be fourteen dollars a month or so so this adds up the current rate plus the number so it's uh it'd be 14.50 and then it would increase by the CPI after that and then the dollar 25 local option and that's what would be recommended is that what you'd be recommending you know I don't have a specific recommendation what we're really looking for is that sustainable uh fund balance and services going forward um so I mean we have a range of options uh that you can do there uh I would recommend diversifying to not focusing on one option but having multiple options um any other members have any thoughts this kind of layout of suggestions um and you know we're floating by floating just and that's only 25 percent deferred Staffing right so that's a little bit more of everything so it doesn't quite get anyone good fully staffed but it could be you know a couple more fire stations some more police officers some more internal services but not the not the full ask back to uh member um Varney's question about a public safety Levy that is specifically you know again fire and police that could pay not just for infrastructure it could pay for people it could pay for Staffing is that correct a levy yeah really good question uh distinct from a general obligation Bond it's a separate kind of Levy a local option level can be used for either infrastructure or operations in this case uh we're looking for operations okay thank you thank you for that Clarity because the bond is helping with the fire trucks and those items yes they've been ordered uh I would ask if there's any feedback if uh if this committee recommends to you to hold that work session we do have it scheduled um is there anything else that would be helpful uh additional information or displays uh you know for you and your colleagues as you consider different I think this display is incredibly helpful I'm wondering what you have seen from The Balancing Act from people bringing in their input I can uh I'll I can provide some high level input at that at that work session uh we've had quite a few views you know a few hundred views as far as submissions a little bit less but people are spending some time on the site so that's good news because they're they're experiencing what the services are what the revenues look like um so even if we're not getting them the actual submissions people are are looking at it good well the 10 times I've been on it track that from the 200. it does patient so it's pretty interesting about half are from Salem and then a half from other other areas oh really what other why would that be of interest I'm just when you submit you can pick your location on a map so we can look at the word distribution but there are others that are interested that aren't living within the Civil events oh interesting okay well uh let me lower my hand I don't think I have any more questions right now thank you no thank you any other member questions I have one more anybody else as you think about it um can we do two local option levies one and then whatever it's called and then one on Public Safety is that possible uh yes absolutely it would be separate ballot measures yeah except separate local optional others and again you know so so there is compression we already have some compression in Marion County on bolt count inside but in the Marion County side um so the higher the rate the more compression you have which which basically means that you have a portion",

        "text": " filter of our standards and come up with what we call analysis areas that are required for each of our standards um that need to be what needs to be included in the actual application because at a notice of intent it's a notice of intent to file it or submit an app for a site certificate no application has actually been submitted or received so the applicant is preparing all the materials to include in their application with at this time and so while I write the project order they're working on their studies and coordination and Analysis coming up with their plans and then we issue the project order and it will tell the applicant what needs to be included in that application and that is you so we issue the project Court the notice of intent is valid for two years so in the time that from the notice of intent phase we received a complete notice of intent on this project on September 28th 2023 they have two years to submit an application now the applicant has indicated they would like to submit it earlier than that but just realized there's a two-ear window that they have to to uh submit that application so it could be as late as September 2025 that they would actually submit but it's up to them and how how soon they they get it all together so the next stage is the actual preliminary application and then what we call a complete application so again they submit information to us for review and the application is quite expensive um they're exhibits documents survey reports everything that gets in there we again issue of public notice we will open it up again for public comment and then we have an information meeting at that point too and that's important there's been particularly a long period of time that's elapsed between the noi and the actual application and again we review with the four naming agencies um reviewing agencies the tries the local governments um for this project because it's located in Wasco both of those Counties have been identified as special advisory groups there are more of Commissioners so Wasco County and shman County had the ability to participate in our process as what we call special advisory groups and they will also provide input throughout our process and then the next step is the draft proposed order the department of energy cting division staff we prepare the draft proposed order and it's our evaluation of the application materials and as we run it through a filter of our standards so we make recommendations in those draft proposed orders we include conditions that need to be that should be added to a site certificate these are all recommendations for our Council we then issue yet another public notice um and it opened up another period but we also hold what is a public hearing and that is after the materials have been made available to the public so that they're on our web page you've been received a a notice there's ways for people to go in who are interested and read all these materials or maybe they just want to read some of them and a public hearing is a formal public comment period And when I had mentioned the contested case proceeding which is built into our process if you want to participate in a contested case or think you might it's very important that you have commented on the record of the draft it's a really important thing to to keep in um we bring that draft proposed order to the energy facility citing Council for review after it's gone through the public hearing we compile all the comments that we received um and they review it and they will make comments themselves and make recommendations to us and things that they might want see change and we take that information and we process it and add it into the document and edit the draft proposed order and then it becomes the proposed order we again issue a notice when we issue that notice there's an a notice of the opportunity of the contest case toing and there will be information on how to request a contested case or be a party to a contested case at that time in that notice the contested case is built into our process if no one requests a contested case we don't have one we don't actually hold one but there it's a placeholder in our process if there's a contested case there is a whole process that goes through before it goes to the final order again Council will review this proposed order they might have additional comments at the very and we take our proposed order and we take it to council for approval it's Council the a council that makes the decision to Grant or deny a site certificate for a facility so if you look at under the the pointy arrows there's different colored uh boxes under each of those and what's that's showing is who's basically the lead on that so notice of ATT 10 it's the applic job to prepare that the project order is the Department of energy I staff that prepare that again the application materials are prepared by the applicant we prepare the sighting division the draft proposed order and the proposed order council is the one that makes the decision on the S so kind of a big overview of our process and what is not on this slide is the appeal path a final fet decisions are appealable directly to the Oregon SU court and they have six months to issue a decision if it is we have a public guide on our website um there's copies of the public notice if you didn't get one on the table back there along with some information sheet and there are links on there and how to get to all of ours um on the internet can you take questions during this or do you want to wait we would like you to hold questions till the end but if you want us to go back to a slide we can do that June so I had mentioned earlier reviewing agency this is just a little bit more information on you know what what are the review reviewing agencies what is their role what how do we utilize reviewing agency input and coordination and the reviewing agency serve a really important role in our process because they provide comments on the proposed facility um within the jurisic or expertise of the agency so if if there are sensitive species then we talked to ODFW about habitat and habitat mitigation plans in the species that might be impacted so it's a really important part of us getting information and like I said these are the state agencies the local governments the tribal governments sometimes it's a federal agency depending on the facility and if it's in you know a federal jurisdiction and all of them help us as an as a cting division to just identify and determine what kind of studies and what kind of analysis needs to be conducted which permits are required any kind of uh specific rules or administrative rules or statutes or ordinances local local zoning considerations things like that that we we really value that input and we look to different agencies for expertise so we have reached out to all of the reviewing agencies when we received the notice of intent and issued our public notice and I am in the process of coordinating with all of them to get input in comments that we then pass on to the applicants so that they can incorporate it into their planning and design and the goal is good site so um and like I said we have two special advisory groups on this per proposed facility which is wco and Sherman County supp isues okay next slide I think I went to the next slide without telling you to go to the next slide yes you did okay for a second so people can catch up and it's basically everything I just said so next slide so I mentioned six General standards that are required for us to to assess and determine um as we review information the state sting process is a standards based review so it's based on these 16 standards um and it's evidentiary so we need to see information that demonstrates the bur approv is on the applicant to provide that evidence to demonstrate that they meet that standard it's our job as the sighting provision to evaluate that evidence and that's part of what we're Consulting with our reviewing agencies on studies that have been conducted at the application Phase and then we make those recommendations in our draft proposed order to our Council the energy facilities citing Council and they are the ones who ultimately evaluate all the information in the record to decide whether to point it's a site certificate because we're at the notice of a 10th phase we're really seeking any type of comment that anyone wants to provide um but it's important to know because I said we are a standards based process if you want to comment particularly on the draft proposed order focusing your comments to relate to our standards is very important so if you're making a comment or you have a concern it is most effective persective is the best way for our Council to evaluate it is to link it to one of our standards so if you're worried about fish and wildlife habitat link it to our fish and wildlife habitat standard and that's how our Council looks at the information provided and so it's it's just a really important part of our process next slide so okay so at the notice of intent phase the applicant is required to do a desktop assessment of what we call study areas and the study areas are basically set by Statute and it's for them to go out and do like a desk what we call a desktop which is what is the available information out there in the universe that applies to this standard and each of our standards has a slightly different or there's different reasons why we have these study areas in the notice of intent and so the notice of intent that the applicant submitted was required to to do the desktop analysis for all of these so as you can see there's 20 mile study area for areas things like the the cultural tend to be limited to the actual site boundary and I'll get to the site b in a minute um fish and wildlife has a half mile endangered species is five miles and one of the things that we're looking for input on at the noi phase whether it's a reviewing agency or the public is what you pick up what should the analysis areas be often times they're the same as this but they can also change so if you think that the analysis area should be doesn't need to be that big or it should be bigger this is a really important part of our process particularly with our reviewing agencies of getting that input on you know does this make SS does it need to be bigger there something we're not seeing here and it's just at the noi comment phase this is one of the things that we're really trying to uh dial in because in the app in the project order that I prepare I'm going",

        "text": " the policy as I saw it last time so I uh thank you very much and treekeepers and I are always available for questions I think I've memorized all of the prior code and I'm now got some new literature for me to memorize thank you for your testimony next is Jim long excuse me chair Lockwood yeah we have lilan Stone now online okay let's go back then and and Miss Stone would you please go ahead hi can you hear me yes wonderful thank you my name is Lily Stone and I reside on vandos Road in the SCH scholes Valley thank you for the opportunity to speak here this evening I would like to thank the county for doing the work to update the significant resources mapping and the work that occurred during the go 5 inventory update process to ensure the continued preservation of the wonderful natural resources within our County I have a few points that I think will help enhance the proposal and protection of our significant natural resources within county first the references to land outside of the urban growth boundary specifically references 42221 42222 and 42223 should likely be removed since this ordinance is focused on urban areas and and we shouldn't be referencing allowing development on significant natural resources outside of the urban boundary second in article 7 there does not appear to be mitigation measures required for transportation facilities public transportation facilities have significant re impacts on nearby streams wetlands and Associated R riparian habitats there should be required Alternatives analysis supported by an independent traffic consultant before one of these snrs is impacted and there should be a requirement that County pick a path that involves the least impact to the snrs is possible third continued development in the same area of wetlands and riparian habitats makes those remaining Downstream resources have a higher value to the habitat itself there should be some reflection of that higher value within this proposal fourth it would be helpful to have a migration plan and pathway more completely contemplated here uh to help preserve our local Wildlife as well and lastly it would be beneficial to have an incentive for developers to not develop in and around significant natural resources Beyond just the required mitigation measures maybe this isn't appropriate for for these ordinances but perhaps there could be lower building permit costs for areas that don't have significant natural resources I hope that you'll take some of these points under consideration to be implemented into these ordinances to ensure the preservation of beautiful resources within our County thank you thank you for your your testimony I think I skipped Andy Hogan but or did he not is Andy Hogan available no okay um chair Lockwood we have Tanya steel uh she was the first person on the list okay she's um available she is available right okay please go ahead Miss Steel but if he is online um if he could raise his hand and let us know uh seeing nothing we can uh move on to Jim long okay Mr long hello yes but we okay the screen just changed totally uh my name is Jim long um chair of the significant natural resources committee for the committee for Community involvement um we have and I submitted to you the first letter as a draft because it hasn't yet been approved by the full CCI which be focused on 901 and 902 on August 20th the night before your next hearing so we encourage you to hold another public hearing as we perceive more issues as as others have stated with the Ordinance do I have time to read the entire seven pages I'll probably just summarize so I'm here for the significant natural resources committee not the CCI uh we oppose the proposed ordinance 901 and 902 as currently written please accept our support for uh for our subcommittee's uh input the current proposals fail to strike a balance between housing production and the need to REM protect remaining natural resources including trees and wildlife habitat protection is one of our favorite words with this for Upland habitat consolidating Upland habitat classifications obscure critical distinctions between different types of Upland habitats Each of which may have unique ecological and conservation needs uh there's a level of amb ambiguity in these uh proposed ordinances and we will identify more specifically what they are um in article 422-4469 Wildlife um we're glad to see that uh tree replacement would occur on site and actually we we are also like mitigation on local mitigation tree canopy is well known to play a key role in climate change mitigation by preventing Urban heat Islands improving air and water quality and enhancing storm War order management mandatory maximums must be included to preserve these essential Services okay we're concerned with the duration of um of these of these ordinances and how they will uh ensure plant health and soil moisture the lack of resources has already been brought up that uh the county doesn't have resources now to effectively Monitor and force all County policies as a result land use and transportation department relies heavily on community members to report code violations this enforcement model is dependent on the Public's ability to recognize infractions leaving gaps in effective oversight as well as responsiveness to improve this re process it is critical to consider additional Washington County resources transparency uh detailed information on mitigation efforts have been undertaken that have been undertaken including specific actions are things that we need we need this information we recommend Washington County provide details regarding mitigation activities assigned and or implemented with the last five years for the purpose of calculating ecological impacts as a result of SNR tree losses we find the tree valuation points to be a little confusing the cumul there are C cumulative effects of the current policies and the way Washington County has been developed over the years oak trees are slow growing sturdy trees but there are other trees besides oak trees that should be protected also uh the Ponderosa Pine needs to be protected but also including the Pacific Willow and some others we we recommend cities qualified inventory update should be included as part of the S&amp;R mapping uh the city of baverton reinventoretv since over 200 trees have recently been removed in public right away by Washington County due to conflicts with recent infrastructure decisions all of these Street trees provided need need provide needed shade to pedestrians bicyclers M Mr long um your your time is up okay I've got a there's a bunch of suggestions that our committee has come up with you've got it all in your uh in the document I submitted earlier today thank you for your time thank you for your testimony chair Lockwood can we try Andy Hogan sure Mr Hogan Mr Hogan are you online not seeing him online is there anyone in the audience or virtual audience that would like to communicate to the Planning Commission on this ordinance or ordinances we do have someone online it's Amo hi can you hear me yes good evening chair Lockwood and members of the Planning Commission my name is Andrea I reside in Washington County and I'm a member of schs ordinance 901 and 902 are the utmost importance because they will change Mo and County forever Generations can can you be a little louder sure can you hear me better now yeah hello yes please go ahead any of future Generations according to the 2019 stud we have already lost 85% of our snrs and with 901 and 902 you could lose the remaining 15% the state of Oregon has a Timber regulation to protect streams and tree canopy Oregon law requires that trees be left as buffers along stream to protect water quality and fish habitat Forest buffers shade streams keep water cool trees fall streams form aquatic habitat buffer whips vary depending on the stream size and whether the streams contain fish or provide drinking water 901 states that creeks and drainages shall be addressed through applications provisions of the CDC and the CDC states the development within reparan areas water areas Wetlands fish and wildlife habitat shall comply with the app whole state and federal regulatory guideline but 901 says roads required Brides sh preferred means of Crossing streams and waterways rather than infills piping or channelization of water flow 901 also states that retention of trees shall be encouraged partic particularly when existing stands of trees can be used to lessen the impact of a new attached unit development therefore 901 would allow cutting trees in phills and culverts because it is written as preferred or as encouraged 901 doesn't preserve or protect our streams or our trees building and crossing the SNR should be avoided alog together Washington County has 463,000 acres and 4,200 Acres of snrs less than 1% seeking alternative plans are not even mentioned in 901 or 902 draft the draft goal five report and es those need to be addressed also but I don't have time to talk about those but thank you very much for your committed dedication and work that you guys do for County thank you for testifying is there anyone else seeing no one oh it it we do have one Val beton court all right Mr is it B betting Court can you hear me okay yes please go ahead um I have lots of things that I'm going to be reviewing as well after this because there has been a lot of new information but I do have lots of questions is that if there is um a required permit to take trees down um why don't you have them apply for permit for old gr growth trees like other counties um um I'd also like to know what environmental surveys were done and did any third-party environmental experts or companies evaluate your project or maps and the new laws I also noticed that there are many mislabeled places on the map that don't include certain wetland in a reparan areas specifically the 100y old Wetland on the Portland Golf Club property um and I'm wondering why any field work hasn't been done and I am confused about allowing the swingle single dwelling development on um certain areas of the map I noticed that in one of the slides so that was a bit confusing so I'm hoping that can be on and of course with the permits for the old trees of course that would um exclude Hazard hazardous dead and dying trees but I also feel that it is the property owners um the property owner's responsibility to have arboris uh make sure that the health of those trees are taken care of um and I believe that's it but I do believe that we are in a current climate crisis and I've seen large redwoods Douglas fur oak trees that are 100 150 years old come down on my knee neighborhood um just be taken down by the owners and completely clearcut their entire properties just because they want to and there's nothing to stop it since",

commissioner Griggs here commissioner Heller here commissioner Levin is absent commissioner Slater is absent and commissioner Viera brendel thank you Shelby saving on to item three the public conference this has been time if you would like to make a comment about any of the issues other than public hearings deliberations and merits of land use issues that we review at public sharing so I think I see a couple interested people but maybe not needing to impressive advice is that correct you're move on to the consent calendar commissioner Keller do you have a question by um I move that uh we adopt the minutes of our July 18 2020. commissioned me thank you do I have a second commissioner Augustine is our second any discussion on that motion Shelby please call the role signify by saying I if you're in favor of the motion negative you are a host commissioner Augustine commissioner Goble uh commissioner Griggs aye commissioner Heller aye and commissionera brindle aye the rest of the Commissioners thank you motion passed moving on to the public hearings we want all of the public here for items 5.1 Bryce will be presenting for the staff so before that are there any experts in context or a conflicts of interest to it's all on one okay this is a public hearing to consider a comprehensive plan change and zone change within annexation case number anxc 756 CPC zcu 2303 for property located at set 572 Heil Lane Northeast the criteria applicable to this application are found on the Salem Revised Code SRC chapters 260.010 G2 for annexations with a minor comprehensive plan map Amendment or quasi-judicial zone change 64.025 E2 for minor comprehensive plan map Amendment and 265.005 E for zone changes failure to raise an issue prior to the close of the public hearing but statements are evidence sufficient to afford the Planning Commission and the party is an opportunity to respond to the issue occludes appeal and use board of appeals Luba on that issue a similar failure to raise constitutional issues relating to proposed conditions of approval precludes an action for damages in Circuit Court prior to the conclusion of the hearing any participant May request an opportunity to present additional evidence or testimony the Planning Commission will then either continue the public hearing or leave the record open for at least seven days thank you Shelby thanks welcome and this is the application is is being requested for essentially allowing the body to be brought into the City and the development second phase of an existing Department Complex public Cascade Vista Apartment Complex which is to the north of the Central Park they would have access to Center Street so in terms of the location of the factory it is a essentially a slight law to served by a private so I called accessory in Marion County which is named this final Lane which takes access to Auburn and so being a flight called it doesn't have girlfriends on the street but served by that access way but property to the north which is the first phase of the Cascade based apartments it's the North and the west of the property the plant annexation or after annexation that's through the property will be incorporated into the rest of the scientific Department investment and then go through the landing spiritual to expand the existing apartment complex with one additional building that would have 18 so when we look at the screen here the areas that are in place is is in the city uh the correct sorry that's a little bit washed out hard to read the current confidence of client designation for the event he was developing residential and then as indicated the request seeks to change the conference of plans and multi-family residential be consistent with the as you can see you know basically it's a landlocked Parts essentially this has changed as provided for a more logical boundary of this is developing residential reported in RS in terms of resulting it's currently in Marion County uh UD Urban Development request is changed designing to RNG development on the property that was proposed as a second phase being consistent with multi-hand consented to it future expansion um the site itself is 4.78 Acres of science the Topography of the site is flat there is a a portion of these support the little pudding river that runs adjacent to the Eastern property line of the central property as identified in the memories of termination report that was that it was not on the property but it is to the East and the dash green line is save line Channel and associated with it was submitted by the applications to apply with DSL or future development of the site there are no threes on the property and there is a really small one you can't see there because it's too small but there's a really small area of ants like Hazard points that are susceptible waypoints that Jets into the property near the southeast corner is in the future development plan or the conceptual development plan it's in the setback area so as long as early on The Showdown because it was Sue this property on the site to the the site of the north is in the city limits but then as you go further to the north through the site there is acts Transit access to the inside via Center Street it's a 15 minutes level service so it's a higher frequency service and of course uh accesses so Center is a major article and then Auburn is a collector Street and then green Crest world over here that is also a collective it goes itself and it connects through the East Park development to the Southwest Auburn uh here's the conceptualist future development plan for phase two submitted by the applicant as you can see uh the city they have the city limit the standard shown in red and sites to the north outside is to the south and east and so there were those new building of 18 units is we're beyond the property line as it's proposed as it exists today they're essentially the majority of a lot of parking Urban Landscaping interior to the parking it's setbacks primary access would be through be multi-family parking lot circulation to the North and then filters at the center and then there would also be secondary access for emergency vehicles there is an easement that exists to serve this line from down to Auburn so it does have access in this case with a certain secondary assets would not be accessed for everybody to the development to utilize and impact those things in itself that you know also didn't utilize that for access with the 120 units that were part of the first phase plus the additional 18 of this that brings it to the 12 138 which is a density of 23.9 units per acre which is you know kind of in the mid-range it was allowed an orange Zone at minimum of 12 or 13-12 units substitute over so I said he wanted to spray here so they're in the staff report you know we have the findings satisfied and supported by the applicants analysis of the proposal performance of the criteria they feel at least the criteria is a much more The Logical organization of land you know the family complexes to the north provides for a lot of extension of that increases the cities even though we do now meet the housing needs analysis mobile changes that occurred are the same appropriate uh the results and then actually and then you know designating more land excuse corridors City this will still result in more multi-family land that will actually be used for their developers but you know this will actually a good additional constructed goals is identified and staff reported so this is the recognition report we didn't receive any comments prior to the staff report we did oversee received more comments after the staff report was made available and it was from the mailman neighborhood association and they hadn't heard any specific objections and so and they indicated that LS policy to not to support small organizations like this so they only supported with one thing they did know was that your residents of the mobile home park to the first phase the way this issues for the extraction of that for the states and there was other Communications does establish reminders so it's already 6 30 that's too early seven or later that way and then we didn't receive any other comments after this afterwards and based on that we are recommending that the County Commission recommended the city council on planned resignation changed from developing residential to multifigures thank you questions for Bryce from Commissioners at this point thank you I was wondering about the runoff and how it's the report said it wouldn't increase but as far as amendments is that is that did I read that correct yeah but we have a stormwater detention Sanders so there has to be you know levels of payments okay thank you so just a quick easy question is it so unfortunate that man talks to the construction company about the noise yeah they were if they're operating at 6 30 in the morning around 37 yeah they were called enforcement so that's what that will happen well well we don't get it and there's a way to do that online other questions for snap thanks have you up later who knows the applicants that the applicant like to address the commission of 15 minutes distance if you would mind state your name and your regrets or your board for the record president Griggs and planning Commissioners my name is Bailey Oswald and I am here tonight as legal counsel for the applicant Center Street Holdings um together with Jared Stevenson our address is one two one one Southwest 5th Avenue Suite 1900 Portland Oregon 97204 and we are here representing the applicant in its proposal to Annex approximately 0.78 acres into the City of Salem specifically tonight we are discussing the proposed minor comprehensive plan map Amendment from developing residential to multi-family um residential and that zone change from Urban Development to rm2 after annexation the subject property will be Consolidated into the adjacent Cascade Vista Apartment Complex which is also owned by the applicant and as background about adjacent conflicts with annexed into the City by the applicant in 2019. first and foremost we wanted to thank staff for their excellent work on the staff report we agree with it in all um and not going to reproduce staff's efforts to walk through the approval criteria tonight in such a thorough job um in an effort to keep this relevant for free um we also want to thank the planning Commissioners for their attention to this matter tonight um we are specifically requesting that the Planning Commission accept the findings and conclusions of the staff report and recommend",

        "text": " and they do not have to follow if they go through you they don't have to put any kind of agricultural use on these farmlands um they don't know what you said they don't have to do that for any project whether it's County or state now that doesn't mean that you know if they're going to take Prime Farmland out of production maybe you know if there's no habitat or no Farmland mitigation plan maybe that doesn't justify approval um so it really depends on the particular application so in the east side of the mountains where most of the projects that we reviewed are there is not much in the way of you know it's there's a lot of up in wheat some of the areas are exclusive Farm use so let me speak exclusive Farm use owned but they're not in active production so in that situation you know it's the same requirements it's the same standard those may not require any kind of agricultural mitigation here if it's their argument to make it's it's not our argument to make it's the applicant's argument to make and it's your also your ability to review and provide comment that if they're going to take this Farmland out of production can they do that and then just take it out of production or is there some mitigation requirements that are necessary in order to justify approving that that's what this process is about so I'm not saying that they're not going to do that or they don't have to do that the law does not require them absolutely to do that but that's probably as they've said and that's why they're talking about agrovaltaics is I think they believe that that's required in order to justify this but you're saying theoretically and I'm not talking about these Cascades we all live in Lynn County I want to know about this particular project it could theoretically be approved without any kind of agricultural use is that what I'm hearing you say theoretically yes thank you I think all the well the Pegram of alterix that was done by Mr Higgins Professor Higgins how big was that it was six acres it's nowhere close to the size that you're talking about so how can you how can you how is that going to work I mean like that's you know something you're going to have to look at and in this area and again I'm not online can you make sure you start can you make sure you speak into the mic so people on the okay I'm a stupid retired attorney so the bottom line is though you can't tell me that six acres out of wood burn is enough to say oh this is going to so what are you gonna do this is uh clay soil it holds the water it rots out a lot of roots on a lot of plants and you know grass seeds kind of maybe it's where it's at it's Lynn County so what are you going to do about that are you going to try to mitigate it or what what's the deal I I can say what we're working on right now is is working on a plan to address that and and that is part of you know what we're looking at as Todd had said part of it is going to be not only addressing standards but also addressing you know making sure the preponderance of the evidence um supports what can be accomplished with this project and so it's up to you know our team to be able to clearly articulate that and that's something that is still like we're still working through it um so whether it's six acres or more or the size of the project we have to demonstrate that plan to be able to justify what we think you know for this project that it would work and and that's a work in progress and so that's why we've got a ways you know we're at the very beginning again we haven't developed or in the process of working through this so we yeah that and that would have to be articulated in our application okay yeah I guess my concern is you take all this farmland and to me you know on from Eastern Oregon and I come from much larger spreads but when you talk about 15 1600 acres in Lynn County and you're taking all that out of production and you don't theoretically have to put it back into some kind of agricultural use no matter how much you want to that raises a red flag for me and I also wonder when you put these solar panels in are they concrete it in how much concrete goes in that Earth and how is it removed if you have to if it's abandoned and how can it be restored back to something workable is that feasible have you done that in the past so for how panels are installed they're actually pile driven I'm sorry they're they're pile driven um so no concrete is actually needed uh for the installation of those the applications so the the intent we try to be you know provide flexibility when we're addressing you know what materials will be used so at this point there's still there's final engineering hasn't been done but uh the anticipation is that piles can be used and so but we still have to plan for because in these applications you have to identify all the materials up front so if there is potential for concrete use we want to be upfront about that but also note that the you know I uh prior to construction all these plans will be finalized with the intent that it's it's pile driven but you know as a contingency a lot of the application materials will also provide you know like what's the maximum case scenario um you know if it has to be used so that that's why you'll see some things like that that contemplate you know if that that's why okay I would also like to add when it comes to concrete for the piles um typically projects don't use concrete for the piles only in like really extreme cases of really terrible like topography would you need something like that but it given that this side is pretty flat if not entirely flat um that's not something that we're expecting that's needed so the piles or the panels themselves they'll be pile driven and then we do something called a geotechnical study that measures how far down we would have to go and it kind of like re it measures like the tolerance for piles and that dictates what size and what length of it would be needed and then if it can't be supported just by a pile then there would be Alternatives that may include like concrete okay so is this the largest project that you're involved with with your company okay thank you Ryan Glazer is next and then Kurt kainer is after Ryan Glazer okay Kurt kainer hi my name is Kurt kainer I farm in the donut hole that you guys are creating I have some direct questions that nobody's been able to answer yet the first one was for you guys Oregon's known for being a right to farm a lot of complications go when you are mixing industrial with or residential with farming what kind of complications are you going to see by doing the submittal Farm ground like I said I chose not to succumb to the 800 an acre or the 30 40 000 signing bonus of the deposed because I don't want to play that game and I don't want to do that to my neighbors I'm a right I mean I I mean the choices that other Farmers make with their land is their choice and I I have nothing against that I'm not trying to be Sensational guys I'm just saying that that was my choice the neighbors want to do something with you guys that's their prerogative you know we live in a free country and and I believe that should happen but the problem I see and I guess it's self-serving is what happens to me in the middle of this with your solar panels all around me I mean there's a couple of us there's Esther guards there's myself Jesse Farber he's here somewhere you know some of the things that you're proposing are are flawed and here's what I'm going to say is you know I've Got Friends on both sides of this so I I'm I understand the need for electricity I definitely understand as a fourth generation farmer the need for farmland and preserving that land because we're being encroached on from so many sides do you take into account from your administrative rules I I'm not buying this it's all it's not all laws and rs statutes a lot of what you do is Administrative rules somebody's making this up as they go along I spent the last 14 years of my life on the city of Harrisburg Planning Commission I'm pretty good at figuring out this was nothing more than end around to get easier path okay I understand you used the rules in your benefit those of us in farming usually don't get that option because we don't have lawyers on retainer we don't have a lot of stuff so that being said what do you take into account for those that are left in the middle of this that have to farm because some of the complications that come into this are going to definitely fall into the right to farm laws or if that's ORS statues not administrative rules that you can break or snap that's a great question so we've talked mostly so far about direct impacts and and and that absolutely indirect impacts are something we're going to look at so when Jim Johnson from the Oregon Department of Agriculture was up he talked about a case uh Supreme Court or a landing board of appeals case that is applicable to us as well we will evaluate that so once again why I appreciate you being here appreciate the comments up we will evaluate the indirect impacts you know on adjacent properties and so we want to know you know are you able to get your farm equipment in there is that going to create you know you can't get through the donut hole are you do you have certain agricultural practices that are going to be impacted as a result of this um we absolutely want to hear that in our process in our application right now how are you talking to to find out what those answers are you we're talking to you so we're seeking that in just one guy but that's but that's exactly what we're here for is we're seeking that information from you because you're the one who's going to be impacted you're the one who knows your farming practice we want to hear from you about that the truth of the matter is each person that owns a property should have rights as long as they don't infringe on other people if they want to if my neighbors want to participate in this project so be it it's not my place I don't feel it's my place to step in the middle of it but by the same token what you're proposing is definitely going to step in the",

        "text": " wanted to make sure you got a heads up on that so Erin isn't there a new uh OTC leadership didn't yeah two members uh so there have been nominations for two thief on the Oregon Transportation Commission I don't have those names off the top of my head um it got buried and they the the tear of the Oregon Transportation Commission did step down um I think he's looking to actually um and there was another vacancy that had it that needed to be filled and the governor has is working on that appointment process which has to be confirmed by the senate in order to move forward I would I will get you those names and include that update on Friday thank you yeah um when we get to the Q a section I know I have some other questions related to land use uh but I'll just wait okay the Q a section I'm happy to wait till then um so that is this slide I'm not hearing that we took a position but we didn't take we understood that there was no need to take a position so I mean how are we going to articulate and I think we articulate that we heard it but we understood that there was no position we are pleased to see the Oregon Governor's executive order pausing the tolling work until January of 2026 I think that's a great statement and no need to take a position because it sounds like it's been fixed but I just didn't like the way that representative McLean was kind of kicked to the curb on this and I think we need to at least reach out and make sure that she understands that we support her hard work that she's been putting in on this and and the bridge replacement so I just want to make sure we're sending a good message to her so maybe she didn't like this maybe she wasn't it doesn't sound to me like she was even talked to about this but again nobody likes to be blindsided and I just want to make sure that we're communicate and support her what are your thoughts Erin I the conversation writ large around concern around polling has been very vocal amongst members of the elected body at the legislature she was aware of the work I don't know um what the level of communication between the governor's office and representative McLean were related to the governor's action um today but this is not a conversation that hasn't been had amongst the membership is my understanding that there's been a lot of discussion about concerns coming out of 205. um so I will I can check in with representative McLean but also Express um the commission's support for her ongoing hard work to find Solutions um as we have the two-year pause if that's acceptable I think my support for this Governor's executive uh pause I'll call it that distinguish it from the homelessness stuff is we've been kicking around Kotex executive orders um is just as a result of the community having so much angst and controversy over this particularly in South County that in no way does it to me diminish the work that representative McLean has been doing so I don't feel like I haven't heard additional reinforcement needed there at all I think we're ready to move on okay uh let's play please um so in the world of Economic um the Strategic investment program engaged your conversation had informational hearing about proposed changes that would both modernize the Sip portion of a sip and gain share Arrangement and then change the cap in a way that is unacceptable for Washington County um so house bill 3457 is a proposal for making significant changes to the process around civil agreements some of which is um aligned with the direction that Washington County would like to see in particular it would raise and then index the threshold for the Baseline amount that is subject to property taxes so the that currently 100 oh wow my brain just short circuited there the 150 million dollars that is currently taxable and then we have the um abatement that sits on top of that it would um into or sorry 100 million dollars it would index that or raise it up and then index and you're moving forward so that that base amount that is subject to straight property tax pages from year to year um based on standard indexing using the inflation index and that would change both for Rural and for urban and all sizes of hip agreement and investment included in that however are some other Provisions that we need to work um with the legislature on that bring more people to the table that have to agree to and sign on to propose sip agreements which can complicate the negotiations and give detail power to smaller taxing districts which is um there has to be a way to move forward and we'll we're working to find that way to move forward in ways that don't subject us to um lack of economy and Authority in that conversation and the most concerning piece of all of the second recommended changes sits with the change to the game share cap the bill Amendment proposes capping it at five million which is um I'm probably more blunt than I need to be today um that is unworkable and unacceptable from the position of Washington County to see a 10 million dollar or 11 million dollar reduction in the cap um we have made it very clear for the proponent of the amendment that that is a non-starter as far as conversation and in fact we should be looking at raising the cap um and pointed out that the cap if it were not in place would sit in a um we would be collecting approximately 52 million dollars in case your dollars without the cap and we're not saying we need to go to that but we need to lift the cap and index it so that it has proportional value for the amount fund income that comes to the state so that conversation is ongoing we do have plenty of Advocates that we are working with um to undo that mindset uh that is tied to where we were in 2007 and the expected revenues From Any Given zip agreement said that the game care payments would probably pack out at four million dollars which clearly is not at all how effective we have been with the zip tool for bringing the state 141 million dollars in Revenue um so that conversation is ongoing um we do have advocates in the legislature who are working with us um both elected and with other stakeholders to move that forward and that is included in Senate Bill 1084 which right now is just drafted with a straight extension of 10 years for games here but we are looking to include language that would increase and index the game share payment as well the negotiations between house bill 3457 Senate Bill 1084 and a variety of other um local inventive packages that may or may not include the regionally significant industrial site Enterprise zones and long term rural Enterprise zones are all being negotiated as as they also negotiate related to um everything else that the semiconductor Tac forth had recommended so this conversation is ongoing the story that we are telling is being heard by some but if not being heard by folks to just see Washington County pulling down 16 million dollars a year over year and feeling that that is Washington County government does not pull down 16 million a year we need to really that is a size that I do emphasize that whenever I speak to anyone that it that 16 million dollars is spread across a variety of packaging districts that all need that funding um not just Washington County and that in fact Washington County as a counties is a diminishing amount of that money coming to us so since we have media reporters listening to our work sessions I want to make sure everybody knows that all of the taxing districts in Washington County that receive gain share dollars are in that total pool of 16 million dollars and the county agency itself has gotten 9 million of that 16 million so 9 16. not you Aaron it's the audience I think it's to hear it I think it's smart to reiterate that chair uh Aaron could I ask who's who's supporting this uh the the draft amendment was put forward by the revenue chair Nancy Nathanson uh representative out of Lane County Eugene area how to blame Mr Carr uh thank you for re-sharing with us the 2006 Washington County policy on sip through the prior sip enabling as well as through this current legislation are we required to adopt a Strategic investment plan program I don't think so no so I think the limits being discussed are a joke five million dollars 9 16 of 5 million dollars is 2.6 million if I did my math right uh so um and these modernization of caps for sip to me is not grounded in what this equipment and these equipment Investments are so this is all very troubling uh it's saying something is a valuable resource when it really isn't not not good not good at all oh and commissioner Rogers has a question okay uh my my question is is it Friday seems to be an important date for certain bills can you tell me what does happen or doesn't happen on that date with sure um so the second chamber deadline is for scheduling work sessions is on Friday which means that bills that are in policy committees subject to the deadline have to have the work that's been scheduled in order for a bill to move forward this session however it's very important that phrase policy committees subject to the dead body when it comes to revenue committees um and the joint Ways and Means those are not subject to the same deadlines they work through the session and can schedule a work session at any time with the um that both of these builds that are on the table that are on the slide related to sipping game chair uh they then have to go from whichever either the Senate finance and revenue committee or the how Revenue committee they then go to the Joint tax expenditure committee which is also not subject to the to the deadline instead of coming up on Friday so the deadlines do not impact these so what time frame do these bills have have some action in order to move to the other chamber um because they go down to the Joint fact expenditure committee they do not have to go from one chamber to the other they just have to go to both floors uh sorry I should have been clear about that and they are therefore subject to the Sani die deadline okay so um Mr Carr I would ask just as one of five also if uh legally the state legislature can impose limits on our property taxes or because who knows which way these this legislation is going to go what my my

        "text": " people that we serve um uh from an equitable standpoint as as well so I'm happy to yield for a moment I think we've got some folks from our team on to take if there's initial questions and then we'll be uh following up with some reading material as if people didn't have enough reading material as well so I'll yeld for the moment thank you director Bell it's of course fascinating to hear about your work uh both both of your um uh we and when we uh developed the kind of technical document that supported the development of the road map uh we had really wanted to do a stronger job than we were able to uh uh to evaluate equity and and to start to think about how to inform some of the policy choices and design programs that are Equitable so I see a lot of opportunity to work with with your um Agency on on thinking that through the next time we update the the road map and as we start to pull out some of the activities and and think about how do how do we design programs that are going to do a um do a better job of reaching out to the people that need the most help so really appreciate any questions or comments well again um you both uh could have we could have spent the whole meeting just learning more about uh the great work you're you're both doing uh but we do really appreciate having you both on the commission and look forward to finding ways to collaborate um and to support the good work that you uh your agencies are wading so thank you um we're gonna turn things over to um Nicole Singh who's with us uh with the with the EQ and and um she's going to walk us through the rul making that the department just kicked off uh to reestablish the climate mitigation program sure thank you protection program thank you chair McDonald and Commissioners um oh I see the slides up in front of us and um I'm going to talk today about the climate Protection Program 2024 so we're going to go to the slide um before I dive into today's presentation I know we with the time that we have today we there are a couple of things that you know I would like to focus on I think I've been asked to focus on um one of those is really just you know why are we having a climate Protection Program 2024 Ru making and really the process that DEQ has developed to move us forward is part of this Ru making I'm not going to actually spend much time today talking about like the design of the climate Protection Program you know how it works how it regulation works all those kinds of Det details of course if folks are interested in any of that um there's a lot of resources on our website but I'm here the rest of the the office of ghd programs and the climate um policy team is available for questions so I'm just putting that out there um as folks have more questions we're always happy to answer those but you know why are we the the climate Protection Program 2024 update is the climate Protection Program 2024 rul making um and so you know you know why are we having this rule making and I'm sure folks on this call um are aware of the fact that essentially uh there was a a Court ruling the US court of appeals um in December of 2023 invalidated what was the climate Protection Program rules and what was the climate Protection Program and so our primary reason for moving forward here at DEQ with a CPP 2024 rulemaking is we do want to reestablish a climate program in place of the CPP um and again you know we want to go forward and do this because of the invalidation of the rules and I should be clear I if folks are not aware um what the court of appeals decided was that there was a procedural error in our notification processes and that procedural error is what led to the invalidation of the total climate Protection Program so I'm sure folks are aware there's many other things that were raised in the petitions that led to this decision but all those other kinds of questions they have nothing to do with the actual ruling by the court of appeals the court of appeals basically just made this ruling focused on the invalidation just on this procedural era um you know obviously for DEQ one of the things that we want to do is in in the role that we play here um we want to continue to provide certainty and Clarity on Oregon's climate policy you know many of the the regulated entities in the climate Protection Program so again these are Natural Gas Utilities these are liquid fuels and propane suppliers these are you know large industrial stationary sources these regulated entities had been you know over the last year and a half two years they had been ready working on how they were going to comply with the climate Protection Program and the climate Protection Program it did St you know it did establish mandatory emission limits that declined over time so our regulated entities have been already working on meeting the requirements of the program and you know essentially we want to do as much as we can to continue to see that behavior happen so providing that certainty and Clarity on Oregon's climate policy is is very critical and it's part of the reason that we want to move forward with you know a Brisk but a deliberate CPP 2024 rulem and I think more generally you know everything that so many of you all have been working on in Commissioners is you know this doesn't just apply to the regulated entities right we're we're all businesses consu consumers all of us are folks who use fossil fuels more importantly I think as we developed the climate Protection Program so many folks lives are being touched by climate change and it's it's definitely a a topic and a discussion point where people all across the state have engaged and have provided their expertise and have provided comment so again we want to provide that certainty and Clarity to regulated entities but we want to provide that certainty and Clarity to again the businesses consumers stakeholders Advocates all of us who you know live work and call Oregon home um next slide please I can I don't know have to show this but again I think this commission knows you know y CPP 2024 rulemaking you know obviously at the time the Oregon global warming commission everything we've talked about the road map it really highlighted the importance of programs like the climate Protection Program not in isolation obviously the climate Protection Program is supported by all these other State programs across DEQ and other agencies that are helping us to transition in the clean energy economy but you know the program itself did play an important role in you know reducing the state's greenhouse gas emissions and also these kind of future forecasts for ghd emissions in the state I'll go to the next slide I did I did want to talk very briefly on you know how we got here how we got to the climate Protection Program you know how we got to the original climate Protection Program where we are now and where we hope to go with the CPP 2024 rulemaking um you know at the time I think this was very unique for DEQ our agency when we thought about developing the climate Protection Program um which again is a program that's developed within our current regulatory Authority so this is the program is developed and it will continue to be developed with the authority that's invested to our Environmental Quality commission but that program we did almost an 18month 20-month development process um we had what we call two phases to the program's development one of those phases is our quote unquote official rulem process and our official rulemaking process which is what we are also doing now again in 2024 our official ruem process really took place over the entire 2021 calendar year um it started in January and we basically wrapped it up in terms of the eqc's decision to adopt the program late in 2021 but prior to the rule making process we had an entire scoping session and we had those scoping sessions included lots of technical workshops uh it included um town halls I think we had something like seven eight nine workshops three or four Town Halls um at each of those uh meetings there was hundreds of attendees hundreds of folks giving us comments at those meetings and also providing written comments you know in addition to that kind of work we did do some some kind of modeling analysis to help support some of the program design options some of the decisions that we were trying to make and again for us I think at the time unique for DEQ was not just modeling analysis around potential emission reductions and not just macroeconomic impacts but also Public Health impacts and also an equity analysis how we could how we could design a program that would support Equitable outcomes and focus on environmental justice communities um once we finish that scoping session I think one of the real big takeaways of that that scoping session and all that work was really these kind of three foundational goals for the climate Protection Program one of those goals obviously was to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions but to try to find ways to do that that we also could where possible contain costs for businesses and consumers um but also most maybe for us at the time unique focusing on ways in which the program could support Equitable outcomes so really looking for ways that we could create benefits for environmental justice communities and also ways in which we could in whatever role that we could play small part that we could play in the program um reducing reducing any potential harm to environmental justice communities um so I'm going to go to the next slide but I I did want to just emphasize you know the amount of time and it took for us to develop that I just wanted to once again acknowledge the sheer volume of uh comments that we had received and the engagement we had received again from stakeholders from regul entities from Individual oregonians and I do think again for us as DEQ one of the things that we took away from that process is you know for us it was I think based on the my understanding is it was really one of the few times that we had so much new voices engaging on some of our programs and those new voices part of that I think was reflective of the fact that you know all agencies all of us are learning ways in which we can remove obstacles and more voices can participate in our R making and our regulatory activities but I also just think the breath of",

        "text": " I'm sorry um we are meeting with staff next week on the planning side to make sure the phasing works for for their code um so we don't quite have that finalized um and I don't have an exact number in my head sorry that's all right and you know I I also point that out because we are trying to minimize parking and maximize housing so I'm sure you're well aware this is not your first rodeo not your first project um that seems like an awful lot of parking 477 for 279 units so I don't know how you plan on scaling that down especially if you plan on providing shuttles and such but I know it's a ways out there I know that means cars are more likely to be important but I encourage you this council's been supportive of doing away with parking mandates and doing everything we can to support great affordable housing projects so just some food for thought for you thank you is there further disc discuss councelor Stapleton and then we'll go to Barney um thank you I don't have any questions but I didn't want to ignore you so with my back I'm sorry um uh so uh for those of you who watched our committee meeting which I'm sure it was like everybody in the city um um I voted against this um in committee and I um will continue to um to be against this project here tonight um and I wanted to spend a little time talking about why um of course I am not against affordable housing I want to see more of it um and as soon as possible um but for me I feel like we are sacrificing one goal for another um and we are sacrificing our climate action goals uh for our housing crisis um and although both of these are uh very real and everpresent and very intense um we talked a little bit about our committee meeting uh today in climate action about how do we how do we struggle with these things that seem to be intention with each other um and come out with um with Direction and so for me um I felt like our committee discussion was really great um and we did find ourselves in tension um but moved forward uh to hear tonight um some of the things that of course are really important for me are continuing to focus on the r Salem plan um and prioritizing infill projects along our court uh Transit networks um when we look at the housing development that we um already passed tonight with Greenlight development um that is a prime location for infill um it has all of the connections to Transit walkable bikable um areas here in town and close to amenities um I am really encouraged by the ideas that we heard tonight about um you know um having access to jobs that's fantastic but we are more than just our work um there is family there are um you know uh entertainment and and of course shopping and all of the things that go with living um and that's going to mean that these folks are going to be relying on car transportation and um that means that they're going to need a car payment and insurance and registration and maintenance costs um my husband and I were just driving our truck over the mountain and we felt something in the front end took it into Le Schwab and sisters and it turned out that one of our tires was about ready to blow and uh we had to get all new tires just drop of a hat 1,400 bucks right um and when you're a car owner you have to be prepared for that um but that's a a cost of living in our society that don't that we don't talk about enough it is the second highest expense for people who are living uh here is their housing first and transportation second and although I I love this project on all other sides um making it affordable to live but then increasing the con con Transportation costs there we go um is just something that I am struggling with um and so um I really want to help us focus our money the the small amount I wish it was more like councelor nordik said that we've set aside for affordable housing um to be in locations where it's going to be affordable as a whole so the whole part of living for these folks is going to be affordable um that's those are projects that I want to focus this money on um I I think that this um I think that this is has the votes and it's going to move forward um but I want to um this was just one of those spaces that I couldn't sacrifice one goal for another so I appreciate you all um being willing to listen to my um struggling with with the hard choices that we make thank you counselor and like I told you at our committee discussion um I don't think I I very much support this project um is it ideal no but it's inside the urban growth boundary housing and homelessness are this Council is number one priority and have been for a number of years and I think we need to encourage all the Housing Development we can with inside our Urban growth boundary would it be ideal if it were closer in sure but it eventually all of those Open Spaces within our Urban growth boundary are going to be are going to be filled up with housing um and so uh it may not be ideal but it gets us a long ways towards uh our goal I mean this is 183 units of affordable housing and and I I can't say no to that so that's why I'll be supporting it further discussion Council verney thank you um I'm really struggling with this one I think it's a great project but I'd like to be able to pick it up and move it in where there is access to stores and services and the transportation um I think the shuttle to jobs is a is a great idea but uh folks are still going to have to get car have cars to get services and that that concerns me um at the bond meeting one of the things we talked about was uh moving forward with this at this $10 million for affordable housing is we really needed to uh develop criteria to use um to select projects and we haven't developed those yet and I'm looking at at this using up a third of our affordable housing funds and that makes me a little uncomfortable cuz we don't know what else is going to be coming up to use those um yeah I think 100 I'm 183 units is is great um but not being in a Core Transit area or having access with bike bus I mean those are really some challenges um I did have a question so in terms of affordable units and providing those affordable units is this for perpetuity or is there a limited term that these will be affordable I mean how does that work yeah it will be tied to the state funding um which is typically um 30 years uh but this is owned by a nonprofit so the intention is not that that nonprofit at the end of 30 years will say oh I want to make a profit or I I mean it it's their purpose to um manage and own affordable housing for the benefit of the population they serve um so it it it will be restricted based on funding for that period and based on um uh this city as well but uh after that it's not going to be flipped it'll be in the hand of the nonprofit to continue to serve their mission okay thank you for the answers um so as a nonprofit does that mean that you don't pay property taxes um the intention is to yes to use there's a few different funding mechanisms to limit property taxes or get rid of property taxes and that is part of the funding structure that those would be limited that will be a separate um conversation and discussion um but that is part of just about any true affordable um and definitely affordable that's owned by a nonprofit uh funding for property I think M retherford has a comment on that so we have two different programs um for one for nonprofit owners of affordable housing so one is our low-income rental housing property tax exemption program that allows up to a 10-year uh tax exemption for affordable housing uh we also have the management agreement through the Housing Authority that a lot of projects go through to get their pass through tax exemption which can be a longer term than the first program that I mentioned this project will be exploring the management agreement with authority counc Gonzalez thanks mayor I just wanted to say a few things I mean just a 600 people on the waiting list at Cornerstone that that right there um you know is proba priority makes me just really think you know uh similar to Mayor Hoy uh I think when we were talking about the just the 10 million in the in the bond overall the budget I remember those discussions and 10 million was really all we could really get to to get support from the public to support that I mean there's General support everybody wants affordable housing but even even just getting it done today look how hard it is and people don't want it in their backyard as much as we thought as we'd want um and actually I'm in Reverse of everybody's saying I think we should use this money as quickly as possible if we have it because inflation is only going to kill it and we need uh to get people into into homes you know so to me I'd rather see projects sooner rather than later and unless anybody can figure out how to have virtual Farm Workers we're going to need places that people have parking for their cars so they can deliver the goods that we also uh eat every day so just wanted to say that thank you thank you counselor I want to coign in everything you just said I agree with it completely especially about the getting the money out the door sooner it doesn't do any good sitting in the bank we need to that's the whole point is affordable housing and we need to get these units built further discussion councelor nishioka thank you um I too I as I said I pulled this because I had a lot of questions and it was really understanding the project I'm now hearing that we are on a very tight timeline thank you for coming here tonight and explaining all of that to us and though it is not ideal um I do feel that um uh neighborly is trying to work out some of those details for transportation um hopefully some of the improvements that we make will uh also include um bike paths or utilization of some sort of walkability uh whether it's near Corbin or somewhere else um but I do feel that this project is something that needs to get done right",

        "text": " that when it comes back uh we can either accept that delay it or um or or or or rejected at time as an adequate justification so I just want to make sure I'm clear I I'm totally understanding what you're saying your ability to review this again won't be until the final order um so while we have this open right now while the council is reviewing the draft proposed order you can conclude that today you can say we still want to have a little more time to think about it and we'll put it on the next Council agenda but you need to be comfortable with your review of the draft proposed order and then specifically you know I agree this seems to be the most significant issue so you have to be comfortable whether you've had enough time to review think about it you know see what's currently written you know what staff's recommendation is in the draft proposed order whether you agree with that or based upon the comments and your own analysis you think some changes need to be made so that's why I want to make sure you know we can take the time to kind of go over that further right now Chase can continue to the end of this we can loop back around to that at the end of this agenda item today or again based upon you know some solid but preliminary conversation we can put this on another Council agenda and not conclude the council's review um and then focus on that more um specifically at a future council meeting so so that's entirely up to the council uh what you want to do with that but it is important that it's this time frame council's review of the draft proposed order you don't get another opportunity really until the final order um to at least make a conclusion on this yeah Patrick Ro J I'll just add to that were you to make a change at the final order uh that's a material change compared to the proposed order then we have to have a material change hearing so the ideal time to get your input is really now or if you need more time at the next meeting while that might you know push us back until the next meeting I suspect that that might in the long run be more of a timesaver than potentially having to get a lot of input from you after the proposed order at the final order stage that that could delay further thank you Mr chairman um yes councilor delin I found myself coming into this meeting having uh reviewed the staff report and the comments and the order and feeling relatively comfortable however in the last 20 minutes has people been talking been going back reading the moral County comments reading the U uh reading the applicants response reading this appal staff area and I I don't feel as comfortable as when I was coming into the meeting it's not that uh it's not that um I'm I'm saying that I'm not okay it's simply that I don't have the degree of certainty that I had before uh because I know the applicants response came in on June 11th which wasn't very long ago and I know that members um receive some of this uh just Wednesdays um so I do think in a sense if we're going to continue to discuss this it might be better to resolve this issue by delaying the council's consideration to a future meeting it might make our July meeting more probable but that's fine thank you councelor dein councelor Imes thank you chair how um I said earlier you know I had some concern um and I still feel that way um especially after um actually getting a chance to look at some of the comments um this morning and um I would also feel a whole lot more comfortable if I had a little more time you councelor berer just a quick comment it seems as if out of all the comments that we received and there really weren't that many comments comments the goal three exception comment is probably um at the heart of what we're still struggling with and if we could um focus our efforts on that section of your final staff report and if you can help direct us to the applicant's evidence as to that section um that would be helpful and I think we could have a more productive discussion that way I'm comfortable with the other comments and how you've responded to them um but this one seems to be a trickier thank you councelor Imes chair how I did have a comment because I did get to look at what was presented last week and um I just wanted to make mention of that the analysis was done by the same um company eco Norwest and so I know we're talking a about looking at other projects that aren't up to the same Pro in the process that we're at now but yet we're seeing that the same companies are doing the analysis work but getting but also presenting us different results which I I just have to make mention of I mean I think it's important um we talked about it with the Wildfire standard um to get to a um a more of a cohesive approach or you know a baseline Approach at least um with uh Wildfire plans and we mitigation plans and now here we are looking at um you know a goal three which is a really big mitigation plan so and something very new um for this Council so just wanted to make mention of of um that caught my eye thank you Mr chairman councelor Doan um take more time but can I get a clarification from counsel on an issue the goal three um is in essence being made by the council so that's reviewable does moral County have to go through a go through exception process also meaning if if the application was before Morrow County is that well if it was before Morrow um I think in our process from what I've been told before uh we have the authority in this area to you know Grant the goal three exception subject to review of course but if we Grant it moral County doesn't have to go through the same process right it's my understanding it's part of the side if the application were before the county would the county have to cons uh Grant a goal three exception that that's the question counselor I believe that is that that they would but I'm going to defer to secretary cornette given his experience with local land use issues yeah yeah thanks council member Devon for the record Todd cornette um so in this particular application you know the an applicant can either choose to go through in an FC project F SEC jurisdictional project the applicant can either choose local um land use review or Council land use review in this instance they chose Council land use review which means the entirety of the land use gets reviewed by Council including the goal exception process so in this project for this you know for this particular um element the goal exception is entirely within your review the county certainly can comment and they have but they don't not have the authority if the applicant had chosen the local government to review the land use the goal exception would be within their Authority and if the project was not FC jurisdictional but was of something you know in the range of this size um but not FC jurisdictional it would also require a goal exception so you have the 122 acre threshold for goal exception if it removes 12 acres of high value farmland or 20 acres of arable land it it triggers a goal exception so it the county would have to go through the gold exception process if it was their jurisdiction anyway so I mean the short answer is or any significant solar size project in the exclusive Farm use Zone a goal exception would be required whether that's done through the local government or through the council okay I thank you both for that clarification I just wanted to be sure that this wasn't a dual process uh that the council actually had the authority um and obviously the county would have the authority if the applicant had chosen to go that direction so right Council has so jurisdiction of the goal exception on this project okay um from a process standpoint you know it sounds like and just going back to council member buyers um As I understood it you were sort of validating maybe the desire to come back and and review the goal exception um I still think it would be valuable to continue with the presentation and to maybe uh dispense with the other comments and issues and then at the end of this you can let us know you know if that's still what you want us to do is to come back you know with the goal exception at a future council meeting which we can do um and whether that's the sole Focus or whether there are any other elements that you would like us to review as well but um I think probably um the other ones are probably fine but we can also analyze those but I would say recommend that we continue with Chase's presentation and then loop back around and then you give us your clear direction as to what You' like us to do yeah okay thank you cheers Chase for the record Chase mcve Walker and the the the last remaining five standards that I'm going to review um go through actually didn't have um ISS isues related to comments on them so they were just ones that I thought were unique or interesting so um next slide please for the retirement and financial um Council must find that a site can be restored to a useful nonhazardous condition following uh permanent uh cation of construction or operation of the facility and that the applicant has a reasonable likelihood of obtaining a bond or letter of credit satisfactory to the council and an amount adequate to restore the site to a useful nonhazardous condition and in their application the applicant estimates that the proposed facility's useful life uh to be 50 years in their application and uh the applicant provided evidence in the form of a letter from an FC evaluated and pre-approved financial institution specifically Wells Fargo Bank um to support their ability to receive an adequate Bond or letter of credit the letter from Wells Fargo Bank indicates that nextera energy Capital Holdings Incorporated has a revolving uh credit and letter of credit uh in the aggregate amount of just under $4.3 billion which um is greater than what uh the department recommended Council find to be the total adjusted cost estimate including AO contingencies and applicant contingencies for this facility which would be 30 183 and that that total amount which is bold on that se and the third bullet uh is what the department recommended Council find to be a reasonable estimate um to restore the site to a useful non-hazardous condition next slide please for the fish and wildlife habitat standard um this requires Council",

        "text": " aspect too you know some of the desired here though that we like building more room some potential constraints to growth so those communities and future Vitality in this community and then you would make any potentially being more so into the deaf criteria proposition for them doesn't even know I mean just like thinking yeah so you have the Administration I mean that's just yeah you know I mean we see so many communities that are you know their low population that they're absolutely constrained because they don't get the investment that they made in order to be able to do and I especially to see the amounts of the young people in this community so you don't even have obviously based on see Peter Potter it comes into play where you have too much of a matrix right to try to absorb you know so if you're looking at plan growth or anything then you have to start looking at the open Urban growth District or the you know land use commission plans or whatever and then you're starting that okay well how long a process do you want needs to be a simplified template you know based on a number of customers that are going to be serviced or upgraded because of the projects you know the cost of the project whether feet Meats the requirements that you're having the funding for you know then whatever other aspects that come into play but in my opinion you got to do a simple flight template you know and it's not just customers so some of these some of these mitigations here are you know it doesn't really matter how many customers are on that Miles and Miles of land the impacts of you know significantly higher right because of really good points and I could see with the you know if we if we choose to have a number of people who benefit as a criteria it's super simple number of people and now it's easy to judge between projects and it's a balancing factor of that of how you describe vulnerabilities in two or three selective criteria so that it doesn't get like you say you know too um you know how frequently does that line go down is that population that served even if it's only 100 people maybe they're cut off in a lot of other ways so that describing that vulnerability within the system I think could help lift those projects up and then certainly the liability and Fire Prevention side of things that's a whole other piece of it I think that we heard a lot about PSPs yes that that's gonna be built in to identify some of those think about those a little differently well one of the criteria getting a little bit of feedback that the two of you on the ends aren't very well so maybe just a reminder to kind of speak they can hear you though and me oh that'll help thank you I didn't realize not at all it might be only connected through this oh you know what that's for that yeah okay that's right I think just reminder to project yeah well one of the things is too is that you can take into consideration the service area for utility you know and then the number of customers within that service area and then that be able to give you a grid as to you know for the smaller utilities you know have as a higher weighted average than the others based on the number of customers in the service area that you're covering because yeah your distribution cost per customer is a lot higher and to maintain those or upgrade those is a lot higher per customer than it is for higher density areas so like PGE or ppnl you know they're in high density areas and do have rural areas but they're spreading across you know that large a much larger base of yeah yes very much and that's where identifying rate impacts as one of the vulnerabilities with service systems really yes service area yeah yeah those are great points thank you all right I think yeah I think we'll move on to the next section this will all flow all of this feedback is going to incorporate into the next section into the next one so we can continue this too all right so we're going to move into a discussion about these Community um this slide is kind of a resource slide and it's in a family of slides where there's about 20 more of this type of slide at the end of this presentation we probably won't get to them today but it goes through a lot of the federal guidelines and resources that we've been working on that we wanted to share and um let folks know that it's common to a lot of different Federal funding a lot of these Federal requirements to be crossover so these are the federal guide guidelines that are governing this particular project and a direct describes and states to administer Grant funds in a manner that prioritize projects with greatest Community benefits and they basis on a few core policy areas including labor and Workforce Community engagement Advanced and Equitable outcomes and implementing the federal justice 40 goals and um but again total will take care of a lot of these Federal requirements within this program just want to highlight for everyone in the room um Jennifer Jolly had one additional thought that it's important to consider a more medically vulnerable people in denser areas in terms of community benefit weight it's important so we're going to move on to the way a discussion about Community benefits and also some examples from some of our partners where we'll be able to talk about how these Community benefits might be able to flow through these projects and just want folks to keep these questions in mind as we're going through these examples how do we Define community benefits do you have examples of past projects that could positively Impact labor and Workforce how do utilities already Advance Equity diversity inclusion and access what more can be done in general what areas do you think Community benefit requirements about the greatest impact throughout Oregon and Falcon and Community benefits requirements in the program achieve the greatest impact and so I think this moves us into our project examples is that right that's the end in the end if you want to kick us off um as if you're in the room and we can invite others to participate as well this is um what we go through on a winter basis um just about every single year that's Frost buildup on our lines uh mainly in the company area but it's throughout our entire service territory last year we ended up losing 13 volts during and poor transmission Bulls during one of the um we we ended up having to get a cat to plow and to get to the Bulls we had we had approximately 23 people uh kind of power for nine days at one point every single one of our vehicles was was stopped until we got the cat out there to pull them out and then they ended up using the cat to tie off to to lower down the ridge as we were putting Bulls um but that's an example of of what ends up happening I gave this example a long time ago I wasn't around obviously but right when we first started building the system Billy Gentry was wearing superintendent he tells the story of losing 800 Bowls because once the frost had started snapping them and they were just like Domino's going down then so you shortened up your span we had points we have 300 foot stands now like stool on that yeah and once again um cost right no goals are spending and and that's that's one of the areas uh that is pretty interesting Wildfire tanks um you know is is where everybody's headed these days uh liability reasons right um more than anything else but we have the PSPs to to help mitigate those risks on that side during winter storms like we experience out there uh that's where we have people out of power for the longest periods of the time obviously because the storms that come through from lightning or anything else in the summertime are Party Fair pretty short in duration um these can last a month so in these areas where you get the most downage would you be up for one underground underground okay and it would so there's a double benefit there right there's there's the wintertime benefits and Wildfire at the exact same time um which are the hardest areas to get to yes great good yeah no see it's like you know so I mean you have your past history yeah yeah I mean that definitely would be something that you would include in The Matrix also I know there's a few more pictures yeah that we can uh go through it there's some more that just shows the build up again on the trees that my favorite slide is I think probably the next that just shows that building that's even on our set of stations uh but this is the one you can see it's that's not a power line right there that's all all right across and it's on the ground yeah nice and that happens just about every year we we have crews out ice scraping knocking lines to to try to keep it down but it it builds over max they're they're out working for their own shifts to try to keep it um from taking out multiple holes yeah you know this this particular issue brings up uh something that I hope we see in this program which is projects that address more than what hazard at once you know the fire fire hazard is you know something that everyone's thinking about but like you said this is a winter condition with icing but there's also a lot of winds and things hanging around those lines of some of the pictures so um you know there's a wildfire Hazard and a winter Hazard that don't get addressed seems like that sort of multiple Hazard mitigation could help lift projects in the competitive story yeah and and and at the end getting back to the points that have been made on on Healthcare and everything else um our our age population still lives on the barn right we're rural farming communities really everywhere in in their Aging in place which is really really nice um except when the power goes out and then they get cold in a hurry it's not just call it or it's they're probably involved right yes it's different than in our a lot of our Conservatory or water they still have water right when you use that piece of water that's just you know that gets that gets back to the entire point of the other thing we deal with on the fire mitigation side if you want to we're we're damned if we do more damage we don't we shut off power to these at-risk communities High Extreme biorist communities they lose their Wells when they lose their Wells they don't have water um technically if we shut off power we're going to get we're going to get sued either way um is is the way we look at it because we've shut off their ability to protect their structures the way they see it because they can't get water if",

        "text": " this is because there are Grant funds but also I am always impressed by how you are able to find so much grant funding and how we take advantage of it in such a fantastic way I know how hard it is to get and maintain grants and I just want to say once more how much I appreciate the work that you guys do to maintain our budget to the best of our ability and to do the most with what we have so thank you thank you we have a outstanding finance department that they work magic for me other discussion I'll just I I feel compelled to say that I'm unsurprisingly very excited about this I'm excited for the battery electric buses that's not what I'm actually saying but I I wanted to say that I'm very excited for this pilot I have every expectation and hope that this succeeds that this is a wonderful success but I also want to State publicly that this could fail and it's okay Pilots fail and that I want to State here on the record that if it does fail or if there are more challenges than we were expecting though I was very happy to adopt a new vehicle acquisition policy setting a goal for 2040 battery electric bus or zero emission vehicle adoption I will be the first person to make a motion to modify that vehicle acquisition policy if it sacrifices the level of service that we owe our community and so I am very excited to have cleaner and quieter and less polluting vehicles on the bus but are on our streets but first and foremost is the level of service every diesel bus is still cleaner than a single occupancy vehicle so uh just felt compelled to put that on the record there so uh with that all those in favor please say aye any opposed see no opposition although motion passes unanimously thank you next up uh security and emergency okay I'll ask Karen Garcia to come up our security and emergency management manager to present the report and members of the board this evening shall the board authorize the general manager to enter into a contract with PPC Solutions Incorporated for the delivery of Transit Security Services and approve a project budget of four base years with three option years for a total of 11 million dollars so as I'm sure all of you know we have contracted for many years now with private security providers to provide a security Presence at the transit centers and throughout our system to improve the Safety and Security for our staff and Riders and members of the community that are engaging with our business we currently have a contract with Allied Universal Security Services we've been in contract with them for a little over five years and that contract is due to expire May 31st of 2023. so as we prepared to pre-procure re-procure excuse me the transit Security Services we really did a thorough dive into the current scope of work it was written many years ago and things as you sure I'm sure you know our communities change our services changed we really wanted to make sure that we included in this scope of work everything that we would need for a security provider now and for the foreseeable future in our customer engagement surveys with riders the community and with our staff everyone spoke to the importance of Safety and Security while engaging with the system so this is important for all of the folks that are involved so with the review of scope of work we made decisions to increase the security Staffing at both of the transit centers to improve the presence of security at both of those facilities with that additional staff we will also be able to put security officers out in the system every once in a while to ride the buses which is going to be great I think we do experience problems out in the system now sometimes with behavior that we're Limited in being able to address because sometimes those individuals do not come to the transit centers where we have an active security presence the other piece that we added was a Mobile Patrol component and this unit will be able to patrol the service area in the urban growth boundary and help monitor Park and Ride lots and respond to problem areas like shelters that we have within our system so the final scope of work was written into the request for proposals that was released November 30th of 2022 the closing of that RFP was two months later January 20th of 2023 we received seven proposals that were all deemed responsive and in the packet it outlines the categories for scoring and the scores of each of the proposals that were determined at the initial scoring by The Source evaluation committee at the end of the initial scoring there were three proposers that were selected to participate in our interview process so in the packet also is the second and final scoring which includes the review of proposals after the interviews were conducted with those three proposers The Source evaluation committee determined that PPC Solutions Incorporated was the successful proposer for financial impact on this project we have accounted for security services in the approved fiscal year 2022 and 2023 budget and we will account for subsequent years in future budgets the total cost breakdown is in your packet it outlines a per year cost if we exercise all of the services that are in the scope of work I did not break it out in the packet but each level of Officer comes with a different billing rate obviously the supervisor is a different billing rate than just the average security officer and then with the Mobile Patrol unit that is yet again a different billing rate because of the vehicle service that's involved in that service but overall the grand total for the four-year base contract with three option years is 10 million nine hundred sixty five thousand three hundred and Seventeen dollars so the source evaluation committee recommends that the board authorize the general manager to enter into a contract with PPC Solutions Inc for the delivery of Transit Security Services and approve a project budget total not to exceed 11 million dollars Over a four-year base with three one-year options and I'm happy to answer any questions that you have at this time any questions for manager Garcia director Duncan thank you so much uh yeah I have a quick um the part you talk about including mobile security patrols and response to shelters and park and ride Lots when you say response what would something like that look like is that something that a transit officer would put in the need for a response or is that something that writers would request thank you for your question director Duncan typically what we see are the transit operators noticing people loitering in the shelters or Behavior like camping happens a lot in the wintertime it rains and people that are experiencing shelter problems you know they want to stay in our shelters because they can stay dry and warmer there so it does interrupt the service though so technically when The Operators see that they'll report that into our Dispatch Center and today because we don't have that mobile component our operations supervisors are typically dispatched and they are great skilled people but don't necessarily have a security background or have a lot of security training and so to reduce the risk to those staff members and really get the properly trained folks out there to respond to have those conversations we wanted to include a security component to be able to do that we also work closely with law enforcement because even our unarmed security staff are not going to engage the same way that law enforcement would so if it rises to that level of response we definitely will be calling for Salem Kaiser or Marion County to help support thank you very much for that clarification you're welcome director holmstrom thank you very much so you know one of the I think practically the only kind of concern that came out of the district's study or survey of folks to you know customer satisfaction survey the additional one came out looking just really great you know obviously one of the key the key issue was the Transit Center shelters and and feeling safe there and you know I think part of that is is what you've identified here is that we need to kind of beef things up a little bit potentially and so I really look forward to hopefully having folks who are trained and able to interact with folks in a positive way ideally when possibility not necessarily needing to use law enforcement when that's not necessary I think that's great this is I think it's critical for the district to be able to be successful to have safe places for people to be able to access our services so I really I think that's important so I just wanted to highlight that for folks um one thing I didn't see in here and I I you know it goes seven out it goes out seven years I imagine it's seven years from now we'll have the South Salem Transit Center up and running is there a way to make sure that we're going to be able to have stuff in there Beyond just what the mobile Staffing or things like that like to the same level that we would do Kaiser or is that not part of the plan or talk a little bit about what you think for that in the future Director Holstrom I agree if we have the South Salem Transit Center especially a place where there are a number of services there and especially if we have any kind of facility there for staff to lay over or for customers like a Lobby we're definitely going to need a security presence there in my opinion because we don't know exactly what that looks like yet I felt like it was premature to include it in this contract but we have the ability to do amendments we've been able to do that in past contracts so as we have a clearer picture of what the South Salem Transit Center needs are I think that we would work with the provider that we have in place at that time to to get the right services and coverage from security in place thank you yes you're welcome manager Garcia Could you um maybe talk me through PPC as a as an organization I I saw as I was reading about them a little bit they offer a whole variety of Security Services they're you know as a regional security provider they're fairly large they offer a lot of services I did not see any instance of them working with Transit districts necessarily and I just want to state that you know what we expect of our security officers is a little bit different than what a security officer for a different organization might operate and I just want to make sure that PPC is equipped to hit the ground running right from the get-go I think that's a great Point president um we actually were excited to see in their references that they did have a number of Transit districts that they do work with they're primarily in Washington they do not work",

        "text": " thank you I I will just answer that quickly we are planning to come back with that information to have it Incorporated with us within the CIP process it is currently on track for quarter four of this calendar year and specifically chair Harrington in the January to August time frame which is where we are now it's really that initial planning phase which is initiating those condition indexes inventory where we are now identifying some of those big processes so that we can then move in to more of a prioritization conversation with the I have a question yes ma'am and thank you I would in this question again is not for right now but I would also like to know as we move forward and I can't read that and I can't read this so it may be in here um is I'd like to understand how this is going to be incorporated into the budget process too so I think that's an important piece I it's it's clearly a highly needed and much anticipated but I'd like to just see how it fits in as we move forward very fair okay so we're moving on to David and facilities and Technology Capital correct all right so this again David Martinez uh assistant County Administrator I am as you can see on the graphic this displays this slide provides an overview of the facilities that technology Capital including emergency Communication System Event Center facilities and parks and information technology you can see the changes between FY 28 223 and 2324. one area that I want to mention and and bring attention to is that what's not reflected which are the critical maintenance needs in our congregate care facilities and Justice service buildings the board became aware of these needs last October and on April 18th approved approximately 24 million in arpa funds to pay for a portion of these critical due to the timing of the board's approval and the timing of the budget process the appropriation was not included in the proposed budget this will be added as an amendment for consideration at the meeting on May 25th you will hear more about the mechanics of this amendment from Greg later in the presentation and more information about the critical facility needs themselves can be found in the board of County Commissioner's presentation from April 18th on our County website I want to highlight that on the next on the next slide I will speak more about the Erp project and the Strategic approach the county is taking as well as additional its capital work in regards to the facilities capital as was mentioned just a little bit ago we're currently in the facilities condition index is currently underway and will be utilized to identify and prioritize existing and future needs for building equipment and replacement there are projects identified across various County locations they range from Service Center East Courthouse public services building parking structure and so on tenant improvements to improve work efficiency and effectnesses Effectiveness are proposed and these are in the areas in in areas including assessment and Taxation land use and transportation Community Corrections jails district attorney Washington County cooperative Library services and then in regards to landscape parking lot landscape replacement and irrigation repair is planned for multiple Pro multiple Lots as well as Courthouse sidewalk repairs on this slide we want to highlight the the enterprise resource plan or Erp as you can see from the from the slide graphic an enterprise resource planning system Erp connects critical business processes people and Technologies Technologies to enable effective organization-wide decisions the County's current Erp infrastructure operates on a framework that was a state-of-the-art when implemented over two decades ago while these systems have been updated several times the pace of technology and business change has outpaced Washington County's ability to stay current and provide real-time data for Effective decision making the county has begun initial phase of a multi-year effort and a presentation will be provided to the board this summer to provide an ovary of the project the scope and and budget this is exciting county-wise strategic effort an opportunity to involve departments to collaborate with the one Washington County approach other highlights I would like to share for its capital is the establishment of the it portfolio governance steering committee this year its introduced the it portfolio governance steering committee as part of the its capital projects prioritization process this committee is Central to the prioritization of I.T initiatives across the county the committee includes cross-departmental leaders who make decisions on I.T initiatives which have been ranked by several criteria measuring value to the county and the communities we serve members are driven by the one Washington County mindset serving the whole County versus just the interest of a single Department its worked closely with the it portfolio governments governance steering committee to determine to determine what capital projects could continue considering the seven percent reduction in the proposed FY 2324 budget Mr Martinez could you slow down a bit please can I ask a question how many people on that committee you know I will need to get you that answer that would be very helpful one other highlight that I want to note is a new position the information security officer ISO this is the County's first information security officer this position brings key oversight Focus to the its security team and will help build upon our existing progress in addressing cyber security threats as well as our overall security and I do I neglected to identify the department folks that are here and I just want to thank them for all their work and if they can wave from the back there we have its and Facilities folks and they can probably get me the answer for the number of people and then my other question is on the info security officer is that a human you're going to hire or a company consultant you're going to hire it's an individual that we we have hired okay good so even better very good all right all right yeah and so this last this last uh slide I will wrap up with the emergency communication system uh the emergency Communication System project was made possible by the voters who approved a general obligation bond in 2016. this project has likely been mentioned or updated every budget committee meeting since that time this slide provides a celebratory update for the Washington County Consolidated Communications agency or wccca which is the County's 9-1-1 Dispatch Center as it is nearing project completion thanks to the work of the Washington County facilities team as a project lead in partnership with wcca and the contractors the bond included funding for a new size of physically sound Dispatch Center and wccca has moved into that new facility located in Hillsboro with new and upgraded towers and the replacement of analog radios to new digital technology the entire system has been improved has been improved the project should complete this next fiscal year any money left or do you spend it all I spent it all probably I I will have to get you that answer um chair bowling we will successfully close out the bond okay good you gotta spend it all of course yes okay moving on to Transportation Capital uh the fiscal year 2324 Transportation capital budget was developed using current practice with the board's leadership and as we just mentioned we are building a new process for Capital Improvement planning and while we're building the on-ramp to a new practice we haven't quite accelerated up to full speed onto that new ramp yet total proposed capital budget for fiscal year 2324 is approximately 238 million with the majority of spending in the mstip program the total transfer from the general fund for transportation capital is approximately 48 million dollars which is a seven percent reduction the remainder of the appropriated budget here is the result of other transfers and accumulated fund balance other funding for transportation Capital Beyond general fund and mstip includes State funding grants Transportation development tax and the road fund that we discussed the other night all of these funding sources are breeded together to build out the County's transportation system there are 89 Transportation projects with planned expenditures for fiscal year 23 24 and this slide shows the breakdown by type many of these projects were identified as needs through the current mstip process however this shows all projects Transportation projects regardless of funding source nearly all projects include Ada ramps bicycle and pedestrian improvements and the 28 projects noted on this slide as Ada ramps and bicycles are Standalone meaning they don't have another significant Road Improvement associated with them the pictured photo is or the photo on the slide is the Elward Kruger Rhodes in Sherwood this project is at the closeout stage and was funded with mstip tdt Transportation development tax and funding from the Sherwood School cost escalation continues at an unprecedented pace and in all of these projects and is affecting all types of construction projects from our largest and most complex projects to sidewalk infill and our safe routes to school as you all probably know this isn't unique to Washington County nor is it unique to transportation for example the Willamette water supply program pipeline has doubled from the initial cost estimates on this slide you'll see all of the transportation Capital funds but as you mentioned projects really happen as a result of braided funding and the capital Improvement plan will make that more clear mstip is a capital program funded primarily through a general fund this is a collaborative process with cities and partners to identify Transportation priorities that are that are brought to the board of community Commissioners for approval the fiscal year 23-24 budget includes a seven percent reduction in the general fund transfer and while this is significant as I mentioned the bigger challenge by far is cost escalation in February Lut staff estimated that remaining that the remaining mstip projects would cost approximately 70 million dollars more to complete than initial planning cost estimates with recent project bids coming in higher than expected staff are revising these estimates and and estimate that actuals will be even higher given the unprecedented cost escalation and the reduction in the general fund transfer staff will work collaboratively with Partners to rescope projects and or delay projects staff are currently identifying projects that could be put in a parking lot so that projects that are underway or ready to go can be staff will be bringing recommendations to the board as part of the capital capital Improvement plan implementation Road Capital we discussed this briefly on night one these projects are funded by a transfer from the road fund and some highlights include what nearly 1.5 million dollars in Ada ramp projects throughout the county and nearly three million dollars in pedestrian finally Transportation development tax is a fund that was established to provide a separate program to account for resources made available by the creation of a new tax on development the tdt is collected from new development for use in building transportation",

        "text": " urban planning area agreement with city of Tigard also references the need for a tile flat extension and provision of Transportation infrastructure within their expansion area so these are ongoing conversations with City staff as they move through their process I excuse me if I just follow up there yeah if this board says that tile flight doesn't make any sense because of the topography the wetlands what's the answer I mean we don't have a solution to get to the North out of is there an alternative backup plan or is there nothing I I think that it would be challenging from a transportation Network perspective not to have that connection or at least not to be thinking in the long term 20 30 years from now what do we need in our transportation system so I think it would complicate those decisions and I think it could lead to some development occurring in ways that are impactful on County roads in a way that could have been avoided you're restating what I yeah the I don't know I'm still drawn that that's not the way we design things with design them to work and so trial fun doesn't work is there an other Alternatives I think that would get us to shows and I don't see it on anything maybe when I meet with Heidi they might have some something else I I might that's been my only question 82 as well as this how does it work so let's go back to process Ary so Tigard has gone through their concept planning process for River Terrace 2.0 and now they still have to go through their comprehensive planning process so uh they do have the opportunity to design the area of River Terrace 2.0 to go up to Shoals Ferry Road without trying to really ask this as a question though I haven't phrased it as a question but my understanding is that they have the opportunity to go through the comprehensive planning in a way that doesn't make them solely Reliant upon Roy Rogers Road which is the concern that you expressed earlier small matter of planning they're just starting their comprehensive plan process now and that will take um generally about 18 months to two years to get through a comprehensive planning effort and so we'll continue to work with the city and we'll continue to talk to them about various options um they do have plans for it's a little bit difficult with the semantics and I don't have the right Maps because they weren't talking about ordinance 882 today but they already have one one access point on Shoals Ferry Road in their concept the Mountainside Road Extension would be the north-south connection and that is so that is in the Board of Commissioners October 5th 2021 meeting packet that is fully available on the Washington County website it's just very confusing I mean it just they're asking to do the plan we're rushing ahead with 882 and it just doesn't seem like coordinated but that's just me right seems like we would have coordinated and not done anything until recorded with them well guess what with our process this ordinance would come before us October 3rd and that other ordinance would come to us and is coming to us October 24th so they are sequenced out but we don't know what Tigers going to do we know what they currently have in their adopted concept plan and we do need to give them time to go through their comprehensive plan they already told us that they don't their River Terrace 2.0 planning does not rely upon a tile Flat Road Extension so we needed to take them at their word so we're doing things in a logical and sound manner and we'll continue to coordinate with city of Tigard as they go through their process we have a seat at the table in their technical advisory committee meetings and we'll be bringing back more information to the board thank you I always thought planners were methodical and finding up accountants are even worse we always say well we want it all figured out you know before we jump into something but okay it's sometimes a bit of an iterative process and there's some back and forth and that's how this one has done commissioner Teresa 5 first of all thank you and I recognize that this is about the expansion here and I understand what you're saying but I saw this I think it's important to stay focused on that ordinance and um through mpac and through other other areas I've been aware of what's what's happening and I understand the the timeline that you followed so I'm in sport and I appreciate your your diligence in pulling all these pieces Aaron I I just have a quick question uh the slight before this and great presentation so far I think it was pretty straightforward but I think I didn't quite comprehend the two first bullet points uh first sentence and second sentence and I'm wondering if you could help me educate me on this Metro rules require interim protections until further planning for urbanizations and then so what is that those two sentence what do they mean so Metro's rules as far as the interim protections mean that essentially they want us to apply a holding Zone they want things to stay exactly the way they are today until city of Tigard in this case can complete their comprehensive planning and then begin to Annex the area so that any development that occurs Waits until it's fully ready to urbanize and be a part of the city now in the holding Zone you can do some things so if there's let's say a farming activity and they need to put up a pole barn right now they'll be able to do something like that so you can do some minor development within the fd20 area but essentially it says keep doing what you're doing but keep this the way it is today while the city completes their planning process and how does that correspond then the 82 I was trying to track that um it doesn't really so the interim zone is a land use holding Zone it doesn't really say anything about the comprehensive planning process itself or planning for infrastructure within the area so that's more a part of well we have it in the holding Zone Tigard is moving forward and doing their comprehensive planning and we're participating in that effort with them thank you commissioner trees I've already you've already gone and I but commissioner Willie has not yes he has he started us off so long ago I'm I'm last do I have any questions nope I'm all set uh I don't mind asking though has tigered position remained on on River Terrace 2.0 or have they sent staff any other letter um I'm not aware of any additional communication they've really been working out sorting out the funding for their comprehensive planning efforts so we've met with them on um almost a monthly basis although I think we took a little bit of the summer off in those coordination meetings as they've been working on their scope and schedule and budget and all that for the work they'll need to do for their comprehensive plan they received a grant from Metro and they've been looking for some other funding as well in order to do that work so once that fully kicks off we'll have more of an update we expect the concept plan will change somewhat as they move into comprehensive planning as usually happens but that hasn't happened yet yeah and I was going to ask you how long we should expect the comprehensive planning to take but you already answered that yeah I think about 18 months to two years but I haven't seen their final scope schedule and budget on their plans for that um I do know that they would like to move it forward very quickly they've been doing a lot of development work in River Terrace one the original River Terrace area and they feel ready for more and so they've approached us already and started talking about annexation and what that could look like for this area yep and uh four of the five board members had the opportunity to see the storm water and dream stream Side Restoration that they built out as part of River Terrace 1.0 and that was really impressive and I imagine no excuse me continue that fine work with River Terrace 2.0 it is very impressive what they've done yep yep so um I'm ready to move forward with the October 3rd public hearing thank you terrific thank you very much for all of the fine planning work that I know the three of you have put into this so um so we've come to the end of our work session agenda today is there anything else that uh folks wanted to have us cover before we close out today's work we're ahead of schedule so we will reconvene at our business meeting at 6 30 so this work session is hereby adjourned thank you",

        "text": " see my screen but just a couple different scenarios to to discuss so you've got like a situation where you've got multiple covered buildings of size and type behind the same meter um so in that scenario there's you know really a few different options that um that we're proposing in this you know through this through the Draft rules for compliance um you know if each if if each of those buildings has a Target um you know so say they're all covered and they all have a Target um that Target UI can be based on the weighted average um of those buildings based on the square foot weighted average if they're all grouped together um if the owner chooses to maybe install a submeter to be able to separate those out those buildings could comply individually based on their own um you know their own measures and their own euis so in that scenario an owner could could choose the submeter install their own submeter um but it wouldn't necessarily be necessary wouldn't wouldn't be needed in order to comply there's other Pathways there too so then it becomes just an investment decision for the owner if um if they want to put in a meter to comply in that pathway um then that's a that's a possibility too um so then there's this other scenario too where you've got multiple buildings and only some are um say somewhere under the size threshold or somewhere tier two so those buildings would have multiple options as well so you know one an owner could choose to include all the buildings gross floor area so both uncovered and uncovered building space um and their energy use to meet a weighted average eui to meet their target um they could install multiple you know energy conservation measures at uncovered and covered buildings to meet that eui Target if they're all grouped together so essentially treating treating it kind of as as one building but you know key and on the one covered building as its um as its primary compliance schedule and um and pathway and then there's another option too where you know if if that option to group them all maybe isn't the the best strategy for the owner they could choose to install submeters to separate out the covered and uncovered buildings and then of course only comply for the covered buildings um and then there's another pathway too that where the the owner could just choose the investment criteria for the pathway without submetering and perform an audit and install measures only for the only applicable for the covered building spaces um and then just a note here too that uh like in the the other requirement for energy management plans operations and maintenance plans would still only apply for the covered buildings too so um maybe I'll take a moment here to um see if there's any any discussions um or questions um after having kind of talked about uh these couple different scenarios for like buildings behind the meter so I think the key thing here maybe is that in in all these scenarios it's there there's flexibility for the owner to either comply as an aggregate building um or as an aggregate group of buildings or install the sub metering to be able to comply for uh just on individual covered buildings so yeah there let's see I not seeing any the oh there we go Clark yeah are you are proposing that all three options would be listed as a menu in one rule or are you asking which option we'd like the best or which oh yeah sorry sorry if that wasn't clear so um kind of as we're we're proceeding um for as if all three options would be included in the rules and available to a building owner for compliance um and in our you know discussions and um you know work with with Washington this is has been the Washington approach as well so okay and I had a followup question on Washington which was can you remind us what was I guess I care less what was originally in the Washington bill but what yeah legis a fix did they do with regard to these buildings that got us to this place where these are the three options just so we can understand oh okay yeah so um other folks that are maybe a little bit closer with the entire like Washington process start to finish might know more but I I believe that that some of these options to be able to like address these campuses of buildings were part of their legislative fix um in my the discussions I've had with Washington it was mostly centered around like what's the current pathway um I'm not exactly sure when these Pathways were were put into place but um I I think that that these Pathways were part of the the legislative fix so great thank you yeah uh Kevin oh I think you're muted thank you for that it seems like uh this is a great way to deal with this I don't I don't know what else you could do uh unless you want to be unflexible and require sub reading there have to be some other Alternatives so that that option one and three I think accomplishes that and um then an odor can weigh the cost and and and disruption of each and make a choice but otherwise I don't know how You' get there without those uh without these groupings yeah thanks for the thanks for the comment Kevin see I don't see any other hands raised or comments in the chat uh right now make sure I'll add something like just on some experience in Portland and yeah I I agree with Kevin I think that this is seems like it uh it gives flexibility to folks to install submers and then they figure out the different advantages of doing that or not um I uh a couple scenarios you will run into natural gas versus electric and so we have cases in Portland where uh there'll be a gas meter covering four buildings and then an electric meter covering two of those four plus two others and so I think you just want some way of describing that scenario that that could be considered one campus and we actually design that with a special like campus ID so we can kind of track that reporting and so essentially it's like it's not just based on one be the one single behind the same single meter but rather it could be multiple meters crossing over multiple buildings yeah but but the same concept right um and then right one other thing to consider here is ownership like the city of Portland has an office building that is on an electric meter with um uh two PSU buildings and um we own a we own a tower but we only own a portion and this is not an uncommon scenario by the way where you have the ownership of a building that it's a portion of the building and then the other ownership is another portion so then you have to figure out who the actual real owner is reporting and then uh we don't have a submetering of our Tower so we end up reporting with PSU so just just something else you probably run into similar kind of condominium type of Arrangements but it's it's less about that owner but I didn't know prot teally condom but um following the meter is the key yeah okay thanks um okay I'm not seeing any other com oh there's Ben go go ahead Ben yeah I'm just uh option one feels incompletely formed to me maybe a little bit in terms of how that's that's grouped so you it it would include all of the buildings behind the meter all that gross floor area and then me a weight weighted average um so if some of those buildings are not um I guess where is that weight at Aver how is that weighted average going to treat that because that's kind of an question as far as you know the legitimacy of this path in my mind yeah so I mean I think in that scenario you would have like say for example like a like a smaller office building with a larger office building or maybe a different type of maybe a different type of occupancy but it would just be a a weighted average of all the you know square footages and targets to come up with an entire campus eui Target and the you know the smaller uncovered buildings wouldn't weight as much in the toward the target just on the nature that they're that they're smaller um but you could feasibly make installations of energy measures at any of the buildings to help meet the meet the target if the owner chooses to to not submeter out just the covered buildings yeah and yeah I think that's yeah reasonable in terms of meeting our goals yeah I'm just that I think if we're going to continue with that we just need to kind of understand the detail of how we're going to handle those uncovered buildings in this weighted average and and maybe that's written into the rules already the Draft rules I haven't picked up on it but okay yeah thanks we'll make sure Uh Kevin yeah Ben's question made me realize I was reading uh the the not option two but group two there they are covered buildings they would be covered if they're bigger but I I realize what if you have like an agricultural building that's completely not covered right it's not about size it's just a category uh then then what is that Target might become an right yeah so then it becomes like um it it's easy when all of the buildings have a Target right right but for some buildings that are like a building without a Target like a building used without a Target if we don't have a target for that sort of a building then you can't generate a weighted average for that entire building right um so then then an owner would really need to follow either option two or option three um to submeter out the cover buildings or choose the investment criteria so gotcha yeah so where you've got like a bill without a Target in that group of buildings then it then that kind of removes option one sure from from the pathway cool thanks um and then I just wanted to address to so like I know we had also talked about so this we previously kind of these first two scenarios were looking at multiple buildings but there's also the scenario or you've got one building with multiple uses inside of it that could be tier one and tier 2 uses and this scenario is really similar to to the multiple building use but I just wanted to to bring it up to where you know you've got a scenario where you have maybe a building that has tier 2 multif family and tier one covered space um so in that scenario it's similar but you know building owner might choose to include the entire building area in the gross floor area and the energy use to meet an eui Target you know weighted a weighted Target for all the different uses within a building they can install energy conservation measures in the whole building to meet that to meet that weighted Target that's one one",

        "text": "good morning everyone and welcome to the Tuesday April 16th 2024 Washington County Board of Commissioners meeting clerk MOS could you do us the honors please certainly CH Harrington the Washington County Board of Commissioners also meeting as the board of directors for clean water services and all other County service districts is now meeting this regular session April 16th 20124 commissioner tce here commissioner Rogers here commissioner Willie here Vice chair f pres chair Harrington here thank you the next item on our agenda is Public Communication this is an opportunity for members of our community whether here present in the auditorium or online to come and speak before the Board of Commissioners for up to two minutes an individual clerk moss do we have anyone who wishes to do so we do Madame chair uh first up we have Addie Smith followed by Duncan Shields so Addie please come can anybody hear me okay hello my name is Addie Smith I live in Bethany where's the timer so that okay here we go sorry hello my name is is Addie Smith I live in Bethany I am speaking before the Washington County Commissioners the Washington County Circuit Court judges not only discriminate against and violate the laws of black defendants whom come before their court but also to the black attorneys that represent anyone coming before their Court the racism discrimination and violations of the laws is so bad that even the sheriffs in this County are allowed to behave this way all with impunity judge menaka is Mexican he is the equivalent in terms of racism discrimination and violations of the law as Justice Clarence Thomas he is the Mexican Clarence Thomas however the difference between Justice Clarence Thomas and judge Ricardo menaka is this there are codes of conduct and ethics that judge menaka has to follow he must follow and he is not both both judge menaka and Justice Clarence Thomas violate the laws of the state and of the United States respectively but menaka has codes of conduct and ethics that he simply must adhere to judge mchaka isn't the only judge in the Washington County Circuit Court whom violates the laws of this state with impunity judges Kathleen Proctor Eric bushe Brandon Thompson and others do as well with impunity when complaints are filed against them with the commission on judicial conduct the excuse from executive director Rachel Mortimer is that her office needs more funding to hold these judges accountable Rachel Mortimer should not be the executive director just like these judges must be voted out and I am going to start getting people registered to vote to do exactly that because I am not afraid of any of you or any of those judges and if you can't do your job you have to go thank you Miss Smith next we have Duncan Duncan good morning Commissioners thank you for having me my name is Duncan Shields I live in the unincorporated area of aloa and my issue today is livability with roosters I think this has been kind of a thing uh lately um but I've lived in my home for uh since 2015 and now my nextd door neighbor has decided to get a rooster and not only does it keep me up in the morning I work late at nights but it also U makes noise in the afternoons so um I was inspired to come here today because I had already contacted animal control which referred me to code enforcement which referred me to lending my voice as to what I could possibly do to express my concerns um I watched the video video on uh April 2nd of this year which was in regards to a gentleman that has the similar issue but it's it's more intense apparently he's got a bunch of roosters all over the place and what I'm here to do today is just express my opinion on what he said about the 200 feet Mark of uh within the the dense um Urban populated areas which is where I live and I wanted to tell you that I agree with that and I think that that's a good start with something such as this um I've never had to deal with this before and um it's kind of disturbing um I I have trouble sleeping most people do and I understand that um but it is uh annoying it's worse than a dog and uh dogs can be dealt with because you can call Animal Control if no if if your neighbor doesn't comply or doesn't want to work with you in any way but there's nothing I can say to the neighbor because there's no law against it within these Incorporated areas so that's all I wanted to say and I appreciate your time today thank you very much thank you m Shields would any other member in the auditorium would provide comment for up to two minutes on any count related topic give you just a moment to raise your hand start coming forward not see any one would anyone online via Zoom wish to provide public comment uh for up to two minutes on any Cal topic give you just a moment to utilize raise hand function not seeing any hands chingon thank you clerk moss and with that we'll proceed with today's consent agenda which consists of 14 items one set of minutes one item from facilities Fleet and Parks one items from it one item from assessment and Taxation one item from the county Administrative Office one from excuse me four from Housing Services one from Finance one from Health and Human Services one from H human resources and two from land use transportation what are the wishes of the commission move for approval second there's a motion and a second to adopt today's consent agenda all those in favor please vote by raising your hand or saying I thank you Commissioners any opposed the motion carries unanimously five to zero next we'll move on to proclamations and today we have two separate proclam ations the first one is to Proclaim April 22nd 2024 Earth day and we have some uh Department here uh hello are you James Douglas I am terrific thank you for joining us today to bring this to life absolutely it's good to see you all this morning uh good morning CH Harrington and board uh my name is James Douglas sustainability program prog manager I'm incredibly happy to be here to present this year's Earth Day proclamation to all of you and to give voice to all the Fantastic sustainability efforts taking place at the county not just from our office but more so from the Fantastic colleagues that we get to work with the history of Earth Day in the US is a pretty amazing one oh I've got a clicker I will use that the first Earth day was celebrated in 1970 to raise awareness for environmental issues it's an example of public support lead to bipartisan action including the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency the Clean Water Act The Endangered Species Act and updates to the Clean Air Act Earth is a worldwide celebration that occurs every year and just like in 1970 the why that Earth Day focuses on is an excellent reminder and is grounding for the work that we continue to do today these of course include the always important cleaner air and cleaner water but more so than just that it's about the people the plants the animals and the environment that benefit when we keep these goals front of mind even for those of us that work in the environmental Fields daily this is an excellent reminder of why we do what we do in recent months the office of sustainability has been working through strategic planning process that's occurring across the county and we're considering how we shaped sustainability goals that weave into the larger County Mission this is already somewhat in practice as we continue to work with a one Washington County approach in partnership with Public Health on our community climate efforts we are starting to expand this collaboration to support the incredible climate resilience work that's already occurring at the county in different departments such as Housing Community Development Emergency Management among others as we support these Community efforts we always want to make sure that we're leading and working by example with our amazing facilities and Fleet teams on energy conservation and management as well as Contin to incorporate sustainability best practices into our internal operations there's a lot of climate work and sustainability work going on at the at the county not just in one Department as I'm sure you gathered from the previous slide one step to a more cohesive one Washington County approach to this work is a central place for the community to learn about this topic in the next two weeks you can keep an eye out for a new climate web page that will allow residents to gain background information as well as resources on climate change such as tools to reduce energy consumption uh all the way to things uh such as hazards it also highlights County efforts across departments and provides information to those who may want to take steps on their own to improve resilience or reduce emissions I want to thank Highland with our climate and health team as well as Carolina from our sustainability team for the incredibly thoughtful work that they put into this project uh before I read the proclamation I want to make a few uh announcements on behalf of the solid waste and recycling team uh just to highlight some of the Amazing Earth Day themed events that they they have going on uh they're partnering again this year with the Westside Planet Alliance to host the annual Planet con event on April 20th from 11:00 a.m. to 2: p.m. at the Portland Community College Rock Creek campus they also have uh recycling collection there for items that can't go into the recycling bin at home and other fantastic sustainability focused activities uh they are also hosting an earth month online scavenger hunt that runs uh through April into May uh if you haven't had the chance to uh look at this you can download The Goose Chase mobile app to play online and win prizes and you can find out more information on the on the uh Solid Waste and Recycling page good morning um chair Harrington and board Marne Kyle I'm one of the acas and sorry I was a little slow getting I'm a little slow these days but um really um the only reason I wanted to come up was to introduce JT who you've met um James is how you'll find him in the directory but JT is what he goes by he came to us from Texas and um I just wanted you all to know I am just thrilled with what has happened just in the short few months that he's been here um and he also has an incredible partner Carolina um who um has been with the program for several years and um they are just energetic they are subject matter experts and we're going to see some really great things from JT with a small and mighty team thank you um so with that",

us absolute no choice in this situation the people who voted for you and chose you your constituents are not happy with this decision they are upset about not being today we are demanding to be heard and we appreciate you giving us that time if this Village is to move forward and many of us would like it to be in another location but if that is not the case we have three senior citizen homes we have a daycare in the neighborhood so many children we at least need to have some rules and regulations this cannot be a low barrier to entry camp we need background checks we cannot allow people with history of violent crime or sexual assault history in their background we do not want drug use either in the camp or outside of it there there needs to be rules um this needs to be a 24-month-only contract if we're going to have this in our backyard then the county needs to share the burden with us and have it moved every 24 months this can't not just sit in our backyard we're worried about the property being purchased and it being permanent um there needs to be people on site at all times at Hillsborough there are not people on site at all times like you guys are saying and you're not keeping the promises that you're making on a regular basis thank you thank you next we have Tessa Walsh and Michael Palmer again name and address if you could please hi I'm Tessa Walsh and live in thank you for the opportunity for us to be heard so as you can see we have quite a big support of people that feel that there's a better place for this Village that would be um both better for our community experiencing homelessness as well as us there are houses I don't know if any of you have visited the site there are literally houses a hundred feet from where this Camp is going in there are school bus stops all along 198th which are less than 100 feet from where this encampment is going in and to have a low barrier no background check no whatever in this location is just not there's gotta there's a better place for it does that conclusion remarks yes we would hope that you would postpone this so we could as a community find a better location for this this my name is Mike Palmer I am a business owner taxpayer homeowner Navy veteran I live about 500 feet to the front door of my house from where this proposed Camp is set to be put up the people who live in this neighborhood are invested in this neighborhood many people have been there for 10 20 30 plus years and have built a community and a neighborhood of friends neighbors and continually being fed to us is the words community and neighbors and that we need to take care of them but the people who are going to be brought in are not our community members they are not our neighbors they're mostly people from other cities other states and other countries and they just need some place to hang out and that's what they're trying to give them in the middle of our neighborhood that we have established and we've invested in they have no investment in it they have no concern over whether it's clean safe or healthy for the children or anybody else in the neighborhood the controls of these safe rest are set to be inside their fence but once they leave the fence and are free to wander the neighborhood no one has any watch over them they're put out to be trusted on their own this is basically unacceptable for a community with families and people who are looking for to continue living in a safe and friendly neighborhood and I would sincerely hope you would consider that before you move forward in placing these people into the middle of our community thank you next we have Barbara mcmains and Ed Mary bremmer and Shane Boyle start yeah Shane Boyle a resident of where is the public process been on this decision to set up a rest Village in our I'm only here tonight because of neighbors informing me of this upcoming board decision and I could find very little information on the County website to even research what this decision was about how it might impact my family my neighbors my government that operates in the shadows is not a representative democracy you're being asked to vote on something that clearly has not gone undergone an appropriate public process we're all witnesses to that here tonight what you're about to vote on is going to irrevocably change our neighborhood for potentially the next decade you know I'd like to ask you some questions to consider As you move into your decision later on tonight what process did you as a board use to identify that this is the best place for a rest Village did the board consider the future costs of bringing wrap around services to this fairly developed out location did the board evaluate if they enhanced Sheriff's Patrol district has the resources in this location to support arrest Village a low barrier shelter potentially could equal more crime that we the the residents will have to shoulder in future espd um costs passed on to us has the board considered the safety of the campers this location has no sidewalks on a busy commuter Road no Center turn lane and you know these these campers are not going to be safe just as well as the drivers who have to drive that road every day you know finally does the Methodist Church have the financial resources sustain this effort for potentially the next decade and if they don't would that bill be passed on to us to local thank you very much for this time Beamer my property backs up to the church the church knows me and they did not come to me and ask how I felt about this at all you call this a safe rest Village I will not sleep safely now okay having 30 felons criminals you know mentally ill people wandering my back fence every day I will no longer be able to keep my back doors open because I back up to the church and feel safe I checked into selling my home I have to my realtor tells me if I wanted to sell my home I have to disclose that there's a safe rest Village or homeless camp in my backyard basically so none of us can sell our homes right now because who's going to buy one next to that I was told I cannot put a fence up higher than seven feet by the county I'm left with no options here other than put up with 30 people felons criminals in my back yard and I'm the one that's not going to sleep one night for the next 700 days it's easy for you guys to check off a box of this is your to-do list you know okay you know this is my business I'm going to do this it's great you know hey it's great for the community but it's not great for all of us neighbors there's nothing great about this we're the ones that are losing I'm the one that's going to lose sleep every day I'm the one that isn't going to be able to you know live safely in my own neighborhood anymore worry about drug paraphernalia coming over for my children my grandchildren that come to visit you know my house is Where We Gather I'm not going to want anybody to gather anymore it's like I don't feel safe and how is that fair to us I work every day you know I contribute I pay taxes I just don't understand this logic that's all I got all right next we have Dan Baker and Alan Ballentine hello my name is Alan Valentine and my back fence will also border this proposed camp in fact I have a little bit of elevation to my home so my back deck will look right in to that camp one of the things that I wanted to bring everybody's talking about you know crime and I want you to understand what this neighborhood is I raised my children I have lived there for 30 years in this home I raised my children in a place where kids play baseball and basketball in the streets we live in a nugget a diamond of Safety and Security which This Will Destroy This is the thing that we're upset about I also as you can tell am a senior I have worked 30 years of Sweat Equity into my home so that I could sell it when I retire and move to a small community I will not be able to sell my house I have a four bedroom house what family is going to move into a house that looks a homeless shelter it won't happen so I am My Equity in my home will be lastly it's been mentioned you will be I believe marooning these people at this location there are no sidewalks there is infrequent bus service how is this a good place to put a shelter thank you very much good evening my name is Dan spraker I too live in Aloha I'm a neighbor with uh with Ellen and I'm also a six-year employee of Washington County so I work here as well so I am sympathetic to the current crisis and I actually voted to help on the uh on the ballot measure that was out there and I do applaud the work that the housing department is is doing we need to find homes for the house lists that are out there and I applaud their effort however I want to bring up one point that she made was geographic distribution there was talk about having them in Geographic dispersed areas but as Mr Marsh pointed out you have the Aloha in and in less than a mile you're putting in another housing Village in putting these these two sites together so where's the geographic distribution um I also want to talk about Community engagement you know it was very sad for me to see as a Washington County employee to see the lack of communication from the county to the residents of aloha we found out about this through Word of Mouth Facebook next door there was no engagement from Washington County until we heard about the the NIMBY meeting that the church was holding um earlier this month so we decided we were all going to show up there in force and make our voices heard um the other thing I'd like to to bring up is I I've read through the governor's emergency declaration as well as the attached executive orders nowhere in there does it state that it supersedes local ordinances or zoning laws this air this church is zoned institutional which strictly prohibits the placement of manufactured residences on their property how are we going to skirt that uh let's see here I think everything else has been said so I appreciate your time",

        "text": " to the department and council member for corrections of certain scrivener's and then we have fire protection issue left to resolve um the draft final order to review um um our next slide up is jesse sorry good also oh thank you yes um and so related to the um the draft final order review will be the opportunity for the parties to comment on to the department's order proposed order that are occurring as a result of the hearing officer's proposed contested case order so basically i've just walked you through the proposed contested case order you've had a chance to ask questions um you know state objections if you have any and so we're going to provide that opportunity to the parties as well before the council takes a final vote on um on the site so um up to the council members whether or not they want me to proceed with scrivener's errors at this point or if you'd like to dive back into the fire protection issue um it doesn't really matter to me we have the scrivener's error slide up if you prefer to prioritize the fire protection that's fine council anybody have a preference harry none jesse do it the way you like okay well we've got the slide up so i'll keep going thank you uh okay so um i guess uh um we have a very small number of scrivener's errors from both the applicant and the department and uh sarah if you wouldn't mind putting the let's go with the departments first because if i'm remembering correctly the applicants are mostly a subset of the departments um so let's let's start with them give me just uh 90 seconds so jesse this is hanley are you going to progress through this as we progress through the document or just go through the list that's in the february 10 uh memorandum i guess yeah um councilmember jenkins i guess my thought was that the number of um corrections were small enough um on the departments and applicants side that we could just kind of take a look at their charts here um if there's anything that's not self-evident from the chart we can we can go to the page in the proposed order and so if that's uh uh fine with you that that was the way i thought of proceeding whatever works i mean i minor minor strictly scribners i think and and um you know i just i haven't paper clipped on my hard copy here so okay well i will i'll go ahead then and walk through um the departments and the um applicants and then we can go through yours and on that on yours then we'll go through the the part of the proposed order put that up on the screen so that we can all see okay just okay so uh with the departments um on this page one of three here that's been pulled up on the screen um we have uh first just a misspelling of ms estherson's name the next one is um an acronym issue um so uh we have the lake county planning commission um and then we have the lake county board of commissioners um and uh the um distributors error is intended to properly identify who determined uh that the applicant properly inventoried accepted farming practices etc that was the board of commissioners not the planning council similarly the board of commissioners not the planning council determined that the site certificate application is conditioned to adequately address its potential impacts through proposed minimization and mitigation techniques another acronym issue um so according to the directory uh director of the it should be the lake county planning department not the planning commission next change is page 89 second full paragraph here it looks like there is a mistake using the word with instead of without as corrected it should read nonetheless the applicant does not request and the department does not propose the council grant site certificate for unmanaged construction activities without sufficient mitigation that's clear enough from from the context based on the hearing ruling on that issue moving to uh the next one here page 89 second full paragraph last sentence um i i think we just simply have a um an autocorrect issue um where the uh um hearing officer had described the um the applicant as a contentious community partner when it appears that he meant conscientious uh from from context um and uh um uh that the um appropriate phrasing at the end of that sentence instead of the applicable site certificates um we're talking about a single certificate um that really what the hearing officer was referring to was more generically the approvals so our next change again um this is to clarify um that uh um while the the applicant has other jurisdictional projects in the area um this is the first f sector's digital project request um and so um we're not referring to site certificates here um we're referring more generically to the other approvals that the applicant has uh so that's the list of um scrivener's errors from the department again we'll just do a quick straw poll here to see if there are any objections to any of those okay hearing none we will go to the actually jesse i have a quick question um with respect to the smaller um that the applicant has done and so what approvals were required of them so the primary approval in non-fsec jurisdictional processes is going to be local land use approval whether it's a conditional use permit typically would be what the approval is there depending on the project there may be other state permits that are required for example if there were removable hill impacts there would need to be a removal fill permit from the department of state lands um and there can also be um additional deq uh permits that might be required for a variety of things for storm water discharges um uh you know um really kind of any number of things uh there's a lot of potential permits there but again from the county's perspective from the or from the local jurisdictions perspective the the primary approval there is the conditional use permit and my concern there is that in our site application criteria may be much much broader and specific and that the um the meeting of those approvals not defined uh may may not be relevant necessarily to ours and so i was wondering if they just should be uh indicate what approvals those are you know it's a question more than anything else councilmember condon i um that is something of course that the uh department staff could take a look at the the the approvals that are mentioned will presumably have been described at some point in the record um you know the applicant was attempting to demonstrate that it has proven itself a conscientious community partner has been able to meet its obligations under those those local land use approvals or or perhaps other statewide permits um they would have submitted evidence to back that up i don't personally not aware of what that evidence is um but um i'm concluding from the ale the from the hearing officer's reasoning here that he reviewed um the applicant's evidence um and and found that it demonstrates the claim that they've made about their status as a community partner for example or their ability to operate within the parameters of their i should say at this point that it's a um it's a requirement of the site certificate applications as part of the organizational expertise standard that applicants come forth with any permit violations um that resulted on their other projects right i just knew that the the um the applicable site certificate was not wasn't certain that the that those approvals was specific enough so that that's fine okay so uh then we'll move to the applicants scrivener's errors were good okay so the first couple changes here are misspellings of witness names pretty straightforward the third was having a cross-examination witness missed in in the list there and so another person who did appear and was cross-examined and then the final one again is the same change that the department requested concerning the autocorrect error here contentious versus constant inches so does any council member have any objection to any of those scrivener's error changes all right thank you um so then councilmember jenkins let's move to you and uh sarah if you could just go ahead and pull up the proposed order i uh our proposed contested case order sorry i and then we can go through and take a look at those page 30 and ask that kellen and sarah kind of help me with these to make sure i'm alterations to this can you advance to page 30. okay so in 112 there it is yeah so the second sentence mr n i kind of thought that that was supposed to be uh nicholas johnson instead of n walls nicholas johnson is resident of lake and the current executive director of mr n walls i don't know who he is also has prior experience with applicants through the development of others solar projects was that supposed to be nicholas johnson in that second sentence i can double check i mean it seems like it makes sense but i can double check this exhibit reference if you'd like yeah i think we ought to be accurate there then advance to page 62. some jet gym walls jim or james walls testified at the cross-examination provided the declaration as an applicant declaration of jim walls founding director of lake county resources initiative lrci okay that probably should have been a separate finding then because the third sentence then says mr johnson's experience so i don't know you know there there's not a linkage there between the three sentences sorry wally can you hear me i just want to be able to mark your edits as we're going through them and not sure if i know how to do that easily let me just work it there i'm making note of them as well okay all age 62. under uh opinion yeah so um the first word there i think is and then i don't think you need the last word in the sentence generally it's a repeat page 84 be the bottom of the second full yeah so the the oregon administrative rule reference there um 345-002 i think that's supposed to be dash 022 because that's the section we're talking about all the way through this part of the discussion so you might check that and this is real picky bottom of towards the bottom of the page where it says related to economic development comma i suppose supposed to be states s t a i think that's it all right thank you councilmember jenkins and i'm um assuming that there are no concerns with those modifications from any other council member we have now reached the part where i i think it is um appropriate to revisit the um fire protection issue and language because the next step beyond this would",

        "text": " go away they build wiring harnesses and put our kits together and then they're sent back out and then they the installation and uh the discovery phase and insulation is right now tentatively eight months to 10 months and then there is uh two to four months of testing so there'll be you know September end of September of 24 we should be at system acceptance thank you very much appreciate it you director Duncan I just have a little question um so for the kits that you're talking about knowing that 12 months we may or may not acquire more vehicles in that amount of time um will that be something that eventually goes when they're building the buses or will those always be something that we kind of have to add on before we're going to have those buses in circulation that um thank you for the question um yes so we we could certainly purchase separately we could use from the spare spare parts ratio that we have built into this what they proposed and we would have any vehicles that are surplused and not replaced which can't think of any ever but if that were to happen then we would just put those those parts on the Shelf if you will and reuse those but it certainly not uncommon if we were to come back to the board and say you know well first you'd know because we're coming to the board asking for six new vehicles to do these awesome new routes then we would also need the equipment to go away those after we received the buses and they would get put on here at our location rather than like with or something so when it well you can do either so like going down to Gilligan and seeing our our Fleet you can see buses that have all of the equipment installed at the factory that's one way to do it I know that our maintenance manager usually has them pre-wired because we usually will swap the equipment out of a decommissioned bus into the new one but if we were to buy the equipment outright you know I'd have to confirm with Greg in maintenance but we could probably have that added to the price of the bus and then work through that acquisition thank you very much I was saying a lot thank you thank you thank you director thank you president thank you very much Chief Operating Officer Dietz um so I I'd just like to maybe reflect back that this was actually the first action item that I and it has been a I will catch it this way I'm excited to see progress on on this um now in my fourth year I I do have a series of what all couches due diligence questions the the first of which is and this is purely from an outside perspective but one of my I'll call it a hunch of what might have not succeeded in the past was that the source evaluation committee previously was not robust enough now I know you weren't here and you mentioned that this Source evaluation committee featured 12 people I'm I promise I'm not quizzing you just a quiz you but could you maybe talk about who those people are or where they live in the organization because as you noted its touches a whole lot of different things and so I'd love to hear that certainly thank you for the question uh vice president Davidson uh we chose representatives from Finance planning I.T maintenance operations marketing just about every division had one or two because of that as we transition to implementation team provided this is approved by the board We'll add even more representation on the implementation team because now we're talking about representation from customer service and from Business Services which handles a lot of our entity reporting which this system is critical to get that data thank you could you um could you talk a little bit more about the operations pardon so I I of course value marketing I think marketing is essential now I also recognize that marketing may not be as dependent on IDs as operation so could you speak to maybe who or where in operations because I know it's a it's a big area yeah thank you for that and I apologize that's that's my Camp so it's all everyone's in operation so yeah so that includes maintenance and transportation um and uh contracted Services is also in operations but they he Ben Sawyer who's our contracted services manager will be involved because we're installing we would be installing this system on the regional Fleet um not the Paratransit Fleet they have the another software so it if they touch a bus or do anything that has to do with a bus and what it does they'll be on this implementation team they may not sit at every meeting marketing probably won't won't be impacted by the by the installation but everyone will be in in in the know if you will so what um what I told the team at our debrief is that there will be absolutely crystal clear transparent communication all the time nobody will have to wonder what's going on with this project great and did on the source evaluation committee was an operation supervisor like a Don Clifford was were they involved in the source evaluation committee yes yes they were great okay thank you that um that is wonderful um and I I know uh Chief Operating um Dietz you and I we've communicated by email about this but I'd love to get this on the public record so I noticed that IndyGo based in Indianapolis Indiana they contracted with the veil Technologies and uh in a news report it was reported that one of the Hang-Ups in the implementation of one of their bus Rapid Transit lines was two contractors one of which was Avail Technologies could you speak to the the reference checks that you did is thank you for that so we received uh five references from Avail Technologies and six references from uh the other finalists equines I received an additional one that was not in the list and we spoke to all but it was incredibly difficult to get communication with these other properties excuse me um so the Indigo the Indigo I read the article I can't really speak to that because sure when it was before I joined the district but it they were not on the list so I would not have known to call them exactly um but the reference checks we had a series of questions that the entire SEC contributed to and they were very specific and there was a reason why those questions were selected to ask we had a what a vested interest in knowing their answers to those specific um and then you know I could not stop them if they offered more which I'm happy to say there were real no real surprises in the information that we gathered from that great thank you um I I obviously don't work in this industry but they're depending on the industry there's a sense when doing reference checks sometimes of my mom taught me not to if I don't have anything good to say don't say anything at all is that did you number one did you get that sense from any of the reference checks and then number two is that common in this industry so thank you for that um I I'm I'm not in Human Resources I probably would not survive in Human Resources I'm thankful that this was not a job reference check because there are certain questions you can ask certain you can't um these questions were our questions to them and they answered um and I I don't want to speak put words in the mouth of the SEC but we were comfortable with what came out of that I felt they were candid answers we did get additional information that um solicited I guess uh and you know they were real about yes we we had a struggle with this or we had a disagreement on this and um but if they've kept a company for 20 that speaks um uh I don't think a district would um grind it out for 20 years if they weren't if they weren't happy so um and that's that's what I want to be perfectly clear with with this board as well is um there is not a thing as Perfection it's a software system and you're getting a lot of components to talk together and some don't play nicely together so it it's a constant juggling but I am extremely confident and proud of the team that is at the table today and I I feel that we've got great success coming because of the team that's that's been assembled for this so yeah it's it's a little nerve-wracking because uh one it's it's a big project and it's it's a lot is resting on whether this system works in our in our inner transit district and to that point and I want to acknowledge that you're absolutely right this is a incredibly important project as director holmstrom mentioned this will allow us to achieve many of the goals that we want to achieve as an organization but in a high pressure high stress situation like this when a lot is writing on it I I am afraid that in circumstances like that individuals are not ready to let a procurement or a source evaluation fail was that a serious consideration for the source evaluation committee like were if if you were not comfortable with a veil or any of the other applicants were you ready to let this fail and and I say that as a good thing to fail and try again like if you're going to fail fail quickly is my general feeling So yeah thank you for that question that's an interesting one because I I remember coming to Deputy general manager uh Trimble and saying I think I'm trying to be too careful because I wanted to get everything right which caused a delay you know and we talked at Great Lengths as an SEC about that very thing and we're living it right now we're we're living in um the IPS world so I will say that only to say going into this the the the first solicitation that this District had no experience with an its system a central its system now we do so it's not going to be um wandering in the wilderness um and um you know trusting the guide that said it'll I'll be there for you um this is this is we have this experience so it might look a little different it might sound a little different but when um and having gone through this at other places once the staff get into this they're going to say oh yeah yeah that's what that does um and they won't be afraid um but back to the back to your question I I believe that if if the group was not comfortable with anything that we I believe we would have been comfortable enough to to come back to elt and say we don't have a winner yet but we saw we saw some great things um promising things throughout through this process and um avails a known entity in North America a few decades so I I do believe again a lot rests on",

        "text": " notice that when we did the co-benefits a lot a lot of the high greenhouse gas reduction amount actions were actually ranked in the top 10 of co-benefits only remember this is just the three the 45 points associated with health and jobs and economic Prosperity so and then the uh other two other three uh three other ones were in tier two and the seventh and eighth uh co-benefit ranking ones were the least uh or the lowest in terms of greenhouse gas emissions so uh because of that fact number seven and eight uh we didn't feel like they should jump up into tier two because they are such a low amount of greenhouse gas emissions associated with them so because of the co-benefits ranking it's pretty much sticks with uh the original tiering and so we didn't suggest any changes or recommend any changes to the tiering based on cost next slide please didn't get made based on co-benefits amazing yeah I think we're cost to benefit on cost of benefit uh cost Effectiveness Centric yes based on co-benefits thank you chair thank you and the next slide is we did look at the tiers based on overall the holistic approaches as commissioner after said on the overall score of evaluation criteria scoring and we put in the top 10 in in that are the numbers above the bars again uh and it's not surprisingly you waited greenhouse gas emission reductions is a high part of the of the um scoring and and of the top tier one you saw most of them were in the top ten uh two of them were in the top um in tier two and then the ninth one which was food waste program uh was the ninth most highest scoring one and and the rest of them were not in the in the top ten and so we the recommendation that we had that one that stands out is moving again having food waste move from tier three into tier two X graph please that then we looked at um uh Federal funding while so we don't know what the federal funding is exactly for all these things it's still very much in flux and very much still being determined by U.S department of energy and so we can't apply specific numbers in the graph and beside that while we were doing the scoring and ranking is when the IRA passed in Congress and so it was pretty uh 11 59 in terms of the the timing of of that information and yet even if we did try to do that we don't we don't know what how to apply those to determine the the the cost Effectiveness change in in some of these things um or implementation dollars but what we did then look at was of the actions that we have identified in this analysis which one of them which ones of them have the potential to have Federal funding and we noted those by the dollar symbols above the bars and what we mean by federal funding is there's kind of two parts to the federal funding and Ira there's the tax credits which are individuals can get a tax credit if they do this certain action so that could affect any a lot of these actions or there's a direct programmatic funding so like the homes in here 113 million dollars is for the first two is going to is is direct funding to do weatherization both in the in um uh commercial in in residential and also rooftop solar for some of the greenhouse gas reduction amounts so if it had tax credits or direct funding uh we put a dollar sign above it what's notable is that almost all of them have um have Federal funding available to them and um uh so the there's a couple of notable exceptions and in the memo you talk about why they're they're not being funded but uh and two of them being the reducible area and higher residential density we didn't see how there was a direct Federal uh funding for either those at this point um and so with that there wasn't much change in terms of Federal funding impacting our tiering except for food waste which we thought should move up from tier three into tier next slide please Zach and so finally what we did was they looked at risk and uncertainty and scored those those numbers of the of of risk and uncertainty showed up as numbers above the bars there were a lot of ties uh so there was clear one and clear two and then I think there were six or seven programs that were actually uh tied at three and then it jumps down to like nine and or dumps to ten so the top 10 are listed here but there's a bunch of Threes because they're all tied in terms of their score so again we didn't feel like uh this analysis and this wasn't one of the ones that the commission recommended using to to do prioritization so we didn't feel there were any changes to the recommended recommended tiering uh based on this analysis next slide please so this slide actually shows the the all of the actions and electrification scenario um and the in in in rank order by greenhouse gas emission reduction amount so the very first one so it shows the hearing that we said in that graphic tier one two and three tier one is the ones that are highlighted in green tier two are the ones highlighted in blue and tier three are the ones that are white uh and this graph does reflect moving the food waste program as recommended from tier three into tier two that otherwise be a white colored action and then the other uh one that is recommended moving tier 2 is the energy storage uh increase of 25 and that is because of the fact that we already have an operating program uh the that photo operates the solar Plus Storage program that current currently gives incentives for people to do Residential storage and so that would be easily super easily bundled with the solar action which is number two on the list because it already exists so the ease of doing that one and the fact that we already do it means it's it's readily it's already being implemented we have to do a whole lot uh made that recommendation go from tier 3 to tier um finally I just point out that there on the little table to the right uh by by action category most of the actions that are in this list are Energy Efficiency 16 out of 27 so um more than half 14 are building Energy Efficiency six are related to Transportation four are related to renewable energy two more industrial Energy Efficiency and one is related to waste the food waste program and then um one more slide that there are also uh several of these actions that um Merit more a further study before they can be fully implemented we already know how to do a lot of this stuff we know how to do weatherization we know how to do rooftop store we know how to do energy storage and residential sectors so there are a lot of these actions can easily slide into an existing program where we already know the pathway we already know the delivery mechanism or and and they exist so a lot of those move forward but there are several in here that that need more development before we can develop the action plan to get them towards implementation and these actions either don't have an existing pathway or their delivery mechanism or technology is not as as certain or as underdeveloped and so the the those actions uh need to be made a high priority in terms of development uh towards getting to an action implementation plan and and they're listed here as it relates to two two and tier three actions and and uh those and as part of the recommendations that we'll be doing in the in the later part of the meeting uh recommendation 5A for additional global warming staff and part of what they would do is to actually figure this out a little bit more so they can get towards an action implementation plan uh and and and be able to move them forward similarly there's a couple of these that we had that we didn't uh have uh sufficient information on at all to uh to even score and rank and those were uh the the uh industrial electrification action and making transit buses all EV by 2035 and 50 of off-road vehicles all be EVS by 2035 we just didn't have enough information those also would be in the in this in this grouping Ellen to go backwards Point yeah I just wanted to explain we could go through this analysis again for all of the electrification stuff and we can do that in it with more brevity but we can do that after or before this kind of uh conversation we're about to have uh on I just wanted to point out you know you've got um reduced the residential floor area and higher Urban density as needing more study and yet that sounds a lot like the climate-friendly communities I know I'm not getting the name of that program right but you know considerable effort has gone into thinking that through so I I guess I question whether why those would be things that take more study um but yeah director Bateman and then same thing with congestion pricing but uh is doing some additional study that they're going to be doing over the next year to help design that or finish the design so maybe it's fair to leave it there but it's you know well five years you know into the program at this point right and talking to the folks on the last Point talking effects at uh ODOT some pricing has had a lot of work and thinking about it um and actual Pathway to deliver it and putting it in place is not there um and and uh so that is something that they're going to be working on quite a bit and the program you're referring to climate and friendly Equitable Community cfac if you like acronyms is something that the the DLC or lcdc put forward and put those those goals and and rules forward to communities I know as a city councilor in Eugene um we've got those sent to us and um they landed with a big uh question mark that uh we don't know at the local level how to actually Implement that there's a lot of study for just for Eugene the estimate was it would cost a million dollars just to figure out how to implement that rule and it will take probably a couple of years so there's still and and that's exactly what this is saying those things need to be fleshed out more before they can be actual uh action implementation plans that can be delivered and that can deliver greenhouse gas reductions director Bateman do you want to respond yes um our staff is happy to to um I think collaborate and work with you on um that we certainly have um the guidance and the resources here um",

We will mirror that as closely as possible in order to stay consistent, but it will be between the hours p at 10:00 p.m. and 07:00 a.m. i'll second that. I have a motion. I have a second. All in favor? Aye. Anyone opposed? Motion carries. Can hold. Before y'all leave, I question no, but great. We'be done in just a minute. You can stay and we'll only be a couple more minutes, then we'll be finished. And you can certainly ask. But I just wanted to say hopefully you could read what we were saying. It's still kind of up to you guys. And they're going be know they're going to be held to standards. Their standards and our and have been more agreeable than most, I will say to spending money to try to alleviate some of those situations. But you guys want to sit down? We're getting ready. Mister cruteiter is getting ready to adjourn a meeting. And you can. I'm sorry. I know. And you guys are welcome to one on one in case you want to, you know, have some conversation afterwards. You're welcome to do that afterwards. If you have any questions for staff about a special use permit because it's pretty restrictive. So the language of Vebge that went into this. You'll have an opportunity if you want to, but at least you can talk with the Howards. They are your neighbors. And you know, most neighbors do want to try to get things worked out when they're not in agreeable. That's up to you. But we have to continue our meeting. If you want to stay, you're welcome to stay. Do I have any motion to approve the minutes? I make a second. Who made the motion? I apologize. Make the motion you said. All in favor? Motion to adjournm. Move. Motion. I have a second for adourn.",

        "text": " this study due on september 15th of 2022 next side please i mentioned earlier that we might have some guest presenters and they're largely taken from this list of entities that were listed in hb 3375 odo was tasked with gathering input and consulting with these organizations and as you can see the list is comprised mostly of intergovernmental subject matter experts that are involved in work activities either directly or indirectly related to floating offshore wind next side please this is a timeline of the overall plan for implementation of the we're currently at that green highlight public meeting number two i mentioned earlier that we're also inviting um additional feedback in written form by april 22nd uh we plan to have a final meeting um in person on may 11th in in coos bay so a little bit more on that in a moment and um additional written feedback would be welcome after that as well and the final report is due september 15th next slide please so some reminders of the topics that were surfaced through the literature review and which we've been discussing in our meetings so at our last meeting on march 10th uh that's that list of sighting and permitting port infrastructure sea vessels economic development equity local reliability and resilience were and then today we're focused on five other topics that surfaced from the literature review about clean energy targets floating offshore wind technologies transmission energy markets and state and regional we were hoping for comments on that first list from public meeting number one on march 24th but we actually haven't seen any new comments come in about those topics we did have a few technical glitches on our portal not sure if that's the reason why but um we are sort of welcoming um comments and written form on any of these topics by april 22nd so please don't think that you can't provide written comments on the earlier topics um we welcome those as well next side please and then uh we have heard interest in an in-person meeting for this study um out on the coast so we have reserved the mill casino on may 11 at 5 30 pm and we'll be providing an overview of the study's preliminary findings which is in part why we're hoping to get that written feedback in advance to inform those findings as well as hearing any public comment on those preliminary findings so um this is this is kind of a new date mark your calendars we'll also have this on our website and we'll be sending out information over email to remind you next slide please so as i mentioned before our overall objective in this study is to gather and synthesize a range of information and perspectives on benefits and challenges of integrating up to three gigawatts of floating offshore wind into oregon's electric grid to inform a summary of findings in a report to the legislature including opportunities for future study and so the focus of our meeting today are on those specific topics i mentioned and my colleague jason will be sharing common themes of what from the literature as well as the comments received so far to give you a sense of the perspectives that have been shared with us and what we've heard uh we don't want to assume that you've gone through and read all of the literature or all the comments so consider this synthesis um our our way of trying to share that with you so that you can provide additional perspectives let us know if something's missing or if there's a gap or if you'd emphasize something differently we'll be prompting you for that additional feedback that additional um when we pause at the end of each topic so um you know we're hoping that we can structure the agenda in a way that we focus on those topics as we go along um so keep that in mind when you're providing your additional input next slide please so while i mentioned that we didn't get any additional written feedback by march 24th we did get a lot of feedback before um 22 different commenters provided written feedback from a variety of perspectives on our comment portal um you can read all of that feedback on our comment portal the slide gives you a sense of the comments received so far from who and i'm gonna pass it to my colleague jason but before i do i'm just gonna the chat here um to see if there's anything new that's come in on how to provide feedback or any of these sort of big picture items on the bill i'm not seeing any questions in the chat or any raised hands yet okay well i'm going to pass it to my colleague jason to get us started on the first topic 100 bye jason hello everybody welcome to our second uh let's see here yes our first topic for today is 100 clean energy targets so before we launch into an overview of the feedback we heard uh on this topic i thought it'd be good to do a quick refresher and share some analyses projecting with the ballpark scales renewables necessary to achieve clean energy targets could look like in the future here on this slide we see the clean commitments that are in place and grown across the country when we look to the pacific northwest we have the state of washington committed to 100 clean by 2045. idaho's largest utilities um idaho power and vista um committed to 100 clean by 2045 and the adoption of house bill 2021 here in oregon um last year committed the the state's largest utilities and electricity service suppliers um to 100 clean by 2040. so outside the pacific northwest we can also see neighboring states of california and nevada have clean commitments california aiming to be 100 clean by 2045 in nevada to be 100 clean by 2050. um so a bottom line takeaway here is that oregon many other states are looking for more sources of clean and renewable energy this slide here gives us a glimpse of what has been in the pacific northwest for renewables over the past few decades looks like we have about 11 gigawatts total of solar and wind onshore wind is the big blue uh the big blue graphic here about 10 000 megawatts or 10 gigawatts of wind and an increasing amount of solar in recent so that totals up to about 11 gigawatts so this just kind of helps paint a picture of where we're at these and i have some numbers on the next graphs numbers however you want to look at these that are all from the work leading up to the power council the northwest power consoles 2021 regional plan um power plan and the next slide can zoom out a little bit here to the entire western interconnection so all the west wide states and this this analysis was was in their recently published power plan and and it incorporates renewable and clean energy policy requirements from western states and uses the council's baseline price forecast um to put together this uh projected estimate of what could be built um based on that price forecast um just with today's knowledge um looking into the future so this isn't necessarily a representation of what will get built and the power council refreshes its annual power plant analysis every every few years and goes and cycles so the data is constantly changing but for now uh this is a quick snapshot just to show kind of the scale that could come our way um the orange and the colors indicative of solar and solar plus storage i tried to highlight there's two shades of wind there's onshore wind and offshore wind the darker green is the offshore wind that shows up in this forecast and it's hard to see exactly how much that that grows to by 2041 but but we can see that it's projected to potentially come online or could come online um around 2030 just based on cost estimates not necessarily factoring in you know what we talked about at last last month's meeting port development transmission infrastructure needs and and other kind of longer term projects that might be needed to enable and accommodate offshore wind um a big takeaway from this one is can it all get built in time that's a pretty big number you know you put that 350 gigawatts roughly of renewables in context with what we have today which is what about 11 gigawatts from the last and then a couple other numbers for context would be um the pacific north northwest region today with all the hydropod projects you know the all the renewables natural gas call the nuclear plant the few nuclear plants we may have um that's 60 gigawatts in the entire west wide state region is about 260 gigawatts so um we have another slide coming up that shows a projection of of what we might need in the pacific northwest region but these are big numbers and so that's kind of the big takeaway can it all get built in time um so kind of picking picking apart that um last chart with the colors of the rainbow there we saw the orange and the red for solar and solar with batteries this this slide kind of shows um maybe some of the rationale for that um it shows the average annual solar output across the western states and you can look at oregon and then you can also look and see where oregon falls at different times of the year and so you know seeing a bunch of colors on that northwest power console slide means that there's opportunity for a lot of diversity and diversity could be critical and probably will be critical to meeting meeting our clean energy needs so here's here's uh some more information on solar in the region and then here's a i thought it would be a good slide to look at wind both these graphics are for you know wind on land and in the offshore environment there the chart on the left shows average wind so irrespective of kind of the value of what those wind speeds might be for the power grid and then the chart on the right shows an estimate of kind of how the power grid could value these offshore wind resources in addition in addition which also shows kind of respective relative values for the onshore wind and so you can kind of look you see montana and wyoming have a lot of uh high quality wind resources and then what jumps out uh closer to oregon and in the offshore environments is those strong indications the heavier dark blue colors on the left and the heavy dark orange colors on the right for southern oregon and northern california offshore wind so again this is a part of a diversity approach there's lots of trade-offs with all renewable resources um and traditional resources and so you",

        "text": "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Marion County Board of County Commissioners workshop regarding the implementation of plan service area study. If you could please stand with me. We're going to go straight into our pledge of allegiance. Thank you all. And Madam Clerk will go directly into roll call. Chairman Stone. Here. Vice Chairman Bryant. Here. Commissioner Curry. Here. Commissioner McLean. Here. Commissioner Zalig. Here. Very good. Thank you so much. And this afternoon, we have several that are in our audience that I believe will be presenting. And to get us started is our growth services director, Mister Chuck. I'll turn it directly to you to introduce. Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. Commission Chuck Verdon, director of growth services. We are so excited to be here today to kick off the plan service areas, the PSA project, which is something I know that's it's been in the comp plan and the strategic plan, something that we've talked about for a while. So in today's really just a high level conversation and really kind of also to introduce you to Kathy Ebal and her team. And JB pro are consultants for this project, and she's going to just help walk us through just a high level conversation, talking about things like, hey, what are psas in general? Why do we need them? And, like, what is their kind of benefit to our community? And you, you know, and part of the project is developing a roadmap for, like, what do we want psas to mean? What are the underlying principles? What are the framework that we want psas to look like for Marion county going forward? So that's just a quick introduction. So I wanted to jump in and let us get started. And unless there's questions, I'll hand it over to Kathy. I think we're good to go. Thank you so much. Welcome. Thank you. Good afternoon, board. I'm Kathy Ebaugh. I'm the director of planning for JB Pro. And we are very excited to be getting started with this project, which we know the county has been talking about for a long time. And, you know, sometimes when you talk and talk and talk, you wonder if it's actually ever going to happen. And we're excited to tell you that, yes. Now, today is the start of the happened. So I want to introduce you to our project team. We are led by JB Pro, and we also include Wade trim in the Corradino group together. We have worked together for almost 20 years on various projects. The project will be led by myself as the project manager, and then we will have Dustin Felix and others. Dustin is also with JB Pro and others. Who will help us through the project. So, Brad Cornelius, who you're going to get to meet in just a second, he is going to help lead the effort. He is an expert in public service areas. He's done these plan service areas across the state, most recently having done one for Citrus county. But he was also at one time the assistant county manager for Sumter county. So he really understands not only what a plan service area is, how you implement it, but he's done it himself in the county just to our south. So today's agenda, as Chuck mentioned, is a quick overview. We are new to this. While you all have been talking about this for a long time, we have been learning a lot about it in the last two months, working with your staff, understanding what the project is, reading your, your standards, reading your code, reading your strategic plan, your comprehensive plan, your land development code, talking to your staff, touring your county. Yesterday, we spent the day being toured by your county and learning everything we needed to know from your excellent staff and the wisdom they have and the experience that they have sharing it with us. And our job today is to help you understand what we've learned and for you to help us understand what else we need to know as we get started on this project, as we start this roadmap, the first thing we need to figure out is where are we headed? And that's what today is about, having you help us understand where we're headed so that we can get there successfully. And then we're going to talk a little bit about what our schedule is, and we're going to have a little discussion. So what are planned service areas? From our evaluation over the last couple of months, we have Fig we've come to a conclusion that we think they are the center node areas of activity that really help drive development in a very concentrated area. For their mixed use. They're multimodal, they really benefit from the existing services and are the areas where most of your plan, your public services are really concentrated. And in doing so, they help ensure that your urban growth boundary is able to be maintained, and they preserve your rural areas and really help provide that direction and character for the county. This is the future land use objective 3.2. This is what is currently in your comprehensive plan. When we go forward through the evaluation appraisal report, we'll be identifying new changes to these so that we can really flesh this out. We really can better explain them. We can establish a policy framework for achieving these plan service areas in the future. And then this is what is in your most recent strategic plan directive. This is the language and what you have said to us and your community, what you expect from the psas. So what are our goals for the psas? Working with your staff, we have come up with this list, which we think pretty well captures it. But you're going to have a chance at the end of the meeting to make sure that we're on the right track. But what we think that we've heard is one, the psas are to help sustain the urban growth boundary that we recognize that Marion county has established an urban growth boundary, has identified targeted areas where you want development to happen, so that you can preserve your farmland, so that you can direct services, so that you can create walkable community areas, and you can really drive economic development activities. The psas, being the centers of these areas, will help assure that that urban growth boundary can be maintained now and through 2050, which is the next planning horizon that you'll be working on through your evaluation appraisal report. And in fact, this PSA will become a chapter within the roadmap, which will be your valuation appraisal report. So when you are finished, you will see that as a chapter. Yes. Thank you, Miss Eba. Commissioner Bryant, I just have r1, quick question. I think maybe you've got the definitions for two of those pictures flipped. Yes, they are. Thank you. I just wanted to verify that for anyone in the public who may be watching and following along. Yep. So we're in Marion county and rural. So rural should be where you have suburban. Suburban should be where you have silver spring shores. Yep. Thank you. So then the second thing is that these direct growth to your urban and suburban areas. We want to direct growth away from your rural areas so that we can preserve those areas and really direct them into your urban and suburban areas. And in doing so, creating focal nodes or focal centers of activity. Whether these activities are economically driven, whether they are commercially driven, whether they are residential and economic driven in a mixed use area. Those are kind of things that we're going to be figuring out as we go through this project. And in doing so, we're maximizing utilities and infrastructure. These are areas that we will have public services in place, and we want to make sure that we maximize that. We want to make sure that the investment that the county is putting into these areas is insured and utilized at the most it possibly can be. And this does two things. One, it takes well of your public investment. It also ensures that you don't have to expend your public investment by putting it into places that aren't going to be utilized as highly. And in doing so, it supports your rural agricultural land, it discourages sprawl, and it fosters mixed use, walkable communities. Why psas now, you've been talking about it, as we mentioned, for quite a while, and yet now is the time we're bringing forward this project and going to be working on embarking on this project for the next year. And the reason is Marion county, as can be seen in the map of Florida, which was surprised by the Bureau of Economics and Business Research, which is the state of Florida's growth management and projection think tank out of the University of Florida. The darker the color you can see, the more intensity of development you have. So that dark green area, you're getting an increase of development about plus one. The lighter green, you're getting up to 5% growth. So you can see that Marion county, which is circled in the orange, is kind of the head part of a lot of development activity that is coming from the south and in this north central Florida region. We think it's really important to address this area of Marion county now, because we know that Marion county is growing. We know that Marion county is going to continue to grow. The question is, how does that happen and how does that happen in a way that supports your economic activities, that it supports your residential communities. It provides great places for people to live, work and play, and it supports and protects the rural agricultural areas. In doing so, it sustains the urban growth boundary. As you can see in this map, your urban growth boundary is the area that is highlighted in the kind of bright green colors surrounded by the dotted red line. The lands are. Anything that is in green is agricultural, anything that is blue is industrial. Anything that is in red is commercial,",

        "text": " including Energy Management Systems like smart thermostat um more efficient heating or cooling equipment like heat pumps high efficiency furnaces on demand water heaters heat pump water heaters um other Appliance upgrades or weatherization measures like air cealing or insulation um so it's a pretty broad swath of um projects that might be eligible so I wanted to pause here for just a second to see if anyone had any specific like what is the program questions before we dive into into the you can you go back one I think will thanks oh maybe not all right well hearing no specific questions about the homes program um let's hand it back over to chrisy to kind of get us set up for our discussion great thanks everybody so we did have a conversation in the chat for those who missed it someone asked if this would be recorded um I said yes it would be and then Emily was kind enough to share the link to where it will be recorded and Stacy is waiting to say say that it will probably be posted tomorrow so I think you have a complete answer there on that question and then I'll be keeping an eye out for hands up or chats um with feedback on the first question here so we would like you to weigh in on the following questions to um to inform our design we talked about raising your hand for those on the phone just a reminder that um when you oh gosh I wrote down a note so I'd remember but now I can't find it star three to raise your hand I hope and star six to come off mute memory serves um someone corrects me if I'm wrong quick um but that's how you participate by phone and that will ra raise your hand and then unmute you and then um the first question we have is homes rebates will require demonstrated Energy savings of a minimum of 15% of the household energy use for projects to be eligible and this can be demonstrated using either a modeled approach or a measured approach uh and then um what considerations feedback or recommendations do you have on this requirement and then Emily did correct me it star six to raise your hand and star three to unmute um and we do have a question that came in while people think about their answers or raise their hand to give feedback on modeled or measured or how that would work um it it the question is is there an overarching plan to reach all of or uh to reach all oregonians with information about this program and I'll say that that's certainly a major issue for us we do want to make sure that everybody knows about the program and that it reaches as many people as possible so we're definitely working on that Outreach strategy and stuff if you want to weigh in any further you can feel free mention onstop shop whatever works for you yeah I was going to um pick up on onstop shop so we are working on developing and uh kind of unified resource to help Direct people to the the programs that they are eligible for and to help them access um both these incoming Federal programs as well as existing state programs um so that's kind of being developed uh alongside the development of these two programs and then uh just a a note that while this funding is substantial um there is not enough funding in the homes in here pots of money to uh provide an a rebate for every Oregonian so the the reach of this program will be somewhat limited um by that so we're looking at um identifying gaps and places where we can um bolster existing programs to expand reach um to include more people in um improving Energy Efficiency of homes um and helping Oregon make the clean energy transition so we're trying to be strategic about where we focus our energies on these programs yeah yeah we want to be clear like well we wish the money could even come close to reaching even half of waran households that need it um it'll be significantly lower how many households will be reached so thanks for setting that expectation I see your hand up uh Doug um I'll get to you in one second I did just want to say Melanie brought up the U measured seems like it could be risky like if you get the work done and then the measuring doesn't actually work out in the end and so suddenly you don't qualify so that was her comment and then Doug if Doug can be taken off mute um um that' be great Doug you're now off mute and you can share your thoughts hello I have qu three questions about modeling is is the applicant required to pay for the modeling up front um so the energy modeling aspect of the program can be covered as part of the administration of the program um so we we don't have a complete answer on whether or not the participant would be required to to provide some portion of that cost or whether we can cover all of it within the admin we're still working on crunching the numbers um and figuring out what is going to be required um but it is an eligible expense under the the Administration okay second question are there software products that have been listed and approved for BPI 2400 modeling um so there are a few um like a few software products that are um like certified meet BPI 2400 standards um however I from what I understand they aren't necessarily in wide use well specifically there's a product available in Oregon called snug bro is that I'm familiar with that one and I believe it does meet the the BPI standard thank you and the third question about BPI 2400 does it require a blow door test or is that optional can you repeat that I didn't quite hear to conform to BPI 2400 is a blower door test required or is that optional I do not believe that that is required um great it needs to be specific to the house but it uh it does not require a blow or test thank you those are my questions thanks so much duck appreciate it um meanwhile in the chat a few new comments um we do have a question about retroactivity um we're going to have a slide on retroactivity right yeah yeah we have a a conversation about that that we I'll save that one for when we get to that topic and then um Jeremy Anderson flagged for us an existing program or a pilot program with energy trust that they had to abandon called pay for performance where they found measuring energy use was very difficult um so thanks for looking back on that um Melanie had the question about her had the concern about what if you get the work done and then the measuring doesn't match up and Durk shared that he talked to a company interested in Contracting with us um on the measured approach and that they would be responsible for that risk and then we have some questions and it's uh let's see certification or licenses required to conduct modeling um and how do organizations get certified and is funding available to help with training um so I would love to chime in just really quick on uh what we have available to to support contractor training um and then I would also love to hear from from David who's got his hand up uh he's a member of the VPI 2400 subject matter expert convened by BPI this year which is fantastic I would love to hear from you because I'm not an expert in 2400 standards so thank you for being here we appreciate you um we do have a contractor training grant that we've been kind of talking about like a side card to these programs um that we are applying for from the US Department of energy and there's also some State funds to assist in um doing some Workforce Development to help prepare for these programs coming through um so one of the things that we're looking at is what is it going to take to get our existing residential energy Professionals in the state of Oregon um ready to do BPI 2400 standard modeling um what support do they need to access training as needed um to do that work and um figuring out how to kind of distribute resources to help support that development um so do you want to take David off mute and he can also chime in on some of this thank you Stephanie this is David pesum from Earth advantage and yeah so the there there is some confusion about BPI 2400 I think um in general across the country the the law called out that the um software had to be used that uh complied with B BPI 2400 uh it's a BPI 2400 is a standard of how you estimate savings for homes uh using utility bills to calibrate the model um but it there has never been a certification process and there still is no certification process by which a software is approved by BPI 2400 um so what has been mentioned here is that Doe is actually going to be approving software so that that will actually be the process is that you'll have to use doe approved software um so it it's assumed that BPA that Doe is going to use the BPI standard as the method that it certifies software and that currently there are software vendors out there who are claiming that their product is in compliance with BPI 2400 but at the moment nobody can say that they have BPI 2400 certified software because there is no process to certify the software that sounds like semantics probably to a lot of people but it's just that's the actual uh rule so by the time do gets around to coming up with a list of approved software there may be more software available right than the one than the private companies that are out there talking about their software um which is all fine and dandy it's just that's the way it's going to work and then the other thing I would add is that um you the subject matter expert group I was on got convened by BPI this year because of the fact that you know some homes you don't have access to utility bills so for not every single home will you be able to calibrate the model to a 12month history of utility bills so what was come up with was a separate pathway that'll be utilize when you don't have utility bills to calibrate the model and so what that is referred to is it's just going to be based off the composition of the building what the envelope is like what the Mechanicals are like and um no single tool was named but it's pretty obvious when you actually get to see what this language is is that it's the home energy score tool as a National Standard way of conducting modeling if you don't have utility bills because",

        "text": " of been repeating from time to time, what we are trying to get to is a bunch of strategies, not just a single strategy, because there's no single strategy that is going to solve all of the different types of housing problems that exist in Hillsboro, or in fact many different types of household situations that have here. So you need a suite of strategies that address the various aspects of need, whether that's affordability or housing type or things that are specific to register. We also understand that this body has to have a sensory vocal about the pro house. That's a really positive thing. And the HPs is a great opportunity for your jurisdiction to take action on them and come up with plans for what you want to do over the next six to eight years in order to enact states. So before we get into strategies themselves, we thought it would be helpful to talk about what types of strategies there are, and that way we can sort of break it. So I'm going to do some more rope reading here on the slides just to make sure that we define these things clearly. But you can think about them as the types of tools that are in your toolbox for this process. There are partnerships. Partnerships allow you to facilitate connections and share information in order to foster more opportunities for housing production. Here you can imagine different types of partnerships we're working. There are investments. This is when you are directly contributing resources to projects or to infrastructure in order to spur housing production. There are incentives. This is when you're changing how you levy fees or taxes in order to reduce the cost of development, incentivize the production. There are land strategies in which you're trying to do something interesting with land in order to spur housing production on it or make housing production possible. And then there's regulations where you're reforming zoning, land use codes, etcetera, to make housing less costly to build possible to do with more expenses. These are the different types. How do we go from types of actually producing housing? We think that there are roughly three main mechanisms here. You can cut this many different ways, but this will give us a way of talking about this. So the three ways are expanding opportunities. You can think of this as like growing the pie. We make housing possible in more places, make more deals possible. There's lowering costs, which you can essentially think of as making it more efficient to build housing, right? So if you lower costs and make more efficient with the same amount of resources, and then last is bridging down some financing. Low income housing or affordable housing tends to have a gap that's required to build the subsidy in order for the projects to be possible. And the local government can play a role in that as well. So that's how you go from a type strategy to enacting a particular change, like expanding opportunities. And then ultimately, we wanted to give just one example of one of those mechanisms in motion, because this is an area that I think sometimes people, there isn't a lot of clarity about sort of the city's role and the city's ability. So we wanted to break out a particular mechanism of lowering cost for lowering costs. The city really does ultimately only have limited influence on that problem. You can't affect how much it costs to pay a professional worker back, the cost of insurance, cost of hiring money. But there are some aspects of costs that you do have some influence on, like the cost of infrastructure or the costs that come into projects through instances or permits. And you can help projects more efficiently come to completion by changing some of the rules. And that might influence heart costs or it might reduce the amount of land cost per unit. Your code audit is an example of a strategy that is upcoming that your community is going to use to try to use this method as it produce more housing. So code audit is a great way for you to potentially lower the cost of groups and housing interest. We look forward to more of that from this team and I'm sure other folks. So I'm just looking at the facade articulation and maybe even the materials. So we make changes in code, but then maybe those materials, the facade doesn't last as long. Sure. So all of a sudden, you know, 20 years out instead of 30. Now it's a cost for that home and, you know, so it's almost like, you know, we made something a little less expensive on the front end, but then it becomes more burdensome, you know, not even on the back end, but just partway through. So I guess that's, I guess, more of a comment disguise as a question. And I'm not really expecting an answer, but I'm just trying to think. I just want to be careful things that we don't just focus on starting, but we're also focusing on halfway through the race. And absolutely, yes. Longevity, I think, is a really interesting game when it comes to housing. Definitely. When it comes to city investing, the way I think about it is for a homeowner, there might be some out there, not everybody, certainly not everybody in this room, who might prefer a cheaper housing unit if it means they get to own their house and they would rather put out new siding. 20 years, that's what it takes to own a house. So sometimes by changing the rules and just letting it happen, you can let them make your own choice about what's right for them when it comes to building housing. But certainly, I mean, whether or not we're building something to last is always a question. Okay, so what we're going to do next is going to, I think, involve a lot more conversation, which I'm excited about. Glad we got here. So with some time to spare. So we're going to walk through each of those types of strategies together. I'm going to tell you what typically goes in nhps because we've done some of these in the past. And then we'll talk about what you're already doing, or at least an example. And then we'll talk through a couple ideas that you could consider, including your upcoming hbs. And then we want to hear what you think. We want to hear some of your reactions to those ideas, other ideas you might have. We want to hear questions, et cetera. So we're going to get through as many of these as we can with the time that we have, but know that we're coming back in June. Deep discussion on strategies, focus on strategies at that time and less certainly front level setting. So the first one that we have for you is incentives. So these are your fees and taxes. So what typically goes in nhps is changes to how your SDC, maybe referrals, maybe sanctions, scaling the sdcs. Those are the sorts of things that tend to get considered. Obviously, you don't control all of your sdcs that affect housing production here or sort of staff, but this is an area that you can make difference in terms of a couple of percentage points of cost for this account. Property tax abatements is another really common one, and we do have some books already in Hillsboro that are available. Nonprofits produce loan housing, but as I understand, vertical housing tax zone for multiple zones where you're able to get those that sort of state evolved tax credit. So here's some examples that you could consider. Vertical housing, a tool that you may be familiar with, has a sunset provision in 2026 where you'll no longer be able to certify new projects. The old ones will stay on the books, but the tool, for whatever reason, has the sunset on new certifications. So that might be something to consider acting upon finding a replacement. We tend to like mufti, very fun. I think it's a multi unit property tax exemption also available, made available through state legislation. It's more flexible and the tax abatement can be greater. Vertical housing is capped at 80%, lumpy is 100%, and you get to decide what the community benefits are that you want to receive in exchange for providing the tax payment. So there is a bit more agency for you to customize how some of this works for yourself in order to for house of production, too. So there's also a bunch of STC ideas that you need to consider. So one idea that we're seeing implemented in other parts of the state, and I know right now is just on a push to change this for themselves, is collecting sdcs later in the permitting process, such as when a certificate of occupancy is issued. This can be a logistical difficulty for cities to implement, but it can represent meaningful cost savings to housing developers because they don't essentially have to take out construction loan for that portion of sdcs, which leads to an interest loss. But they don't have to put up their own equity, which is quite costly. So high cost of capital going into projects to pay those secs can be alleviated by moving later in the build period, hopefully, if that makes sense. And then let's see a couple others. As I understand it in Hillsboro, adus sometimes have their sdcs waived. Now is a great opportunity to talk about whether that's a policy you'd like to formalize, whether there's another policy that would be more appropriate going forward. And then last but not least on this list, variable sdcs is something you would consider that would be scaling your sdcs to the size of the unit so that small units, which presumably have a lower effect on your systems, would pay less than okay. Those are some examples of things that you can include in your housing production strategy to try to pass some of those factors that you were talking about. Does anybody have ideas, reactions? Questions? Ask questions now, please. Oh, I sure do. Go for it. Yeah. A couple of thoughts here. Strong agree about variable sdcs, particularly on our parks and transportation line. Even our transportation is limited to South Hills where I",

        "text": " be able to make the application so that the Luma decision brought it to light that we needed to make a change and there was a disconnect in our code yeah yeah Jane's just notifying me that so this packet process like what we're here today to talk about in this specific how the caring started in 2021 because of the legislature changes I would assume that through uh all work that anyone does when you learn something new you try to keep and it's not working out for a particular situation you try to change it in your particular situation there's an action that Public Works was aware of and then whatever that action was and I don't have all the details all I've had Community people talk to me about it there's a need for us to change our code even in your case yes that's what presented this to come forward but there's likely other situations throughout the county that would apply to this particular code what I don't want is for you to leave here today thinking that we've made a decision that directly impacts you today because there has to be an entire process that comes forward that we potentially could deny for facts and findings that come forward in that case in the future um so I I just I'm going to support this entire code amendment process today because it's been going on for some time but I look forward to the future discussion on your particular situation and any application that may come forward and will work I will work very diligently to understand all of those details and the impact and harm that you're stating that could occur for you and your neighbor it is occurring it has been occurring since 2017. okay I do not feel heard by the county at all okay and it's been very frustrating and if you pass this there there is no ma'am I admire you and I but I respectfully disagree there's no doubt in my mind that this particular code Amendment and I think Brandon acknowledged it is being passed specifically as a result of this case and this project I'm not disagreeing with that I'm I what I was what I was trying to say and I think you heard me is that your case brought awareness to the public works department on a situation that they can engage in based on an app I don't know if an application even came forward but whatever that previous situation is in butteville that education triggered a response from Luba a direction that we're now implementing in this particular code so yes your particular case brought that awareness forward but I don't believe that that gives direction to a future outcome of an app a future application so I I can't I mean I can't tell you what that looks like because I don't have the facts and findings in front of me for that particular public hearing and I can completely understand why you would be frustrated I've been I literally have been to in front of your house multiple times in the last two years having ice cream and sandwiches at the store nearby um so and I have a visual and I understand but that is something that we will if an application comes forward address in the future so okay it's going to happen like if somebody applies and I I don't know who that somebody is it will make its way to this body I assure you and we will have made sure we do all of our work so you are frankly heard um in that process well that's good to know I appreciate that yeah um I and do not anticipate any other code changes I I'm at a disadvantage I The Greenway code um the code that I referenced about change of use I don't recall that being you said it was a state Greenway code and I'm in a disadvantage because I can't argue that point but it was my understanding that was a Marion County code that there can't be a change of use there's been a dramatic change of use but I won't argue with you it's our code that we Implement on behalf of the state for that specific Greenway program and signature code is different the signatures yeah it's a whole different part of the code the signature part is just the ability to make an application to get into the process to consider either approving or denying a use to considerate conditions well I will point out that they tried to falsify that they were doing the project on mine and my neighbor's behalf so they were a little desperate to get this through I guess so maybe that's so I guess the code change was the next step in getting around that so I think if I could maybe add to what Mr Bella said we like to make decisions on substance of the case and I think one of the things that often these land use decisions it becomes all about process and procedure and so we've had a couple of these hearings recently where an applicant's lawyer wanted to argue about timelines and whether the county had met the timeline or not right and I get that I I used to be a lawyer I get that that's what lawyers are paid to do is to fight about the details and the procedure and all this sort of stuff but for us as a policy making body it's our job to look at a situation and say is it right is it just is it fair to everybody involved and so I think in a case like where basically there's a fight over I need to look at this from a is this the how we should determine your particular case and I would say no we shouldn't determine your particular case on whether or not there was a signature missing or not we should determine your case on on the things you've identified is there an easement is there a right for the public to use that easement are they using it appropriately are we preserving the rights of the property owners all this sort of stuff if we're making decisions based on these technicalities all the time we're going to frequently frequently do Injustice because we're gonna be making decisions based on technicalities not based on the substance of what we're deciding so I think when we're looking at a legislative change like this we have to make sure that that we're making decisions for the whole County and for how how everybody can engage with the county and how everybody can engage with the process like commissioner Bethel said then when you come before us you know that we're going to make a decision based on the merits of the case and you're also not going to lose on technicality just like you won't win on technicality you also won't lose on it right because you know that we're not going to Ticky tack this stuff right so I think in order to do justice to you but then also to everybody in the county we have to make sure that we're able to move this stuff out of the realm of technicality and process and procedure and into the realm of substance so that we're making decisions based on effects well believe it or not that was my concern that this um these code amendments that are based on my case affect everyone who lives in Marion County which is true and every single case that comes forward with an application will be determined on its individual merits based on this particular process so it's public works there's a system in place to make sure there's no sweeping ability for them well I actually really adore all of them and find them to be very heart forward for the citizens citizens of Marion County it's our job to be accountable to every single case when it gets I mean there's an application then there's a decision a denial an appeal you know a what's the lady that does it before us officer thank you hearing's officer you know appeal it gets to the board like in it's costly unfortunately but it's to make sure that the process followed and it's per its perspective is unique to every single application and I'll have to tell you land use has been the steepest learning curve for me because it's Unique to the people and the land in every single case to me and I want to make sure that I'm representing the best I can the people that elected me or didn't I mean who knows who voted for me but in general the reality is is that we deeply care as a board about our citizens in their property like we really want to protect people's rights on their individual property like it's a really big deal to all three of us and I believe it's a big deal to our public works department too and I I agree that this process is a little sticky and unfortunate because of where your home lies with your neighbor in this particular access to the river and I think it's Unique in general but I do think there's other opportunities in Marion County for applications similar to this that will come forward that we'll have to determine a decision on so it's we can sit here all day and kind of debate it but at some point we have to make a decision and continue on with the process and I I don't want you to feel today like you're leaving being unheard or unsupported in your ability to engage because we want you to be very participatory in any process and I'm really grateful actually that you came today I am too but I do feel I just have to respectfully disagree I just feel like a vote for these amendments is one step in reducing our rights as private property owners and removing our ability our signature Authority I understand that thank you thank you for hearing me I really I appreciate all of you thank you for coming thank you thank you for answering your questions if an application comes in I intend to send it right to the hearings officer for public hearing so all the neighborhood and the property Public Works everyone can participate it's important to me to get resolution on this and either we approve it or we deny it and if we approve it we get the conditions that it makes it fit into the code and meets the criteria and getting that application in so we can move forward with either making it work or saying no to me is a really really not letting it just waiting out there and Brandon and I also want to clarify because the issue of notice is brought up in this case the notice wasn't given directly to the neighbors but if you want to submit an application then the notice would be given directly right because they're the ones that would be affected by it absolutely okay and if we could get two or three week notice because I know on some of the hearings we've had as little as five to six days and that's really not enough we'll mail it out 21 days notice yeah we mail it out to about 21 days okay before the first year open so thank you I I would appreciate that greatly yeah Julie can I just uh",

        "text": " we'll certainly want to think about other strategies to reach um all all consumers and then um Jeremy's notic noting that a qualified contractor list should require more than the basic ccvb insurance qualifications customers tend to think of a qualified list as the same as an endorsement and Odo doesn't want to be seen as endorsing poor work of which there will be plenty he prognosticates um Mendy has a question and then I'll get to the chat or the hands um his question I'm sorry their question is the is this referring is the consumer protection like beforehand or after installation and ensuring that equipment functions well for the life of the unit let's say it's all of that so it's beforehand it's during and making sure it's installed correctly and then it's also I guess when we talk about the life of the unit that's probably more so an education piece on part of the contractor or someone else to make sure that the the owner knows how to to use that equipment properly so I would say that's all part of what we'll need to develop a plan for okay and then can we get Ahmed on line yeah just just to speak to a couple of points in language access and to like say where that's coming from so one of the reasons we in immigrant rights Coalition have been engaged in the um deployment of these rebate programs um and just clarify like I'm based in Oregon but we're engaging with it with members around the country is that our members some of them have been uh involved in navigate running Navigator programs to implement similar State programs Implement Li Heap Etc to their members and found that there's just like a really significant barrier to especially limited English proficiency folks accessing these rebates but also a high concentration of limited English proficiency among some of the most energy burdened households in these Target States uh so that we see it's like a key strategy so just say a language access plan like obviously our members in Oregon are Beyond just Spanish speakers you know AO is one of our members of organ the Asian Pacific American Network in the state um so there's a number usually involves like identifying the top usually five or by you know voting population languages in the state kind of trying to map them onto where are your target populations for you know energy burden Etc and then like deploying stuff in language based on of like a mapping at that level um it's a best practice we can talk more about we can follow up more oneon-one on that and then I just say on the um contractor side of qualified contractor lists are members in other parts of the country that have imp pled for example like the TVA uplift program one of the major costs and the biggest challenge was a lack of qualified contractors with appropriate language skills and we're seeing that all over the country as a key barrier in immigrant communities and limited English language proficiency communities so folks are having to provide translation at like every single contractor appointment to do navigation work to get you know those benefits to those households uh so including um language skills on your list of contractors um I think is really important I think it's a thing that we assume that a lot of these countries should have language skills and just um it's we've noticed it's a thing that our members have asked for yeah thank you so much I think we totally agree um Will's chatting me that we want to get together with you maybe desperately so we'll find you and get together and talk more about that I also just want to flag we know that there's a lot of folks um that do this type of Contracting work that speak Russian for example so um we definitely know it's not just Spanish um but that's just what we have going I know for a fact from the heun program so I was just kind of speaking off the cuff there about what I know but um but I really appreciate that and um and we absolutely should follow up and have a longer conversation and make sure we're ready for that dynamic to play out here in Oregon and well do you have anything to add no I was just going to say yeah thank you for bringing that perspective and would love to have a more in-depth conversation around those challenges yeah um oh and by the way we also this is just like how this goes too um we do ask for languages spoken for our contractor lists um we got the idea actually from a meeting with latino Network a few years ago and so we started adding it for our our solar rebate and so I think we also have it for our as far as I know we have it for heat pumps too and it is interesting like how One thing is like how um limited that is like sometimes there's just no you know there's very few in our Solar contractor list folks that speak different languages and then we've also had the issue of we'll find out that there's somebody who speaks Spanish there or something or Tagalog for example and then later it'll turn out that staff member has left so it is sort of like an interesting um just an interesting Dynamic so when we do talk maybe we could think of like you know how do we how do we deal with that kind of thing um okay so we have a lot of activity in the chat um I'm going to have play come off and then we'll deal with the chat play your up thanks uh touching on ahed's significant point about language uh on the digital channel side it can it can become incredibly challenging to do that multilanguage uh one thing we've seen work is is at least having landing page options in various languages to to at least start the um you know the experience in in the language familiar with that person uh same thing with uh marketing uh especially email marketing is to be able to to do that in multiple as a kind of at least finding like a economical uh initial path forward uh the other side of that is uh is making people aware that they can leverage Google Translate to at least get some modom of translation that's beneficial for them to stay engaged uh through you know deeper digital channels that become more difficult to fully translate um economically all right than clay and then to the chat uh Zach raised that e web has a list of contractors that have previously received incentives and pass subsequent inspections as a kind of quality control check there Rachel I think is coming back on the coupon agree that there needs to be some ability to guarantee the coupon for a longer period especially for projects that need to tackle larger electrical upgrades to support new equipment and our code upgrades that require going through building permit process which can be a months long or even year-long process depending on the scope of the project and then um a plus one to the points that Amed was making about language skills Andor built-in access to paid interpretation um and then Rachel points out that speaking for CCC as an affordable housing developer I think that's Central City Concern um uh we often need to be able to pull together and finalize our financing package up to 18 months before construction completion EG when you in conjunction with lihtc dollars so we need to be able to go into Finance closing knowing we can count on those rebate dollars to be available when ready to pay invoices and then Katie Kate sorry uh says program Direct Administration funding should be used to Resource community-based organizations to hire staff to conduct Outreach audits act as Navigators hire contractors and more that is local and culturally specific be clear in the program cbos can do more than just Outreach in these programs all right that is that for the chat and I don't see any hands up so I think we can go to the next slide and do we have two more there's one more after that's that's General is that right well yeah I believe that there's just one General keeping an eye on the clock we have about 13 minutes left so um how can Odo support the development of a Workforce that can deliver these rebates and we talked a fair amount about Market transformation earlier but or Market speaking too fast Market transformation earlier but how can the rebates deliver sustained Market transformation that creates long-term demand for efficient so clay has his hand up buet to in one second clay um I did get a comment kind of hearkening back to Rachel's comment from Central concern a program design element for he rebates for projects like yours could be that a specific amount of the funds was set aside to be used by lihtc funded Pro projects similar to how the Oregon housing community services multif family efficiency program operates and um Jeremy Anderson notes that one way we can take care of these items is design a stable program versus boom and bus that pushes for higher efficiency standards versus is federal minimums clay you can go off mute or once we get you off mute I'll let you know okay you're up hi uh certainly there there's a Workforce that's already available uh with uh at scale retailers and of course they're hiring from local population so that that uh has to be leveraged especially for uh you know lifestyle products like uh stoves and and so on um and then well that also translates into sustained Market transformation because those retailers are going to be stocking uh products that are selling like hot cakes um which will you know be highly rebated uh here products okay thanks Clay and I don't see anything else in the chat or or hands up I don't know how fast we want to move on yeah let's move on and then we can just kind of open it up generally and we can come back the next one's General right great um as we transition slide Zach's pointing out working with unions contractors and sellers to understand the rebates one thing I'll just point out that's really interesting um most residential work is not Union work in Oregon so multif family often can be um but anyway it is just kind of interesting because um we partner closely with unions and a lot of our work like in the capital and such and um have found that they say this is the case although there's apparently an example of one local that has some residential folks in maybe Central Oregon so anything else you want to make sure we consider that hasn't already come up or anything that you're still working on typing um there is a quote to create an application path for multif family projects to be treated as single project application versus unit by uh clay we'll get you off mute and then David we'll come to you next clay you're up yeah keeping in in the Forefront through these program rollout designs uh Behavioral Science in consumerism and uh and your digital channels and and you know really",

        "text": " turn back now after 11 so uh the development of written policies uh we will start to report on that and the first one that we'll be T tackling in this fiscal year will be the reserve policy and the goal is to have that uh to you to review and adopt in quarter three of this year on the second page uh this talks a little bit more about the financial information that we previously talked about um in the previous fiscal year and we'll start with the general fund the revenues are at 22% which is trending at normal we should be at 25% considering it's the first quarter of the year if we were right on budget but due to the timing of the draw Downs 22% is is where we typically fall our expenditures are at 21% in total they should be less Le than 25% and every division is within their budget so we are looking good there for the transportation programs fund the revenues are at 8% again that's normal but it's the dry the dry down of the um expenses that we reimburse that draws that out in that first quarter and the expenditures are at 23% so again less than the 25% uh for the quarter in the capital fund this is actually really fun to talk about this time um you know it takes a there's a lot of dollars in there so it takes a lot to move the needle and our revenues that we received in quarter 1 were 31% of our annual budget but that's because of the 10 battery electric buses paying for them and being reimbursed for them so um that's higher than normal but that's very exciting for us and so the expenditures are also higher than normal at 38% but you know the the buses are our biggest project so um the payment of those in first quarter um is the Big Driver there we also had some payments for the technology equipment and the South Salem Transit Center and then the bottom section is the the expenses related to the FY 24 strategic plan organizational tactics that you heard about earlier and the three tactics that had uh movement with expenses in the first quarter were the integration of battery electric buses so we that was $1.1 Million that we had as expenditures for that in first quarter the efair implementation or UMO as most of you know it um the actual expenditures in first quarter were only $2,000 but that was a timing issue with getting the invoices in from the vendor and and and them getting their work done on that so in the second quarter very shortly after the first quarter we actually received the remaining $178,000 of invoices so um that project is actually in a closeout phase at this point in time um from a financial perspective and then the third one is the clean and safe passenger amenities and in first quarter we did hire additional Staffing um for facilities maintenance for that and the cost of that additional Staffing incurred in first quarter was $20,000 are there any questions that I can answer all right I and I've been I've heard people's alarms going off so y'all are going to need to keep it brief any questions director homr yeah thank you very much uh great news good to see although when I was flipping through the report and I saw a bunch of FS um I I think that was a very good grade uh but uh I I read read it oh favorable that's it's green so that's good so uh appreciate good yeah so but at first of all I was like why are we getting bun FS but yeah so thank you very much we are really tripping you up evening okay any other questions or comments director Davidson just a comment um I wanted to acknowledge the gfoa award I given the longevity of it I think it's easy to think oh this always happens this is normal every entity gets this but when he mentioned that only 94 entities in Oregon receive it I mean to put some context on that there's three mass transit districts in Oregon there's 36 counties in Oregon there's 241 cities and there's upwards of probably 500 if not a thousand Special Districts so being among the 94 I just want to extend a you know Applause and gratitude to you and your team and the everybody who's been involved with that so thank you thank you we we have a really great team chariots all righty okay there's nothing else we'll move on to the general management report thank you very much thank you all right thank you so in your stack of stuff at your spaces you do have a hard copy of the bus coalition's uh 10e report um if you don't know we are a member of the bus Coalition uh it's a nation wide Coalition that focuses on uh bus and bus facility federal grants uh and as a result of the work of the Coalition uh we have seen significant plus UPS in bus and bus facility Awards uh so this is a nice little 10year review uh so you're welcome to to have that and if you look in the facility section you'll see a beautiful picture of Kaiser Transit um do you want to report in case you're are not aware you know we have multiple agencies who serve uh our area uh to include chariots chariots Regional yamill County uh Wilsonville with the smart uh Wilsonville smarts 1X system along with us and also T County transportation district and uh this week unfortunately uh tmok uh discontinued route 60x which is the coastal connector service from Lincoln City into here into the Salem uh they have been struggling with that uh it's not a financial issue it's a staffing issue they're they're having a tough time uh hiring drivers they actually discontinued their 70x uh earlier this year uh but modified the 60x to serve the stops that were going to be lost on the way into Salem um ODOT uh is working to try to find some type of uh solution uh but we've been letting people know because this is one of their end points uh so that that is unfortunate but I thought you should be aware of that in case anyone asks um last week as you know I I was in Washington DC for legislative visits and uh so I met with the federal delegation with staff of Senator uh Merkley and weiden along with uh uh staff from representative Chavez deimer uh and got actual meeting with the representative selenis you can see the the picture there had a great discussion with her on our services I shared with all members of the delegation updates on the South Salem Transit Center and our electric bus project and pro pres Pro provided them pictures of both the electric bus and the concept of South Salem and everyone was impressed and really loved the the look of the buses so uh good visit with that in addition to the delegation visits we also met with FEMA uh right now uh we are not one of the qualifying entities to uh uh receive FEMA funding uh but we went and pled our case to be cons that we should be considered for that they're evaluating our request and hope to hear sometime soon uh and whether or not we can do that the importance of that is it becomes a new source of funding for us they provide provide about $93 million a year in security funding to address issues like cyber security hardening facilities uh uh security at large Gathering events uh uh amongst others and so uh we believe uh we could compete well for some of those projects uh if we are eligible so I will keep you posted as we hear back from FEMA staff uh in addition to that I also uh attended the apas winner legislative meetings and and Congressional reception where we receive uh federal legislative updates with a high focus on the status update of the fiscal year 24 Appropriations as you know we are on continuing resolution with the the tud due to expire January 19th uh and so well it looks like things have shut down now for the holidays uh it'll be fast and furious to see what happens in in January to either extend that continuing resolution uh come to an agreement on Appropriations or have a government shut down so we will wait and see what happens there could you clear up that acronym T Hut T oh yeah the transportation Housing and Urban Appropriations uh okay and then uh for board members that were able to attend uh Saturday we did have the uh first electric bus in the parade and you can see some uh pictures as I I talk it was great day the bus looked uh great uh people were were pleased to see it we had a nice turnout a full bus of uh participants in the parade and since we're talking holidays I just want to remind the board there is the employee holiday party in this room tomorrow from 11: to 3: feel free if during that time if you want to stop in for a half hour hour or all four hours you're you're welcome to attend and that concludes my report okay thank you all right so that'll move us into our board director reports um before we get into those reports I did want to just note some uh committee assignments so on the legislative subcommittee um our chair will be director s Carney um other than that the makeup of that subcommittee is the same on the Dei subcommittee we have uh director hin laa mkff joining us uh to replace our Ian Davidson and um on the service enhancement subcommittee our chair is going to be director Ian Davidson and then also as kind of like a last minute addition uh we are going to have a representative on the Salem scenario planning advisory committee and to that we'll have uh STI Carney participating and with that um I'm going to start on the more festive side of the Das uh director davson sure happy holidays everyone um so few updates from me um first um wanted to talk about Council governments so um for the last couple months Council of governments our legislative committee has been meeting and talking through different uh legislative priorities that we as a region would like to have um we've had um kind of some core priorities for this same for the last at least 2 years among them being Regional Transportation initiatives including Regional Transit um however I want to highlight a two couple uh additions to that going into the 2024 short session the first is um support of the Westside Express um extension bill so the rail passenger rail bill um that will then study that um so um the Council of governments is keenly",

County Board of Commissioners work session we're expecting commissioner Roy Rogers uh thank you to staff for I'm changing the arrangements for today's meeting given that we had the budget committee meeting last night it was nice to have a little flexibility this morning so first thing on the agenda is board communication who would like to go first not me because I didn't even read my notes yet okay I'll go first um it's been all budget all the time for me pretty much since our meetings uh last week we had a very successful and productive Clean Water Services budget committee meeting all day on Friday uh just diving into the Washington County proposed budget and I'm starting my work with commissioner Rogers to craft the performance review for the Clean Water Services CEO which we need to get done and delivered before the end of January I'm also working on uh board planning as I mentioned at a recent Tuesday business meeting we have this growing list of things that's coming our way after we get through budget so it feels like the July tsunami and I'm hoping to replace a tsunami experience with just a steady volume of work for us through the end of the year so learning more at our Round Table meeting of June first I will go over a bunch of that in order to figure out a plan that will address the needs of the two agencies while hopefully chart a course for the next year of getting through that work so that's it for me who's next I I can go next fighting yeah no keep writing good afternoon everyone uh in terms of my uh my board update yes Diane uh we had a successful budget day and I was just chatting during my lunch time with Mark perhaps next year we can break it down to two days but I don't um it just felt like a lot um every year but um this this is the first year I was reflecting what could be and look forward to that discussion I'll fill out the survey that will be coming out and last week I also um the Beaverton Chamber of Commerce meet in Greatwood elected officials and I did that this month and I was it um and it was a really good meeting and a lot of the questions from the business community members were focused on um budget as you can expect and a lot of the stuff around the arpa the budget County and we really talked good about the County Administrator how you were able to present a balanced budget and people really felt the leadership and appreciated that so thank you and you know there were like kudos to the County Administrator for presenting a balanced budget around the shortfall of the 25 million people were reading um and then yesterday was aoc's Health and Human Services committee there's a lot of Rec um the community recommended to support a lot of bills that were on at the agenda and good afternoon Senate Bill 1097 which is the liability mitigation for court order Community Mental Health Services the committee chose to support that and then House Bill 3610 which is establishes Task Force on alcohol pricing and Addiction Services but the community the community supported with an amendment to add a seat for public health prevention expert and then there was a support for the 24 20 House Bill 2420 a the amendment and this creates a work group to propose options for Equitable access to birth and death certificates throughout the state and Equitable fee Revenue to maintain and improve vital record system and then we had a really great discussion around 2506 which is the super sighting bill for mental health and addiction residential treatment facilities that was a robust conversation and to be um and then the other conversation we had was commissioner Daniel Bethel submitted couple letters to the committee and one of the letter was to the members of The Association of Oregon counties and she this was around adverse consequences to counties due to the September 1 2022 federal court order limiting the commissions um two and shortening treatment at the Oregon State Hospital Washington County was mentioned a lot in that meeting and how we're collaborating with Marion County and then yesterday um commissioner Bethel sent another letter because there was a strong interest to join to the federal lawsuit um and and then the other update I have that was yesterday we had a wccc Works Workshop um it is really so wccc meets two hours every every month um but this one was about an hour long and this is the prep work for the joint Metro and jpac workshop on draft RTP project list and it was a really good discussion and uh you know Washington County has the most we're doing great on those project lists 21 of our requests of our 89 projects are about walking and biking and then we have about 72 percent of um on our projects are roads and bridges so look forward to discussion on the jpac and in terms of future meeting that is jpac coming up with that with 40 seconds left I turn it to the next person all right thank you I'd like to go last so Roy will be next after me check your personal email so yeah uh had obviously lots of meetings Clean Water Services last week I had we are going to be appointing Don ottoman to the Northwest act and I had lunch with him yesterday to kind of go over a few things that was always interesting to in the transportation conversation with Don you're going for the presumptive close huh okay well let's just say on our work session agenda next I know I am I getting ahead of you on this all of us I'm just teasing you so I'll go back and tell him um also I had a call with uh stia's salmonberry Trail foundation's executive director Airline um and we've got a steel board and an executive meeting coming up this Thursday where we're going to be trying to move ahead a little bit on some plans for the trail so that'll be fun time I have a meeting this week with Peter Brandon who's the city manager at Upton kelder from Astound um regarding cell coverage on Highway 6. um we are having a safety on six meeting today that I can't end as well so I'll give you a briefing on that because I know you were having conversations with David Yamamoto about the cell towers and oh some of that stuff on six so I'll let you know what the Yeah latest and greatest on that is thank you uh wcva uh reception visitors Association reception coming up I think yeah you're speaking I get to listen to you again I almost had this I said that wrong good night yeah the coal pack Northwest act uh GPI Clean Water Services executive briefing is coming up I'm doing some things with paint Water Services is um is we're doing a gig with GPI so looking forward to that as well and then uh on Saturday is the Intel VIP tour at nine I think I don't know how many hours to go into that but um yeah so looking forward to that haven't behind the scenes for a few years so good to get an update so that's all I'm afraid to go neck because you're going to get all of my time okay I think I'm going to take some air time so oh okay well I'll make a short time there's not a lot to report uh we all know each other's uh schedules we've been uh doing it in our weekly updates plus I think we've seen each other every day for about the last four or five days I know can you stand it no I can work to it just brightens my every morning yeah thank you so much it's just when you're trying to run a business and also do this it's very very very bad habit I can get no sympathy I think oh no sympathy at all I would had a couple of things when Pam and I are going to assist in regard to a pirate CWS this Friday and I think that was on our agenda Thursday I've got the meeting in the governance Committee of we not governance government relations yeah it's only about two blocks from my office which is um and I would just put a little seed in your mind and most of you are probably aren't going to agree with me but that's it would be nice if we somehow consolidate some of our budget meetings I mean this thing of every night having a budget meeting is cumbersome to say the least and especially when you hear how many people are participating from the outside world I have more on my block than ever participating just where I live so it'd be nice if we could sort of do not exactly the Clean Water Service model but something that would give us maybe a day and then a couple of night meetings so that people without participate it would be easier on some of them so I'm speaking for myself but shall I have some silence now so Pam can't have all my time and keep going if you'd like oh I don't have anything to say I just did one and it's not that big a deal but I did I just wanted to have a discussion with us after I do my report so that's why um Mr Teresa thank you commissioner um there this past week I've had a couple constituent meetings went around either a climate discussion and another uh from member of our community that's interested in holding a barn dance to honor the wingspan so and I just want to say that Rachel uh I don't know if Rachel's with us today but she was uh great in helping me navigate that and to discuss with the concentrum what you know what our options are there um we I did attend the AOC legislative and board of directors meeting yesterday uh commissioner Bai talked about the meetings I think in the morning that fed up to the legislative legislative committee and uh the only thing that it was a really quick legislative meeting for us uh chair was there as well it we we did get advice from Aaron Doyle to uh take both uh Senate Bill 1096 House Bill 3620 off of the um the Slate to approve be and to vote no against them and the reason is that they were basically the it's fast tracking small pieces of land into the ugb and we hadn't had a discussion here and it wasn't it it's it's just the Senate bill that house bill died yes thank you it's Senate bill number 1096. exactly it's it's the one that allows for Fast Track ugb oh yes okay yeah outside of Metro inside of Metro yeah you have ",

here is the the way that we vote on this committee is a bit different than other places um there's some concern that if City of Salem were to have more people on the board they would somehow take the majority this is a board where if a single entity decides to vote no the whole thing stops so any of these smaller communities could choose at any point in time to Halt and you know encourage further discussion the reason why the equitability is important is because our city council member is representing like five or six times as many individuals and miles of road than their counterparts and and that is easily mixed up when it comes to talking to the community about this issue because there are very few boards that I've ever heard of that operate in such a way where one entity could stop a vote um if one we are we vote by unan we have to be unanimous in order to move forward with anything um so for these reasons of it being complicated and delicate I think it makes sense at this point to be a little bit more tempered in our response and um we're really asking for in a lot of ways legal uh light here on on this as well because there are federal guidelines that really should be investigated at a higher level um and we can do all the looking that we need but at the end of the day we we want professional help in doing so um so that's kind of where I'm coming from on it it's complicated and delicate and at the end of the day we are highly invested ourselves in each of these communities and we want each of these communities to have Equitable representation and I think that that's it's not necessarily how it's being perceived at this moment and so I just want us to move forward with Grace and caution and uh Goodwill to the community understanding that we we're really doing this because we do have everyone's best interest at heart um we're not trying to attack anybody um and I think that a slightly more tempered response might be what's needed given the delicacy and uh I think that's all thank you Director Holstrom thank you uh vice president Davidson um I appreciate all the the conversation by the members of the board and I'm I'm sympathetic to director lar miff's point of view frankly personally um I think some changes are necessary um that being said I think um the letter that we've uh drafted is is uh what's maybe necessary at this point in time um it really does um I like what one thing I like that it does is that it recognizes and it acknowledges that um this is not going to be easy and that there are differences of opinion on this uh and that we know that so um I I do like that I know that it it it's not going to be an easy conversation um I appreciate the um proposed approach of bringing in a third party to facilitate those discussions because um they haven't got very far so far without the third party so um I like the letter I support it uh and um I I look forward to um further discussions about this topic and and maybe moving further if necessary in the future thank please yeah i' i' like I just like to maybe amand and elaborate my comments um in four ways the first is um while I'm very supportive of our efforts here I'm also very sympathetic to the rural community I I grew up in sha and ston and most of my family that lives in Oregon lives in rural Maran County and so boy do I know that we get the short end of the stick on almost everything and so I I understand that I wouldn't even want to appear to be suggesting second um in my feedback on the letter I was not suggesting to not have a facilita process I believe strongly in that my and third my comment around um let's see if I can get through four without losing my train thought uh my third it was about um uh this going coming out and saying it and the spirit of that feedback was just that we've all been saying it I mean and I it almost feels a little not to be too on the nose it feels almost feels a little disingenuous not to say what our hopes are because you just finished you know very articulately describing what our intentions are I think all of us share those intentions and I think it would be it's not the hell I'm going to die on but it would be odd not to at least name that and if I were someone reading a letter I might be go well we all mean yeah okay facility process we all know what you know Cherry um and so but that's neither here nor there per se and fourth I'll just finish by saying I still stand by amending the best line please uh thank you vice president Davidson um perhaps it would be prudent to include in our letter reference to the motion that this board passed and I forgive me I don't remember the month um where we uh unanimously supported a facilitated process with the aim of achieving a more Equitable and representative voting process as the intended outcome I love that I have some thoughts a a question so I I agree with the word best and the ambiguity and uncertainty there but does that not also extend to Equitable I think other letters that we've seen demonstrate that and so I'm afraid that if we inject language like that that for many is not defined the same way we're not furthering our cause and perhaps only distracting from the immediate need which right now is a facilitated process my you know conception of what the scats policy committee should look like I I can almost guarantee will look different than what director Carney thinks and I imagine that will replicate a few times over and I I think having a third party come in right from the get-go I'm I'm willing to say that my perspective will change through that process I imagine those of us who are actually on the policy committee both representing chariots and others may as well um so I'm I I I I get the intent there's there's that tension there where I'm I'm afraid if we uh I I I fully support Chang in the lens I don't know if uh referencing the previously approved language gets us to where we want to go director Duncan I just want to note you bringing up Equitable is prudent because within this committee we have struggled to define equity and equality differently and accurately so I I just wanted to that might need to be spelled out um just for clarity since for for some re there's some contention around the difference between the two um so yeah and and I I don't know if I am ready to have a definition session right now on like what we think as Equity um I I think our time might be better served elsewhere right now but please if I may add a few things so I I think we need to go back to what the original ask was from the staff recommendation was to bring in a facilitator uh I think if we get over prescription prescriptive we're presupposing we know what we want and part of the facilitated discussion may bring up other opportunities that we may think is better than what we think are thinking right now and and ultimately we can bring those array of options back to Chuan and and give guidance to our our our representative for when it comes time to decision- making because it's also more than just what the representation looked like we're asking to update and modernize the whole document which has different meanings for different things so I think ultimately it's the the basic ask is we need a facilitator to go through all this and then bring back things as as they're developed because there may be a better solution than one vote one one any one vote or weighted or maybe a third or fourth option and we don't want to put in the letter this is what we want and then oh we changed our mind MH and I mean I think the reality is that we can submit many of these letters moving forward as we get more information through a facilitated process um this is not our one and only shot at this um I I also just want to flag as uh maybe an anecdote that I think if I'm doing my math right a majority of this board wasn't even born when the original Cooperative agreement was signed and if the only change I didn't mean to shame anyone he said yeah I I didn't say who I was not born um the the point I'm trying to make is that if the only change has been the addition of a new government to the policy committee I think it's the addition of enville to the geographic boundaries is a wonderful opportunity to reconsider this um and I'm I'm excited by the opportunity I I think these entities as Cooperative functions government collaborative governance are fascinating they can be very productive um and I think the most important thing that they can do is regularly do tuneups and this is a great opportunity to do that so but any other director Duncan I just wanted to strengthen what um uh director or what what what you just said um specifically sorry I struggle with the formalities constantly and that's why I often just say you or you when we're doing these um but I wanted to say that I just wanted to picky back on what you had to say because I fully agree that um I think there's something about that that strengthens our argument in a way of being a little bit more aloof to the side because we're preventing presenting something that's incredibly logical and nonpartisan by just simply asking for the facilitated process at this time and refraining from putting in what I mean like you said many of us have already differing um opinions and a lot of the some of the other letters that we've seen come in are a little bit more on the nose and I think just simply asking for more information is very intellectual standpoint and I appreciate it so thank you for voicing it in that way please um thank you vice president Davidson I would just say I really appreciate the thoughtful comments of this board um and your attention to this I do think it is a great opportunity and um I especially appreciate the comments around a facilitated process potentially bringing to light solutions that we haven't considered um as it",

        "text": " number of a number of years um rather than the lifetime of the project and i think a lot of what we heard too is limited capacity um to to engage on these tasks and i want to jump in actually i sent out a report or christy did uh next slide of from mterra the midwest tribal energy resource association and nrel keep going so these are points that i pulled directly from their report um so some of these biggest the biggest barriers they've identified with um national outreach um is lack of tribal representation at the utility state or federal level uh and that includes on local um local we see limited capacity clearly tribes are served by multiple utilities making engagement really difficult to navigate and and frankly costly and and very um um time intensive um keep going in many states there's net metering limits or a lack of net metering policy uh which really inhibits the ability for cost-effective small-scale projects to um to take place on on tribal lands so really making sure that that those are in place um and it makes economic sense um is is vital um i i mentioned earlier the limit of third-party ownership we have some states that prohibit uh third-party ownership then uh again prevents tribes from uh receiving the the the tax credits and also prevents them from having a third party um contribute uh funds in lieu of those tax credits interconnection uh uh requirements both at the utility and the distributed scale um are are often difficult to work through and and um and are clearly very costly at the utility scale and backed up um keep going let's see some of these other ones um tribes being served by by local co-ops it makes it difficult particularly if they have no seat on the board um to really have a say in um in the policy making unless they go to ferc um let's just those are kind of a repeat so we'll keep going maggie we're we're over 10 minutes at this point i'm just curious if you want to yeah this is it so i think a big test thing with your we are obsessed with your powerpoint that's great yeah so i just want to uh emphasize yeah the non-taxability um the issues with with offteek and then um the property tax jurisdiction question is is really something that needs to be evaluated at every state level so thank you yeah thanks so much maggie this we like literally i have somebody being like can we just like use maggie's stuff in the report this is so good so thank you um does anyone have any if anyone has questions in the chat from maggie that would be a great way to handle it um we are 20 minutes over i tried so hard i don't know where i went wrong but um so we're 20 minutes over we want to give the break at the time that we suggested dugan i'm sorry if i'm pronouncing your name wrong and jed are cool with it so um i would love it if they could like give a signal to me that they are cool with us taking a 10 minute break and coming back to their 20 minutes of presentations it's fine with jed you can do if you need to go somewhere we can let you go and then do the break after but if you're happy to hang out just let me know yeah great okay thank you so we're going to take our 10-minute break as planned because i think we all probably need it there's been a lot of information and then we'll come back and do those presentations and then we're going to make up for that time in the takeaways and sort of breakout room section that comes after the breakouts that we'll do after we hear from um dugan and from and hopefully that all works for everyone we'll make sure that everybody gets on with their day on time of course because it's a priority so we'll see you all it's 11 17 so if we could like manage to be back by 11 25 and take like an eight minute break that'd be awesome um we'll probably get started around like how about 11 26 and we'll just see how it goes alrighty we will see you all at 11 26 thanks christy for bringing us back on track there and we will uh we'll manage our time as we go here so see you all in a few all right it's 11 26 i'm hoping people have made it back and got to do what they needed to do i fed a cat which hopefully helped my next hour and a half or so um i'm really excited that dad jorgensen is here to talk about inconduit hydro um jed whenever you're ready to get started go ahead and um just again because of the time if people have questions as he's going go ahead and put them in the chat hopefully judd can answer him when he's done and then um we'll end on dukin which i hope i'm saying thanks christy thanks rob i'm jed jorgensen i work with an organization called farmers conservation alliance we're a 501c3 nonprofit based out of hood river i'm going to talk about inconduit hydropower projects that are mostly from my perspective the ones that have mostly been associated uh in the context of irrigation modernization and the key barriers that we've seen over the past decade or so that have slowed or prevented project development i'm going to give some really high level context of what irrigation modernization means because that's that's pretty crucial in thinking about these projects so irrigation modernization this is a or suite of projects that we work on and hydro conduit hydropower can be integrated into these projects so what irrigation modernization is at its highest level is really large scale piping and infrastructure development end of life open canal systems with pressurized pipes when i say large scale what i really mean is thousands of miles of large diameter pipe i think four feet in diameter all the way up to 14 feet in diameter so it's really big infrastructure project there's a whole bunch of benefits that are associated with these kind of projects from water conservation being a really critical one to agricultural resilience to drought environmental improvements for rivers so conserving water you can put water back in stream for fish and wildlife economic resilience in rural communities by keeping the agricultural system alive there energy savings by pressurizing that water supply you can reduce pumping and then the potential to integrate conduit hydropower where there's surplus pressure within that pipe system or other renewable projects as appropriate if hydropower isn't possible the hydro potential that we've seen through irrigation modernization tends to range from 10 kilowatts at the smallest scale which maybe is more on all the way up to about five megawatts or so so these are community scale projects they're not the the utility scale projects that maggie and laurie are mostly working on but they do face many of the same kinds of challenges because the majority of them that we work on are qualifying facilities that would work through purpa except at that kind of smallest on-farm when we look at the opportunity across oregon there's maybe about 30 to 50 megawatts of capacity potential across the state if all the possible projects could be installed associated with those broader modernization opportunities so these aren't significant from a grid decarbonization perspective but they are very significant or they can be very significant locally because they can provide a revenue stream back to an irrigation district that helps to increase the pace of that modernization and all those other benefits those revenues get reinvested in projects that provide further benefit to that community so we see a lot of different with these projects uh both for new ones and for the existing fleet of irrigation district conduit hydropower projects that are out there and in the state there's already about 35 megawatts so you know there's about 35 megawatts there maybe we could double that with new projects one of the coolest opportunities that we see is that these tend to be a relatively large generation source again from that community perspective but with a relatively lar relatively small compared to you know solar this is a building that could have a five megawatt generator in it and sometimes that generator might be relatively closely located to a rural community so there's an opportunity to have that function as the backbone of a resilient power system potentially energizing all or part of a utility feeder that could serve critical facilities during a public safety power off event or some kind of other outage potentially before a natural disaster of some kind doing that gives you an opportunity to maximize that the value of that existing resource or a new resource that's being and if you're able to power several critical facilities that might be on a utility feeder you might be able to do that at less cost adding solar and storage at each of those facilities individually instead what you'd be looking at would be adding storage at that hydropower plant and maybe adding some switching at the substation or elsewhere on the utilities distribution or transmission system to enable that power flow to operate and be integrated into their outage restoration so there's a really great example of this potential that i think is is interesting over near the redmond airport in uh near bend uh so redmond that airport in redmond is set to be the state's emergency command center in the case of a cascadia earthquake there is a north unit irrigation district canal that runs right by the airport just to the east of it there's a potential opportunity there to build maybe a one and a half megawatt hydropower facility next to the airport there there's also another potential hydropower facility that could be built about a mile away that would be more like two megawatts further up the road there's a 10 megawatt solar facility a little further up the road there's another three and a half megawatt hydropower facility so within a relatively small radius you have all of these facilities that potentially could be leveraged to keep that redmond airport site and other critical facilities in that area energized during or shortly after a cascadia event so the key barriers that we've seen i'm just going to touch on three i think you know maggie gave such an impressive laundry list and we've seen all of those as well but um the the top three for us low ppa prices or power purchase agreement prices so success in the context again of irrigation modernization means getting close to eight cents per kilowatt hour on a sustained basis over time not accounting for inflation again the goal",

        "text": " in real low volume compared to everybody else so if there's any way to increase your volume that would be appreciated by me um I would just um second what um the landscape architect and Fuji and Irene have recently said I mean I'm we are very much in favor of uh Renewables however we're sort of discovering some of the impacts as development happens and then it's um some of the impacts are already established so um I'm fairly cautious about um the idea of restricting the area of analysis or impacts um I I think that the idea of really looking for some research based data to um base where we go with this would be a really good idea idea so uh yeah I just want to um I just want to voice a note of caution on that um so thanks thank you Brian uh Jimmy I see your hand up I'm gonna go ahead and see if I can unmute you I was having an impossible time unmuting myself um hey my comment relates to one of the problems with this discussion is that we're trying to answer all three questions at once um I think right now we may not understand the right size for to assess impacts for different types of facilities but it seems relatively obvious that they study areas may need to be different for different types of facilities I know from an endangered species standpoint which is something that we're experts on at at the Oregon biodiversity information center um they're really different the impacts are very different between to both types of endangered species or the types of wildlife that might be impacted and and the area at which it may impact them similarly the same thing is true for for natural areas and and protected areas it depends on the type of protected area it is and also depends on the type of facility it is and so by having a one- siiz fits all plan you sort of of get the worst of all worlds so I strongly recommend that study areas should be different for different types of facilities that they should be both resource-based and impact based and that they should extend at least a bit beyond the borders of Oregon if they're right on the edge of the state I got hey Susan um yeah I'm not sure if this is uh maybe beyond what we're talking about right now but I'm I started to become really concerned about insects and it seems like there's um no part of uh Oregon laws existing that are protecting insects that I know of um and I I wonder if we know enough about some of these different types of structures to know it you know I I feel like that ought to be a part of it um yeah I will say uh that I think you are correct that there are not uh statuses for invertebrates under like Oregon's Wildlife laws for example um and so that is something we're wrestling with and I and I guess just to address a few the comments that have been made um these three standards currently don't specific uh study requirements in them around impacts on wildlife and they don't really differentiate between protected areas that are protected for um their biodiversity Valu their eological values um versus you know a protected area that's uh protected for its recreational or aesthetic values so um those are definitely things we're trying to parse out here as part of this process and maybe continuing to work on throughout um some of our other making projects can I can I try to address that inside question in particular yes please do okay it turns out that that in 1979 the state passed what they called the Oregon natural heritage act which has been morphed into the Oregon natural act and that law allows the Oregon parks and recreation department to have a SE and6 agreement for rare threatened endangered invertebrate in Oregon um part of that agreement allows funding to come from the official mod service which does list threatened end dangered inverte including a number of butterflies and fairy shrimp um they provide funding to the parks which is managed by Cooperative agreement with our office at Oregon State University um part of the State University excuse me um and so there are a list of of rare and at risk invertebrates if the department of energy wanted to use that list it's it's developed cooperatively with the US fish and wildlife service it is true that neither organ Department of Agriculture nor that department fish and wildlife um is willing to take it on but there is a group of invertebrates that could be potentially used there's information in the Oregon biodiversity information center that could apply if people were interested in in trying to include that in assessing right yeah that may or may not be outside of the scope of this Ru making but we'll definitely um take a look at that and um you know try to if we don't if that's not something we specifically look at now uh we'll make make a not to keep that on our docket for when we're looking at um specifically the wildlife and threat and and dangered species standards later later down the road um since you've had your hand up for a little bit I'm GNA go uh with Angela and Irene thank you um comment and a question um a comment in terms of uh this being a new technology just want to remind folks that the first utility scale Sol or project that we had in Oregon was in 2019 and so you know we've had 12 years of of experience on on that that particular project and after 2009 more more utility scale projects all the time um every year in Oregon so um you know I'm not sure how much how much more time we need to fully understand the impacts um but my question was about um should study areas extend beyond the borders of Oregon and this is more of a legal question um I mean I know that our laws can't extend beyond on the borders um of our state and it seems a little strange to um extend study areas beyond the borders um is there does that happen in in other states it seems sort of unusual um I'm actually not aware of what the practice for establishing analysis areas in other states would be uh that's certainly something that we can look um you know I not sure that orgon law requires uh us to only consider impacts that occur within the borders of the state that's certainly been something that's been recommended though um so hopefully that addresses your question but uh we can definitely look at the legal question more more carefully as we're going okay um Irene if you don't if you don't mind me breaking in I I can't figure out how to get my hand up so that's our Point okay yeah it should be in your if you click on the button that says participants it should then be in the lower right corner but also feel free just to to jump in if you okay if if you don't mind so a few years ago I was involved in a wind energy project uh that was out just outside the Columbia Gorge National Scenic area and it was located in Washington state but all of the visual impacts were located on the Oregon side of the Columbia River and uh you know there there's a lot of instances I think where uh projects can be viewed from either side from Washington or from Oregon and I don't think we want to preclude the the in the um consideration of what those impacts are on either side I don't I I agree with the um with the previous speaker said that I I don't know what the legal implications are in this case it was the Columbia Gorge National Scenic area so so the review was done um within that context but it is something that uh FC should be aware of and and be thinking about thanks Dean yeah and that's a good example of you know um I know that is that that management plan was enacted part in part under advice State agreement but it does make sense in some cases to say uh you know Oregon has a policy interest in protecting certain resources um outside of the state um and the gorge I think is a great example of that I do know you know back in ancient history when we were looking at uh the uh Trojan nuclear power plant you know the council did do an evaluation of the socioeconomic uh impacts that plan would have on the kelu Long View area because that was one of the the major um Urban centers even though that's that's in Washington itself too so there there have been a lot of examples where we have look that impacts outside of the borders um and some reasons why we may want to continue to do so although that might not be the case in every every example um Irene okay can you hear me yes am I off off okay um I just I I'd like to support what Dean had to say in terms of the way I look at like things like protected areas those aren't Oregon resources they are public resources and the same thing for resources in the state of Washington um just because they happen to exist in Washington does not mean that the public at large doesn't have a vested interest and and my experience at least with wind farms has been there's been uh basically no consideration for the impacts outside of the state actually when I raised my hand I was intending to comment on the The Gorge and the fact that things that happen in Washington happen affect us very directly and things that happen in Oregon affect them very directly so um so at that comment but also um I am concerned because with the protected area standard it lists a bunch of things that are reviewed but as far as application um what fsac has been looking at is is just the um the issues that are listed in the management plan so they've been um these protected areas I'll Grant you they may have a specific component that is the focus of them being protected but all of those issues that have to do with protected areas really impact all of them and I'm concerned that that there's a a failure to deal with all of those issues in your circle so so I think it is worth really making some comments in the um I suppose in the rules that say that that all of those issues will be concerned of consideration um the other thing just in terms of uh solar developments in particular is I'll grant you that the First Solar Development may have happened in 2009 but with the focus now on renewable energy the number of U solar developments that are are coming fsac it's increasing exponentially and so the next few years are going to see a huge increase in the number of solar developments I am concerned about doing anything that's going to um cause significant uh problems where hindsight is always 2020 so so that would be my comment on areas of impact for solar and",

includes other factors like energy burden so if it's an area that has a particularly High number of people experiencing energy burden or if there's particular climate constraints like it's a colder climate or a warmer climate in the Summers I'm going to talk about the regional entities right now Camilo so just hang tight and then if you have any specific questions I'll grab them after the next two slides when we're talking about the regional entities so as I mentioned there are 11 regions in the state this is a map of those regions the regions are based on Oregon's Economic Development districts which are in statute for those who are familiar with Oregon's Regional Solutions program this is this is that same exact set of boundaries and you can see they use county lines and then they cluster certain counties together to create these different regions so um the um we'll have grants for each region you can also offer grants for federally recognized energy energy tribes Indian tribes um and then you can kind of see how these regions are are portioned out uh on the map and hopefully you know different climates will match better although you'll see some of the coastal areas are kind of matched up more Inland so we'll be kind of dealing with differences like that as needed and then next up what exactly what entities are allowed to apply to be Regional administrators and this is the list from the statute includes local governments local housing authorities non-profit organizations as I mentioned federally recognized Indian tribes and then it gets to some other um more specific type of entities Coordinated Care organizations they generally are healthcare providers in the State Community Action agencies they already administer some heat pump and Energy Efficiency programs in the state manufactured dwelling Park non-profit cooperatives and finally Electric utilities these are all eligible to apply so Camilo if you have any other questions I'm happy to answer them now um the way that we'll go about selecting these is the agency will put together a request for proposal from eligible entities off of this list for the regions and then we'll do a review process in order to determine um which particular application is the strongest for that region and I'm going to take you well I'm going to have Patricia take you off mute there you go you should be able to talk now Regional administrators are functioning at the county level so when things get organized we'll go to our County government most likely no you'll go to this eligible entity so it's not by County if you look at this region you can sort of see there's county maps but the shading is how the regions are determined so for example if you look at Eastern Oregon there's like that pale orange color where Legrand is there's three counties there that make up one region and then from there whoever gets the um whoever is selected by the agency to be the regional administrator and it'll be one of these if you see now one of these sorts of entities so somebody could reach out to us and we could be like oh you should contact ABC nonprofit that is the region one administrator does that make sense one more question when will we find out um who's got this responsibility in for the administration yeah we're aiming to have those requests for proposals out early in the new year um and then we'll be having that review process as we mentioned with selection we're hoping to have selection done in those programs up and running in time for the cooling season next year thank you for the great questions all right um I will move us on but if anyone has any other questions as you can see just raise your hand I'll grab you or feel free to put something in the chat and you're keeping tabs there um while each regional administrator will be setting up programs that will work best for their region and figuring out the details of what will work best for their customer base there are some requirements in the bill that must be consistent across all programs and one of those is the prioritization of financial assistance first the financial assistance will be prioritized for what's defined in statute as environmental justice communities so this means that in Oregon law there's this term environmental justice communities and that particular term includes a lot of different communities around the state includes communities of color communities with a lot of immigrants communities that are lower income it includes rural communities Coastal communities and there's even a longer list from there so that's one piece and then also prioritization is applied for individuals who rely on bulk fuels so I put a couple of images up here of the type of bulk fuels we're talking about with the oil tank or the wood stoves so heating oil wood stove propane are examples of bulk fuels and then also electric resistance Heating and that's that kind of old school pretty beat up baseboard heater that you'll see that picture of and the reason that electric resistance is on this list is because it is considered very inefficient it's actually a very expensive way to heat a home and paradoxically that's kind of a big word sorry but um it's often in homes where lower income folks live so you don't want the folks who have the least income to have the least efficient and most expensive heat system so that's why that that's prioritized in bulk fuels are prioritized for either public health or greenhouse gas emissions considerations among other among some energy cost concerns and then the other prioritized category is individuals who reside in a home or structure that don't have functioning heating or cooling whether it's fallen into disrepair or it was just built without an adequate heating or cooling system so I will then um call on my colleague James thanks James who's going to talk a little bit about the rebate amounts that we're considering right now yeah so we uh um planning on establishing a maximum dollar amount in the administrative rules and it's gonna uh kind of mimic uh the numbers that we're talking about in the rental program and it will flash to that side up later on um but it's going to be in the range of 4 000 uh ish to as a maximum cap up to 100 of the the cost for the the pushes installation of the heat pump uh with additional cap for related upgrades um and the regional entities when they're applying will be able to kind of propose if they want to kind of uh some ability to kind of customize that for their um as well so they might offer a lower base but then uh build it up for some of the some of the higher efficiency or so uh the idea is that we'll set a higher end and then allow uh the regional entities to customize it uh within uh well proposed to how they're going to customize it for their region and we'll kind of be able to show you some of the the similarities with the other program in terms of the max levels when we get to that slide um yeah thanks Chrissy yeah no problem does anyone have any questions right if someone wants to unmute I then go ahead hey can you hear me yeah is it primarily rebate so the community heat pump deployment program that Regional entities can decide what different types of financial assistance they want to offer in a second I'm going to talk about a different program where it's limited to essentially rebates so it's possible that the entities May provide it up front for this one for this program but then maybe like the a rental one is rebate only probably yeah yeah I'll talk about that one in a sec but yeah that's correct and then we have a question that I'm going to call on James for from Jim balderas in the chat is the cap the same for single family and multi-family I'm sorry should I go ahead yes please sure go ahead Camilo and then we'll come back to Jim's question you you alluded to this question before about coordination between federal and state agencies you know I'm wondering what what you should could anticipate whether or not uh there's going to be one system of applying for rebates or would a consumer have to apply to both state and federal when the when the uh organization has the plans prepared uh good question we anticipate that the federal program will be run we run through the states and so hopefully we'll be able a uniform system that wouldn't require someone to apply to our agency twice I will admit that there are other ways to get money for heat pumps in the state right now that are not exactly going to be that neat some will be one application for example but we are working with those other entities for example the Oregon Housing and Community Services has a program also the Energy Trust of Oregon also utilities so we're working with all of these entities to try to make it as easy as possible for folks to apply to our to get our dollars as well but just know that the coordination and the streamlining is something that's on our mind and I think we'll take some time to to get right but on the federal one that one shouldn't be as much of a trick thank you thank you all right so Jim's question was is the cap the same for single family and um thanks uh so the community heat pump deployment program is uh gonna be aimed at uh individuals who reside uh in the regions for the entity so it's going to be kind of targeted at those owner dwellings and uh the cap will be the same as whether it's a single family dwelling or it's a dwelling unit in a structure but the kind of rental side the land uh the landlord of a rental unit will be able to apply to the rental program that Christie's going to talk about in a um and so that'll be a separate program they'll apply to hope that answers the question Jim yeah we'll talk a little bit more about it when we get to the um that slide that's for the research great I forgot to say because I know we have somebody that's on the phone that if you want to um raise your hand you can press star three and to come off mute it'll be star six so just so you know I I meant to say that early on um all right we have another question in the chat and that's from Paul hi Paul will there be an allocation formula to distribute funds to each region and um I uh the answer is there will be an allocation formula it's in the bell I mentioned it earlier um and I just named a couple of",

        "text": " the umatilla electrical co-op follows the existing uec line and would go up to another substation or existing substation so um it also depicts the turbine strings and access roads which are the longer linear purple lines throughout the site it's a little bit on the procedural um the notice of intent was filed in september of 2017. the draft proposed order was issued by the department in april of 2022 in between there was a series of revised preliminary applications changes in site design um but the dpo was issued in april it opened a 37-day public comment period we had a public hearing pendleton in person on may 26th the hearing was held open at the applicant's request to respond to comments received at that hearing that hearing just closed in the previous agenda item so the public hearing has been closed and where we're at today is council's of the dpo um after today the next steps would be to issue the proposed order which the department will work on so today is the opportunity for council to provide comments to staff on the draft proposed order and the issues that have been raised on the record as a result of public comment and through the public hearing after today the department will prepare the proposed order taking into consideration all of the comments received comments from council comments on the record and any reviewing agency consultation when we issue the proposed order in the future we will also issue a notice of a contested case and then unless council has any questions at this point or comments on the process what i will launch into next is the review of the draft proposed order seeing no comments i will proceed so the first standard that we're going to cover today is the general standard of review the general standard of review requires that a proposed energy facility comply with all applicable oregon standard statutes and rules including those of agencies other than the energy facility citing council the council consults with other agencies to determine compliance with the and it's important to note that fsec follows an evidentiary process to determine if council standards are met when evaluating an application for a site certificate so under the general standard of review there is a provision that when the applicant has shown that a proposed facility cannot meet the council standard that they can ask for a balancing determination from council and in the application applicant did request that council make a balancing determination on the fish and wildlife standard and specifically as it applied to the washington ground squirrel squirrel in the asc the applicant requested the balancing determination primarily because they did not agree with odfw's determination of what is category 1 habitat for washington within the analysis area so the department reviewed the information submitted by the applicant had several conversations with odfw um over their category one habitat determination and we ultimately concluded and recommended that council deny the applicant's request for balancing primarily because we felt that the applicant had not evaluated or demonstrated why it could not meet the and that did not really demonstrate that they couldn't build the facility without a balancing determination so that was the basis of our recommendation at the public hearing on may council member jenkins agreed with our evaluation and also since the dpo was issued and at the public hearing the applicant has indicated that they're not going to push pursue this issue and will accept the council's determination on the balancing request do you want us to comment on each of these as we go through i feel like if you have comments or questions as we go through you should definitely interrupt me and chime in i thought it'd be nice oh really it's getting fuzzy okay between two computers okay did you did you have a question okay yeah and if i'm missing it just chime up so the next standard that we're going to talk about is the organizational expertise standard the standard requires that council determine that the applicant has the abilities and the resources to build operate and retire the facility in determining compliance with the standard the council considers the past experience with similar projects a history of any regulatory citations and other evidence of technical managerial and organizational expertise that can help demonstrate that the applicant can meet this standard so as part of our review of the application the department evaluated the alberta utility commission website for compliance and enforcement actions against capital power and we can affirm that there are no citations or pending citations or actions the department has recommended the council find that the applicant through its experience of its parent company capital power that they have demonstrated that they have the organizational expertise necessary to design construct and operate the facility and retire the facility as this standard requires and the department has recommended that council require that the applicant provide evidence of a shared use between the applicant and uac umatilla electric company if they do indeed select the uec cotton wood transmission line routes and at this point i know we had additional discussion uh comments from council a submittal from the applicant just now before the hearing or before this agenda item and i'm going to kick it over to sarah so sarah can pick up the discussion of comments in the review of the memo test test so apologies i know it doesn't sound nice but uh good afternoon council sarah esterson for the so as kate mentioned i'm going to walk you through uh comments and applicant responses on the record of the dpo related to this so on the previous slide it was presented that the applicant is a limited liability company it was created for the sole purpose of being the applicant for this application and then would be the certificate holder for the site certificate if issued so then as a project specific llc it doesn't have its own experience and resources to meet this standard but it relies on its parent company which is capital power individuals that represent the llc are employed by the parent company and so at the may 26th hearing council member condon expressed concern uh about relying on the resources of the parent company when the parent company hadn't provided any specific guarantee or warranty that it stood behind the project and provided the financial stability that being expressed in the application in response to those comments in oral testimony representative of capital power and the applicant matt martin provided some additional information which we have on the screen but that included an affirmation that the parent company was the entity that would fund the project and that it would it stood behind the application and the development of the project he also explained that capital power corporation had been an entity since it was a publicly traded company it has a standard and poor investment rating of triple b negative that's how you say it which is a rating you can only get uh if you're financially stable and he also explained that there was um the parent company has over 870 um so i guess i would then turn to the evidence that was just submitted today yes for the record yes uh is it is it minus or negative or positive it was confirmed it was minus and so maybe that was just uh an error in the middle uh so yes so i'll turn now to this additional um document that was submitted today for your review and consideration which is a letter signed by the parent company's senior vice president and chief legal um and it provides uh a statement that says this is a firm statement that capital power stands behind the project um it's intended to authenticate the testimony provided at the hearing and then i would know additional the letter references additional attachments which we have printed for you and we can distribute for your review as i understand it it's excerpts from the application and and from the um the transcript of the hearing so with that i'm might so it would be our intent to incorporate this additional facts and evidence uh into the findings of the proposed order so that that would what is what we would be asking council to rely upon to make findings that the applicant has the uh to design construct and operate the facility in compliance with council standards site certificate conditions and in a manner that protects public health and safety madam chair cindy condon for the record so um one i want to thank capital power for providing this letter and speaking to the issue brought up at the last meeting i do and mind you we just got this letter letter and i am not an attorney so but in the letter uh the last paragraph of the first page please allow this letter moving on to the second page to ensure that the project is built to the appropriate standards and within the regulator regulatory framework approved by the council and i appreciate um that it will be built um but the operation of the i i would be certainly much more comfortable if it read it designed built and operated since that is the standard um and i don't know whether it's intentional to leave that out i would guess not i want to make sure that stan stands behind as used in this paragraph can be interpreted as a guarantee or warranty that's just a specific comment so this is hanley um so do you think we should do that in the form of an approval condition is that what you're uh cindy conan again for the record i believe the application and the review that was done was relying on capital power to to take that and so i i would recommend it being a yeah i i would recommend it being a i support that thank you this is marcy so kent and family are saying they support jordan perry and anne says yes jordan says sure perry you need to lean into the microphone sorry harry you've got a yes and i say yes is um so with that would council be interested in staff putting together a draft condition for your review to make sure we're on the same page and we can come back in a standard or two cindy condon i i would appreciate that and so i mean since we're here are you envisioning a pre-construction requirement that a parent co guarantee or similar type of document be provided that affirms capital power stands behind the design build and operation of the project cindy conan again i yes here yeah if i may for the record talking i think this kind of tease up a good sort of procedural um check-in excuse me swallow it okay um and and if we need to seek clarification we will but this is a good example where you know a sort of a question or an idea was brought up and that's fine um and i think us sort of fleshing that out and sending it to council would also be good but it also is very important that we know um what you're interested in so as much clarification and direction from you today really helps us because",

        "text": " sort of crazy period before we move into subsequent rounds we're actually going to move into trying to look into that providing some clar ification uh on some of the items based on what was required in Statue because this was actually a statutory requirement this consultation that made it into the rules but there was never any specified guidance of how that had to come in and we've done a lot to go to go deeper into our other required items to create that guidance and based on this round and and subsequent rounds we definitely see the need to go and try to re uh try to respell this out a little bit better for applicants on what we're looking for vers what the utilities can even provide at this point in time in a project cycle as when it comes to the feas yeah and we're happy to do it and it's actually pretty useful on our side to receive information ahead of time but maybe um like a a form or something like that to just kind of guide what is me what information is wanted from you guys because um they're not doing a full interconnection review that's not something but we are definitely taking a hard look at system protection and making sure that if um somebody receives a grant we are not going to decline the interconnection application because nobody wants that to happen but to do that system protection review is kind of what I'm talking about is um depending on the size of the project could take longer or shorter could be more complex less complex and there were some very large ones that came through okay yeah I think um as we as we dive deeper into this this feels like something that we might want to get a few of our U of our utility reps uh together try to find out sort of what is that process for you what is the from you know even the cus to the I what are what are the process and what are you really providing versus what we really needing at that time as well as what information would be valuable to you from an app from a project that's being a proposed project not an actual at this point and then formulate some guidance cuz I I know uh all of the utilities are going to have separate they're going to have separate pieces about what this really means what it entails what we're asking for what's good for them to have at this point in time uh as it's in a proposed state so I think that's a great I think it's a great example we were looking at doing that guidance but that'll even be more beneficial if we are able to touch vase with our with our utility reps and yeah happy to help with um our thoughts on our side if it would be useful wonderful thank you Audrey yeah that's something that's been in there it's it's it's on a it's on one of my famous post notes on my desk actually we need to address this yeah thanks for bringing it up and I think it's a rule thing it's a statutory and Rule thing yeah statute has something but it doesn't have like a letter it's like loose on what it looks like so remember us trying to figure out what even rule doesn't have rule says that that's one of the options is a letter U but the the it's built upon consultation with the utility and stakeholders for feasibility yeah great well with that I don't see any other hands up for me um oh wait Shannon's back hi Shannon come on back hi sorry being in a pest here um I'm trying great I'm trying to unpack and better understand and I Know It This is a whole other long hour and a half conversation but about what that BPA restriction is to the cus we're working with a couple um and we've definitely come up upon their own 25kw metering limits but this is clearly something else that you're talking about no it's the same thing they can only have a certain percentage of Renewables on their system so it's not just net metering it's like just a certain amount that they can have um and I back when this was first when this program was still first being built I could tell you like the percentage or the amount they were allowed to have but because of residential solar many utilities are like at their cap with BPA and so they can't add more Renewables without being in violation of their contract and it's something we actually have on our list a some of our staff are doing like a let's ask BPA questions sort of thing good on our list because they're doing their new provider of choice contract process and we're just sort of curious if there might be some movement on that because we get calls from I mean kind of unrelated to this program and hopefully this is useful information for others on the line and of interest but we'll get calls from like I remember specifically the Dows we've had a few calls that like have kind of accidentally Fallen my way in the years past um and it was the Dows specifically where there was a solar provider doing a lot of work to like get interest and then the homeowners were calling us to be like our utilities as we can't um like what can you do to fix this like was like an organized campaign to like call us to try to like fix the law only it's not us it's BPA it's Federal um so uh so yeah so it's definitely like an issue not just for large well in this I'm not saying LGE these are these are large compared to a a rooftop solar on a residence projects so these larger small scale projects like in CP um versus like residential they're even bigger right so then it's even more of a challenge for them to fit into the resource mix for some of those some of those um localities thank you that's that's really helpful I guess you just um Unearthed another priority policy yeah it's definitely an interesting interesting issue thanks yeah and those contracts last a long time and the one that is currently in place has been in place for a long time too so it was like you know back when that didn't see when that seemed like a lot of Renewables if that makes sense yeah yeah exactly so right so we need to get grol to P BPA and into shape got it peasy yeah no problems thanks Shannon and now I really think I'm happy to come back if anybody has any other comments or questions and I'll put my email address in the chat if anyone wants to reach out that way too wonderful all right well we'll uh go ahead and uh if you think of questions about the the legislative change concept uh we will we can jump back into that uh in the comment perod a little bit later on as well um but for now I'm going to go ahead and jump in as a a quick summary for our first two rounds of c um and this is just a really really big overview is that uh in our planning projects uh the ones you see on the left side of the screen these are the planning projects that have actually gone all the way through uh the grant process and have gone their grants are completed with their final dispersements uh have been paid out um and I believe uh each of those except for one uh is also a round three construction applicant uh clth community college did something a little different in round two uh or they would be included in this one uh and then we have a couple of construction projects that have completely wrapped up we're just basically pending uh inspection and a little bit more on one a little bit of documentation uh but they have notified us they are complete and we're setting those up so we'll be into grant complete and uh project completion on our first two construction projects from the program uh a lot of our projects are a lot more extended in time so that's why you're not seeing a lot more of the construction projects coming into uh completion uh and then one of the items that James will be talking about with our proposed rule changes will probably wind up We Believe are going to accelerate uh the timelines on a lot of the cup construction projects but we'll get to that in a bit um and uh and then of course along those lines about 11 to 13 uh grantees have started or near uh completion and as I said uh James will cover that second payment option uh that's probably going to present faster Cycles if we go to the uh next slide please and uh as many of you know on May 10th we wrapped up the third opportunity round for the C program uh it was we had 75 applications submitted which equated to about 47 million in funds requested uh the bucket we had available this round we actually bumped it up uh 6 million from 12 million in the first two rounds to 18 million uh in this round um which was a good thing because uh this was the highest number of applications for a c round uh as as well as uh overwhelming amount of the construction projects that came in which were a total of 55 41 of those uh are resilience projects and actually we're in the process of doing some information requests and we had a couple of projects select the wrong category on their application so we're very likely looking 43 uh potential resilience construction projects that would be moving on to a competitive review along with that we had 20 planning applications and as I said before with a couple of those round one planning grants that wrapped up another really really uh piece of exciting news for the program and really showing the efficacy of the program is that 22 of our 33 current planning uh grantees submitted for construction funding uh in this third opportunity round that represents 67% of our current grantees uh some of those have not completed their planning they're in that final stage of doing their project reports and their final documentation so that's how they were in a position uh to have the information necessary to be able to move their projects into construction so that's uh very very exciting it has also Amplified the competitiveness this has always been an excellent competitive program um but the uh competitiveness for the projects moving into competitive review has really gone up another notch and we're really excited for getting into that process for this third round if we could go to the next slide please and so as just a quick breakdown uh construction resilience recommends or uh uh equals out to 35 5.2 million in requests construction Renewables sits at about 10.1 in requests uh and then planning projects combined uh represent just a little over 1.5 million uh in requests and I'm going to go ahead",

question the chair just ask around shifting into HHS look at in order How Could you um I'm not asking where it falls in the org chart I'm just trying to understand some boxing end going on here so I don't know what box I I'm not I'm not I think a development was mentioned HHS was mentioned and then you made a comment so I'm just not following everything that was just said so we are currently determining how we best organize our work based on the board's direction as we move forward and aligning with our current our current available resources here at Washington County that is it how we team how we collaborate together and how we get the work done in service to the community we have to continue to be flexible and Nimble internally and that means sometimes we have to stop doing certain things so we can start doing something else based on evolving Community need and that may mean how we work as a team may be different than a week before to how we're working moving forward and that's just the continued kind of culture that we're building here at Washington County not just reflective of this conversation but any conversation in general is that helpful yeah okay understandable I just yeah thank you thank you so this is our climate planning timeline moving forward so um but wait this is the collaborative um starting spring of this year through winter of 2025. uh on this timeline I'd like to bring to your attention uh the community engagement Milestones uh we'll be working with a consultant over approximately an 18-month period on a multi-phase community engagement process with a consultant we will identify established County committees councils and Boards such as acre and the public health advisory Council um that can potentially work with us as collaborators in developing the climate adaptation plan we also plan to collaborate with community-based organizations that work with and represent highly impacted and marginalized communities so phase one of our engagement efforts should be complete by December of 2023. this will help us identify the climate adaptation needs of our community phase two will be completed by July of 2024 and will involve working with our community and our partners to prioritize adaptation needs phase three uh will be complete by December of 2024 and includes working with our community on adaptation strategies informed by these needs the community's needs and priorities and finally phase four complete uh by July 2025 we will be working with community on the climate adaptation plan efforts across this timeline will result in climate County climate change adaptation plan by the end of 2025 that leads with race centers Equity diversity and inclusion and is responsive to the house bill so thank you for your time today we look forward to receiving additional feedback and questions Commissioners what are your questions and comments we started off by some comments didn't even have to do it this time brought it over good job I'm a slow learner but it happens old dogs yeah old dogs well thank you for the work I mean obviously there's a lot of passion around the subject I think we're all trying to understand the implications of whatever route we go it's important work we understand that I don't think anyone has not recognize that I think as we dialogue I think this is the listening public or anyone else I think it's a little premature to uh to suggest uh that anyone who takes a position or is asking questions is doing some devil's work or something by asking those questions or is not really understanding the issue I heard the speaker earlier today come on and it happened to be directed at our chair but um those kinds of comments I think are unfortunate because it there's a lot of issues in the whole climate question I'm kind of rambling but here's my thoughts uh one I always look at this and say yeah it's kind of a we're looking at the same cause all the time greenhouse gases greenhouse gases greenhouse gases no one disputes that that's an important issue but there's more than just that issue I mean it has to do with you know natural occurrences of capital for Millions here we'd still have dinosaurs if it weren't an Ice Age we just wouldn't have other kinds of climatic conditions if there weren't changes and so some adaptation is necessary and I think that's what you said but we need to understand that and I think this is the process that we'll all go through together so I hope it's not just as simplistic as saying gee if we cut the greenhouse gases in Washington County Oregon that the whole world's going to change well frankly with the Chinese building more coal-fired by our plants every day and we're in the same world I don't know how to quite get out of that that's I mean it's kind of like doing something and thinking we're going to cure the evils of the ocean it's not going to happen quite that way we need to figure out how we we deal more comprehensively and in a system so I think that's the adaptation part um I'm also concerned that we understand what this is a cost I mean we can do a lot of things and I certainly don't want to leave to my great grandchildren a world that's worse than I find it today but I don't know what that cost is going to be I mean we've got to be aware that the only way the country propped itself up during the recession was infused have large Capital amounts there's not that kind of money anymore what's going to happen if we prop up are we propose things people aren't able to pay for you think you have a population disparities in income and wealth now you're really going to have it so we're I think we need to look at that and so I my rambling says this is not an easy question it was easy we all would have done it uh chair mentioned that some of us have been through this uh before we have but not as comprehensively as you have done it not as maybe well thought out as you're going to do it but we attempted and uh so we're not insincere in the work we're just trying to understand but so what were my main Cube takeaways please don't always just say it's Greenhouse Greenhouse Greenhouse Greenhouse not when we say well we'll go to the electric vehicles because that's secure for everything and we know it costs seven times as much energy to create a electric vehicle as it does gas-fired one we know that we're going to sit there and not have the infrastructure to do it what's that going to cost us we understand that we've got Partners throughout the world who are doing things that we need to have some kind of a climate action plan worldwide we're all going to be I mean we're all in this together so we need to understand that we understand we need to have something public afford and we need to sit there and be thoughtful I think with one another and no matter how crazy our comments might be because we're trying to understand all this too that people won't draw conclusions about all this too soon or pick on any one in an individual uh I was a little sensitive about comments this morning so I apologize this over the speaker but I just think that's a little a little premature in making comments before we go through it but I appreciate what you did but I appreciate what we're going to hear and I hope that your proposal your RFD and Consultants are thoughtful enough to look more comprehensively than just say one trickle fix it all the world will be better I would have fixed it 20 years ago if that was the case so that's my comments thank you any other commissioners I'm absorbing a lot of a lot of comments I'm absorbing a lot of information here and um I really hadn't thought about a structural type of uh situation here so as as the chair mentioned well I just asked the simple question which related to why not essentially why not re-org resources into HHS right given those public health approach we've already got a really knowledgeable environmental health folks and whatnot so that's what that kind of just getting at that's all and I hadn't really thought about that so that's that's what I'm saying the um the one piece that I'm I've said before that I will continue to say is I really am interested in the community engagement and making sure and I do see that as a part of this moving forward I'm not sure what that what that looks like in terms of how Okay barely that's not what you're saying thank you so much so it gets really sensitive about that so I just want to make sure and so I I just want to be on record saying that that is extremely important to me I think we hear it uh you know everywhere we go so as we as we move forward that voice is important to have at at the table so thank you thank you I'll give them a break to commissioner um thank you for your great presentation uh first of all Robin good luck to you uh City of Hillsboro um and look forward to somehow crossing um hopefully you'll be doing climates you'll somehow Beyond this journey with the county as well so I'm glad you're not leaving Washington County so you're somewhere in Washington County uh great presentation um and and thank you to you both um and I heard your message you know mitigation and adaptation are interlinked and I think there's no debate we've heard from the community that we can't move away and it doesn't sound like that's what we I'm very confused of the direction we're taking from a public health professional I have concerns about what is uh we're not going to be doing focusing on this part but I trust your leadership Marie and and and your judgment and as our local Health Public Authority officer official I trust your judgment in coming to the board to give us um information that so for us to make that sound decision with that um I am a bit concerned about the direction we're going and in terms of I hear I don't know the framing the titling was climate adaptation and I think we're sending a message to our community that we're moving away from climate mitigations so I think we need to be a bit more that's not what that's not what I either we never were doing climate mitigation we've had no actions I hear you I'm gonna finish my comment uh and say that the community we need to be strong in how we message because",

        "text": "uh hi and welcome to this video series uh with the community renewable energy grant program uh my name is Jason canaus I'm a program analyst in what we call the c-rep program and hello my name is Clay Deckard I'm also a program analyst with the crap thank you uh clay and I put together this series uh this is to uh cover the uh key application sections and questions we're not going to be going through every single one just the uh kind of the key questions on the application for both planning and Construction Grants in in the video series for each and this is uh more focused on what you'll find under the competitive review scoring criteria in your particular opportunity announcement but first what we want to do is just kind of do a brief overview of the C rep program and we'll go ahead and just jump right in uh house bill 2021 established the sea rep program and its intent was to offset costs of planning a developing Community renewable energy projects to support projects and traditionally underserved communities throughout the state as well as to promote small-scale Community renewable energy projects and provide direct benefits to communities across Oregon by improving energy resilience creating local jobs promoting Economic Development and reducing local energy costs and next I'm going to let clay talk about the program's budget okay the legislature gave us two main budget priorities in the crap program at least half of the funding must go to projects that have a Reliance aspect under the program definition and rules and we'll cover this in details later in the presentation and the second priority is that at least half the funding must go to projects that primarily serve members of environmental justice communities and we'll get into those details as well as we go through the presentation all right thank you clay and uh you'll see this particular graphic published on our website uh this is a breakdown of our particular programs uh and the maximum Grant award for those programs as well as the maximum uh eligible cost percentage for the reimbursement of a particular program I just wanted to pay one particular note uh to a construction project that is a renewable energy only that is still the maximum Grant award could be up to a million dollars for that project but only 50 percent of those eligible costs up to the one million dollars and additionally a couple of really important program notes and that's that grants will be awarded on a competitive basis and will include performance agreements and time limits for both starting a project and completing a project and that that's within both the planning grants and within the Construction Grants uh and then that competitive review basis we will get into more details uh in this in the next video about the importance of that competitive review process as it relates to you and your application another item that we really want to point out at the front end here is that grant funding if awarded grant funding is paid to the grantee or the applicant and may include up to 30 percent Advance with the rest reimbursed to grantee after the project is complete and the final report has been approved on construction projects that would also include a site inspection the grant May cover eligible costs incurred by the applicant as shown via paid invoices as part of the final report and Department of Energy payments are made to grantees only so grantees should follow their own procurement and finance policies when working with any partners and next up I'm going to go back over to Clay he's going to talk about some of our program definitions that are that are very important to pay attention to okay I've got a sample uh definition up our main definition of a community renewable energy project and this is right out of the house bill 2021. I put this one up I'm not going to read it I'm just going to point it out as all of our projects need to fit into this definition and this also includes those projects that have a resilience component and then we have more detailed definitions for the resilience components which we'll get into next a little bit um so here we have what community energy resilience is in general and then what a community energy resilience project is the summary of that is the systems must provide Power and a grid outage and the system must support critical public services to the community it must support facilities essential to the public welfare and so as you can see crap has very specific definitions and I want to take this as a reminder that you go through and you read the Oregon administrative rules for this project the links are on our website you can go back even and read the whole um section there's only like three sections in the bill that covers the crap program read those and you'll see how all of them are related and condensed into the opportunity announcements and so knowing the definitions is key to having an eligible and competitive application so that you aren't speaking to some generic industry um definition but you've actually dialed in to these program definitions excellent thank you clay and and you'll find during the course of these video presentations on either either planning or construction projects that clay and I will continually remind people to go back and read the bill go back and read the rules read your opportunity announcements that's going to along with and maybe even before finishing up this video series it's going to create a more successful application um I just want to jump in and this is also in the bill as is that the eligible renewable energy projects for crap are solar geothermal hydroelectric wind biomass landfill gas biogas wave and tidal energy systems as well as ocean thermal energy technology systems as well as electric vehicle charging or EV charging as long as that is paired with a new renewable energy system or an existing Renewable Energy System and as we move into our eligible resilience component in tandem with a renewable energy system those would be energy storage such as most predominantly batteries or battery backup storage and uh micro good micro grid Technologies and I'm going to go ahead and bounce back to Clay and he's going to talk about one of our Key Program priorities and benefits okay so we covered the resilience which is that 50 budget priority to those projects that have the resilience component the other 50 budget priority relates to qualifying communities which is one of our definitions but all that definition does is point to the definition for environmental justice communities in House Bill 2021 and that's it in its entirety it basically just lists these types of environmental justice communities the c-rep rules do not have specific definitions for these individual types of environmental justice communities including you know rural communities communities experiencing lower incomes for example Odo understands the definitions vary across government entities and so applicants might decide which debt our applicants may decide sorry which definitions to use and you must detail and demonstrate how your projects are in an environmental justice community and separately how and to what extent your project serves the members of environmental justice communities and we'll be looking for you to explain which definition you used and any other details about the quantities of you know the size of the community that you're helping or the dollar amount of your program that is dedicated to those communities the more detail the better the application we also have all of this stuff is competitively reviewed and and on a scale so you can get partial points you can get full points you can get no points for these different criteria and so a great place again to start is the review criteria that are in the opportunity announcements um we also have additional resources on our website that gets to more around the different government um websites that Define these environmental communities in different ways depending on the agency that's defining them all right now we're going to get into who is an eligible applicant right so very specific for this program it's it's it's organ federally recognized Oregon tribes there are nine of them in Oregon consumer owned utilities and then a whole list of public bodies as defined by Oregon revised Statute 174.109 but this includes cities counties local service districts sometimes called Special Districts public school districts community colleges public utilities and others there's something like 43 listed in in that organ revised Statute so take a look the links are in our documentation all right great thank you clay um and as we're getting close to wrapping up this first video uh just going to do a real quick rundown of our application process and and that that begins after you go through that and fill your application out of submitting that application uh and then um that your application will go through what's called a completion and eligibility review from internal Department of energy staff uh people like clay and myself will be looking these over uh determining the eligibility those projects those applications that are determined eligible move into what we are alluding to the competitive review process uh and uh and as you would see in your opportunity announcement scoring criteria that review process will go directly through that criteria those criteria over project strength and feasibility program priorities and project benefits or Community benefits uh and as well as the equity considerations that we're talking about as well as just the general project diversity both the type of project the location of the project in the state and so that's kind of a brief rundown I'm not sure clay do you have anything you want to add to that yeah just one thing to wrap it up um first of all that first part application submission this current um the deadline is February 15th at 5 pm um and each round stands on its own so um we we compete and because the the rules allow the program to make adjustments and changes between each round and so always read the opportunity announcements read the rules in the application read our user guide um because there are differences from round two than there were in round one pretend like it's a brand new application in effect if you're coming from round one um we also recommend that before you start an online application and even before you watch the rest of these videos it gets into more details on the application questions and scoring criteria is that you first thoroughly review the opportunity announcements that fit your project and the application user guide that's posted on our website and that you take that information in you spend some time um you know either creating your project or if your project is already set writing your application a little bit and Gathering your information before you even bother starting the online application then watch these videos because we give some really good clarifying information where you see overlap between sections and the application and the question are are our follow-on videos will help you decipher some of that then when you're done with all that and you you feel like you've got all your information gathered maybe you've even started writing some answers based on the user guide",

        "text": " resilience among many other important opportunities so through a series of public webinars discussions with our energy advisory work group and other interested parties we developed the principles that you see on this slide to help guide our overall approach to the federal funding for all of the programs in addition to grid resilience so I won't read all of these word for word but you can see that we are hoping to consider Equity at every step and that includes Geographic diversity we want to make sure that the benefits of this funding make it to the oregonians who need it most and are distribute it equitably around the state in designing the programs and distributing funding we will coordinate with tribal governments as much as possible and communicate clearly inclusively and efficiently to ensure that stakeholders in the public are informed and supported where possible and where internal resources allow we hope to provide technical assistance to build community capacity and support Grant recipients there's actually a position funded in the governor's requested budget to help us do this we're working across agencies to leverage expertise and support historically underinvested work to further energy and climate goals and to provide other community benefits and we'll also try to take advantage of high priority funding opportunities while also ensuring quality work that puts every available dollar to its best so these are the principles that we are applying across all of our work on federal funding as we think about program design and implementation and hopefully you'll hopefully you'll see how the program that we're talking about today is aligned with these next slide please and back to Emily all right so the purpose of the funds as outlined by the U.S department of energy is to improve the all hazards resilience of the electrical grid against disruptive events generate the greatest Community benefit in reducing the likelihood and consequences of disruptive events Advanced Doe's Equity environmental and energy Justice priorities including the justice 40 initiative and invest in the America's slide please this application to the US Department of energy is nearing submission we are required to submit a request to usdoe by March 31st 2023 for the first two allocations of funds under this Federal Odo is the state agency that will apply for receive and administer these funds next slide please under this program States tribes and territories apply directly to the federal government once awarded these Grant recipients can then run processes to issue sub-awards to entities eligible as sub-recipients such as an electric grid operator an electricity storage operator an electricity generator a transmission owner or operator a distribution provider and a fuel it is odo's intent to focus on electric utilities next slide please although the legislation contemplates allocations over five years usdoe intends to issue the first and second allocations of funding at the same time accounting for the extended application the first two allocations for the state are listed on the slide both a little less than 10 million dollars this program does have two match requirements first the state or tribes are required to provide a 15 match secondly sub-recipients are then required to provide a match as well sub-recipients will be required to match at a rate of either one hundred percent or one-third depending on their electricity sales in the previous year next slide please and while this list is not exhausted some of the eligible activities permitted under this award are weather weatherization Technologies and fire resistant Technologies and Fire Prevention systems monitoring and control Technologies the undergrounding of electrical utility pole management the relocation of power lines or the reconducturing of power lines with low lag Advanced conductors vegetation and fuel load management and many more however funds are not allowed to be used for a new electric generating facility or a large-scale battery storage facility or cyber security we've learned since our last public hearing that usdoe considers solar panels to be a part of a new electricity generation so while in general microgrids are allowable Grant and match funds would not be able to pay for solar panels as part of a microgrid next slide please federal funds will come with requirements that apply to the whole project these are some of the provisions that potential sub-recipients may want to familiarize themselves with highlights include Davis bacon Act the National Environmental Policy Act and build America by America Oda will provide pre-application technical assistance on these topics as appropriate and our resources allow slide please and now I'd like to hand it over to Rob Del Mar there we go good morning all my name is Rob Del Mar and I'm a senior policy analyst with Oregon Department of energy and I'd like to go over some of the preliminary program design features that we've got in the program and here we see the high level objectives of the proposed grid resilience program and these align with what we've described in the narrative and first we want to focus on making investments in natural Hazard mitigation and you may recall from the public hearing last August that we originally planned to focus solely on wildfire in Year One we've since had a chance to communicate with more utilities and found that in many service territories hazards such as wind and snow and ice storms actually rank higher than Wildfire as a highest risk to the utility next is community benefits and equity and we really want to maximize Equity by supporting projects that provide benefits to disadvantaged communities they're maximizing Community benefits we want to support investments in projects that are ready to go and could deliver immediate Community benefits and in addition to expediency we're looking for feedback feedback on how Community benefits should be defined and demonstrated and how to evaluate these benefits and how to evaluate whether or not a project is really ready to go and finally we want to engage with stakeholders throughout this project to design objectives metrics and criteria to guide implementation of future years of funding so years three through five we will be applying for in the future and we want to work with all of you to ensure that we have a program which continues to work for stakeholders presently you mentioned earlier Oregon's formula allocation of funds is expected to be just shy of 10 million dollars per for a total program funding of approximately 50 million over five years and the first allocation we'd expect about 19.9 million which represents the first two years of funding there is a five percent limitation of these funds um that describes that at least 95 percent of funds are to be made available as grants to eligible entities as sub-recipients the remaining funds the five percent and be used to support program Administration information sharing and technical assistance thank you we also have a small utility set aside the funding actually requires that a minimum amount of Grant funds be made available to small utilities equal to no less than the percentage of customers served by those utilities so in Oregon based on the numbers this minimum would be 25 percent that's the number of customers that are served by small Utilities in Oregon but we propose rounding that number up to 30 percent so that we can exceed the federal compliance requirements and you may recall that we proposed a 40 carve out in the public hearing last and since that time we've gotten some guidance from usdoe which caused us to Umatilla and Electric Co-op into the large utility category and that affects the split between the large and small utilities because they have a more than 10 percent of the the state's loaned their sales so even though we've reduced the percentage of the car valve for small utilities we've also proposed increasing the maximum award side for small utilities and this is because our initial budget is about twice what we were expecting in August and then this will be spelled out in more detail in the coming slides I believe we have a question we do yes uh Jennifer Jolly has a question Linda can you go ahead and unmute Jennifer please go ahead um I didn't know if you are you taking feedback on the proposal today or are you just explaining it we're definitely taking feedback um well I I would just say that the small utilities that I represent um were really disappointed to see the um from um 40 to 30 percent in the proposal for small utilities um given the the number of of utilities that are competing for this small pie um so we'll be providing more written comments on that but um it seemed like the rationale that was given in August that the larger utilities were in a better position to compete for um grid resilience funding would still stand and that the you know any error in the calculation um for Umatilla being a large utility you know fall on the larger utilities so that that's a piece of um feedback that we'll be submitting thanks Jennifer we'd love to have that feedback um and appreciate you raising it and I just want to I'll turn it over to Rob to explain further but it wasn't an error and a calculation it was the change in the status of umatill electric that really resulted in some math change for us since August so um Rob if you want to just sort of clarify how we landed on that number but again happy to have feedback yeah yeah that is very valuable feedback and I'll go through some numbers and some tables that are coming up in in some slides but um originally we had proposed to usdoe that we do a five-year running average to try to bring umatilla's customer base and load base into the small utility category but we got some clarification from usdoe that we need to use the previous year's sales according to eia and those numbers have Umatilla electric well above the 4 million megawatt hour mark that separates these so I will jump into this next table that shows the numbers for the large utility category um and this table demonstrates the draft funding distribution for large utilities um as a reminder these large utilities are those with sales exceeding 4 million megawatt hours per year and the table shows each of the large utilities with their share of annual sales and proportional maximum Grant Awards and so that bottom row the 13 of sales from Umatilla electric is what brought us from around 35 or 36 percent for small Utilities in our first proposal um thinking that 13 to the large utilities brought us down to about 25 percent of of sales in the small utilities so hopefully this will be more clear as I go through a few more slides and um yeah the purpose of all of this is certainly to get feedback from stakeholders so we're happy to hear what you all think of this so this slide shows similar information for small utilities and rather than calculate a separate value for each utility based on percentage of load as we propose for the larger utilities",

to be calculated under the statute is consistent with these 13 principles so uh so yeah so that's basically just the explanation there um but it's something the council has to include in the rulemaking record before you make your final decision is findings related to these 13 standards okay so uh the last issue that we had was was related to the updated of the monetary offset rate that rate uh as i mentioned is is used to comply with the current emission standards um because the standard is set to 17 below most efficient plan in place at the time that the council sets the standard almost all facilities have to offset at least some other facili their emissions so if you were to say build the most efficient plant in oregon uh you would still need to offset 17 of your emissions under the existing and all applicants to date use the monetary pathway to do that and that is by paying the climate trust to basically invest in offset projects on behalf of the the amount of money they need to pay to the climate trust is based on a monetary offset rate set in rule and the statute uh provides that the council cannot change that rate by more than 50 percent in any two-year period and that any change must be based on the empirical evidence of the cost of offsets and the council's finding that the standard will be economically achievable with the modified rate for natural gas-fired power plants the carbon dioxide emission standards were established in 1997 the councils increased the rate four times most recently on uh in june of 2020 when the council set the current rate of 285 um that means that effective july 1 2022 uh the the last rate was effective july 1 20 um 20. uh you can change the rate by up to 50 percent uh we just wanted to provide a little bit about the empirical evidence of the current cost of offsets um this graph shows uh the monetary rate over time set in rule as well as where it would be after this proposed increase it shows the average voluntary market in yellow which you can see is just where we would end up um and i want to point out that that voluntary price includes a lot of different types of offset projects all across the world um it's not subjects necessarily the same restrictions or a rigor that um compliance offsets typically are so while it's a good indicator we can expect that it's lower than what would be incurred to me with this the council um and that's kind of evidenced by the blue line which is the average price um calculated by the climate or incurred by the climate trust in actually investing in offset projects the climate trust uses they typically invest in forestry and land use offset projects and um have a preference for local projects either in oregon or us which are typically much more expensive than projects in say the global south or or certain other things um i also wanted to just point out that the way that the climate trust calculates their average price is on a basis so um the actual cost of offsets incur in any given year are different and uh when i bought this data from them they mentioned that you know they're currently looking at prices in excess of ten dollars per ton for their current contracts this year so council member common uh thank you chris just um an update so i am just as your representative on the climate trust um board and or the last review of this the paid was thirteen dollars so i'll just throw that out there and there was some conversation about the offsets are getting harder to find and at least one person uh projected that they're expecting to see 20. so for what it's worth thank you for sharing that cindy all right well so you would say i guess uh thank you member content um and yeah i would say that you know these data are conservative and even with these conservative data we think that there's sufficient evidence to justify the increase but it is good to note that the actual costs are much higher than what we show here and agree i also read through the ecosystems report on the state of the carbon offset market and because states like oregon well other states are you know all passing and legislation to reduce carbon dioxide emissions there the demand is going up and the market is much more volatile than it has been in the past so uh as i mentioned we think there's sufficient evidence to justify the maximum increase allowed by statute results in a rate of 427 per short ton of carbon dioxide we took a look at uh how this would the overall construction costs of a new fossil fuel facility the two main one could actually be built in oregon and we believe that uh the modified emission standards that we discussed before so with our recommended modification standards the overall cost of developing a new fossil fuel power plant would increase by approximately four percent that's using the same economic model that we used in the last update and was reviewed by different stakeholders so well it's definitely uh it's not a lot of assumptions um we feel fairly confident that a good place to rely on um the actual cost of energy would not increase four percent it would be much smaller um kilowatt thesis and i would likely be offset by the social benefits of yeah this is all kind of hypothetical because there won't be any new fossil fuel power but have to offset their emissions in oregon but i think those findings could be applicable to things like concentrating given all those caveats uh we recommend that based on all the the increase is it takeable academically achievable on all that analysis we recommend that the council increase the monetary offset rate by the maximum amount but you could of course make no changes or change it by a different announcement and then um well sorry i'll stop there to see if there's any other discussion on this particular issue thanks chris does anyone have any so just um this is hanley just to be it goes from 285 to 479. oh i'm sorry councilmember jenkins i may have made an error in the staff report it should be 427 i believe is that yeah okay thank you yeah that's what i got too thank you yeah i uh i have gotten gotten sloppy with my 10 key typing at some point in time any further comments on this this is cindy um just to comment i mean i you know i believe we should do this um because it's the only thing we're allowed to do but i think it's very very that this monetary offset although it might not be imposed because there's not going to be a fossil fuel plant um or likely not going to be a fossil fuel plant um it it certainly is not adequate to at the rate today so a comment this is hanley i think we got behind um this several years ago and that was the conversation this is marxy that was the conversation back then we were behind and well anyway okay all right councilmember connor the last time we went through this exercise we i did the math and because every time we increase it we can increase it a little bit more the next time uh it does seem like if we were to be aggressive which is kind of why we're bringing this this rule making to you now and the way that we're bringing it to you you know do it exactly every two years we could have it up to the current market rates within you know four to five two year cycles so like within within ten years we could have it up to about what we're actually seeing the prices being but as uh as you noted you know this is our we are bound to our statutory limitations and so yeah it is it is less than what we would probably need to actually ensure that the offsets actually happened but i will speak a little bit more to the timing in a second um but hearing no other conversations i'll go ahead and move on to my last slide um so in addition to the kind of substantive changes that we recommended we just had some housekeeping changes um that are mostly designed to um remove the existing carbon dioxide emission standards from being a like regular part of the siting process and moving them keeping them on the books but like moving them to less prominent position in the rules so that would be um the general applicability rule uh in division 24 wolf 500 as i mentioned before which would kind of say the new standards are what are important and these existing standards are here for existing facilities basically we would be uh deleting just some of the a few of the existing rules which just do nothing else besides restate statute or restate what council statutory authority is because they're kind of unnecessary that's just the cleanup and then we'd be recommending all of the carbon emissions specific definitions from the definition rule and moving them into division 24 and then also uh which is this is maybe more slightly more than just that housekeeping change uh we are recommending that the council all the definitions of os 469 300 and 469 503 sub 2 by reference in the appropriate definitions rule that basically means we can take out anything that says you know a term what it means in rs chapter 469 and that is just an editorial preference uh thing but it does i think remove some unnecessary duplication yeah and so that that would be the remaining housekeeping rules that we have uh in place uh or have recommended have kind of looked at the fiscal impact uh we want to make it very clear that the rules implementing hb 2021 do not create fiscal impacts uh because they're just implementing existing law but we do want to acknowledge that that law itself is likely to be fairly transformed transformative uh in the oregon energy system and it doesn't itself have physical impacts and economic impacts on uh energy facility developers uh we also want to acknowledge that there may be some increased cost of uh from changes to the emission standards and monetary offset rates um for existing fossil fuel power plants and other carbon dioxide emitting but those actual costs would be realized under very limited because of the limited applicability of 469503 standards um as a result the overall magnitude of impact would be small and um based on analysis",

        "text": " any of it out, then we wind up with too much dirt. So dirt will be sold off the site. That just happens to come in with the trucks. But we are not grinding the material. We will be taking it, and we're just burning. How are they reducing the material for the incinerator? You don't. That's the reason. So it gets separated. So you have basically the limbs and the tops, and then you have the logs and the stumps. Logs and stumps don't burn as fast. And you want to get your fire started with your tops and your limbs. And so the smaller material, you get your fire started, and then you put your larger material on top once you've got it going to make it fully incinerate. David, can they not ask for the special use permit rather than a permanent. We are not allowed to ask for a special use permit based on the settlement that occurred with on top of the world because of what? So there's a. So the way there was a settlement, there was a lawsuit against the county based on a special use permit that was requested. And the lawsuit basically stipulated that you cannot ask for a special use permit for anything that is not specifically listed as an allowable special use permit request. And since this is not listed under agricultural as a specific use for a special use permit, then we're not allowed to ask for it underneath that criteria. Wow. This is one of the toughest one I ever find. Yep. So last time we went through the zoning and went to table, I wanted, at the bottom of table, I wanted to add any. Anything else we can dream up. And then that way, it would have solved that problem, but they didn't add it. Okay, do we have any other questions before we close the floor and call for a vote? Yeah, it says here, sale of processed materials. So that's telling me you have to reduce this waste down as like, selling it for mulch. How are they reducing that down to that. To that degree? When you burn it, it reduces it to ash. You can sell ash for fertilizer. I mean, we're not. But we are not taking it down. I don't believe there's any grinding that's occurring on this site. I'll confirm that with my client when I bring it back in front of the board to make sure there's no grinding that's occurring, but I do not believe there's any grinding. And the processing material would be. We're separating the tree debris from the sand that's coming in and selling that material. You aren't selling any wood product? That's right. Not that I'm aware of. No, sir. Okay. Are we ready for a motion? So for purposes of the board, staff's recommendation was denial. They gave alternative conditions should the board desire to approve it. Would you mind putting. David, have you look at the alternate condition conditions up there? Yes. For us? One more time. Let him look at one. Yes, I did. I mean, we proposed those land berms and they were recommending the same thing. So we didn't have any objection to that for the alternate objections with the alternate condition, you have no objections, right? That's correct. Okay, so staff is okay with the alternate conditions if they follow or you still have denial? No, staff. Staff is absolutely recommending denial. The conditions are provided as an alternative. And what is the reason you provided alternate conditions? Just in case we overturn your denial? Correct. We will always provide some kind of alternative conditions in the event that the board chooses to go against staff recommendation. There were not many to provide here. Just because in order to mitigate this use, it would be difficult because it is not compatible. I know. Tell me how you actually feel. And a land berm is actually sand, correct? Yes. That's going to contain it? Is someone like to tackle this one? Hi, Ken. I, William Heller, agree with staff's finding and recommendation and hereby recommend denial of the requested zoning based on the following findings of fact will adversely affect the public interest, is not consistent with the Marion county comprehensive plan and is not compatible with surrounding land use. Okay, we have a motion. Do we have a second? I'll second that. We have a motion in a second. All those in favor? Aye. No, wait. How many would maybe raise a hand so we know who they are? 1234. And all those opposed? Aye. Two of us. Motion is going to carry 42 and be moved on to the board of Ghana Commissioners. Can I get a motion to accept the minutes from last meeting? I'll move the motion. And we have second with Mister Bonner. Second? Denny's first. Okay. Second. Mister Bonner. All those in favor? Aye. Anything that we need to discuss before we adjourn? Were we. Did we need to bring up that advertisement again at the end of the meeting or that was suggested or is that all taken care of now? I'm not sure I know what you're talking about. The location, the no address issue in the ever. In the advertisement, we provide the parcel number, which is the actual. Like how you can find the parcels or the subject properties on the maps. The address. If a site is undeveloped, it will not have an address. Otherwise you're just providing area. You know, it's within this area. You know, you could probably put subdivision, but some parcels aren't subdivided. You know, I understand that. And this is, you know, we had a little bit of discussion there before the meeting about the location so that, that people could look at this advertisement. I understand it probably meets the state statute. It's the minimum. But I've, you know, had people complaining to me about they have to look up the parcel number to find, you know, they. I know it may not have an actual address, but you can put. There's something you can do there to. So if you were the location of it, so people could find it, you were to go to probably the issue is like if you go to Google Maps and you put in the area and you get to that area of Google Maps, it's not going to show you the actual parcels or anything. It's not going to show you where the exact subject property is. That's why we suggest come to our county map, use the parcel number and it will take you exactly where. So you can't, you can't. In the, in the advertisement, you can't put that location, the parcel number and the location where it's at. Is that what you're telling me? What would we put as the location other than like quarter mile east of certain intersect? We tried that years ago under Earl and then we got away from it because it just became very, it wasn't very precise, you know, I'll give an example. You know, with it in increases the cost of the ad. Oh, well, you just pass that on. What's the problem? But what would we, what would you suggest we put in there? Well, I know, I know that, you know, over the years I've gotten plenty of calls from and the sheriff's department, new California police Department tell me where they need that record. And there was no address, but I was able to find it. They didn't give me a parcel number. 13. Mister Fisher, if you tell. If there are multiple unaddressed parcels all in a row and we give you a cross street, there's no way for an individual to know what parcel it is. Which is why we do a parcel and then no address assigned. So the statute requires in some situations where you have to publish a map, which is what we do from a map. And if there's no address assigned, we will outline the particular parcel that's there. But there are some notifications that you are not required to do a map for them. You may not be required to do that. No, you're not required to, but it's helpful to the public. Right. But that cost would have to be something that's passed on to the applicants. So. So what. That's what you need to do. I don't understand. If I wanted to know about something, I just get on my computer and type in that parcel number on. On the county's website. Well, and it would take me right to it. I'm just. I'm just passing this on, you know, I understand that, you know, but, I mean, the odds of. If you're that concerned, you would assume you live by there, so you already know. I mean, I. It's hard for me to. I'm trying to think. Okay. Why would you. Why would you be concerned about a parcel that's up in, what you say, the northeast? You live in the southwest. Okay, well, if I'm really concerned about it, take the time to go figure it out. Well, let me put it this way. So you get the parcel number, and now, you know, you've got an area or a location where it's at. Now, you know, whether it's of concern or nothing. Just like that. So you see what I mean? If you're. I would think if I was that concerned of a citizen with. How many do we have on there today? Nine or 1010 applicants. If I said, hey, I want to find out where everything is, it's not going to take me ten or 15 minutes on my computer to figure out. And I mean, most. What I'm suggesting is something that would assist the public. Could I say something, please? Yes. The whole issue isn't what you're talking about, really. The issue is, like, last month",

        "text": " northwest can sidestep missing money problem because we haven't had that divestment of generation and transfer of the procurement function to an rto and i don't think we have to have an rto presumes that kind of restructuring in the west so i don't view it as as relevant a question for rto formation here as it has been in the east and i'm uh happy to hear if others have thoughts on that question um but first i will ask uh linda from odo if she can check to see if there is any interest um among attendees in public comment it looked like most of our public attendees were associated with organizations that are on our committee so i'm not sure but there were some others so i wanted to make sure we uh have a chance to hear from them in reviewing the um attendee list i don't see any hands raised or questions submitted i will check back in say 15 minutes linda so if remember if you can monitor that and let me know at 11 45 i will uh pause again so we can continue with this discussion um here i'm also happy to move on to the table discussion which kind of tees up this incrementalism question more explicitly i mean so unless there's a further discussion of this on the sort of flexibility and missing or any of the other issues we just went through on kind of market design i think there's some interest in talking more about incrementalism and and what that looks like and how people might have different different definitions of what that looks like to their organizations so i will move us forward here and that's that's my second question so my second question is on incrementalism my first one uh which i previewed in the the email i sent on to advisory members um starts with this problem statement uh that was raised by uh some folks we talked about at the last meeting and uh so i'm asking if we can clearly articulate or define what problem or problems the sector's attempting to address by even evaluating our geo formation and this is an addendum to this question that i added to to it here and what if anything has changed that makes this answer different in 2021 than it's been in previous decades right we've talked about rtos multiple times this isn't the first time it's come up in the northwest so is this has this changed um so i will open up the floor on that question and then again the next question is going to be on incrementalism so stay tuned for that one sarah um i'll throw a few things in it's not uh exhaustive list so please others but i think what i'm thinking about is so rto is a tool set is unique in that it provides the ability to provide an integrated solution set for a number functions and mechanisms that we need to achieve the kind of deep decarbonization and clean energy integration greater and greater utilization of resource solutions that don't look like our traditional set of generation into the grid and when i say integrated i'm emphasizing the fact that the rto all of the inputs and outputs from the market optimization part of the rto the transmission planning piece and the resource adequacy piece potentially and because those pieces are under one roof they're able to leverage each other and the data that's produced from these different functions and mechanisms can be integrated to provide that solution set where all the pieces are coming i'm certainly and we'll get to this but you can't not talk about the incremental approach when you're answering this part we certainly have shown in this region that one thing that's working better than anything that has worked in 20 years these decades is the incremental but we've also while we acknowledge that like politically economically from a regulatory perspective those that approach seems to be more successful in terms of achieving these different milestone pieces it isn't well suited to bring them all together for that integrated solution set so for me that's kind of what sticks out here in the conversation too many screens open i'm jumping around here um thank you sarah for that any other thoughts or feedback to either this question or to uh sarah's response and again i think it's particularly helpful you know um for members of the public and stakeholders in the legislature who are you know a lot of us who work in the industry are thinking about these things all the time and it's sort of we know why we're thinking about rtos and and potential but i think it's good write some of that level setting uh we can also take a pause here oh nicole go ahead please well one i just wanted to point out that um michael young has his hand up too so she wanted to make sure you caught that but you know sarah just nailed it as she always does that was perfect description i think to answer the second quick question of why what has changed i'd say um it's the conversation around um the uh you know states our states mandates on procuring more clean energy but also around the impacts and effects climate change is having on on our system i mean 10 years ago we weren't seeing the radical climate weather impacts we weren't dealing with the the wildfire situation that we are today and so i think for for some people involved in this conversation there's a feeling of desperation that if we if we aren't doing everything that we could possibly to continue to live the lifestyles that we are hoping to live and um then we're not doing enough and so for for my members it's how can we decarbonize the electricity sector and this is one of the solutions one of the important solutions to us thank you nicole um anything else anyone would like to add on this question otherwise i was going to suggest uh we could pause here a moment and we do have a um public comment we could take so i will i will um when i see spencer of your hand up i'll come back to you spencer after we hear from and linda if you could unmute michael or give him the ability to unmute right testing testing yes are you loud and clear very good uh thanks very much for the opportunity to chime in um this has been a fantastic discussion and i really appreciate the the chance to hear what the stakeholder advisory committee is thinking and as well as to share our i represent pngc power we are a generation cooperative gnt cooperative um 15 members half of whom are in oregon so our members in oregon share a commitment to a rational carbon policy um like many have said here already carbon is real uh and and we're committed to getting 100 carbon neutrality by 2033. um i will share that um from our perspective as a public power um we see what's changed here is that um it's always been pretty easy for us uh we've just relied on you know cheap hydro from the bpa system and never really had to think very hard about uh what you know how to shape the future but what's really changing here is that um we are expecting that vpa system uh will at some point in the foreseeable future not be sufficient to meet the needs of the preference customer the easy the easy way out is no longer going to be an option and we're going to have to start making choices and those choices are not easy and in the context of our carbon we really do believe that a northwest rto is going to be an essential towards giving us options that go beyond just the bpa preference power portfolio and giving us a market that we can turn to to meet our needs particularly in clean power as well as facilitating uh the delivery across the transmission network which um you know may or may not be bpa uh so far we've had you know what we kind of call a virtual rto uh system we can lean on in terms of transfer we would very much like to enshrine uh open access so that we can get the power from the places that we want through the market that works in the interests of everyone here just wanted to share that as the thing that's changed for us since the last go-around thank you for that comment uh and then um we will go to uh spencer and orianna uh thanks adam uh throw my hat in for agreeing with the comments that sarah and nicole made about your first problem statement here i wanted to add one other thing to nicole's comments i think it's important for the legislature to think about how can the good be run and built in a different way that makes it attractive for sectors that aren't currently electrified to electrified and so to me there's a component here beyond decarbonizing the existing electrified part of the economy to keep power prices low enough to be attractive to other industries to electrify as well and transportation is the obvious sector that has an opportunity to electrify with electric vehicles but if we don't have a grid that is providing competitive energy prices across sectors it's going to be harder to decarbonize sectors that aren't currently electrified thank you spencer orianna thanks um i think i want to raise what may not be considered like an obvious problem that's being addressed with an rto but i think if equity and justice and addressing some of the the issues with our current energy system are not addressed in rto formation uh if we're not making things more equitable with this approach it doesn't feel like it it achieves environmental justice goals and i recognize that traditionally rtos don't have an equity or environmental justice goal tied to them but i want to appreciate how much odo and other stakeholders have focused on this particular issue and comments and questions in this space and want to make sure that that is part of the problem statement is how do we do this in a way that really maximizes community benefit and minimizes environmental justice burden and in particular recognizes tribal sovereignty thank you ariana um again i'll note again for anyone who's on uh the meeting as member of the public uh if you've used the hand raised function uh we will note note you and get you in the queue here to jump in the discussion i will go ahead though and move us on to the next question which is on incrementalism incremental approaches to regionalization have been discussed as an alternative to rto formation and some have suggested there may be potentially different definitions for what might constitute sufficient versus insufficient incrementalism so in terms of steps what incremental steps have already been taken are under consideration or could be considered i think we've talked a lot about the ones that have been taken but the the",

attendance whichever one of you wants to go I wasn't able to go either okay oh no so it was fine um there wasn't a full house um I don't think all the I think some of the counselors were working remotely or were absent but I think that the presentation itself I felt the vibe that I got while I was giving it giving the speech was that they were very much paying attention that the audience the counselors the mayor the city staff and the audience were all paying attention to the context and uh I felt really good afterwards when um one of the counselors approached and really you know expressed interest um in attending one of our future meetings as well as the gentleman I had mentioned before so I think that I think my feeling walking away from it was that it was a lot of dense material and I think it's something giving folks something to um reflect on and I don't think it would be necessarily a um a bad thing if we invited you know had an open invitation to the counselors to attend as they're able or to review one of our um meetings but overall I think think it was um I think it was well received so how about you gret and do you have any comments or any feedback no I agree and I think that would be just fine we've um it'd be very easy to share with the city council the date and time of the meetings and and extend that open invitation on your behalf uh Jackie used to be in that position of being a city counselor I don't know if she'd have any feedback on you know effectiveness of that approach or other ideas and I know Robert also attended the meeting Monday night as well and might have thoughts to share too yeah my my suggestion would be if like if you feel like there are certain counselors that weren't like present like they weren't like in person that you feel like they should have been like that's one way could definitely reach out to them and ask to have a meeting and um taking consideration to like you mentioned that was kind of dense so it's like there's any key points that you think would be most important for the uh counselors to be aware of or to hone in on and like if there was like even like a suggestions or recommendations page in terms of what can the counselors do um within the next say two or three years depending on the length of their um time on Council oh that's great stuff I hadn't thought of that you know especially if you know something is specific to their geographical area or their area of expertise to highlight that and you know we'll be doing action in your you know in w you know whatever um but yeah I think that's a great idea thank you for that um some other suggestions I'm thinking of offand it depends on capacity at this point you know there's how many neighbor associations now I lost the number I want to say 17 so there's the opportunity if you're willing to go to the different neighborhood associations and share the report within the communities especially where you're having let's say a larger number of people who are responding so you don't necessar have to go to every single one but to the ones that make sense to attend um my other um thought or um suggestion um around this um specifically and I just lost a thought but if I remember it I'll get back to you yeah it's great thank you for those yeah Robert did you w to speak on your opinion on what happened or how everything went yeah no I think the presentation I think present went well um personally I was a little disappointed I was kind of expecting anything to be like there to be um a few more questions or a little more um engagement uh from you know from the city councilors um you know kind of just I was hoping for them to kind of like promote you know kind of like that you know exchange and discussion or dialogue um at the meeting I I did notice that you know a lot of people were taking notes and you know I witnessed the police chief on you know like a lot of things were mentioning I saw him actively taking notes which I thought was you really great to see um and you know it's been witnessed anything by the police department's you know seriousness as well um in their engagement with service providers to you know want to connect more with the unsheltered population and you know make sure those uh that discrimination isn't happening and so it was really great to see him there um present and taking notes um I did kind of uh just recently appreciate um you know Jackie's um you know kind of recommendations and kind of taking that report and the material that we you know gathered from that and kind of having some more of those you know like one-on-one conversations or you know some of those smaller group discussions I'm just to really get that um just really get that data out there and the message of what we're trying to do and Achieve no thank you thank you for sure and then and then Jackie like your Insight is invaluable like I mean like I like we'll be leaning on you quite a bit when it comes to things like that if you mind that's fine with me I will try not to put you on the spot but I can't guarantee that because I will put people on the spot on the side have a question well a comment um I I also watched the meeting and um I was impressed with the presentation and the engagement and the seriousness that city councilors were giving the presentation but also wished for more engagement but but then there was you know sometimes when when we talk about people who are experiencing homelessness and we're looking for safety for the people who are home sheltered um and it's a hard balance of course you want safety for everyone um but I don't know if this committee would have any kind of role in educating I mean I'm going to try to do it very softly from the sidelines but um I've I've been seeing some City and County Commissioners sharing pictures of people with the trash around them and talking about you know we can't have this this is not safe this is not okay we you know we can't put up with this anymore and I feel like of course we need to say that we need to do better than this and of course we need to say you know let's find more creative options and solutions but when you couple that with the pictures you're take you're you've got pictures of people at their lowest low of of life and when you also add the trash it's so easy to dehumanize fellow human beings and those are the situations that lead some people to feel like it's okay to beat the crap out of someone because they're homeless and they're slobs and you know they're not contributing and they're just making dangerous situations for everyone else so what I would wish for is if there there's a way to kind of educate people you know share your opinions share your creative ideas share you what you're not going to put up with and also what you're going to do differently but to couple that with pictures of people at their very low and the trash you're making you're you're othering people and as soon as we other people you make it easier for violence to happen and when you're busy you know talking about the homeless guy with a machete or something you're not noticing how many homeless individuals are being beaten up and killed by other people who have shelter so I don't know if there's any Avenue for this commission to kind of do some education I mean as an advocate I'm going to try to do that but it's so hard to see the pictures that some people are posting in very good intents like you know this is not habitable this is not safe but it's really painting a picture that others fellow human beings and shows them at their lowest and I feel like if we can do something to educate so that that piece doesn't happen have your narrative and have your Solutions but please don't show pictures of people at their very lowest with all the trash that makes it into like these are other less than human beings because we're having more and more situations of people beating up people who are homeless um some of it by teenagers and I I can't even fathom that but when we add those pictures to the narrative we're creat creating more otherness and that creates more risk of violence thank you Lena I really appreciate um sorry no no worries I was just GNA say thank you for that um I I think that the number one thing would be just for us to as we talk about you know the situation to not I mean to maybe actively encourage it you know you might not want to pict put a picture of that it's really not appropriate it does not help the narrative whatso ever and then just keep going like that and also just thank you for even speaking that because this is you know it does go out on YouTube people do watch it so you know anytime that we can bring it up and make it known then we should and and that that in itself you speaking it does that so we just continue to push forward with it um I wanted to add worries no worries lenel um I really appreciate again your um advocacy especially for our unsheltered um populations you know when was it just was it two years ago you and I had walked um parts of Downtown Salem together um visiting with some of the unsheltered community having brief conversations huning out sandwiches just trying to check in on them seeing how they were doing and the reason why um I had asked um lenel to do this with me was I wanted to hear from folks like you know what were they experiencing were they experiencing any um violence specifically at the hands of let's say police officers or from anybody else who happen to be in the area and those were whether it was like a short one minute leave me alone versus a few other people who were willing to talk and one person who talked for almost I think 15 minutes and just sharing like within that 15 minute time frame how they became unsheltered why they're still unsheltered and you know how is",

        "text": "uh hello and uh welcome back here to our fifth video in the application key application Series uh for the community renewable energy grant program uh just really quick want to reinduce myself I'm Jason uh the program analyst for the uh program and I'm joined here with our with my colleague and program analyst uh clay Decker and uh we in this particular video we're going to move through uh Section 8 of the application and again these are the key kind of key application questions not every question for the application but the key some of the key questions related to the competitive scoring review criteria that you'll find in the opportunity announcement and again this is Section 8 Community benefits and Equity considerations or program priorities for the C rep program and uh so we're going to go ahead and jump right in uh and again we're covering these key questions uh for that application and Clay do you have anything before we get going okay well I would um like to remind everybody that if you have not gone through the entirety of the opportunity announcement that you're interested in and after you've reviewed the opportunity announcement please go to one of our user guides that we have on our website one for construction and one for planning that walks you through the entire application process if you haven't done at a minimum those two things I suggest you stop this video and please go and do that at this time it's a key aspect to understanding the questions and completing the online um for its best possible score if you've done those things first thanks excellent that's that's great advice uh clay and I during each of these videos uh cannot cannot stress enough how important uh the application guides are the resources available on the website and just getting a deeper understanding of what we're looking for uh in these questions and and with that we'll go ahead and Jump Right In uh again this is um one of the first questions you're going to come across in section eight um and this would be on a prior question answering yes and on that yes we'd be looking for you to describe the qualifying environmental justice community and detail how the members of the qualifying Community are those primarily served by the community renewable energy projects so your proposed uh project and uh what we're looking for here is for you to be providing specific details how members of the local environmental justice Community are being primarily served by that project if you don't have that information or if you uh uh aren't able to describe specifically how that's going to impact then of course you're going to be entering either unknown or not applicable in this in this section and Clay do you have something to add there no I'm you know again go back to in the opportunity analysis are the scoring criteria and you'll see where this one fits in under the the several bulleted items in the equity section um and the difference between a strong application and a or a a project that really serves a environmental justice Community versus a project that is just maybe located in or has a certain number of their um being served is a big distinction and that's what the reviewers will be looking for you know does does the one example is a project that has net metering from their Renewable Energy System and they are calculating the savings of that net metering and applying a very specific dollar amount to their utilities low-income service program very specific you've got number of people served you've got dollar amounts involved a very clear example others are hey our city has certain neighborhoods or certain percentages that are these various environmental communities and they'll be served because our project serves the whole city right that is an example it's a bit subjective on primarily served or not but those are the types of answers that that project can support and that's what we want to see and I think just one additional thing to add on a question like this and it may even uh come into play on some of the later questions is that uh on the program webpage uh under the resources tab uh there's a document of helpful resources and within that there are plenty of options for going to uh state databases mapping Etc where you can uh or you can you can plug in data from your specific particular area and be able to pull that data back screenshot it save it Etc and that would then also be utilized for you to upload as an attachment as supporting materials or to support an answer that's being provided in this entry box or in others that are going to be related to that and we'll go ahead and jump into the next one uh in a in the prior video uh I alluded to a question uh that's in the project plan that talks about uh listing out the project leaders and what have you uh and then I mentioned that we would see another one similar to that in section eight and this is this is that particular question uh please provide a brief bio of the project leaders below this is not a repeat question from section seven that particular question had to do uh with the actual project the physical project on site who those partner individuals were Etc uh what we're looking for here in this question is we're looking for project leaders that are outside of the physical project uh leaders that have been incorporated into the project uh from uh the local community the local qualifying Community entities organizations non-profits as well as environmental justice community members leaders uh the heads of nonprofit these are project leaders that are from organizations that have input or have been advised into this project because it's going to be primarily serving or serving these environmental justice communities this is where those bios come into play and Clay did you have something to add um in some cases on how your organization is set up they may be some of the same people that you know they may be a project leader who actually knows intimately knows how the construction and installation will go but also has those Outreach responsibilities so if you do need to repeat somebody absolutely that's okay but clearly describe their role related to community benefit Equity Outreach and working with leaders the strongest applications again will actually have leaders from outside of the organization who are related to environmental justice communities and who have been given a leadership role on forming designing and implementing this right that's a that's a great that's a great add-on to um what we're looking for in the slide and again just wanted to point out uh this is going to come into play Under the project leadership portion uh in the equity area of the criteria the scoring criteria and again this is a non-required question that's a priority scoring opportunity for applicants if this information and these individuals are a part of your particular project uh another priority scoring opportunity that's going to be in that same subset of the equity considerations is please detail any Community involvement in this proposed project highlight any involvement with qualifying environmental justice communities uh in your answer now this one this particular one goes back uh to I believe in our second video where we were talking about section five we're talking about stakeholder consultation that was more of a broader uh Outreach effort uh engagement involvement from stakeholders in a broader way into your project now again just want to keep emphasizing we're looking here for those stakeholders groups that have involved in the engagement process from your qualifying environmental justice communities so just we want to mentally separate those two they look like a very similar same question but we are looking for different information and again this is not a required question it is a priority scoring opportunity on the application in section eight and Clay do you have anything to add there um nope it's tied to the equity section um in the competitive uh scoring criteria and this also is Project Specific a lot of round run applications mentioned uh climate action plan that that their organization had in general that's great that is worth mentioning but if you don't it's not as strong if you don't tie the design development and benefit package of your project back to that organization-wide community action plan so it's one thing you know there might be points for just having a community action plan and mention it but if you can directly tie the growth development planning of your removable energy project for this grant to that community action plan that makes a stronger scoring opportunity and continue to move forward at this point I do want to emphasize this video will be a little bit longer the benefits section the program priorities and benefits section does have a lot of key question that are priority scoring or direct scoring opportunities so we will this will be a little bit of a longer video as we touch on these key application questions but in this next one again we're still talking about in the scoring criteria of Our Community Partnerships under the equity area of the uh of the Criterium and this is uh describe Outreach done to qualifying communities if qualifying communities have been involved in the project development and operations please include a description of the communities and how they have been involved now this one is where we're looking for you if you to the prior question if you were answering that we're looking for even more information uh even more detailed information of uh specific examples uh where there has been some Outreach to these qualifying communities uh and uh we don't have any guidelines on what that uh needs to be um but the your best uh opportunity for uh for getting the scores uh in this area is to describe those uh and then if you have them upload that supporting information uh clearly labeled for the reviewers uh clay do you have anything but this way but back to the beginning of the of the section where we talked about how the project serves environmental justice communities so there is overlap in these questions now we want to maybe have you describe how you came about coming up with that service elements of the project that relate back to to that earlier question you know in the Outreach um contacting the leadership of environmental communities involving them in the project you know how did you go about those things if you've done so and uh in this uh next question we're starting to move into more of the location aspect or this is uh ties in with the community location under the equity area uh and this is going to be another follow-up question that pops up if you answered yes to the prior one and this is to describe in detail how and to what extent the community qualifies as an environmental justice Community similar to the other these appear a little bit similar but what we're looking for is one is more Project Specific and serving that community and this is more of how that qualifies as an environmental justice Community uh and so as I mentioned before this is another area where utilizing some of the resources to uh to provide uh qualitative quantitative data mapping Etc down to your specific location uh where this project is",

        "text": " one's not concluded because of the broader fire and then finally Klondike 3 wind project so on June 22nd Klondike 3 Wind Facility experienced a Transformer fire Transformer uh fault triggered uh a feeder to trip offline causing 23 wind turbines to shut down the fire was contained to the pad mounted Transformer area no Transformer oil was released also the incident was reported within 72 hours in compliance with condition 25 of that site certificate the cause was an internal short circuit in the pad mounted Transformer and the incident is now closed um because we know the cause of that and so similarly offen grid is the parent company of the certificate holder which is Klondike wind power LLC before I move on to my last item is there any questions about uh any of those speak up counselors if there's any I don't see any hands so I guess you can continue secretary corette thank you Mr chair um and then finally just the future Council meetings i' mentioned August 22nd 23rd uh we definitely are going to have the draft propos hearing on the evening of the 22nd um we we are currently working on a proposed agenda which we still need to send to chair how for his review and approval so um D and I have been working on that and so we believe we'll probably have that information available to you um sometime by the middle of next week so but just for your calendars you know at least at this point we're planning on the evening of the 22nd as well as the 23d and probably you know early morning to early early afternoon uh is what we're looking at right now and with that I will conclude my report unless there are any questions chair how I have a question yes uh councelor AES thank you um secretary cornette I was just curious because right now in our area we have um a big fire going on and um was curious if because of the red flag warnings and um you know the condition the climate right now um how is it work with the current wind facilities that are in operation um does the department have any um compliance you know protocol that they're currently doing with that uh well each site certificate is going to be a little bit different based upon what the standards were at the time so you know as I indicated earlier with the m address facility you know the when that one was approved there wasn't a wild to fire standard there is now so now they're going to have to adhere to that um you know there's always been the Public Services standard and there's some element related to Fire and public services but we would have to look at like the specific site certificates and the specific conditions around each facility um and if you're you know the kind of the and you didn't ask this question but if sort of the question was you know are we going to De energize or shut down those uh there's no protocols for that um they need to really you build own and operate the facility consistent with the site certificate with the conditions with the final order and so we would really have to look at each facility to determine you know what you know elements in that certificate relate to um wildfire or you know fire circumstances thank you Vice chair condom uh Cindy and this is to secretary corette um I'm presuming we will be not in Salem but on site for the next meeting in August uh yes Vice chair Condon The Proposal would be um that we are in Hermiston so the the facility is you know in that proximity um to Boardman you know and and others but the Nancy looked around and like the only place that we could find in terms of availability was in Herm so that's that's where we're definitely the DPO hearing will be there and as I said we still have to get um CH House's concurrence on the regular council meeting yeah thank you any other questions from counselors okay um did that conclude uh your presentation uh secretary cornette yes Mr chair that concludes my presentation okay well thank you very much um so I guess the next item then is the wagon trail solar it's a continuation of the council review of the draft proposed order this is an information item and Chase McBay Walker senior sighting policy analyst uh will walk us through this one floor is yours Chase thank you very much chair how can everybody hear me all right yes okay great you council member chak to I appreciate it and Tom um let me share my screen uh chair how can you give me a thumbs up if you can see my slide presentation okay great thank you very well good morning chair how Vice chair Condon members of the council um for the record my name is Chase McBay Walker I'm a senior sighting analyst here at the Oregon Department of energy and today's agenda Item B is as chair how um just stated a continuation of council's review of the draft proposed order for the wagon trail solar application for site certificate uh this is going to be the structure of my presentation today I will provide a summary of the proposed facility and of the applicant um as well as the procedural history I walk through what's happened to date and um go through a few standards um where comments and issues were raised during um or on the record of the DPO by public um and reviewing agencies as well as Council and at any uh any point in the presentation should council members have any questions please uh ask away we'll see what we can do um in getting you an the wagon trail solar project um is a 500 megawatt solar photovoltaic energy facility um proposed by the applicant which is Wagon Trail Energy Center LLC Wagon Trail Energy Center LLC is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of nexera energy Resources LLC the proposed facility site would be located entirely in North Central Morrow near uh Lexington Oregon proposed related and supporting facility compon components with this uh facility would include uh 500 megaw of lithium ion energy storage system two collector substations a 34 a half Kil collection system um operations and maintenance 6 miles of a 230 kilovolt transmission line uh in Four Construction staging areas the proposed facility would occupy up uh can people still hear me and see my presentation okay I gotta yeah looks like your video is off but we can still hear fine okay great I gotta pop up that says my camera is unable to connect um um this facility would be would permanently occupy 3600 Acres of private exclusive Farm use zoned land located within a site boundary which is greater than the permanent impacts of Acres this next slide I've uh because were digital I threw out some arrows to to show you where each of these components are um proposed to be located so the site boundary in this figure is the magenta colored line um there's met stations throughout facility o om andm building inverter locations many inverter locations um this is the 230 KV line6 miles right in the middle of the proposed facility um there's an existing transmission line BPA Line running north south through the facility underground collection lines the 34 and a half underground collection um in this figure which is a compilation of a couple different ones that I put um there's a fence line which is within the site boundary and it's represented as a green line temporary laydown areas a the battery energy storage system project substations there's access roads oh um and I guess that's all I was going to call out any questions thus far on facility on I think you can okay um on to history on November 3rd 2020 the department received a notice of intent for this facility and then on June 11th 2021 the applicant submitted an amended notice of intent to address site boundary modifications the Department receiv received the preliminary application for the site certificate on August 31st 2022 and um in November 2022 February 2023 and December 2023 the department issued additional requests for information to the applicant and uh then in December of last year 2023 on December 22nd the department determined the the preliminary application to be complete and on January 3rd of this year the applicant filed their complete application for site certificate oh sorry the department issued the DPO um on May 7th this year 2024 which initiated a 31-day comment period on May 30th chair how conducted a public hearing on the DPO at the Port of Morrow Riverfront Center River Front Room in Oregon and the record was kept open until June 10th and uh it was actually and that was um kept open for the public and then or the applicant had until June 10th to respond and then they requested an extension to respond to comments received by an extension of a day to May 11th um and that's when we received their responses to comments received um on the DPO and that leads us to today July 19th um where we're continuing our Council review of the DPL this next slide is our energy facility sighting process and I'll be I'll summarize this uh this this Chevron process there's seven major steps in the review of applications for certificates um right now we are in the fourth of the seven steps right in the middle of the process being the draft proposed order the first step is the notice of intent which is the applicant's conceptual plan or facility um following notice of intent there's the project order and that's the Department's um blueprint for the application the Department's representation of what the applicable are third step of the process is the actual application both preliminary and complete and now we're at the draft proposed order which is um the Department's uh initial findings of facts conclusions of Law and recommendations to Council on whether or not the facility would comply with all requirements and this was also um the first opportunity for the public to provide comments um on the record and so we received that and following the draft proposed order step we get into the proposed osed order which um is f it's it's the the daff's revised recommendations based on direction from FC and um additional evaluation following the conclusion of the public hearing and the public comment time frame on the DP and the following proposed order we move into potential contested case and only those persons who have raised a relevant issue in person at the public hearing or in writing by the Comon deadline on the draft proposed order May participate in the contested case and the contested case process step is run by an independent hearing officer following contested case we",

last night um and they did affirm the decision so they approved the The Proposal staff they furnished that decision which is to prepare everything except the deny that request to exceed maximum parking and 63 conditions of approval it was not unanimous awarding counselor so yeah that was a pretty long hearing a meeting before in our neighborhood Council and testify oh and I I had to send it out and I thought maybe you would tell the commission thank you I've forgot about it actually because I like the Salem Heights Improvement plan was adopted by the council unanimously to be included in the transportation system plan and you know I'd say the impacted innocent like my own neighborhood I think the uh the thing to note there was the process it was used and the the way that the city and the neighbors were to develop plan and the degree of public participation would be able to achieve through that joint effort and I think that's important because there are a lot of streets similar to settlements in the City of Salem um and well I hope we maintain a higher priority than these other streets and come later uh I do think it's a different sense for um lived here by the time some of the improvements get made um but the process I think um is an important one something that I hope the city looks forward looks to and in other places if you find that you can find the neighbors with the right attitude and you find it sad person on City staff to work with them Anthony the support that he got for the project um I think you can come up with plans that are variations from what might be the template slide that allows you to um made trade-offs that best fine trade-offs in business any comments Commissioners I'll look for the picture are we under comments we are right okay yes conversation about is I think there's some areas of the development code that we need to kind of take another look at in terms of like over time we've had a lot of really great policies we've got a really great intentions that have sort of like fell on each other and ended up kind of resulting in life convoluted set of Standards sometimes and this was really evident to me because one of my co-workers asked me what are the setback assignments of the rmt zone and this is my response and I'm just like I'm gonna read this become like to me it was just so funny and ridiculous at like how like all these very good intention standards end up creating something that's just impossible for the average person to understand and so I'm gonna go through this and this is what I call a fair case that that it depends right so the setback is 12 feet wonderful family building the Json to the street unless it's located along at sector which is 28 the multi-family building with Jason 238 minimum 12 feet plus one feet per foot they'll be high over 12 feet but not Gypsy 12 feet depth the multi-family interior set back in subject to Zone Zone setback so it very depending on his own adjacent property and if the multi-family building the subject to the diamond being sent back to the portion of the property whereas there are a Zone blocks are different depend on the number of housing into the development that's the ejection species other than wonderful family development are said to them into your subject and less development substance designer view which we require decision setbacks they're all requirements in some cases the buildings will be placed exactly it's set back lines the city can getting into the setback requirements area not to mention like the 100 foot dead back we're going to have so like the just I just wanted to bring that and that's why um that's the rant that I've prepared today but uh this is just an example of one set of design standards for one zone um I think that this a thing that's come up in several instances where just that like I mean that's a job security for me but also like it's a little ridiculous and I wanted to maybe just take it on to print out maybe at the more long-range discussion in simple signs of this development standards I think could be a big priority so next time I ask them what are they building okay other comments for those videos uh the the energy committee subcommittee has been meeting uh at a couple meetings already that have been helpful we decided about the scope of work for us to do I think shelving passed that around I'm not sure but uh we could send it around again uh we have reached out to pte and have asked them to do a presentation on what their plans are uh we have not heard back I think despite several very very polite efforts to reach them we'll move on to the less polite efforts to reach them uh and hopefully we can have them here by the end of the year uh I met with a couple of our Salem delegation to the state legislature to talk about the Salem uh the state of sales property portfolio um and of course then I also talked with the state sustainability director there is a new new legislation that was just signed that gives the state the authority to begin a process of examining their property portfolio and upgrading it so there's a series of steps there but all all new buildings would need to be the new design standard as well as all the ability all buildings that do over a million dollars in construction which of course to the bathroom stage right so anything that's new property uh we'll get that and so they'll be doing a level two energy audit uh as well as some other work there and um uh solar Readiness assessment on their properties as they redevelopers they can do buildings um and so from our perspective we can learn you know my goal would be that we try and raise up the Salem property portfolio towards the top since they have so much property here the legislation also allowed dots to create a set of design standards so to be able to talk about Energy Efficiency so we're Readiness everything from Landscaping to tree coverage treatment that can be coverage on the properties all of that will unfold with over about the next 18 months it will be up to the legislature to figure out how much they want to fund this in terms of how fast it would be their portfolio but I think that's kind of an exciting opportunity for us as um I had an opportunity to talk with the folks the national renewable energy laboratory and they are going to be hopefully doing some work with the City of Salem if you have a right figure out what the scope is we should have somewhere 40 to 60 hours of technical assistance from the national removal energy lab on our function plan and uh I think maybe while we still have planning staff I may come back and uh try and initiate some sort of mandatory uh use or replacement of heat pumps in the City of Salem so I'll bring that back I think maybe uh if it's a temper that we can have that right any other comments for the good in thank you so this is sort of echoing a lot of tonight's conversation around the importance of sharing their but climate friendly and a formal community in Salem to not only be in line and state requirements but intent behind those and related to buildings um it's I can't stress the importance of ensuring we have sustainable strategies not only as a requirement but really just from a fundamental understanding of the impact that buildings have on on our carbon equivalent and as Heather outlined earlier very eloquently I think it it really showcases in the in the data how critical it is today and we do have strategies available to us and you know as a design professional uh we often have to rely on City staff and the review process and codes to encourage developers and our clients to implement those they are available they are often easily balanced as a life cycle opportunity with with the building and I think a lot of times it comes down to the the idea of long-old buildings versus flipped buildings and trying to encourage development in Salem that that speaks to that long home edition so that we are building sustainably every building for the same future and not simply an immediate economic gain so I just wanted to throw that out there as we're considering how to add even more review standings but they are often used as a tool and and I know I personally have abused them in discussions of clients that it is important and this does offer an opportunity to create a better environment for the people not of Salem but Valley in Oregon did you have them um yes set in for a while on the city council the other night on the 400 some unit and having participated as a palette in a previous case of Salem um there were some things that stood me some common issues coming up in the proceedings involving contestant developments one of them is reaching because around the conclusion of no reasonable alternatives because it's something that's provided on and in this case it wasn't there had been a yeah and it's much of an in-depth analysis or look at the reasonable and the other is that there's 63 which means that there's a lot of stuff now this has been improved this still has to go through an extensive process but it's one of which is primarily centered on the staff and the public you know people that in the neighborhood who were concerned about it aren't really part of the and those are two things that I think um the public doesn't necessarily understand and um and from my point of view I'm I'm not really sure I understand how would know reasonable alternative fits in I mean I know um between fits in but I'm not sure how those decisions are made or what that really needs and I'm wondering if at some point please make it a briefing or a discussion about the use of that so something immediate anything but uh it always seems to come up when you",

        "text": " I can follow up on that so um given that there's no time constraint um could the could the applicant um submit something that said yes we're going to have this facility and it will be 15 years out or is there it just wasn't clear to me that there's a timing constraint for construction and that when do you have a power purchase agreement or the evidence that it that for the wind component does that make sense now I understand your question I'm not sure I'm gonna let Sarah jump in here and help me out um this is Sarah esterson senior policy advisor for the citing division um so uh council is obligated to establish construction commencement deadlines for the facility and a completion deadline so they and I don't know do you have the ability to go I don't want to throw you off I can find it I wanted to verify what their time frame is but traditionally it's you have three years from the start and then three more years to finish so the time frame of this condition is within that window as a start but it's still a pre-construction requirement so bringing it back to council would be prior to construction of wind how quickly after they get these documents in place would we come well so um just um given that construction needs to be completed within three years let's say does that mean that both the solar and wind would have to be completed in in within the three years is it complete right that they their final design whatever is their final design they have to be done they don't have approval for everything in it if they go past that okay thank you I think that does the trick for me okay thanks great yeah nope for buyer so I think what we've seen in the past is that that triggers an amendment process if they need to go beyond the three years so this relates pre-construction to letting us know what they're doing the three-year periods and then the opportunity to come in with an amendment if more time is needed and and this condition doesn't change any of that good thank you council member Dublin doesn't have any bearing on my decision but just so I understand some of the aspects of this when you say 50 megawatts of wind are you referring to the name plate of the units okay not the actual um if sometime in the future I don't know if this is even theoretically possible but given the footprint of this site if that's all they ever actually develop is the uh the solar and the 15 megawatts uh if they were to choose to sell a portion of this site uh to someone else um could that be done without counsel for the record Todd cornet um no so ultimately if they wanted to split the site split the site certificate into two site certificates they would have to come in for an amendment to do that okay so they could certainly you know I mean if they wanted to they could Market a portion of it to somebody in Market abortion of it to somebody else that's business decision that's not related to council's jurisdiction but if they physic or not physically if they wanted to break the facility and have separate owners they could not do that without Council approval okay and thank you right but it's if if they weren't to develop facility infrastructure and the full footprint that Council would be approving I mean there's nothing that precludes another developer from coming in and working with those landowners to develop or otherwise assuming they get a permit of course it's all the questions at this time okay so I think we are back at the straw poll component so if you can yeah there you go so once again you have two options in front of council one is to agree with the financing facts reaching Supply and conditions of approval in the proposed for the Landview standard for the topic that I've covered or indicate any specific changes in finance fact inclusions alarm um yeah so the same as before you know this we don't have to do a formal Motion in second um we could just sort of a voice acknowledgment if you agree with one or if you um want two and then what changes you would be making um I would support option one I agree with the findings of fact and the conditions the revised conditions and thanks to staff and the applicant or fleshing out the goal three exception language that's very helpful and I think it gives us a good template to work from in the future so thanks I'm Cindy Conan and I agree with the findings of fact conclusions of law and the conditions of approval as presented here thank you care how thank you the same in Jordan truth still don't see him back okay I'm chair before we let Kate go I just wanted to confirm so on the posed order not the proposed contested case order but the proposed order taking two straw full votes organizational expertise and the portion of land use not part of the contested case as Kate had mentioned early or obviously there are a bunch of other standards we did not raise those but we want to make sure that you have given the opportunity to raise any questions um ish you know express any concerns on anything else in the proposed order before we move on to the next stage see heads taking negative so I thank you very all right so next on the list is a possible material change hearing so having taken the straw polls there was only one change uh in the proposed order related to the organizational expertise and that was changing the wood to a will I've made note of that and I will defer councilor Rowe to advise the council whether that constitutes a material change or not if it does not we do not need to hold material change sharing if it does we will need to hold material change hearing I would not consider that to constitute a material change we look at Material changes as something when you're changing and action recommended so for example if you uh there was a condition that you were adding or significantly changing as far as what the site certificate holder has to do we'd consider that a material change if you if the department had recommended finding compliance with a particular standard and you recommended not finding compliance with that standard and we'd consider that a material change but this uh does not rise to that level okay and I see our so not in her head as well we got double double so Madam chair that takes us to then the um number five on the sub list of this agenda item which is the hearing to adopt the final order um you have motion language on there um and really it's up for you to deliberate and decide if you want to make a decision um to approve modify or reject the uh request and if you approve it you would issue a site certificate I think this one is going to be and start out um can you can can we do a mic check I just got a note that um they're not able to hear yeah Chase Chase can you let me know okay yeah so he's saying that works now okay must have been just the proximity of the microphone thank you yeah okay all right so Vice chair Hal is prepared to make a motion secretary karnett do I need to make mention of the one word change you can make the motion and say with the following change and I can read the following change okay Madam chair I move that the council approved the proposed order and proposed contested case order on the Nolan Hills win power project as presented by staff and legal counsel as council's final order and issue a site certificate with um as indicated during the organizational expertise overview in the straw poll I don't have the exact citation but I have the language and I'll read that into the record it's a bullet point and it reads Capital power Corporation as the parent company to the LLC is the entity that and it would strike the wood and replace it with Will fund the construction operation and retirement of the proposed facility thank you so we have a motion council member Condon thank you we have a second of the motion any further deliberation hearing none Mr secretary please call the roll Richard Devlin Ken Al yes Cindy Condon yes Marcy Grail yes and buyer yes motion carries Madam chair thank you um I would just like to take a moment and say uh on behalf of the council first um thank you to staff for doing a diligent job to get things ready we appreciate the parties to the case but I would like to especially acknowledge the public and members of the Umatilla County Commissioners who showed up we all have an opportunity and in some instances to participate in processes like this and it means a lot to us not that we don't pay attention when people submit things in writing or participate virtually but the fact that you were here it gave us an opportunity and I know many of you spoke to us on breaks and things so we appreciate your presence and Ms miles thank you for stepping in and and helping us get um which you know as you stated earlier when you're not living it daily it can be challenging so again thank you to staff and everyone for participating all right um our agenda says we are having a short break but being that we just had a break I would presume that everyone is okay to continue on council member Condon thank you I also wanted to thank the um for being responsive and really taking comments seriously um I think we got to the kind of the finish line so um thank you for your participation response to the requests thanks for picking up my Miss there that I apologize for not acknowledging y'all especially flying all the way from um so thank you thanks Cindy um okay so we are not going to take a break and that means we are on to agenda item H and um this is um you'll excuse me for one hot second I was asked um why I have recused myself so we're going to move on to the Boardman the Hemingway transmission line um this is going to be a possible f-sec review of the draft proposed order on Amendment one we will have Kellen tardy the senior siding analyst ready to provide a presentation on request on the draft proposed order on requests for Amendment one for the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line I've previously recused myself but for the record I want to be clear this is Marcy Grail and I do not intend to vote on any energy facility citing Council actions relevant to the proposed Boardman to Hemingway transmission line I was employed by Pacific Power from 2001 to 2006. I have no financial interest in Pacific Power Pacific Corps or any related entity however as a condition of my accepting appointment to this Council",

        "text": " i don't have that tenure but um okay thanks i may follow up with with that yeah you know just again the the whole point of this is to one convey what these standards are so that you know council members are clear but you know to seek are we doing it you know in the way that the council wants us to you know some of these can be pretty clear and objective and some of them are fairly um broad and allow for varying interpretations and so that's exactly what we want to do is have this kind of conversation so you know council members are concerned with what we're lying upon as evidence in terms of our recommendations to you um and there is that room for interpretation we want to hear what those issues and concerns are okay thank you yeah yeah i mean i certainly would be interested in your feedback as we you know i think chris will start talking about the rule making where we're looking at our standards but if there's a way that sub a could be you know how we how can we really evaluate whether that's giving us what we need to evaluate their financial capability if in fact it's lacking i'm not sure if the lacking that you saw with obsidian was lacking within the framework of the sub a like sub a is lacking but either way um i think we should look at it yeah and and um i don't want to um say that it was necessarily lacking but in my reading of it it would it did not give me comfort i guess and you know it's often referred to as a comfort letter or whatever this is is very very limited um but they would get the bond in the end so maybe it doesn't matter but if we have it on the front end i'd like it to give more comfort i guess that's what i that's what i was thinking so absolutely well and i think that's where we're really trying to get if the information is required in an exhibit for our evaluation we want it to have value and be the information that's needed to support an efficient process and if we have information that doesn't give much weight to the analysis thing than what value is it serving and so i mean we definitely want to go there okay thank you patrick rose doj i have just one one quick comment uh council member khan with regard to the concern you expressed about the fact that one of the legal opinion letters you saw uh limited the opinion to coming from one attorney at the firm i don't find that problematic our standard doesn't require that the opinion letter come from a firm we would certainly accept an opinion letter from a solo practitioner if they were qualified in this arena that doesn't cause me concern and just to respond and i appreciate that fully um i i just looked at it as here's a firm it's on the firm's letterhead and then narrowing to this isn't our opinion it is it is the attorney of actually they named two attorneys and i apologize i think it was obsidian but um i looked at a couple of them um and so i don't want to i don't want to put out there that anybody was lacking i should have said x but um anyway i mean i'll just pursue that a little bit further um in another forum thanks hey uh sarah i see that chris has his hand up so you may want to go to him if he wants to ask him go for it chris thanks sarah and uh chair girl comes with condon um i just wanted to add real quick that just it's a kind of a note but um that paragraph a uh was added when the standard was really related to financial capability which was like more related to you know there's the organizational expertise uh which is more of a technical expertise standard and then there was this financial capability standard which was really about you know do they have the resources to successfully construct operate and retire the and at that time there wasn't actually a bonding requirement um and so that might be part of the mismatch of like why that legal opinion letter does not provide necessarily the same information that we would need to determine that somebody could actually get a bond or a letter of credit that helps me thank you first great well thank you so much for the discussion that was great so please are you concluded i am concluded i can pass you back the sure if you are able to do that so sarah um are we finished with this item or do you have more just about we're just just checking making sure no problem no problem okay am i sharing can you see the i'm sorry i'm lost what screen am i sharing the presentation no not yet we have a couple of boxes up that are partial but not the powerpoint i can continue through if you if that's easy okay do you wanna pass me back the ball sure sorry when i do apologize thank you chase yeah okay so just to wrap up here um we thought it was valuable to highlight for council the kind of the shift over time for an applicant as they become a certificate holder and the applicability and or compliance with the standard um so what we've really been focusing on here so far is kind of maybe obviously the what goes into the evaluation of compliance first for council to make a finding that an applicant can satisfy the and that starts again just in summary like they have to have an adequate satisfactory estimate for decommissioning and restoring the site of the facility and sufficient evidence to demonstrate that they can obtain a bond or a letter of credit uh in this form an amount um deemed appropriate by council then if approved by meeting you know all council standards and then an applicant becomes a certificate holder then they have numerous conditions imposed under the retirement and financial assurance standard as well as the mandatory conditions that we talked about and then before a certificate holder can start construction of the facility amongst numerous other requirements they have to a decommissioning estimate for the facility based on final design so as as we've seen in practice certificate holders are getting approval in large part a much larger facility than what actually goes forward so that and the conditions allow them to take what was a full build-out decommissioning estimate and adjust that based on final design now they can't the unit costs or the tasks and actions that were approved but if they don't build the full 100 wind turbines when they only have 51 or two substations when they only have one they can adjust that um sort of the quantity of um facility and that's the only adjustment that can be done in addition to an inflation adjustment so if their decommissioning estimate was approved in 2020 but they don't build until 2025 we go through that exercise and it is part of the condition of the process for inflating based on gdp indicator index that final estimate so we go through the process of pre-construction of reviewing and evaluating and validating that estimate then we get the bond and the most current bond or letter of credit and the most for current template that council has approved from a financial institution that council has approved and then that goes into our lock box and then once they move into operation they're on an annual cycle where they have to update that bond or letter of credit based on inflation and our um fiscal analysis lee fleming sort of manages that and makes sure letters are sent out on the same cycle as their bond or letter of credit cycle so that we get those annually and then um when and if we have an fsec facility that it falls under our decommissioning site certificate termination rules then they have to go through this process of submitting a decommissioning plan to council for approval and then following the requirements of that decommissioning plan to then close out the site certificate and that scenario would be one where we never had to exercise the bond or letter of credit but of course that bond or letter of credit that we've kept track of the whole time gives us gives the state that protection in case the certificate holder were to have issues and fulfilling that obligation so i believe that is the conclusion of our slide deck and so if there's any other questions we can answer at this time we'd be happy to okay well we really appreciate your time and interest and um i believe i i might have failed to mention this in the beginning but this is part one of two and so we will be following up at the next council meeting likely with some additional information and examples and and thank you sarah thank you all right well next up is agenda item g the surety bond template update this is an accent item we have christopher clark oda rules coordinator who will provide recommended template language updates for surety bonds christopher the floor is yours all right thank you chair crail of the council for the record my name is christopher clark i'm a sighting policy analyst with the department and the council's rules coordinator um i'm going to be actually with you for the next three agenda items so i'm going to do my best to keep things moving along as best i can but please do interrupt me uh if you have any questions because i may miss raised hands or that sort of thing um so as chair grill just mentioned the first item i'm presenting is a follow-up on our last agenda item i'm going to be giving an update on the council's assurance instrument templates and providing staff's recommended changes to the surety bond template and uh you all can see my screen okay i'm imagining it's excellent okay thank you okay so uh sarah just covered a lot of this but um council's rules by the financial assurance and retirement standard requires each certificate holder to provide a bond or letter of credit in a form an amount satisfactory to the council to restore the site prior to and they have to they submit that prior to beginning construction of the facility um the bond or letter of credit provides assurance that the certificate holder will restore the site to a useful non-hazardous condition the end of the facility's life um and then as sarah just just mentioned that underwater credit must be kept active until the facility has been um and and sarah explained the process for adjusting the amount for inflation for inflation sorry um so the council currently has about million dollars of financial assurance on file 56 of that which is around 94.2 million is provided in letters of credit and the remaining 74 million is provided in surety bonds um so a pretty even split between the two types of instruments that are allowable under the council's",

taxes on regardless of the rest of it um it will also then reset the community service fee because there's a threshold of what has to be paid Lou that number the tax the minimum investment the taxable portions are all going to be indexed to the Consumer Price indexing numbers and shift from year to year as we enter into the negotiations the year of the negotiation is what will set the terms of what those numbers are um and then that property tax abatement that's provided for within that agreement must last 15 years person went to statute um after these standards are set we negotiate the rest and that's where the Sip policy becomes vital to how we approach any potential sap agreement turn it back to Matt great thank you Aaron so from here we're going to be talking about the proposed changes to the County's sip policy um prior to the conversation to the presentation of the conversation that we had with your board on July 18th we uh reviewed and thought about some of the direction and conversations that your board has had uh to think about some of the potential changes um and and feedback and input that you might have on the Sip policy and from that we we came up with uh identified kind of three three themes three uh principles those are the first three that you see on the left side of the screen here so I'll just read them the first is supporting marginalized communities is fundamental to promoting Equitable and Equitable economy that provides opportunity for all government transparency is crucial for providing Community with information about decision making and Investments and urban service provision is the job of City governments those are those are a few principles that we heard from previous board conversations during the July 18th presentation and discussion there was three additional uh statements that that we took uh from that uh conversation and those are the three points you see on the right and I'll read these the first is the county should seek to better operationalize its sip policy so I'll talk about that in just a second on the next slide new sip agreements should address the additional costs of Public Services created by Associated economic growth and the third is to make an informed decision about an Sip and for better transparency the county should assess the potential benefits and costs of each sip project so that was the additional feedback that um that we received and have staff have used to think about and modify the County's sip policy that we're bringing to you today um in the County's sip policy there are four main sections the last time the County's sap policy was put together was in 2006. uh there are four sections there's a program overview there's program objectives uh evaluation guidelines and the review process we're going to focus the discussion here today and this is the primary location where staff has sought to to modify the policy these two sections as I have mentioned uh really we think is is going to take more time to make thorough changes uh again to to the to the fee to the process and really actually even consider whether um all of those sections need to be in the policy in general I do want to um just take one more second here to also talk about some of these the ways that we might think about changing the evaluation guidelines and the review process and to speak directly to your board's feedback around operationalizing the County's Sipe policy so we talk about operationalizing a policy it is about the implementation steps the dedicating resources the following through the tracking of the work that is embedded within a policy so I think there's a few ways that we can think about operationalizing the County's sip policy and these were things that we would propose to evaluate and address in a new economic development project in this coming year so one of those things is assessment of the costs and benefits of an sip agreement so how do we know that the return on investment to community from sip is a good deal when do we know that it is passing that kind of rash that rationale test of this is this is going to be a greater benefit to the community than than what we're giving up so perhaps we can think about an economic impact assessment or a cost and benefit assessment perhaps by a third party that helps your board uh decision makers understand whether this sip deal is worth pursuing and worth um worth moving forward another uh area here where we'd want to take a look is around project tracking and Reporting this gets I think to your direction around transparency and good governance how are we making sure and making sure that the company is being accountable to the promises that are embedded within this agreement and how can we do a good job the right job of communicating uh outwardly to community about how that company is doing those things and the impacts and the outcomes to the community and to local government so that's something we also want to explore when it comes to operationalizing the county sip uh I think also the third one is improvements and clarifications to the SIP process and I will note that actually this is something that we staff have already started in creating uh for example templates for a non-disclosure agreement templates to a pre-application meeting just so we're ready uh if and when companies come knocking in the door that we can provide them with clear guidelines around uh how are you going to move through the process so I think that last one is really around around some kind of detailed uh process pieces that uh that we're looking at uh one more uh slide here about operationalizing the Sip before we get into the program objectives I wanted to um put this up here because sip is actually a unique um economic incentive there are a number of economic incentives even here in Oregon uh like the Enterprise Zone incentive that is more procedural uh and is kind of a if than if you do this then you get that and they can kind of move uh companies can kind of move through those incentives without much of a public process but a more administrative process and the Sip is unique because sip has this more public process and I think uh as we think about improving the County's policy and the process something that we need to be considering is the perspective of the business and our businesses think about reducing risk and increasing certainty so that they can follow through on in making sure that these Investments that are planned are profitable and and go the way that they have proposed to move forward so as uh as we think about moving towards improving process um staff is going to be thinking about clear expectations for participating companies and making sure that the process is clear that it's transparent and that is efficient um I'm going to pause just briefly here um because the rest of the slides are really focused on the modifications to the program objectives but I know that I've already kind of covered a bunch and I've talked about this approach to a project so chair Harrington board I know if we want to pause here for any questions or Reflections before we get into the program objectives I know I have a question but do any of my colleagues have any questions but go ahead I'll defer to you and then it's mine's very specific it's okay number four an explanation of that but you can answer oh I want you to jump in there before I'm a little lost I'm feeling a little lost um and maybe I'm not lost but so there's the car policy uh there's what the state has enabled and that's where the current policy rests and there's processes that happen now there's all this chips Act support or as often rise through the federal government the state legislature has taken some action so we have this current set of information in place what we're talking about is making some adjustments to that um for a potential update in some time frame and you're also talking about how they're you've taken a look and there are some other things that could happen in 23 24. okay so there's current there's updated and there's updated again I don't track all the chips act through the media it sounds like well a bunch of this is going to happen real and is just waiting for something and I'm wondering when we had a before the legislative session or during the early parts of the earlier this year before July when we were talking about sips and the what had has been in place I spoke pretty firmly and crisply that those terms are too low and I don't want to be in a situation of being asked to uh and a new agreement under the old terms I guess can I call them the old terms well under the existing terms existing terms yes but at the same time but 23 24 terms you're talking that's fiscal year or could go all the way out to the end of calendar year 24 I'm like oh so what's the timeline look like because I don't want to be in a situation where we're forced to use the 2006 and the older legislation stuff um and have that carry forward or haunt us until we have an update sooner rather than later but the full 23-24 possible updates so you know me I like a timeline let me uh start to answer here and then Aaron if you have some thoughts uh as well um I think to your your final part of the the question around timeline I think that staff I think we could complete that evaluation within the fiscal year so by by June 30th 2024 I think that is something that we could do and and uh appreciate the the question we could be more clear in future um I think um I think there's a couple uh a couple things to consider here I think uh we're uh very interested in getting the boards input on the program objectives uh now in a timely way because the program objectives really are the succinct statements where uh the board's uh interests and and principles around how staff should um think about and negotiate an sip deal are embedded within the policy um and uh they're you know again they're succinct they're clear there's a few of them the evaluation guidelines and the the",

        "text": " good the reality is that it's a burden in so many different ways and I think that that's the other piece you know we're our own worst enemies to some to some degree here but I and I do think of that uh the fact that we need to make sure that others know that yes we might be but you're benefiting and we're paying a lot of the costs here well if I could jump in on that because first of all the chips money is designed to offset a lot of this costs of this development secondly is the City of Hillsboro would probably Annex all of that if it's going to be developed they're going to be developing it there that's why we have that's why we have sip agreements um we can talk about um a significant modification of the Sip agreement but the fact of the matter is again the feds are going to hold us accountable for um and and the only way we're going to be attractive to this development is to have something like a sip agreement in place and we start talking about redoing the entire sip agreement we were causing a lot of consternation because I don't I'm not sure we could get that through now I'm not saying that we don't need to must do some tweaks to the current sip agreement but when we start talking about throwing the baby out with the bath water and starting over again that's a significant issue I don't think that's what she was saying but I understand your concern and thank you for the clarification because I'm not sure I understood all of the you know all of the pieces that you brought so well yeah and I'm just again my concern is let's learn from our lessons that's that's what I'm I think we're going to have to partner up with the city Hillsboro quite frankly in this conversation because this isn't just about us I mean it's it's certainly in our County but the fact of the matter is City Hillsboro is the one that's going to be um probably taking the lead on a lot of this stuff just because it should be in a municipal service environment so okay so for time yep I'd like to have the opportunity in this discussion to contribute go right ahead um my items so here comes the big one uh that I alluded to at the beginning there is no free land for the semiconductor industry to expand anywhere in Washington County it would be impacting negatively impacting foundational farmland that is a healthy and robust industry so it does play one industry off another and I say that to recognize the situation the facts literally on the ground um and that means that the state legislature is going to need to own their responsibility of Engagement we've been around this block once where the state legislature made action people were not heard hence rep solman now Senator solman's um and Metro and the county were left to deal with the circumstance so Eyes Wide Open going into it I think learning from the past the state legislature is going to need to understand that the reality the next big thing I have is there need to be more gets right to use the phrase gives and gets there need to be more gets in order for the County government of Washington County the city governments of Washington County whichever one it is not a foregone conclusion it's proximate to Hillsboro it could be proximate to other flat areas in Washington County or approximate to Washington County what happens if it's the Langdon Farms area which the melitus brothers have been pushing since 2006 if not earlier and that Clackamas counties board is going to have an opinion on it Marion County is going to have an opinion on it um I was the lucky recipient of multiple Sam brentano uh thoughts on this during urban and rural that board has changed over as well so the landscape's a little bit different than it was way back when so in that vein of need more gets we know that I5 is congested we know of 217 and Highway 26 and the 405 tunnel is congested as well so let me offer up another guess the state needs to commit funds for Southwest corridor because we already know that the city of Tigard has been building out the tiger with the result that Southwest Corridor has been adopted into the RTP but it is not funded at some point there is going to be a stop development hold by the state it's going to hit the city of Tigard hard because having it in an adopted document is necessary but not sufficient so no matter where this gets cited near Hillsboro proximate to Hillsboro I don't I agree with you that if it is proximate to Hillsboro Hillsboro is well positioned to Annex it and provide some of the Servicing but if it isn't Hillsborough it's some other community and we know that there will be Support Services in the ecosystem there will be new residents there will be travel for education that impacts the I-5 corridor Southwest Corridor funding commissioner trees was reminding us of our discussion around game share and sip I think there are existing parameters of the existing sip program that are there to build on but I was very outspoken at that work session that I will not vote for an sip program with those 1993 or 1995 caps of 100 million and and so forth two million Community Development and all that kind of stuff I get that those have to be modernized I think I think at a detail level that's what we're getting at I think um at the concept level I referred to those as tweaks even though they're significant dollars but there's okay we're learning one another's vocabulary and we'll continue to evolve D the other thing in the I don't know that I will be able to get to a yes okay but another an ultimate yes getting the cities to a yes right no matter what city it is and and School District there's that responsibility that burden that goes along with it and we EV every government conversation that I've been in in the last six months is has been there's been consistency we are having difficulties right measure five was a a decision from 1990 with the property tax caps and local governments across the board are struggling and we need help hence the relivability aspect and how do we make sure we haven't just given up the ghost so I was thinking measure five trade out it would be interesting yeah that constitutional question yeah yeah yeah I know there's lots of you know it's complicated so I don't know where the thousand friends will be on in this whole process and the farmland and one of their primary tools is litigation I don't know where the environmental side will be we've touched on water we've touched on air I still have some from urban and rural reserves I feel healed but there's still some Scar Tissue there and and it's it's in a little bit under the fabric of the semiconductor task force I have similar Stars just different I think yeah absolutely yeah where is the board of County Commissioners comfortable boy do we get it's complicated uh I think this conversation has given you a little bit more insight as to some of our points of discomfort and some of our unknowns what further information might we need uh we I have heard expressed a commitment from the group to be a good partner with the state what seems less clear through this discussion is how the state will be a good partner to the county and whatever cities are impacted does that sound reasonable yes and I have a question and this is directed at Aaron and maybe others have the answer first of all I don't know where uh our new governor is going to be in relationship to to this opportunity uh we knew where our former governor was but I don't know that we any of us know the other the other question I have is it we're looking as though and I think I said that we're one of the top three counties or top two counties am I accurate in that assumption and I assume that those opportunities are Metro related versus somewhere else in the state and so this brings to mind Catherine the discussions that we have at AOC yeah and the fact that you know this is we're in a position to again carry a burden of course the state economy that I don't think is uh understood throughout the state so so anyway I'm just going to leave that there too so I will just address a couple of a little bit of it um I think because the governor-elect is in transition she is going over these things she's becoming educated she's having conversations with the former governor's office with all of the other and large table as the chair mentioned it's not just industry and local government there's environmental factors there's land um the farm community all of like all of that is still being processed I think by her her team it is um she has stated a desire to be a partner in all of this but hasn't put parameters on where that sits for her and that will be part of the overall conversation in the next couple of weeks um as the indicators that is her attention to business Oregon so I'm just putting that out there too yeah so and and then as far as yes obviously the Metro region is a place where it feels very natural for something this big but I think what is really important to think about in this this overall picture is while much of the work is focused on taking advantage of the opportunity of the chips act and setting Oregon up for success in that this can go beyond the semiconductor industry to advance manufacturing which has Statewide implications and that's where if we create tools that function Beyond one um but create sideboards for advantages we do give to this industry that are saying when we're doing something really big like super sighting and it's very specific to the chips act that it's tied very tightly to that but the rest of the programmatic changes which might have benefited Advanced manufacturing does not rely on the proximity to the Metro region which is then um you know bandied back and forth but I would also say that the Metro region expands because you know you go a little bit further south on I-5 and if congestion is relieved through Southwest Corridor investment perhaps um you know there's opportunities for development of you know pieces of this industry there are other pieces of this industry like our land Technologies um and all the other medium or smaller developers that are in other parts of the state that can take advantage of one investment here so there are ways to think about this as a Statewide investment which means we shouldn't be holding the bag for the rest of the state to paraphrase differently and so when we have these conversations with our fellow",

        "text": " each county and they looked at temporary housing hotels and rv parks places where temporary that would come in to construct the facility would be able to use and the department recommends with the construction of the facility there would it would not significantly impact the ability of housing providers to provide housing this table's a little bit small on the screen as well it's a derivative of a of the proposed order table as well um this is the vehicle trips the estimated vehicle trips this includes light duty construction trucks and heavy-duty construction trucks as well as personal vehicles from construction and so that is just under 1300 maximum daily trips associated with the construction spread there's also a very lengthy table in the proposed order that breaks out the because we talk about a construction and just in the generally of constructing a very long linear facility it's going to happen in segments and so um so in the the traffic impact table we talk about kind of north to south or south to north of breaking out and it kind of shakes out in a per county and some of it some spreads there's an overlap in the county but it's basically per per county constructing where where in a maximum scenario where the maximum amount of workers and trucks and people are on site what are those traffic impacts in that area um so and that table also has it ratios of estimating based on existing traffic volumes with the additional traffic and the the recommendation from those tables is that taking into account mitigation which are items and best management practices included in the draft traffic management plan taking into account mitigation that the impacts per those spreads would not significantly impact the service providers so the service providers are generally public works departments people who maintain roads we look at road conditions a lot you could also look at law enforce enforcement personnel anybody that's on site that would be impacted by increased volume so we have this recommended public services condition 2 which is the county specific transportation management plan the condition and the plan requires that the applicant prior to construction coordinate with the department and the affected county in the finalization of these plans and it is a draft plan so but there are several best management practices on on items to reduce impacts from traffic so we have flagging pilot vehicles hours of one of the most important aspects that would be are are the actual routes that would be used based on the final transmission line routes selected so this kind of goes on to the part part of the process of finalizing plans as we're aware the applicant is proposing the proposed route and several alternative routes let's if we run the assumption or the scenario that council approves all of those or approves the proposed route and in one area one alternative route and denies another one it allows the applicant the opportunity to select its final route out of the approved routes for instance in malheur county we have one area where there are several alternatives in one area same thing with morrow counting more accounting along the bombing range road there's actually two alternatives in the proposed route there ultimately one would be selected which means that that would be then the final route which then is finalized then you have to look at which transportation routes are going to be used for that so that is some of the items that would be as part of that traffic management plan um recommended public services condition 3 also has a helicopter use plan that would be um that would be submitted because as we're aware there is helicopter use proposed in some areas particularly where there's limitations on site access and to transport a cruise and stringing transmission lines and i am going to stop did you have anything you wanted okay so this is jesse radcliffe for the record again and what we're going to be moving to in terms of the contested case issues and exceptions is issue ps4 the party is mr cooper the issue raised in the contested case related specific it's the risk of wildfire arising out of operation of the proposed facility capability of local firefight uh we don't have a very good connection you keep breaking and cutting in and out okay i will try to i think it's the connection try a different microphone oh my god can you hear me oh i can okay great all right um so since you probably didn't catch the initial part of that um i was just uh reading out the uh the issue that had been raised uh by mr cooper uh pertaining to fire protection uh whether the applicant adequately analyzed the risk of wildfire rising out of operation of the proposed facility and the ability of local firefighting service providers to respond to fires so the hearing officer addressed this in her opinion first set out what the standard the broader public services standard requires in this particular case requires the council find that the proposed facility would not be likely to result in a significant adverse impact to the ability of public and private firefighters ability to provide fire protection services the standard the hearing office ruled though that the standard does not require that ipc prove that the proposed facility cannot or will not cause a fire she found that mr cooper correctly identified that it would take the le grand rural fire protection district more than four to eight minutes which was the response time identified in the exhibit u of the application to respond to a fire near morgan lake she concluded however that in the context of the overall analysis of the issue that that did not affect the outcome because idaho power in its application had acknowledged that response times would vary there was additionally uh evidence about um the um the likelihood of fires and the ability of the agencies to respond um in other ways so um the findings there were that although fires are not uncommon in the project area um the fire protection agencies are able to contain um small fires some of the evidence that was provided on uh um this point uh so idaho power had uh provided 27 years of data from the wildland fire decision support for fires within 50 miles of the proposed facility the data included fire size and cause is particularly relevant here it showed that 1.35 percent of fires were caused by power lines um idaho power evaluated the probability of fire to be contained and uh it's in an initial response based on size and the hearing officer concluded that it can be shown that fires within the project area are are capable of being contained where they're still small there are also a number of conditions that the hearing officer noted that bear of the fire protection agencies those include the fire suppression plan which is a component of public services condition six the right-of-way clearing assessment which is a component of land use condition 16 and the vegetation management plan which is a component of fish and wildlife condition two and she found that all of these will work together to reduce the risk of project related fires the hearing officer noted that the legrand fire protection district has mutual aid agreements with both the city of legrand and the department of forestry both of these entities are closer to morgan lake park and are primarily responsive responsible for morgan lake and just really briefly for council members who may not be familiar with what a mutual aid agreement is um it's pretty much what it sounds like it's a fire protection um or other public safety entities that are agreeing to help each other out when help is needed and there are parameters put on that and an understanding of who's supposed to do what when if there is an emergency that needs responding to the hearing officer also concluded that aerial firefighting dispatch center located at the la grande airport would be capable of supporting the fire and finally the hearing officer had recommended amendments to the public service condition six this is the one again that uh that deals with the fire suppression plan um she recommended that additional fire suppression plan requirements include an evaluation of seasonal work restrictions on-site firefighting equipment and necessary fire protection resources based on an evaluation of sensitive seasonal conditions and current uh regarding response times from uh the grand rural fire protection district so that's the summary of the hearing officers findings there and we can go to mr cooper's oral argument which i believe is recorded testimony i am petitioner matt cooper addressing issue ps4 fire protection i live at the base of mill creek canyon less than two miles below morgan lake park i have lived and recreated in le grand for 31 years our home was recently identified as being in a wildland urban air interface or wui and being high risk for wildfire by the oregon department of you can hear it up there um crystal were you able to hear the recorded testimony the last thing i heard was oregon department of forestry okay yeah then you're hearing it i'll restart it some neighbors are now being denied insurance on their homes it is ironic that idaho power proposes to build a power line through the same area i request the council to deny the site certificate or remand the proposed contested case order alternatively underground the route through the morgan lake region which is cited in a 2005 planning document as the number one wooie in the county i raised one exception the alj aired and not including the department's recommended amendment to recommended public services condition six regarding the accuracy of response times present in the asc exhibit u table u10 the department was correct in its recommended provisions especially recommendation number two identify updated information from the grand rural fire protection district on the number of full-time and volunteer employees number and type of equipment vehicles and response times to the facility though only raising one exception i strongly disagree with judge webster's decision which took idaho power's statements at face value and barely acknowledged my closing arguments ipc's closing brief relies heavily on expert witnesses especially berkeley resident chris lautenberger who admitted under cross-examination that he has never visited this area ipc's statements are simplistic blithe and overly broad for example they say their transmission line fire would not spread into legrand because winds travel from the north during fire season and fire always travels uphill my evidence shows that as early as the 1860s fire swept down the mill creek canyon both northward and downhill ipc states that 500 kilovolt lines and steel transmission towers rarely cause fires yet their witnesses admit that there are five documented fires caused by these lines one apparently caused by a mylar balloon my evidence demonstrates that ipc's originally stated response times to fire in this region four to eight minutes were grossly understated a more accurate estimate would be 17 to 23 minutes with the dry and windy conditions that prevail here into the summer even a few minutes could be crucial ipc claims that it does",

Oran energy Alliance Network postive we've been working on off link understanding from a community perspective as well as r i f on the board of and also representing that organization here and for the last three years have been spending a lot of time on being of cing Renewables working in Washington and Oregon rural communities to better understand the goals and opportunities for renew of hydrogen and other things fuels whether they are derived from electrons or renable I My Hope for this work is that we can tap into the profile and other advisors and come up with some strategies that can be readily communicated at the end of the day to oron so that they can understand the implications for their own communities decision that we with respect to what energy sources we have how proximate they are for and what thanks for thank you and welcome next is Tim McMahon not sure I saw Tim on screen okay Tucker bill yeah hi my name is Tucker bman I'm the director of government relations for the Oregon Rural Electric Cooperative Association uh or OA for short because I know that's a mouthful uh OA represents the states 18 not for-profit um uh consumer owned electric utility electric cooperatives uh that cover the geographic majority of the state and serve about 420,000 oregonians which we refer to as members many of you would refer to as customers uh but our our end users own the Cooper atives they vote for our boards of directors and um so we are we're truly a locally owned resource we operate uh at profit and if we have or at at at cost and if we have a profit we return that uh to the members in the form of a Capital Credit um and so that's who we are we cover uh all corners of the state and through Central Oregon along the gorge um and and so we we have a good span of of kind of everywhere in the State uh and we rely on the hydroelectric power that's produced on the Columbia River power system and the lower Snake River dams uh and that is marketed by BPA I've heard BPA mentioned many times here today incredibly important for us it's clean power um it's incredibly reliable and it gives us some of the cheapest rates in the country and so uh orca's members and the member owners of these electric cooperatives are are benefit greatly from from the hydroelectric projects uh and so those are a huge priority for us and you'll hear me um talking about those frequently as a part of this group so thanks for having me I look forward to to getting to know everybody welcome glad to have you with us so I want pause at this time for anybody I named but wasn't here yet team can you help me are there any more advisory committee members I missed either raise your hand or Jump On In right so I think for today we have our table I will be slightly wistful of my day sitting in a room with all of you we're around the table and I love tent cards you know those little name tents that you can just pop up we can see each other's names you can kind of feel the whole table so this is as close as we're getting today we're really grateful and appreciative for all of you being here it's quite exciting uh what I want to do next in these last couple minutes is just let the rest of the project team introduce themselves so I'd like to turn now to Eileen Quigley go ahead and Gilly you can pop back up the slide uh good morning uh thank you very much my name is een Quigley and I'm the executive director of the clean energy Institute we are a nonpartisan nonprofit organization whose mission is to accelerate an equitable clean energy transition in the Northwest we provide unbiased data and analytics to help policy makers Advocates businesses and government agencies in the four Northwest states Idaho Montana Oregon and Washington understand what it takes to achieve a clean energy transition economically technically and equitably Odo selected our team in a competitive bidding process to velop an energy Pathways analysis for organ's energy strategy for the past six years CTI has been partnering with evolved Energy Research to produce economy-wide energy Pathways analyses for Washington Oregon and Montana in addition to evolved energy the CTI team includes two organ based Consultants Angela long of rockrest Consulting and Elaine Hart of moment energy insights from September 2024 through January 2025 our team will model different energy Pathways based on input from oo and stakeholders on the pressing energy questions that must be debated as Oregon de develops its energy strategy in addition to providing energy Pathways analysis the CTI team will also model health and economic impacts of reducing fossil fuel use and incorporate other co- benefits of greenhouse gas emission reduction and environmental justice consideration our technical analysis is only one part of the that offers guidance for the policy and strategy discussions that Odo and stakeholders will have in developing the Oregon energy strategy throughout 2025 thank you very much welcome eileene welcome team much appreciated so next up Kerns and West introductions so just really briefly I already had a chance to say hi Deb noodleman a principal owner and a senior mediator here at kernen West um our company provides specifically neutral process support we have offices around the country this whole team that's working on the project is based here in Portland Oregon um we've all been around for a long time and we say what we do is environmental public policy multi-party uh we kind of call it big table work which means that we love working with representation of diverse interests coming together to argue mightily and have robust dialogues to find conclusion that best meet your joint interests and so that's the sandbox we tend to play in and we think this is a great one to be having joined in again with our neutral process support and then I just want to turn to Ben Duncan my co- facilitator for just a sec so he can say hi to the group hi group so Ben Duncan um vice president senior facilitator at Kern and West and and Deb you really named it I'm it's just a real privilege to be able to be in this space with you all just listening and reflecting on the introductions and the hopes and the vision that you all laid out um just it's uh it's very exciting to to imagine the journey that we'll be able to go on together thanks D great thank you and then Gilly Garber yance you've been hearing from him already he's what we call the hug to the spoke so you'll get lots of contact from him and he helps held the process together our project manager and then Nicole mateli is here somewhere and she's helping with notaker Logistics and multitude of other tasks so we're all glad to be here and leaning in with the rest of you so here we go into the first kickoff for our substance and we're gonna transition to a new set of slides we're gonna have Edith Ben you're gonna kick it off and then Edith I'll be really briefly good job on time we're right at 10:04 that's pretty pretty good after um hearing everyone's introduction so we're going to hear a presentation um from the Oregon Department of energy team and and Edith Bayer and and as Deb said earlier you know this will both be foundation and tip of the iceberg so hopefully we're going to provide some initial Clarity for where the work is headed and and where our work will be um going forward together and so we're going to have a presentation and then uh really ask you to hold your questions as Deb again said earlier either jot your questions down if you want to put them in the chat so you don't lose um what you'd like to ask um and we can capture those that would be great but with that Edith I'll I'll pass it to you thanks Ben um and thanks thanks everybody again I just uh I want to let everybody know we we've built in a break in the agenda comes after this presentation but since we're all remote I encourage everyone to just like stand up and stretch if you need to I'm standing up right now I have a desk that moves up and down so just uh I realize it's hard to pay attention for for so long um but I really appreciated the introductions um and just hearing from you all and hearing hearing what everybody brings to the table and and and what your hopes are for this process what I'd like to do to start us off is to just give a little bit of and if we can go to the next slide a little bit of a an overview of why um where're we're working on an energy strategy talking about energy strategy um I think probably everybody has an idea in their minds and some of you might have heard uh us present on this before but I think it's important to bring us all to the same page uh then I'll talk a little bit about the scope of the energy strategy and the process that we envision over the next year and a half uh I'll outline the opportunities that we've built in for engagement and where The Advisory Group Falls within that uh and then we'll have some time for questions and answers I'm sure um that there might be some questions coming up and I encourage folks to just jot those down and be ready for them um when we when we get to the end um so with that we can go to the slide um and I think it's just a transition slide so we can just jump more and so this is uh some of you might be familiar with this this is a sanki diagram from our 2022 by annual Energy report there's a new one coming out in just a few months um and the reason I'm showing this is that it's really kind",

        "text": "This meeting is being recorded now. We are going to start our work session on the website multimodal investment strategy. I will turn it over to hint. Hello, counselors, thank you for coming. Joining us today to talk about the website, my name is Matt a lot. I'm the transportation assistant division director of the state of Hillsboro, joined today by representatives from ODOT. Good evening, chancellor. This is Kate hockey, and this is senior transportation planner with Petro. Good evening. I'm Stephanie Millar, principal planner director of the office. All right, so the focus of today's work session will be on the west side multimodal improvement study. But before we get there, I want to find a little context of background that's relevant to this study. Was sort of the parents to this, to this west side multiple improvement strategy. Just takes a minute, no more. All right, so I'm going to start with a little historical context. The Washington County Transportation Future study has really set the table for this. It happened about a decade ago, and there are some similarities, but also noticeable differences between the two different studies and their focus. So the catastasian future study was originally pursued by the city, but ultimately led by Washington that addressed how transportation investments can support the county's economic vitality for decades to come. It's funded by the Oregon. The study was focused on looking beyond the typical 20 year planning horizon that we used for a lot of our planning studies. Looking all the way out to 2055. Get there, maybe should go. There it is. Is it on? Just real quick? Does it look like it's turned on green? Yeah, it's working. It should work real quick. So a couple of land use scenarios were developed looking at future employment, population growth. The expected population increase range between 40 and 55% relative to the 2010 base year, and expected employment growth between 100 and 140%. So with these changes in land use comes substantial changes in traffic and travel patterns in our region. So with increased urbanization and density, studies showed big increase in travel demand coming in and out of accounting. The future scenario showed the need to provide accessible and affordable transit to serve more people, especially lower income households and excused areas in major place centers. More urban population would increase the need for safe and attractive bike and walking facilities for both shorter and longer trips. And increased motor vehicle travel demand would mean the bottlenecks wing upstate would become even more congested. There's also substantial impacts to rural roadways that would be expected to experience more demand from urban travel as well. All right, so for analysis purpose, for analysis purposes, we're looking at three distinct packages of strategies were evaluated. They emphasized different policy directions. So option A was focused on continuing the current policies and planned investments require. This is a transit maximizing the existing infrastructure. Option B built on that first one. That's kind of theme with the Westside multiple study where we're kind of building on these strategies incrementally. Option B was adding vehicle and capacity to existing major arterial roadways and other existing facilities such as highways. Option C looked at constructing new highway projects focused on serving longer distance travel to get around Washington county. So I'll breeze through this real quickly because again, we're here to talk about a single. I just want to provide some of the context. So the walking and Bison bicycle facilities produce this nice graphic that really show the network of bicycle pedestrian facilities increasing throughout Washington county. We're talking cross street, off street and crossing streets and bike amenities as well. Transit enhancements the study highlighted a range of transit service improvements. New services, increased service, more high capacity transit, more connections, including first mile and last mile connections. Major roadway improvements looked at expanding our network of existing hr rows. Some of these options have been carried forward to west side multiple modal study, while others have been paid into consideration over the last decade. Finally, in option C, there's some pretty substantial through weight improvements considered. So these are new highways and major widening. So this included west side if a northern connector, a southern connector. Most of these major highway changes are no longer being considered at the time. But we did carry that northern connector piece as an option into the west side multiple improvement strategy. So where did this land us? From a traffic congestion perspective, which was one of the key objectives of the study, it should have increased that even though with increased urbanization and advancing the adopted land use plans coupled with related demand management strategies, those are effective in a way in terms of reducing the share of co op CPF trips we have per capita. This means non automotive trips, faster than auto trips, for example, transitable future scenarios. But at the same time, people travel by car daily looks like 2 million trips a day, trips a day, despite all these investments and efforts, and many of the roadways before guest exceeding capacity by 2055. So the bottom line is that there is a need for investment here. Like we agree with that, but even with massive transit and roadway spending, we can expect a lot more traffic congestion. Now, jumping to the costs of the study picked one strategy over another, necessarily talked about the trade offs of the differential approach. In all of them, the costs are massive. So these values that you see on the screen are billions of dollars. These are from 2013. So eventually your math increased by something like 50%. So this is way beyond what current transportation funding resources and strategies provide. Notably, one of the, you know, kind of hop into topics lately, which is polling was not considered in any of these scenarios, but was identified as a way to create and sustain travel times that we actually. Way back in future study. So that's just to provide a little bit of context that this is the first pass through this. But what the Westside multifloodal study really does is it refines this high level analysis and, you know, add the prompting and support from our business community, really focus in address on the challenges that we have. And we do, I believe, have Councilor Gonzalez from metro council and Brennan could be on the office online making a few remarks before we get started with our presentation. Thank you. All right, excellent. I've been promoted. Can everyone hear me in the room? Yes, we can. Thank you for joining us, Councillor Gonzalez. Of course I thanks, Councilor Martin. And I can't exactly see everyone there. The screen's really small. All right. Now, because of the presentation, no problem. But, you know, I love visiting you at the city and attending work sessions, especially when I get the chance. Just was not able to make that happen today. I think you all know I have a metro councilor, Juan Carlos Gonzalez. Just in case we haven't met for anyone in the attendees, virtually or in person. I'm a metro counselor. I represent district four, which includes the wonderful city of Hillsboro, Beaverton, Cornelius, Forest Grove, areas in Aloha and Bethany. And I am joined here by Brendan Finn. I'll let Brendan introduce himself shortly. And I co chaired the Westside multimodal improvement study. So, Brendan, if you would like to introduce yourself. See you're here. I think I'd know how to unmute myself by now. Hello, everyone. Thank you, councilor Gonzalez, members of the city council, appreciate you having us here tonight. For the record, I'm Brendan Finn. I'm director of ODOT's urban mobility office here that you're having this work session today. This was truly a very collaborative process we went through. Very rich in data and analysis that we went through to look at a lot of the options that you're going to be seeing here tonight that staff are going to go through. But really proud of the work and the collaboration. This is how major transportation investments and how we look at our system and come up with options the right way from the bottom up. So joined by community based organizations, elected officials, obviously, representation from your council on this study. Really appreciate that. We'll stick around to answer questions. I have an affinity for this project. As it started, it came out of the governor's office. The last administration happened to be a part of that. So excited to see it continue to have its iterations and move forward. And I really want to applaud the leadership of your council, but also councilor Gonzalez, as he's been really helping lead this through. Leave it at that. We're happy to answer any questions as we move forward, and I think we'll turn it back to the group, or I'll turn it back to you, counselor. Yeah, great. Thanks, Brendan. I did want to share some really brief remarks, too, before I hand it off to Stephanie and Kate. Brendan covered a little bit of the history of how this came about, and obviously the 26th corridor, a vital economic lifeline and corridor for, for Washington county and especially for the very important industrial and employment lands in the city of Hillsborough. If you don't know, we had a great representation of elected, but also business leaders on this committee, via Washington County Chamber of Commerce, Genentech as well. And I feel really proud of. Of the recommendations that have come up here. You know, we are approaching kind of the final format of what that will look like. As you also know, Governor Kotek did announce a pause on regional tolling. And so there is a small shift that we need to make before we finalize recommendations. But I mean, in general, the phases of work that staff is going to review right now, I think really show a tremendous amount of regional collaboration, but also compromise on these big",

        "text": " of you for review or to the public for comment that not the case the important part is the our amendment process as Kellen has pointed out in 34527 350 if something that Idaho Power wants to do within that site boundary if it could result in a significant adverse impact that you have not previously considered hasn't been surveyed you haven't analyzed whether it complies with the standards they have to come back in for an amendment so I just want to make sure that that you're that secretary cornette and thanks for emphasis for the record Todd cornette so we're going to all add on to this um and so my add-on is getting back to the amendment determination request process so we haven't seen one of these in a while but if you recall and and council member I'm and possibly council member Devo and have never seen one so it's a way for somebody to say hey we're going to do this change and we don't believe an amendment is required they have the burden of submitting that and proving that to us we the department have the burden of evaluating that and then we have to bring it out to you so even if we if if you know in this case Idaho Power says hey we want to do this change we don't think it's going to trigger an amendment we've looked at those three CS they submit that to us we look at it we believe the same thing we have to bring that to council we issue our um Amendment determination request and at the next council meeting I have to bring it before you and if any one of you believe um or even if you just say we think this should be reviewed by Council you can then trigger the amendment process by yourselves so there is a lot of filter and a lot of evaluation so it isn't this cart blanch ability just to move out from micro siding Corridor into the site boundary there are numerous filters in terms of what the the thresholds are but also in terms of the steps in the review processes as well so I just want to make sure that you understood that and so go ahead tell you want to just showing that oh please third question councelor berer if an applicant requests the ADR is there opportunity for public input in that process even if no counil yeah we we provide a notice we put it on our website you know that's also brought up in front but it's not a there's no comment period there's no opportunity for the public to challenge that it's only for Council to either agree or disagree yeah based on staff review of what the applicant has presented correct got it thank you so it really could streamline things a bit in limited circumstances got it but somebody could comment on a public comment period on it like at the at the same at the same council meeting thanks yeah I mean certainly council could if you wanted to solicit public comment but it really is you know looking at those standards does it you know can you go from the micro sighting Corridor into the site boundary yes theoretically as long as it doesn't hit the three cits and so that's where that gets evaluated you know you could certainly seek public input but there's no yeah it's you know and I know a lot of these things are are not as you know Absolut lud um but it is essentially a threshold question of whether an amendment is required thank you awesome um okay so I'm moving on from expanded site boundary except again we're moving on we're going to talk about other topics and you do you know this it's kind of blendy in there with some of the some of the other topics so um all right so let's go now we're back to protected area right um and this is Susan Gear's um and so this is associated with right so now we're now we are now we are looking at um um um you know the the changes in RFA 2 again her comments are kind of blendy with what was previously approved and RFA too um but uh she argues that a wetland within the glass Hill hasn't been properly delineated and there so therefore impacts have not been evaluated um and this is one of those things even though the RFA 2 micro sighting area doesn't go into glass Hill when we talk about things like um you know impacts from construction or you know like like weeds or in proximity we would look at it so we reached out to DSL who confirmed um uh well one that the the study area for Wetlands is the area you know in this case would be within the micro sighting areas so that's like the study area only the only areas where something might be located need to be evaluated so DSL confirmed that the area was delineated in their most recent Wetland delineation um and that also based on the national Wetland inventory the portion of wind Meadows is is outside the study area so that's an example of of consultation that that we would do the maps here aren't exactly a one: one this is bigger than this over here but this is wind Meadow right and so that Meadow is this right here this is from DSL this is their Wetland stuff and over here these are the areas that were in that that's there's that transmission line route which is outside the protected area um so there was question raised about who so in council's new protected area or revised protected area standard you added in um notification of land managers and so now certificate holders and applicants provide the contact of who the Land Management agency is um and so Susan gear you know said you know the Blue Mountain Land Trust isn't the primary contact Joel Rice the land owner and she are the primary contact this is what like where this is one of those where we've contacted Blue Mountain Land trusty just kind of like the standard does say you know the Land Management you know agency um I don't know if it's intended to be the underlying land owner so this is one of those things that we're going to we're looking into um we haven't heard back from Blue Mountain Land Trust um however we do have an existing condition um it's a protected condition I don't know what um I'll ask I'll ask Sarah could you you know the the condition number oh it's right in front of me ha oh my gosh anyways okay well well I don't need to we'll stick stay here on my presentation um but this is a protected area condition and one of them it's kind of like coordinating with um because there's uh lad Marsh the previously approved facility associated with lad Marsh has a notification to uh odf and W and we suggest adding to that condition that just says you know coordinating you know like document that you attempted to coordinate with the Land Management agency or individuals so um and and that would be specific to you know the provisions in like the noxious weed plan which already requires coordination with land owners um there's landowners you know working with land owners is ongoing some land owners are working with um Idaho Power more than others this is all part of our tangential preconstruction work that we're working on um so you know attempts to coordinate with land owners is ongoing and this would be you know part of that so we're just kind of talking about these are the activities this is the schedule these are the activities that are happening these are the you know what our treatments or mitigation measures are and trying to get feedback from folks so our suggestion is to add this into that condition even though it would already be required in that noxious weed plan um so does council have any thoughts on that do you think that having it just live in the weed plan would be sufficient or do we want to add to a condition to be more responsive let me pull up that condition and it's it's okay if we don't you know if if we're like I don't you don't need to we can look at it um you know later too uh so this is the condition oh gosh okay there it goes uh coordinate right so coordinate it's it' be very similar to that sub a maybe even just adding coordinating construction activities well see this is in lad Marsh I'd probably add on a c but again it would just be you know we try to not we try to do we're trying to limit our conditions and not have duplicative conditions or conflicting conditions um you know in this in which Casa but it also if it makes it clear in one area that it is something that should happen maybe that would be helpful any you don't you just want me to move on we'll think about it where do you want to weigh in yeah I have a question I think you kind of touched on it and that's the definition of a land manager and there might be some just gray area there um does that affect your you know potential condition and the way you word that it would right because well and also I would suggest just saying you know document documenting attempts to um I try to be really mindful with conditions to not get somebody in a pickle if nobody picks up the phone on the other line right like so it's like you know at least being like or somebody's not going to work with you you know just tell show us that you tried right um or if somebody is working with you show us where we ended up um so you know if we never uh so we're going to look and see who the contact is so it's interesting because because Joel Rice is the underlying land owner um and Idaho Power in the noxious weed plan and for you know under other conditions like the agricultural mitigation plan which I don't know if he would I'm looking at Sarah she's gone um I don't because I don't know if he would fall underneath that one but there's there's landowner coordination specific with the landowner which he would be you know he would be part of that which is like already being done or attempting to be done um that's that's kind of I bring that up I feel like maybe there could be some added definition behind land manager and then that would help give direction to that area you say you have a landowner section you know there's a specific instructions for land owners and then here we are talking about a land managers because when I read land manager I think of an agency me too that's what I and I think that that was kind of the in intent of the change in the standard we could look this is what we're going to kind of look into but that's why and I think that that's why idah power said yeah Blue Mountain land trust and we were like well yeah like",

        "text": "? Yeah. The northern boundary of the site, which there is a vicinity map in your packet, is comprised of part of the Weibull Creek corridor and also the reservoir that is north of this site that is part of the Crescent Park Greenway. Through the annexation of this property and the application of our zoning, we will put into place the Crescent park greenway setback requirements and overlay requirements. So that sets up for future development to play a role in helping to set aside and improve that area in alignment with city plans. They are also conversations happening with the developer because similar to the last set of questions, this is purely just to bring the property into the city's authority and jurisdiction into applier zoning. This is not going to by itself result in any development or activity happening on the site that would be anticipated in subsequent land use applications and decisions that would happen after the annexation and zone change was approved, should it be approved. But we would be in conversations with development partners at that point in time in terms of partnerships or opportunities to definitely acquire the trail and deliver that. But how in the means by which we can do that, we'll explore opportunities. I hope that answers the question. Thank you. Any other questions? Very good. Do we have anybody from the public who would, who would wish to speak on this item? All right, seeing none, we will close the public comment. I'm sorry, close the public hearing. And so do I have a motion to adopt. Order number 15. So moved. Pace. Second Martin. And is there any discussion prior to calling for roll call? I will acknowledge Councilor Alcare is excused from the remainder of the meeting and will not be called upon to vote. So roll call, please. Councilor Sinclaire? Councillor Pace? Aye. Councilor van Bevern? Aye. Councilor Martin? Aye. Thank you. Order number 15 is adopted by a vote of four ayes and no nays. Next, we will move on to annexation. Zero zero, 624. Farm boys, this is an annexation. And then also zone change. Zero, zero, 624. So I'll open the public hearing on these two items and we will hear, well, what a surprise. Mister Diaz, thank you for joining us tonight. And so, good evening, mayor and counsel for the record, Dan Dias, economic and community development director, having mentioned how great it is to see this evening. So, the item before you on the agenda is an annexation zone change. I'm going to ask Mister Jackson to spool up the video related to the required readings of the Oregon Revised statute language, and then I'll talk about the applicable approval criteria and give the oral staff report. All public testimony and evidence submitted must refer to applicable approval criteria which are listed in the staff report or other land use regulations or criteria you believe may apply to the decision. Any testimony or written evidence needs to be specific and detailed so the city can understand and respond to each criterion or issue discussed in the testimony. Failure to raise an issue before the record closes prevents an appeal to the Land use Board of appeals based on that issue. Failure by the applicant to raise an issue before the record closes prevents inaction for damages in circuit court based on that issue. All testimony and evidence that addresses the approval criteria will be responded to prior to the closing of the record. So, for clarity's sake, the applicable approval criteria associated with the annexation is Metro code 3.09 and the Hillsborough Community Development Code section 12.80.010, point e, and the applicable approval criteria for the zone change is the Hillsborough Community Development Code section 12.80.168, point e. So the item before you at this moment, this evening is a yemenite. The applicant initiated and requested annexation application to bring approximately 116.8 acres into the city limits of Hillsborough, paired with a city initiated zone change application to apply city zoning of industrial sanctuary to that property that's in alignment with the industrial comprehensive plan designation. This site is also within the Jackson East south sub area located further south from the item you just recently considered, and there's a staff report attached for both the annexation and a separate one for the zone change with the applicable decision documents, related findings, and the associated tax maps associated with these properties. I am happy to answer any questions you have on this item now or after you take testimony, and I will note that on this item, no testimony has been received prior to this presentation this evening. Thank you. Any questions or comments? All right, thank you. So do we have anybody who wishes to speak on this item, on this during the public hearing? All right, saying none. The public hearing is now closed. And do I have a motion and a second to adopt order number 16? So moved. Pace. Second. Martin, any discussion? Hey, we have a roll call. Councillor Van Brember? Aye. Councillor Sinclair? Aye. Councilor pace? Aye. Councilor Martin? Aye. Thank you. Order number 16 is adopted by a vote of four ayes and zero nays. We'll move on to public hearing for annexation zero zero 424, witch Hazel Village south and agenda item 5.8, zone change zero zero 724, and we will open the public hearing on these two items, and I would invite Dan Diaz to come and give us a presentation. Good evening, mayor and city council. Thanks for having me. You have before you this evening a public hearing request and decisions for an annexation and zone change related to properties in Witch Hazel Village south. Before I give my oral staff report, I'll ask Mister Jackson to pull up our Oregon revised statute video, and then I'll mention the applicable criteria and get into the staff report. Following that, all public testimony and evidence submitted must refer to applicable approval criteria which are listed in the staff report or other land use regulations or criteria you believe may apply to the decision. Any testimony or written evidence needs to be specific and detailed so the city can understand and respond to each criterion or issue discussed in the testimony. Failure to raise an issue before the record closes prevents an appeal to the land use Board of appeals faced on that issue. Failure by the applicant to raise an issue before the record closes prevents inaction for damages in circuit court based on that issue. All testimony and evidence that addresses the approval criteria will be responded to prior to the closing of the record. Can you say these without looking? Oh, yes, but for consistency sake. The applicable approval criteria for the annexation is Metro code chapter 3.09 in the Hillsboro Community Development Code section 12.80.010 point ethereum and the applicable approval criteria for the zone change can be found in Hillsboro Community Development Code 12.80.168, point e. So this is a applicant initiated annexation to bring approximately 127.27 acres into the city in the witch Hazel village south area. It's not all of, but it's a large majority of the witch Hazel village south area that you all recently approved the comprehensive planning designation for to add housing to our city. This will go a long way in meeting some of the identified need. Also in our housing needs analysis, that annexation application is paired with a city initiated zone change recommending the application of three residential zones, the r six residential zone, which is a lower density, medium to lower density zone with detached residential units primarily and some attached, the Mr. One and the Mr. Two, which are both multi dwelling zones. Those zones are initiated and suggested in large part because they comply with the comprehensive plan designations that you all adopted and applied to the witch days of low south area and would be the most appropriate implementing zones given those different densities and a blended residential community to be planned out and ultimately developed subsequent to this annexation. Zone change that area. To this point. No testimony has been received on either the annexation or the zone change up to this point this evening. And that concludes the staff report. I'd be happy to answer any questions you have now or after you take public testimony. Any questions for Mister Diaz? All right, thank you. Registration deadline for virtual comments is come and gone. Do we have anybody who wishes to give public testimony during this hearing? Seeing none, the public hearing is now closed. Do I have a motion and a second to adopt order number 17? So moved. Pace? Second Martin. Thank you. Any discussion? May we have a roll call? Councillor Pace? Aye. Councillor Sinclair? Aye. Councillor van Bevern? Aye. Councillor Martin? Aye. Thank you. Order number 17 is adopted by a vote of four ayes and zeros mays. Next we will open the public hearing on item 5.9. Is Mister DS in the house? So we'll open the public hearing on item 5.9. And do we have anybody who would like to speak to this in the audience? All right. Seeing none, the public hearing is closed. Move on to ordinances in the first reading. Annexation 00124. Glee PDX, LLC. Consider adopting an ordinance for annexation of two lots, approximately 9.74 acres in size and adjacent right of way into the city limits of Hillsboro. Ordinance number 6476 is available to have a motion to approve the first reading of ordinance number 6476. So moved. Paste. Second Martin. Thank you. Is there any discussion, mayor? Just a heads up. I think Councilor O'Ker might be hopping on shortly as well. I don't know if Aubrey can check to see if she's on or nothing",

        "text": " to go through uh before we can start actually construction um however uh both the project in San Francisco and the projects that we constructed uh between New York and New Jersey took less time than this so uh with with you know proper review and taking into consideration public comment agency comment uh everything that goes into that uh we feel we can meet this schedule and have the cable online by the end of 2028 or um at worst midpoint of 2029 the key point of that date of course is the deadline of 2030 by which the states should meet 80 percent of their decarbonization goals so that is uh very much part of a driver uh of this of this schedule uh next slide please just to sort of recap some of the key the whole point is to help the States achieve their clean energy goals we don't believe that this is the only solution in terms of transmission or any other kind of technology to meet those clean energy goals but given that the utilities are projecting thousands of megawatt of extra additional capacity needed by 2030. that ours at 1100 megawatts will make a sizable dent in uh in getting toward those goals as Ernie explained uh we consider this and we have proven this to be a low impact technology um when we say designed we're at the preliminary stages so this is nowhere near the final design but the point is that uh by taking into consideration all the Environmental and Cultural resource aspects of the environment that we'll be in uh the cable route can be adjusted to avoid or minimize impacts to those resources and that very much includes uh in the river and the impacts to the uh to the life there in terms of visual impact there is none uh in terms of resiliency for the grid and uh avoiding the inherent risks of other forms of transmission to severe weather or Wildfire or that kind of thing that we consider to be an advantage of of this operation we will be providing uh three years worth of uh significant construction jobs and we have already signed a letter of understanding with the Building Trades councils uh uh in the area that covers both uh the Western end and the Eastern end of the of the uh route that uh union labor will be employed and further that we will be assisting in their efforts uh to uh provide apprenticeships and training uh not only for this project but also for future renewable energy projects that will be made feasible because of new cost frequently get that uh the estimated costs in today's dollars is around 1.5 billion we say no public investment here what we mean by that is that we're not looking for state tax breaks or state taxpayer dollars to go toward this uh the development we're an independent transmission developer which means that we have attracted the private capital to move this project forward and that the risk involved in Development and Construction is borne by us as a developer uh not by the rate payers or the when the project works and works right and the switch goes on and it's complete you know that's the only point where we're relying on taxpayer or rate payer funds I I should rephrase that we are not uh relying on that clearly any major infrastructure uh the cost of that will be borne by the rate payers eventually just like any other transmission but we're not asking for that we are just as a point of uh in conjunction with uh the community renewable energy Association out in The Dalles uh seeking a federal department of energy grant that would help uh alleviate the cost burden eventually uh that application uh is going in shortly but that will be a a long process to get to get a review and hopefully approval of that by the federal government and so we're not depending on that to go forward uh with the project if we get it it will clearly be a financial benefit uh for this region we would expect that there will be tax benefits to the local jurisdictions and so that's that's another potential benefit of the project next slide uh as the staff has pointed out this project that's going to be subject to uh very close and very lengthy reviews uh by the public and by the agencies we're familiar with that process from our other two projects uh as we said before the project will respect and be responsive to tribal Nation concerns third point there I bring up only because it's frequently Asked will there be a Electric magnetic uh field uh issue in the river um and Ernie can explain that in Q a if it comes up but the the answer is that uh the impact is minimal to non-existent uh but more importantly there's probably 50 studies of uh and its potential impact on marine uh we're more than happy and I think we have a poster that actually gives you an opportunity to see an article that kind of reviews these studies and to go to the studies themselves if you're interested our own experience is that not only no EMF impacts but no negative environmental impacts uh post-construction and in operation a a a very uh important way to minimize impacts is to observe what's called work so that um the installation of the cable would take place we think this hasn't been imposed by the agency but typically uh the work can only take place during cold weather months uh when there's no uh interference with spawning or migration so we fully expect to have those work um and and to observe them very next slide the major permits we're working with the U.S Army Corps of Engineers who we expect to be the late the lead agency in terms of the National Environmental Protection act the NEPA uh that NEPA process includes the mandated consultation between the US government and the tribal governments excuse me we will need citing approvals from both Oregon fsec and there's a Washington f-sec that slightly different uh uh acronym there uh but in in is essentially similar so we will need approvals from both States uh to the extent that uh municipalities Counties have jurisdiction uh the point of asking fsec to uh coordinate those reviews is simply uh to have a coordinated review it does not take away the input that the municipalities will um we will need interconnection agreements with both the BPA and with Portland General because those are the facilities of the substations where we will be entered interconnecting uh this as Todd pointed out is the beginning of our permit application process although there have been a number of studies at a desktop level primarily to indicate as well as visual surveys and to some extent in River surveys to try to establish a route that we believe is both permittable and constructable and we'll point out that uh we have this kind of Permitting regime already in uh multi-state jurisdictions and the U.S Army Corps of Engineers for our existing projects on the East Coast next slide this is just a list of similar projects that have been built in various places around the world you'll see that even though a hundred miles is a is a lengthy uh distance it's not even close to the of these kinds of projects that have been installed in various places you'll note that and these are recent installations of high voltage DC and two of those the ones that are starred and bolded because we're actually quite proud of them are Hudson and Neptune between New Jersey and New York next slide to talk about those just a bit Neptune was completed in 2007 so it's been running for just I think about a month shy of 16 years linking uh the uh power grid of New Jersey with the power grid in Long Island uh that project provides about 25 percent of all the electricity used on Long Island it runs 24 7. The Hudson Project was completed in 2013 that also links the grids between New Jersey and in this case it goes right into Central Manhattan that's about seven miles underwater and again it's been running now for pretty close to 10 years and as I said before without any uh environmental impact next slide some of these folks you may already have seen but we do have members of of the team here to answer questions and and to talk to you one-on-one the guy with the hat is sitting next to me if you didn't recognize him uh and then next slide having done this before uh we're convinced that the only way to get a project like this built and I should mention that both of the Neptune the Neptune and the Hudson projects were built on time and on one of the primary reasons we achieved that is by taking concerns and issues seriously not trying to cut Corners to engage with the public engage with the agencies and in this case the tribal Nations on a respectful basis to be responsive to questions and inquiry and answer them as quickly as we can and finally to be partners we alluded to the letter of understanding with the uh with the Unions that's already in place and our commitment to working with them to help apprenticeship and training and Community benefits programs that can you know be a long lasting part of this area and the area of the Dalles and in between uh to help continue the effort to bring clean energy to this and make us a good neighbor in the region so thank you all right thank you um so at this point I'm going to ask folks who want to ask a question or provider comments and start making your way up towards the microphone in the um feel free to queue up a few at a time um if there gets to be a big line feel free to stay seated uh we will we're not going anywhere until everybody that wants to provide a comment has had the opportunity to do so um I do want to remind everyone that we are recording this webinar tonight and we will be posting and reporting to our website after we're done so if you want to go back and listen to anything that we've said tonight or if you want to hear last night's presentation or the comments that were given there um you'll be able to find that on our website by Friday all right great and then um as we're kind of getting ready I did just want to point out that uh the department's website has a lot of helpful resources uh to help you learn more about the citing process um there's also uh more information about this project posted on the project page um as you can see on the slide here um there is a public guide to citing energy facilities uh to help understand the different phases and the different opportunities for public participation um there's some more General overview sheets a lot of those are available on the tables outside as well if you'd like to mix them up and we do have",

thank you we have no one on the phone and so again I'll ask if anyone in the public wishes to speak on anything that's not closed for comment including the Boardman the Hemingway Amendment one draft proposed order to our knowledge we have no one who is presented any uh comment cards so we're going to take a last call just to make sure no one is left out okay we are going to close the public comment period at 6 14. um I'm just going to ask council members so um if we may let's take a five minute break before we move to our next agenda item if everyone is okay with that those join in remotely we will take five or and we are ready to resume our the next agenda item is for the obsidian solar center amendment number one and this will include an information portion provided by senior citing analyst Kathleen Sloan who will provide a brief overview of the agenda item and the amendment request and a public Hearing in which I will serve as the presiding officer Ms Sloan please proceed with the information portion of the agenda item thank you chair Grail good evening Council and members of the public who have come to our meeting thank you very much for being here so next slide Nancy so we're here to talk about the request for Amendment one for the obsidian solar center site certificate I'm going to go through the next few slides just to give a background on the amendment request and our process and the public participation piece in and then we will switch back over to chair Grail who is the presiding officer for the hearing and during the hearing that's when we're going to take public comment public testimony um if anybody here in the room wants to make a public comment there are yellow comment cards over there on the table we ask that you fill one out so that we know how to contact you and add you to our list and have your name and you can also put them in writing so next slide was it Frozen oh no uh while we're waiting for that for the record Todd cornyn I'll fill a little bit of time so we do have the computer up and running in the back of the room so it has a map on it so if anybody has any questions about the location of the application or the uh the approved facility or the amendment we have a map that we can zoom around zoom in um the certificate holder also brought a map um so on the other table so if anybody's interested in looking at those details uh you certainly can thank you Gwinnett uh can we go back one more slide yes okay so this slide I just really wanted to give you a quick overview of the mean meaning for this agenda item so as I said I'm going to provide a brief go it will go back to chair grail for the public hearing overview and then open up for the public hearing piece members of the public will be provided the opportunity to comment on the draft proposed order or the request for Amendment one or both Council will also have the opportunity to make comments about any concerns they have and the certificate holder who is also here in the room we have representatives from obsidian renewable we'll also be provided opportunity to respond to comments or provide additional comment of Their Own next slide so just very briefly I just want to give the public piece of the energy facility Council or what we call fsec review process it's a Consolidated review we have a seven member body of the f-sec council their governor appointed Senate confirmed they represent diverse array of geographies and backgrounds and they are the decision-making body for a site certificate so members of accounts this is part of a council meeting and some of our members are here with us in person and other ones are on the phone while citing division staff which is me I work for the Oregon Department of we make recommendations to our Council but council is the uh decision-making body and I think that's the important thing to emphasize next slide so this graphic shows our citing process for an amendment request the certificate holder filed a preliminary request for Amendment and we issued a public notice and those things back in April and those things were posted on the internet on the project web page and that's the preliminary request for Amendment it's the certificate holders basically documentation that they submit to us saying we would like to come in for an amendment this is what we're asking for and then it's up to us as the department to review that information determine whether or not it's complete what type of review process it needs to follow we go through completeness and then we will basically determine a request for Amendment complete and a complete RFA will be filed so we are in a type A amendment process and the one key distinction in that is that there is a public hearing requirement and that's why we're here in your community today to have that public hearing as part of the amendment so after we request for additional information and review of the original preliminary Amendment request we determined that that to be complete and requested that the applicant submit a complete RFA request for Amendment um this is their first amendment request on the site certificate at the end at on July 28th and they said completed all their documentation resubmitted it to us and we deemed it complete we also issued the draft proposed order which is the next step as we take all the application after complete and the department puts it through our review process and we issue a draft proposed order and that is also noticed we had a public notice that went out it was mailed to adjacent landowners and property owners and posted on our website and sent out through our electronic noticing system and we prepared this draft proposed order and that is what we are here today on is having the public hearing about the complete request for Amendment and the draft proposed order that the department prepared that public comment period opened on August 1st and it will close at the end of this meeting tonight and you have opportunities as members of the public to submit comments through various can be through the internet can be through email it's all in the public notice you can do it in a comment card you can write it down on a piece of paper and hand it to me before the end of this meeting you can also just make it as an oral statement when we get to the oral testimony piece and it all becomes part of that that process we then issue we take all that and we take what comes out of the public comment period so the hearing tonight comments that we get from Council and we prepare as Todd had explained a draft of a proposed order and we're we again that's the Department's document and then we will bring it back to council for review um and during when we issue the proposed order we also issue a notice of an opportunity to participate in a contested case and it's built into our process but I one thing that I want to stress is that only the persons that have raised a relevant issue in the comment period the public comment period on this draft proposed order can participate in a contested case so you feel that it's important it's important that those comments get made they get made within this comment period they're put on the record and that they relate to our standards because we are a standards-based review process that is the scope of our review Once all of those things happen at the end the very last step is the final order in the decision on a site certificate and that decision is entirely in the hands of council Council determines whether they will approve the site certificate whether they will adopt the final order they might want more changes so there's there's a process in which it's fairly iterative and the intent is that it builds in the public participation and the input that we get from reviewing agencies and the public as we proceed in our review next slide so I'm going to jump into the facility as approved and also the amendment the site certificate was approved by Council on February 25th of 2022 so this isn't approved but not yet constructed the certificate holder is Obsidian solar Center LLC which is a subsidiary of apparent company known as obsidian Renewables LLC as approved it's a 400 megawatt capacity solar facility with related and supporting facilities including transmission line and a 50 megawatt battery storage in a site boundary that was approved to be 3921 Acres located about eight miles Northwest of here and it is within Lake County and again this is the first amendment request so I know that map is not all that easy to see but to the right of that slide in the Orange is the solar array then there's a orange line that goes to the left and that would be the transmission line as approved there's a",

wall it's four minutes for in favor or in opposition to the all right Erica all right good evening chair good evening commissioner so tonight before you we have the Sherwood West concept plan your role tonight is to make a recommendation to City Council on the plan you are not making a recommendation on a proposed ugb expansion agenda that will be a city council decision at a later date Eric do you want to ask if you can put people in and they will be having that conversation later this summer so with that I'm going to kind of go over you know or touch on each of the chapters within the plan itself those chapters are listed on this slide and so with that I want to touch on what the role of a concept plan is so a concept plan is the required first step to amending the urban growth boundary and it's really a long-range planning tool to help guide decisions about future growth this plan is not a regulatory document once land is brought into the ugb we will do further refinement and that's when we get into the nitty-gritty details of the regulatory framework of Sherwood West and that would include future zoning and updates to any Master so introduction a little background in history about Sherwood West so Sherwood West is the urban Reserve area and it's the area planned for future growth it's Urban Reserve area 5B in the Metro region it's comprised of a little bit over 1200 Acres there's about 126 Property Owners or sorry 110 properties our property owners 126 properties and the average property size is about almost close to 10 acres in size in 2016 um the Planning Commission and city council accepted a preliminary concept plan and so this re-look this relook process looked at that 2016 plan and we wanted to take this Fresh Fresh Approach",

        "text": ". This is either agriculture or some form of residential. This dark blue is considered industrial by the Marion county property appraisers. And then the only commercial contiguous to this parcel is a small landlocked portion that you'll see to the south of the subject site, and that is vacant. So the special use that was approved, you'll see we have the resolution here. And then there was a note that was placed on here that was for screening. So screening was going to be a big portion of what they were looking for with the special use permit and making sure that the screening of activities in any of the inventory that they had on site was going to be screened from the residential uses in the area. So we did do a site visit on the property on the 15 December, and then these were some of the photos that were provided. So you'll see there are some, there's an inventory of some items here. Those are not being screened or buffered from any of the surrounding properties. This is looking directly to the northern property. There is no opaque fencing as was to be provided per the resolution for the special use permits. There is a carport structure that staff did look into to see if there were any building permits issued. We did not see a building permit for this particular carport structure. And then this was proposed to be a staging area for some of their items that were being developed here, and it's being used for employee parking going on. We'll see a number of other photos. These are looking to the south and east. What we're seeing is that there is, again, no opaque fencing as was to be provided by the conditions set in place by the special use permit. There was also supposed to be, I believe, no work on vehicles, and there is some kind of wrecked vehicle at the back of the property. So saying all of that, those were the things that were found with the site visit that happened on the 15th, going into the property and verifying if any of the conditions of the special use were being methadone prior to coming here. The concept plan that is being proposed, so existing, there is a building on the property, and then there is a security residence, which is in that northeast corner of the property. What is being proposed? They're proposing three new buildings with a total of 60,000. Then they are also proposing outside storage, which comes to roughly 127,000. You'll see that these marked areas in white, those are all of the areas that are being proposed for outside storage, with some of them abutting property lines, and then the road as well. And then these are just some site photos from the property looking out at the surrounding area. So you can see this is directly across their driveway. This is a home. This is looking north. These are all homes along the road here. This is looking at the property itself from the road and looking northward. Again, no opaque fencing as required. So with these issues, and then the fact, again, that this is such a heavy industrial type use taking place in what is a residential area, staff does believe that this would adversely affect public interest. It is inconsistent with a comprehensive plan and it is not compatible with the surrounding uses in the area. Due to the density and intensity of the use relative to those residential areas listed here, are going to be all of the comprehensive plan policies of concern and the policies that are not being met by this application, as well as the land development code policies of concern, you again have your recommendations to deny, approve or table this application. Staff is recommending denial of this application. If you were to go against staff recommendation and approve, we have provided some conditions for you as far as setbacks, buffering, and then for some structures distances away from property lines, neighboring residential uses. So those are also provided for you. If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them. I do, yes. First of all, is there a code case on this? Because it sounded like you went out there to the property and found that there was no permit for that instruction. Is there any code case going on? There's none at this particular time, not yet. The road that they're proposing the commercial on, do we have a picture of that road? Is there mainly residential that's on that road? We do. It's northeast Jacksonville. And I think this gives you a pretty good indication of it. So this is looking southbound and then this is looking northbound on there. And it is all residential along that side? The whole side is residential? It is correct. So if they were to. If this were to be approved, the commercials, some of these homes would be looking right at them? Yes. Actually, this home is directly across from their driveway, coming in and out of what would be a commercial use? You're correct. Anyone else has got any questions at this time? I have, yes. Did you say earlier on that this property is actually zoned industrial? No, the use is industrial. The property itself is not industrial. And that was that two year special? It was, yes. That was to be a two year maximum for that special use permit. And then it was to be residential. Did you see that? Did you see any actual fabrication and painting going on when you visited? I definitely saw metalworking and products that were being produced. As far as painting, I did not see anyone painting. But that should be taking place inside the building. So hopefully that's why. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. The applicant here, or is this Mister Tillman? Yes, sir. Good afternoon. David Tillman. Tillman associates engineering. 1720 Southeast 16th Avenue, building 100, Ocala, Florida. Can I touch this? I know the last one you weren't allowed to touch. This one's kind of low. Sorry, I don't know. You know, same rules. No touch, you don't need. We were hoping for a mask. Don't wear high heels next time. So if you all remember, for decades, I believe this used to be the triam rv. So people that were living in that house looked at a commercial activity across the street for many, many years. They purchased the house with being commercial. This has been commercial land use. We did come in and do a pud to modify it. With Armstrong looking to take it over to townhomes. There was opposition in the room night of us going to a multifamily product. If you look in your package, you've got letters from the neighbors supporting this. This is a current activity. Yes, there is manufacturing going on there right now. Not right this minute. But they were working there today. They know what's happening. They know what the activity is. And this is what they want. So the neighbors have written letters that they want this to come to this facility. Stay here. It's a special use permit. What a best case scenario. They get to test it, see what it's like as a neighbor and ask for it to stay instead of the other proposed use that is coming and is approved right now. So you're looking at a case of really the neighbors saying, hey, this is what we want, and we see what it is. So I can't imagine not approving something where the neighbors are saying, hey, we want this. This is the activity we want to occur here. We don't want the town homes to come. So it's a pretty suitable request, I think, for us to make. And the special use permit being in place was great because they got to see what it was prior to us coming and asking for this. That wasn't the intent. The intent truly was when we came in the first place, or we would have just gone straight from triam rv to this. But they were doing this interim. They've struck a deal with the owner now that both parties are happy with, and so they would like to stay here and not have to relocate. Hey, can you address the permit? The building that apparently does not have a permit to be there or so the gentleman that. The gentleman that was in charge of implementing the criteria of the special use permit of and the one that purchased this building no longer is with them. So they were made aware today that, or not today, but a few weeks back that, hey, you guys have got to move forward with implementing your special use permit. They didn't realize they hadn't done it in the manner that they were supposed to, so they will be moving forward with that, I think in the conditions. There are some conditions here that we think are above and beyond what we think are reasonable that we would like to address as well. But the wrecked vehicle that's on site belongs to the gentleman that is living in the security house. There are no pictures of somebody working on it. It's just a wrecked vehicle that's parked there because it's his personal vehicle. And I don't know if he's planning on taking it to get it repaired somewhere else or if he's planning on just scrapping it and selling it as it is. And one other question. I guess whenever that special use was approved, there was supposed to be some screening. Yes, sir. And we don't have the screening. That's correct. It is not in place. But without it even in place, which part of the pud requirements is for that to be put in place as well? With that in place, the neighbors still want this use adjacent to. I understand that. I just didn't like. What do your clients feel about. Do they object to the screening? You said there was some conditions, so we proposed certain buffers here. Staff has proposed something different and some of the criteria in there were some of the things that I just. I can",

        "text": " much as i have a question i'm wondering if you have any idea or if you can offer any information as to a when we might expect the first grant opportunity to open and be the quantity of funds that might be during that first that first round of grants and i'm happy listen to your comments muted again i think rob or andy and would one of you like to feel that question yeah i'm happy to answer that question and wendy just so you know you were you're breaking up again um if we need to we can um pass the the mc duties off to christie or i maybe okay um if that needs to happen but our intention is to open up the opportunity announcements this march and again we'll have four opportunity for the two categories of planning and two categories of construction we don't have a specific budget allocation established for this opportunity announcement yet and one thing we need to do is learn from this first process to see what the um what the demand looks like but the way that the funding works for this program it's a total of 50 million dollars but we get it in two different batches for two biennium so right now we have approximately 25 million dollars to get us through the next two years and which at which time it'll be refunded and so we will continue to be offering funds through the next two but with the idea that we want to get funds out the door as quickly as because we have a lot of administrative responsibilities for the program all the way through the final payment of grants and so we need to try to get that wrapped up within the the four years of the program we also had a question in the chat and it's one that i think i can handle it's from janae um she's wondering why nonprofits aren't eligible only government entities and this was a decision that was made by legislators or the ones who passed the bill of course but to um really help to foster partnerships between local governments tribes special districts irrigation districts and their communities so there's a lot built into the process we anticipate in the bill itself to encourage those sorts of partnerships between community organizations and the local governments um the other uh the other reason is that with local governments and irrigation districts and sort of other public entities it limits the number of possible applicants so there's also the need to keep admin costs low and so we felt i think that decision makers felt like this was a way to keep the program um which we think is one that you know could someday continue but to sort of pilot it and see how it goes with this group and then we could talk about um going out to perhaps in the future the private sector or non-profit so just know that that i think is why they limited the number of possible applicants for this new program thanks christy that was really helpful i think at least um please let us know if you still have questions or if there are other related questions um is there anyone else who is interested in offering a comment it looks like ray sanchez fescuador has his hand raised ray you're on sanchez pescado from solaris rogue in southern oregon and i had a question about your six-month clock as i was reading in the in the document for um essentially ensuring that the project is either either planned or developed and i was thinking about as i'm sure you're familiar the oregon community solar program has been going on started in 2020 many of the planning and development timelines for that particular program is are going on two years and we only have about 10 of the projects completed that have applied so i'm trying to understand your rationale for thinking about six months being sufficient for an entity to fully plan or fully develop a project within six months given the current environment in the iou territory thanks ray is that a question for rob i'm i'm happy to field it and i think that um wendy and james are probably a little more familiar with the precise rule language but i think there may be um just a a misunderstanding for the for the timelines for the construction grants we have a i believe it's a three-year development timeline and for the planning grants we have a one-year development timeline so it may be that the six months was related to our process for making the um you know from opportunity announcements to the grant awards or something like that but starting from the time that the the successful applicant gets that performance agreement that will start a three-year clock with the possibility of an extension for construction projects and a one-year with a possibility of extension for planning projects did i get that right wendy or james um i'm going to have to go back and double check if james is able to look at pull up the rules and and look at the detailed language right now but um we appreciate the comment certainly ray and we will we will take a close look at the rules and all of those time frames again i don't see other hands raised or anyone else in the chat with any questions or comments at this point angela crowley cook just raised her hand so angela you're on angela cook executive director of the cf i would love to hear the answer to that question as well because we had some confusion about the timing when reading this as well and it did look like it was six months for a plan to grant and only one year for a development grant so would be great to have some clarity on that particular issue oh yeah let's see i i just found it looks like um on page 10 little a big b says will be completed within six months of execution of the performance uh i just um i just looked in the bill and that is the language right out of the bill for planning grants it's six months not a and i'm reading down the bill i think it might be one year for construction grants but also with a provision to extend and we had a lot of discussion with the advisory committee about um you know serious issues with um projects getting completed on time in the current environment of you know delays and materials and that sort of thing so we did go straight with the with the language in the bill and i see for construction grants it says we'll begin construction within 12 months of the performance agreement and be completed within 36 months so that's the language out of the bill for the construction projects let's see so three years and six months respectively for construction and planning okay so just the only one thing i would add to that is that the build did require odo include language in the rules around uh plus uh i think of the language in the bill was something about good cause for an extension so include some rules um possibilities for extension so um i would encourage you to maybe read those deadlines closely and and parts around extension of of deadlines and see if you think there's anything uh that you would related to that especially those of you who who work closely with developing projects so we we appreciate your close reading of the rules and we can go back and make sure that our the rules as drafted match the intent and what's in the bill since there's different readings happening um one thing that i'll flag to is um in the conversations about the bill itself it was actually the department of energy that actually first raised concerns about what we thought were shorter timelines so we understand the concern and we want to make sure that we do our best to to honor it so thanks for flagging that we we know we know that's an issue yeah thank you did ray and angela it looks like you're i'm not sure if we're able to lower your hands maybe send a chat if you have additional um comments or please let us know i think gray's back again because his hand went down forever again okay yeah great oh angela has more comments too thank yeah sorry sorry um yeah i think that you guys have a great source of data if you take a look at what has happened over the last two years with the oregon community solar program uh in iu territories you can have an exact determination there are 34 projects going on currently in that program and most of them as i said are still in the planning phase and so for a variety of reasons you know negotiations with and all sorts of things and so perhaps reaching out to the folks who run the oregon community solar program um at might be useful for you guys to get some data and see how long it actually takes these projects to get through the process of planning that's a great idea thank you yeah i have a bunch of comments in addition to that one um so just to first of all to add on to what ray was saying yes planning often takes well i would say usually takes years for projects that are um on the larger side like a a larger community solar project or a utility scale project and so that is a is a pretty tight in terms of let's see on number 14 on page five has a a good cause section for extending a timeline and i wonder if we can think about other wording instead of good cause because sometimes you need an extension and it's it's not due to completely unforeseeable circumstances but something that you reasonably didn't so for example most often delays are caused by the study process that utilities go through and one can reasonably expect that those studies would be completed on a certain timeline and then they might not be completed by then and so i'm wondering if we can change good to something like reasonable instead the term reasonable is defined um and something that the puc uses um different parts of their regulations and it needs quote an event or circumstance that the grantee at the time the deadline is established could not have reasonably anticipated and was not reasonably within reasonable control of the grantee so that makes it a little more flexible what that extension could be for um the way it reads now kind of sounds i think we're all in like a coveted mindset that this would be like if the governor would shut down this data or something but there are other um i think better ways to to allow folks to get an extension and then the i mean the thing with the the planning grants like ray said that's six months is really short and realize that's in the statute and there's not a lot we can do about that what that means though is that really the only entities that can probably take advantage of that planning grant are projects that have already started the planning process and um so then when it gets to the part about",

        "text": " projects um the executive board was formed in June Otto holds a seat on the board uh our agency director Janine Benner and uh Janine is also the vice chair of the so the board started meeting uh in July and so the meetings thus far have been focused on not only the structure of the association in terms of Anti-Trust statements and you know incorporation and officers but also you know further development of concept ideas for the Hub uh drafting grading project grading criteria uh getting an m o contractor secured and um and looking to open up a second uh so Jessica I feel like I've seen some questions in the chat are these um clarifying questions that we should pause for now we do have one additional question excuse me from Jed and he asks um if we could describe our interaction with Washington a little bit um we're I'm happy to so as as the uh has the bill in the Washington legislature that ended up you know getting the funding for the association and as the association kind of began to coalesce as an idea and then as an incorporated organization Oregon had been involved in these conversations with Washington um as I mentioned since last year and there was a sense that even though Regional wasn't defined in the infrastructure act uh we really got a sense that there would be a lot of strength for Washington and Oregon to team up on this opportunity uh we also had conversations with uh some other states in the northwest uh to you know see what the interest was and kind of what this what this group might look like and we certainly hurt interest from some other states uh though they were a little bit farther behind in their hydrogen journey and so they uh you know weren't sure that they were really ready to sign on um to a hub concept so it's my understanding at this point is it's Washington and Oregon um Washington is already more organized than Oregon in terms of its hydrogen in terms of is hydrogen support uh it you know it's it's already you know there's already work there in terms of organizing the stakeholders a lot of the hydrogen stakeholders in Washington know each other have kind of sort of already already forming those ideas of connections between their various projects which in many ways was the impetus for this convening of Oregon stakeholders was for us to really try to reach that level of organization so the interaction with Washington has very um you know congenial uh very welcoming uh I think though that there's definitely because Washington had you know has put up the two million dollars to fund the application process because the association was incorporated in Washington and because Washington is a little bit ahead of Oregon in some um with hydrogen um it's definitely shaking out to be um you know more Washington focused than and Rebecca I have a question from Martina and she asks will uh the Pacific Northwest hydrogen Coalition have public meetings and can you share more about the role of the advisory core committee for that I have slides on the advisory committee so I'll get to that I'm not sure what the intention is with respect to public meetings or not so I think when we get to the discussion that's something that we can bring up as well in terms of what our what are the questions that Odo can take to the executive board on behalf of all of you and so certainly what the what their plan is for public interaction I agree should certainly be part of that and that's it that I have for questions or hands raised right now um some of the things that um oh another question just popped up I just wanted to flag that I put the notice of intent into the meeting chat so I'll go look at it you can see that thank you so much Jessica absolutely uh Kelly just asked give him what you just said about Oregon Washington relationship is it possible the Pacific Northwest application would not include I don't um that's a great question and that's certainly something that we can get into more during the discussion um you know if there are other concerns around that I don't think that's going to be the case um you know could the application be heavily skewed towards Washington I think that that's absolutely a um which again was part of the impetus of this convening uh but you know Odo has been very active in terms of you know trying to make sure that there's Oregon um at the association and we've certainly you know haven't heard any you know any any sense of exclusion of Oregon um and frankly from a strategic standpoint I don't think that that would be in Washington's best interest um I think that if a number of Oregon interests felt left out and decided to form their own Hub concept and applied um I think that that could render both Concepts as less but we can get into that in the so as I mentioned um Odo has a seat on the board at the the association so there are 18 board members and the list of that is available on the Pacific Northwest hydrogen association website and I just wanted to give you kind of a quick breakdown of of what the board looks like organizationally so we've got couple uh we've got three uh labor entities these two state government entities uh Washington department of commerce's director Lisa Brown is the chair and Otto's director Janine Benner is the vice chair two oil and gas companies three uh two different tribal representatives and then I've got this kind of catch-all other and so it really includes one advocacy non-profit which is the Sierra Club we've got Amazon um charge which I mentioned was initially leading the con you know the conversation around a hub um a couple of hydrogen industry companies and an engineering firm um so as you can see this is this is other than Odo uh this is pretty much all Washington on the board uh so that's certainly a question that we've raised with uh the association and uh you know we're looking to see if it's possible to um more entities specifically organ entities to the board so we have that question into them uh Greg I just saw your question so you know they've seemed very open to it I um I think my understanding is that they were going to put it to a vote to the um I'll have to double check on that um but you know certainly didn't immediately hear an outright no uh so as Martina mentioned so there's an executive board and then there's an advisory committee so sometimes it's referred to as an Advisory Board because that's how it was originally conceived so now it's being referred to as an advisory committee um and so when the Washington Department of Commerce invited folks to apply for the executive board they also invited folks to apply for this committee and they pretty much accepted anyone who submitted the application materials requested and I apologize for the bang dogs in the backyard by the way so there are 58 accepted members at this time uh many of them are RFI respondents um there has been a question at um at the executive board as to whether to add more advisory committee members because we've gotten some other uh kind of late expressions of Interest um so the uh members thus far um predominantly 33 are from either advocacy ngos or lobbyists 30 are from um a quarter of them are from governments or utilities or ports or Transit boards and then 13 from Academia and so the goal is is that you know 58 you know possibly more members is pretty unwieldy for a single committee so the goal is to allow advisory committee members to self-select into 12 different subcommittees and I think uh the goal is to have 12 members per committee uh so that's why we might allow more folks to um and these committee these ideas were developed with the actual Hub application in mind and so you see I've got the list of those 12 here so they run the gamut from everything from Business Development permitting and safety and use transport production and so on um do I have any questions right now hey Rebecca I've got one from Chris you might be addressing it later but he wanted to know does the executive board approve projects to be included in the application just a majority vote or how does the approval process work um I so I am going to get back to project selection so I'll leave that but thus far um the executive board does vote on members uh on matters and um thus far they've all it's all been by a Voice vote and they've all been unanimous so um I'm assuming that it is in fact majority rules oh I just had something uh pop up here from Brian says it would be good to have a labor I don't see that one up in there or up on there so many of us would be involved if possible I would imagine go ahead Rebecca I'm sorry I have one more question that just came in too sorry I'm just trying to I have so many windows open so let's see so yeah no there is no labor committee so that's a great uh that's a great suggestion and then Jessica did you say that there was more I have one more question from um who says is the intake process closed for executive board membership as well are you considering additional members of the board beyond the conversation on Oregon entities and what is the process to join if interested that is an area that we will get back to you with more information as I said we have raised the question of could we could we add some Oregon specific board um so I think the discussion at the board level will include whether or not to to open the board to not only more organ membership but in general and so that's what I can I will report back on once I have an answer and then what the process would be for that I I don't know yet I don't know if it would be the same process or if folks would be invited to join um so I'll have to I'll have to get back to you and I know more on that great thank you um so for the advisory committee the role of it as it's been envisioned thus far is to really serve as a focused group of experts uh and to provide input to the executive board um specifically on decision making and tactical actions um perhaps also provide input into the mno contractor which I'll get to shortly um which I believe stands for management and organization um but also to serve as a conduit to um to you know to do some of that Outreach to communities companies and um and provide uh that Avenue for outreach and dissemination of information about The Hub so uh advisory committee members may be asked to develop um and or review elements of the Hub application uh if that is the case they will be asked to sign an NDA and",

        "text": "ana magnera from the energy climate and transportation program manager with Verde is going to present an update on a stakeholder working group that's been discussed in the stating citing process in Oregon orianna are you with us I am here um and I'll be uh so for the record my name is orianna moniera uh chair Grail Vice chair Howe members of the energy facilities citing Council um we're going to switch up our order a little bit because we've got a presenter who needs to drop at 10. so I'll do a very brief intro we'll dive into something that seems very wonky and specific and then we'll pull back out so just a brief note about the work that we've done doing uh Verde thousand friends of Oregon and renewable Northwest have been uh helping to convene a conversation about the citing process in Oregon bringing together a number of stakeholders uh from a variety of different perspectives who are impacted by citing in the state to have dialogue about what's working what may not be working where the challenges and opportunities are and where we can make some improvements and so um our order today is I'll kick it off to Laura Laura Taber from The Nature Conservancy first to talk a little bit about some of the conversations we've been having about transmission and then kick it back to Diane Brandt from renewable Northwest to talk about kind of the history of this work I'll talk about what it is we're doing and um uh bring it back to some of what Lara shares and then we'll talk about some of the other work groups within this process like the ones that Lara is just about to talk about and some of the things they're working on so Lara will kick us off to talk a little bit about some of the chat challenges and opportunities associated with transmission apologies for jumping around a little bit but want to make sure that we have all our presenters have the opportunity to speak go ahead thank you orianna good morning Madam chair Vice chair and members of the council my name is Lara Tabor I'm the climate action director with the nature conservancy in Oregon and I have been working with Kathy moyd to co-facilitate the transmission working group within the broader group that orianna has been convening we've covered a number of topics with a sort of underlying theme of the clear mismatch between permitting timelines and the timeline that we have to meet our clean energy goals Oregon's 2030 Target for 80 clean electricity is approaching quickly and as I'm sure this council is well aware it takes years off and over a decade to permit new transmission projects transmission permitting processes are complex especially here in Oregon where most transmission is federally owned and operated by the Bonneville power Administration and there's also a tension between the desire to streamline and accelerate these processes processes but still ensure opportunities for Meaningful Community engagement this group has discussed some opportunities including around Regional coordination recognizing that in other regions with rtos in place there are often more efficient ways to allocate transmission capacities for new projects and interconnection requests we're also discussing how Oregon can make it easier to upgrade existing transmission and co-locate new transmission and existing right-of-ways the nature conservancy's recent power of Place West study which analyzed energy and conservation to identify scenarios for meeting energy goals with lower environmental impacts found that West wide half of the new transmission transmission capacity we need could be met with reconductoring and co-location and recommends focusing on these options to make sure that we're still adding capacity while new citing processes unfold as we know those will still take time thank you sorry for one second do we have this presentation when we get this okay thank you we can um so it wasn't part of the PowerPoint slides that we sent out last week but it has been updated so we will resend that out to council okay but I'm just trying to figure out how much I need to write thank you no problem um so the last thing I'll mention is we've also talked about what the state could do to incorporate early Outreach both in its own processes and as it coordinates with Federal processes some of our group members have noted that there are definitely opportunities for the state to prepare to move quickly once projects hit State jurisdiction by proactively analyzing our own energy needs and Corridor options so thank you for the opportunity to provide this updates I'm sorry I won't be able to stay on for discussion um but I hope you enjoy the rest of the presentation thanks orianna thanks so much Lara and now I'll kick it back to Diane Brandt uh with renewable Northwest to share a little bit about the history of this conversation and we'll kind of get back on track with the the order as it was planned um and as uh Wally mentioned um we will uh send around um the updated slides uh later today so so folks can have that content go ahead thanks Ariana uh good morning chair Grail Vice chair how members of the council for the record my name is Diane Brandt and I'm the Oregon policy manager with renewable Northwest a regional non-profit based in Oregon that advocates for the responsible decarbonization of the electricity grid our members include renewable energy industry and business environmental ngos consumer Advocates and others as orianna mentioned I'm here to talk a little bit about the history and also renewable Northwest work and interest in policy efforts and conversations around the siding of renewable energy projects in Oregon and to offer a little bit of context for the panel over the years we have worked with our members and partners to understand the challenges facing renewable energy development and look for possible solutions one of these areas has been the citing process and as such we've supported various legislative efforts some successful and others not focused on easing some of the difficulties around the citing of renewable energy so this has included efforts on updating goal 13 to include renewable energy as a beneficial use of organs land opening a rule making proposing to open a rulemaking to look at the goal exception process and also looking at the thresholds for projects being eligible to be permitted at the county we also regularly engage at f-sec on rulemakings and other opportunities for comment and we had the privilege of presenting to the council in April on renewable energy development and and we continue to look for workable solutions that would ease citing barriers facing renewable energy projects to help meet 100 clean by 2040. as you are all aware citing is an incredibly complex discussion it ranges from the technical considerations to local land use and Community Values it also involves a large number of stakeholders when viewed from all of these angles and raises questions around how we as oregonians choose to use our land and resources and now Post House Bill 2021 and moving towards 100 non-emitting electricity by 2040 the need to address the existing pressure points and citing in a way that is inclusive is even more important to ensure the large amount of renewable projects needed to meet the clean energy mandates and climate goals is bad so we must find a workable and inclusive solution and on an ambitious timeline to add another angle to this renewable Northwest continues to view that house bill 2021 can and will drive renewable development in Oregon and citing is how we install these Renewables perhaps more on a practical side in our work in the regulatory process at the puc the Public Utility Commission we see that organ renewable projects fare well in the regulatory process meaning the selection of organ projects appear frequently in the preferred portfolios identified in the utility integration resource plans however what actually comes online is a different matter meaning while the utilities indicate a willingness and desire to select organ projects the organ projects do not always come online for one reason or another this is just another indicator of a potential disconnect or presence of difficulties in the citing process some of these actually we presented on at the aforementioned April presentation to the which leads me to the current siding the conversation we're having today which is a timely inclusive effort to understand and seek and propose Solutions around the difficulties of citing renewable energy projects in Oregon and we are enthusiastically co-convening this effort recognizing the importance of approaching citing reform in an inclusive and collaborative way and we hope it will not only create durable Solutions but it is already offered a space for creating some shared understanding of the breadth and challenges of the issue so we look forward to continued engagement in this effort and exploring strategies and solutions and to any questions that you might have and I'll pass it back to orianna thank you chair Grail Vice chair Howe members of the energy facility citing Council for the record uh my name once again is Ariana Manera I use she her pronouns and I'm the energy climate and transportation manager at Verde verde's mission is to build environmental wealth through organizing advocacy and social Enterprise environmental wealth can mean many things for clean air and water to Affordable energy bills it can also mean renewable energy projects that create benefits for communities through jobs resilience and economic development or the ability to diversify and protect agricultural land the latter is what brings me and the rest of the panel here today two sessions ago the legislature passed House Bill 2021 which set Oregon's ambitious path to 100 clean energy by 2040. while the bill did not go as far as some wanted in terms of mandating that energy be built in Oregon there are still many projects and many acres of land that will be needed to meet our renewable energy and transmission needs at the same time climate is causing increased pressures on our working lands and wildlife habitat we are faced with a difficult touchdown we need renewable energy to help mitigate the impacts of a change in climate but many of the best sites for renewable energy projects have already been utilized and there's little to no low-hanging fruit left reintersecting goals of our land use system mean that Oregon values many different ways to use our land and benefit communities but oftentimes these land uses come into conflict not to mention the lack of needed transmission capacity that prevents many projects from being built at the same time our state is rich in historic and cultural resources and first foods important to tribal governments and communities protecting these valuable and irreplaceable assets is imperative our energy citing processes must weigh all of these things and do so in ways that also include meaningful tribal consultation accessible opportunities to engage for the communities impacted by projects and a streamlined process that makes it possible to get things built there are ways in which our current regime does this in ways it does not if we are to meet",

to say thank you to the council for coming out here spending your time to review our application thank you to chase for all the good communication and uh thank you to the public for coming out and you know having interest in our project and other projects similar thank you yes sir before I open the hearing up to public testimony I want to remind the public that prior to the close of the record you may submit written testimony in a variety of ways the comment portal email and handing in your written tonight I'd like to get a sense of the number of people interested in testifying to determine if I need to set limits um I've got three here um could you raise your hand if there's any more that want to looks one two okay so maybe five and do we know how many are on the phone and on the web X I've got one person with their hand raised okay um same time five okay so with that um we're ready for Miss Tamara mbit nice to see you okay have you started the clock yet okay very exciting I don't often get to sit on this side of the table so it's very exciting um thank you chair how and members of the sighting Council and staff my name is Tam mbad I'm the moral County planning director today I just want to uh Briefly summarize moral countyy is very supportive of this project and we've submitted comments I believe three times formally into the record and uh the Board of Commissioners will consider uh an an additional letter um the next time they meet which will be Wednesday June 5th again the County's very supportive of the process what I want to call to your attention tonight is this um complicated conundrum with a goal three exception um I think this is the time to get it right and set a a a good precedent I think your staff has it correct in their analysis of goal three they reference um a court of appeals case about whether or not goal 13 compliance with Goal 13 um is sufficient reason to justify goal and they concluded it does not and we would agree with that um I spent the day today with some of your agency counterparts Department of land conservation and development the entire day was looking at solar sighting rules we had a lot of discussion about goal five protection of other resources and balancing that with Goal three I think the I think the process works for the most part um but um and in the past most recently with the um Oregon Supreme Court ruling in favor of the the state and the sighting Council where you did not Implement local standards I think this is a time when you can um agree that there is an appropriate place for local government um the staff I think has done a good job um recommending some mitigation um to offset some of the impacts to removing Farmland from production um I'm just not sure that that's the right formula and what I would like to see and I um I expect the Board of Commissioners will have it in some um formal written letter next week is that we maybe make that a little bit more formal instead of off the cup so we have another solar development in moral County they've taken um great steps to quantify that impact and they also work very closely with staff and our elected officials we have a formal agreement their application will come before you rather soon that gives the county the comfort that that exact number is the correct number and this one um seemed not not completely arbitrary but it's not as quantifiable as another project so um again moral countyy is very supportive of this it's really good business for the underlying farmers and the land owners we just think that there is so much to be considered by setting a president with Goal three we'd encourage you to think about that and maybe give some direction to staff in the developer um to formalize that mitigation program happy to answer any questions questions thank you Miss mavit thank you Cameron Krebs thank you chairman oh sorry you have the floor all right thank you chairman uh I my name",

        "text": " jump in there as well that's kind of like uh best case i hope we're hoping for uh the first rounds we might there might be some lag uh just depending we're hoping to kind of learn some lessons of like projects we're getting in um the time we need to kind of turn this this stuff resources that our best would be best to provide to people so there might be a small lag between the first and second round but we're hoping to kind of make this um kind of seamless um and continuous uh yeah my only suggestion is you know just knowing that oftentimes the planning side can move more quickly for uh you know an entity it might i don't know if that will factor into your thinking at all but you know being able to snap that line more frequently on the planning side versus the the construction side might make sense because the construction side tends to you know what we found at energy trust is offering that twice a year was typically more than enough but having application open you know four times or all the time enabled folks to move more quickly through those planning and development cycles than otherwise you know you're sitting around for six months waiting for the next opportunity to open that's a really that's a really good um i guess piece of advice uh well we'll consider that because i think we haven't considered separating planning and projects but maybe down the line we can or will especially because we've always sort of envisioned sort of a lot of planning and then projects right and so if we need to like do things to kind of not slow down the planning so we'll we'll make sure we take that back to the group of folks that are working to implement the program and think about it yeah appreciate it and i think just kind of adding on to uh jed's jets questions there on the water continuum which there is really no good source of state funding but the water resource department at least has a an inkling of an idea that you have planning feasibility and implementation and i mentioned that because i think with energy projects particularly with our folks who many of them are not as versed as folks like les or mark salaker from from three sisters and so they don't even really know where where to start and for them there may be a lot of stuff between the planning and the construction piece that that that they may have questions on kind of as as we go forward and i do know that our folks when they're looking at for for example federal infrastructure funding that the term shovel ready is something that can be problematic for some of them because they're like well we're we're almost ready to go but we need x y and z and i um i can get from an agency perspective where you have a time limit on the money you want to make sure that that's that's being allocated but i think as as hopefully we get a lot more interest in this program and you guys start to questions in advance of the application deadline if there's a need for us to have some further discussions or provide additional information on kind of where where that line is in that are you ready for construction or you know what sorts of things do you guys need to have for that to be a successful application because i think there may be some situations where people are almost ready to go but there may be something let's let's just say hypothetically maybe there's a land use issue or something like that would that would that eliminate someone from being eligible for a construction grant or or not jed laughs because he knows what i'm talking about which hopefully is not something we have more of but occasionally does just happen so and i want this program to be successful because i do think it's both something that our folks can use but also something that will help uh further the state's goals around community energy resilience that's a really good point um we'll keep in touch james we remind me are we gonna be looking for completeness in applications like as we go or just like toward the deadline or how's that going to work it'll be we won't be reviewing the applications when they come in because people can always kind of withdraw them resubmit them amendments i think um so um we were doing that completeness review at the end but if people have questions about what they've submitted then we're happy to kind of answer if that kind of if they're questions like does this mean like what you need like for as documentation then i'm sure would be happy to kind of go through it and i couldn't imagine a scenario although maybe i shouldn't imagine a scenario where we like get one and we're like hey this seems more like planning or this seems like maybe maybe project you know and we could then talk to them about updating that application for the next round and since we'll be periodically doing the reviews it shouldn't be too much of a delay but i can also let you know as we're like seeing them and if there's any themes that we need some work on if i put my former thunder hat back on for a second you know um two thoughts about that one is you not everybody knows what they're doing right and so being able to advise folks like oh you know we see the project development process as being you know from a to b to c and sometimes a detour over to g and then back to you know f or whatever it is um you know and it might be helpful in your application do that to you know specifying your application how you're moving through these things or whatever it is my point there is being able to communicate with people that are when i was at energy trust like you know we had the same goals we want people to be successful in applying for things and so you know we were very open to helping folks like this is what you want to do like here's how you go from a to b i know that's not you know maybe an apples to apples comparison with what this program is but lagging that and then the second piece is you know keeping that same hat on for i was always encouraging folks to think about the process and like discrete chunks and like not try to go from all the way from a to z in one application think about like how do you go from a to c make sure it still makes sense come back you know and then go from d to e you know and and see where things are gonna require extra time where stuff starts to fall apart you know so i would just say you know from that perspective it might make sense for um you know an application you know for multiple steps in the planning to be uh a feature rather than a bug thanks for the feedback yeah for what it's worth keep it coming because like this is new we wanted to be successful too and we want to learn from people's past experience so yeah thanks for sharing that will you throw the email uh into the chat uh yes i'm gonna i'm just i'm gonna email you just a list of questions just so i have a written answer so i make sure that when i because i've had people asking me questions and i've had a bunch of people submit questions to me so then i can make sure i actually get coherent answers back and not just what i thought i heard and we put the uh kind of questions answers up on the web as well so uh everybody can kind of kind of see them as well so we already have some up i think we already have a first iteration so you could also just look and see if someone's already asked the question and we've already provided an answer perfect if you're thinking of asking about community solar we're working on posting one about that i know you're probably not but actually i so i came from an energy council meeting uh about projects to submit to this program uh right before this meeting so yeah there's a lot of questions someone may or may not also be in another role in life in a place that is probably has a climate action plan and projects and all of that so makes sense i like always think of eric strid whenever i see you oh yes eric is the master spreadsheet builder doesn't even live in hood river but nope but he's part of our energy council he sure is anyway he's a character he is a character we have a lot of characters in our energy characters who get to live in paradise good for them um anyway anything else from us i put in um the the email address for like our general um you're basically getting james um and patricia who's on the line as well there and then they route things around to get back to you and then um james also put in the link to that q a doc that we've already got going that we're just going to keep updating with questions and answers so i'll i'll just add i think um the the comments that that les and jed have made or of course terrible and and totally um but i but i do think there's a lot of folks that don't necessarily know where to start or where they fit in the continuum and so um i'm i'm pleased to hear that there's some flexibility with your guys's program and i know with some of water resources departments program that it when we get to the completeness part they feel like they have a very short time frame and when they can accept additional information and so i would encourage you guys as we get to if there are applications that are not complete and need some additional work if there's any way we can be helpful with that let us know but i think having especially this being the first year and they're not necessarily being a a bright line between those different categories if there's some additional flexibility i think that that'll be helpful and then maybe you know i mean obviously after we go through this first year you guys will have data on what sort of demand you got for one aspect versus um versus another but i think additional flexibility is good and since we have that q a document i'll probably share that with our list of folks so that they have that that information so that they can kind of figure that out and then i will also say while it is a small segment i have heard from some of our folks particularly down in the klamath area that they have more um opportunities for potentially doing small scale solar than maybe hydro and so there is there is that opportunity as well as the uh more standard in conduit hydro that may be associated with with district projects so my hope is is that overall we can get some different folks to be thinking about renewable energy more more broadly and and obviously for the other part",

        "text": " use for oregon workers so my question is how what does it look like from a manpower perspective in terms of utilizing how many workers participate on such a project and would you be looking to hire folks locally to to do the work answer to your first question is that excuse me the principal influx of labor need is during the construction period which is a couple of years uh it's probably several hundred jobs involved in building the converter and both of the converter stations would be in oregon there are other jobs required for instance in the horizontal directional drill and even on board the barge that kind of i would say that vast majority of that labor we certainly expect could be sourced locally our experience with the neptune and hudson projects each was under a project labor agreement it's the expectation that you know this one would be under a project labor agreement but during the construction period yeah i would say at least 90 percent would be localized so the the technology and the converter stations and the uh things like joining the cable and that kind of thing is quite specialized sometimes you have to sort of import specialists to do that kind of work but for the basic it's not that basic but for the for the construction of the converter stations that's all a fairly typical spectrum of construction labor and assuming that it is available locally we would expect to to use that through the pla thank you um since we are virtual i can't tell if uh those folks are online with us right now but the question comes up pretty regularly so thank you are there any other questions hearing none then um susie uh christopher we'd like to thank you for coming to meet with us and i'd like to reiterate what uh cindy said it's nice to get um uh made aware of this before uh it dives in and you are right uh todd and sarah and their team are very uh insightful in knowing how we prefer to get information so thank you for being here with us today well thank you for having us thank you all right well this gets us to agenda item j which is the nolan hills wind power project hearing officer this is an action item we have sarah esterson odo senior policy excuse me advisor and sarah i'll turn it over to you for this item please great oh shoot there we go i'll try to take us home swiftly thank you so much to your grail and vice chair how again members of the council sarah esterson senior policy advisor with the oregon department of energy sighting division this agenda item is requesting council approval to appoint a hearing officer to conduct the contested case proceeding for the nolan hills wind power project as well as the deep the hearing on the draft proposed order appointing a hearing officer is a regulatory requirement although a hearing officer could be a council member a staff or anyone else and in this instance we are recommending a particular individual from the office of administrative hearing so um just to get us a little context so this hearing officer appointment would be for the proceedings related to the nolan hills wind power project which is a proposed 600 megawatt wind and solar facility to be located in umatilla county near the applicant is nolan hills wind llc which is a subsidiary of capital power and the current status of that project is um we have just recently deemed the application for site certificate complete which officially puts us on a clock six months to prepare and issue the draft proposed order so here is your context for the location of this facility similar to golden hills this outer boundary is the site boundary it's got a little over 40 000 acres the is their proposed micro siting area the yellow dots are where wind turbines could be located but all of these fingers are potential turbine strings and roads polygon is the proposed location of the solar array and then there are transmission line routing options hopefully you can see my cursor but here and here this is about 25 miles and again that's in umatilla county so as i mentioned we are proposing the council appoint an administrative law judge employed by the office of administrative hearing the office of administrative hearings is a state agency and they provide administrative law judges to be the be the overseeing judge for state or state they have 65 judges employed and we currently have uh an interagency agreement with the office of administrative hearings to support and be available for just this purpose it's relatively recent we've just had this agreement with them since 2017 and to date um given the projects that have been under council review uh council has appointed an administrative law judge from oah for six projects so this would be the and we've predominantly relied on two individuals joe allen and allison green and for this project um based on their staffing availability we're recommending a new administrative law judge named she has a law degree from william at university college of law and is an oregon board certified bar certified excuse me and she's conducted contested cases for 14 other state agencies since 2013. so based on her experience education and employment at oah we are recommending the council of return to preside over again the public hearing on the draft proposed order and contested case proceeding for this application so i will hand your options over to you you can either appoint or choose not to appoint with specific reasons thank you sarah uh council members are there any questions about this uh request madam chair this is kent yes ken i'll move that the council appoint administrative law judge kate triana from the oregon office of administrative hearings as the hearings officer for the proceedings for the nolan hills wind power project as recommended by staff thank you ken this is jordan el second thank you jordan are there any additional questions or comments on this motion hearing none mr secretary please call the role mercy groom cindy condon yep yes very chalk dude bill stenbeck hanley jenkins yes motion carries madam chair thank you thank you sarah uh as always thorough and uh you did bring us home my friend at this time i'd ask does anyone have any further comments or questions um including you todd if there's any reminders that we need before we wrap up again on the next council meeting um if there are any changes in people's availability just please let me know okay i heard somebody it sounded like hey kent yeah chair grill thank you um this is kent and i just wanted to again thank um secretary cornett and ms esterson for the two presentations today uh the overview of the electrical generation and consumption in oregon and the cascade renewables transmission project that those are both great for us to have thanks again yeah i think so the um the overview of the electrical system i think we've done those kinds of things in the past but we haven't done them in a little while so we'll certainly you know try to identify those because i think they're they're obviously very valuable but if any council member has any thoughts or ideas about presentations that you think would be valuable please you know let us know and we'll endeavor to to make that happen because again i i think you're right that you know both of those were very good and i think it's helpful to have a little different context and actually it was kind of in my mind how well some of the issues and items that the uh mr hawker talked about in his presentation followed a lot of the kind of points that were made in in adam's and stephanie's presentation as well excellent i agree this is jordan for the record um yeah on that on that note todd um when you and i spoke about uh earlier this week about it's just kind of the upcoming meeting i i'd really like to see first of all i really enjoyed the report on the uh on the cable so thank you for i would also really like to get an update or a presentation from from somebody or a group or a staff who understands the world of recycling of these components of these power generating facilities whether it's turbine blades turbine gears solar panels uh components that are recyclable components that are not or emerging technology that could be in the future in the short term that we may start to see come online for some of these materials as they're replaced or modified or updated or i know recyclability is a evolving technology that more and more stuff can be used and recycled as we you know move down the path so i think kind of getting an idea of what current practices are and what the potential could be from a recyclability standpoint would be for me fascinating so i'm just going to throw that out there i think that's a great idea but certainly we'll put that on the list and whether it's it's us doing the research gonna figure that out or bringing somebody who probably has more expertise than than we do we will uh we'll we'll try to do something in the in the coming several months related to that so thank you uh councilman thank you any other comments or questions before we adjourn all right well the time is now 2 48 and the january 28 2022 i got the year right very excited about that uh the january 28 22 meeting of the energy facility citing council is now adjourned thank you everyone for your participation and again thank you to staff for helping us be prepared to execute our thanks everybody have a great weekend",

        "text": " maybe they didn't technically qualify because they have other subsidiaries that for each particular project however that's the it's the same company it's not as if a large company like pacific core then formed a smaller company it's the same folks that run these companies it's one small business that has individual corporations for particular projects and many small businesses are actually impacted by these rules and unfortunately it looks like no small business concerns where you know that that formal review about small business concerns wasn't completed before coming to you today so um again while we appreciate that there were slight improvements to the rule over the past year um because of the big issues that we're facing as a state as a as a globe we ask that you delay this so that we can reduce that uncertainty those delays and costs and make sure the review happens first before we expand other rules at the at the through the aspect process thank you that's members have any clarifying okay hearing none thank you miss carly um next we have uh mr brian kelly uh mr kelly if you'd like to provide your testimony please go ahead great good evening everyone can you hear me okay can you hear me hello yes mr kelly we can hear you great thank you uh wishing everyone a good evening uh my name is brian kelly i am the restoration director for the greater hells canyon based in le grand oregon we're a non-profit conservation organization formed in and we are located here in the blue mountains in the greater hels canyon we plan to detailed comments on the proposed rule making today i just wanted to give you a little verbal context i appreciate the opportunity to speak to you this evening you know personally i've lived in legrand here in the northeast corner of the state for over 40 years my career has been as a forester as a conservationist and as an arborist i'm proud to be a certified arborist for over 26 years during that time i've done a lot of field work in the wildlands in this corner of oregon the thing i want to emphasize to you to sum it all up is please take these uh rules for protected scenic and recreation values please take them i agree that climate change is a huge concern it's perhaps the biggest concern we have we need to take steps to deal with that uh for sure i'm personally disappointed that we haven't come further than we have but there it is as a result though i'm seeing results on the wild lands in this area that comes from climate change but it also comes from development from increases in population in this great state of oregon and uh it's all kind of a cascade that has negative effects on wildlife what may look like open space is to various wildlife species their habitat we're seeing a lot of impacts and a lot of challenges to wildlife because of of their habitat energy developments do impact the open spaces and the natural world some of that's inevitable but we want to make sure that any impacts are minimized and i think that's where where these rules for protected areas values and recreational values come in um i i will tell you an anecdote that's real life experience uh for over 10 years i did a volunteer project where we pulled invasive weeds down in the hells canyon national recreation area in uh collaboration with forest service around a federally listed threatened plant species called mcfarland's four o'clock it's a beautiful beautiful flowering plant only grows in a dozen spots and they're all down in the maybe a smarter guy than me would have figured out earlier than i did that the weeds were all coming in from the roads that were built to service the power line towers coming out of the dams in hell's canyon those roads because they're scraped the top soil is basically scraped off so the main plastic grow there are the invasive weeds and the livestock down there are happy to use the roads for access and they transport the seeds for the weeds so when we're down there digging weeds finally i'm going where are all these hard weeds coming from well they were coming from these roads any energy development basically has roads associated with it to some extent these are not things that you know we normally look at at the top of the list but they are an impact that comes with an energy development so that's just one experience that i've had with how these kind of things can degrade habitat not only for threatened plants but for wildlife that depend on plants as habitat so thank you for listening uh like i said earlier we will submit detailed comments but i just wanted to provide the context that we are very much concerned about potential impacts to protected areas to scenic resources and recreation in the state of oregon thanks for your attention and i wish you all a great evening mr kelly do any members of the council have questions all right thank you um i'm seeing that uh mr jake stephen still has a question mark up and that may just still be up but if you do have a comment on this rulemaking please go ahead um well i must have hit some button that i don't know exists um so sorry about that todd um the uh i do have comments um again happy to wait for others but um i'll uh i guess i'll just roll with it since that didn't go very well last time so thank you uh council and appreciate the opportunity to make comments on the these these rules this is jake stevens for the record the ceo of new sun energy and nissan energy invests in the development of renewable particularly solar energy non-emitting development in oregon and northwest but especially oregon and i appreciate uh angela crowley cook's uh comments and we support those comments by ocea in their entirety and i would highlight that we are also a small business under the definitions that were defined and we are affected by this and the rules of um that fsec adopts have high impact to us in terms of the potential um business standards you know business endeavors that we implement in our investments um and heavily affect us and and the um you know the burdensomeness of the f-sec process which is essentially a process to do what counties you know generally accomplish for um thousands or tens of thousands of dollars relative to pretty clean standards uh in most cases um you know is it is a significant threshold and the rules uh moving in the wrong direction only you know creates additional challenges with that in terms of sex efficiency uh and on that front so obviously that is a concern and i would add to osiya's comments um you know in addition to the uh i think it's governor brown's executive order 20-04 and what it asks the state agencies to do um you know hb 2021 has its own standards and as per the prior under hp 2021 we have 100 clean energy standard by 2040 um i'll note that under hp 2021 section two the policy statement is that it is the policy of the state of oregon that retail one retail electricity providers rely on non-emitting electricity in accordance with the clean energy targets set forth in section 3 of this 2021 act and eliminate greenhouse gas emissions associated with oregon retail electricity consumers by 2040. it then says in paragraph two that that same electricity that electricity generated in a matter that produces zero greenhouse gas emissions also be generated to the maximum extent practical in a manner that provides additional direct benefits to the communities in this state in the forms of creating and sustaining meaningful living wage jobs promoting workforce and increasing energy security and in short as representative helm the vice chair stated as part of the legislative intent is well understood that that meant that these facilities would be built in oregon and to provide benefits of labor in the state because the construction and operational jobs associated with them the maximum extent arguably and i think demonstrably entirely uh possible within the state boundaries of oregon certainly the close proximity where oregonians can work and benefit from these these uh benefits you know enumerated in that paragraph so as such as um angela alluded to the or describe the you know the burdens and challenges and concerns and potential risks and extra complications with the proposed rules and for these rules and all the rules that f-sec is considering related to permitting facilities in the state ultimately it is charged with implementing the policies of the state of oregon and facilitating the success of that and i think all of the rules that are by asset going forward need to put them in the context of uh the executive order and hp 2021's requirements and and evaluate whether those rules on item by item basis as well as a cumulative basis facilitate the success and effectuate the ability of the state to succeed in those policy states and policy and obligations that it's imposing on the state so i think as such you know agreeing with angela's recommendation that this be delayed i think the review process for this needs to systematically evaluate you know whether that is occurring or whether additional burdens are being imposed and to what benefit and conversely we would recommend in this case and others that fsec be reviewing the rules that apply and the standards that apply to determine you know where they are achieving and facilitating those legislated statutory policy positions of the state of oregon and the uh the compliance obligations that it's and so forth you know for these purposes um i guess i'll just close with with saying that um you know oregon is a obviously uh unquestionably beautiful gorgeous state and there's a lot to protect here um but we are engaged in a battle um you know we we are in the ecosystem collapse prevention business now and the renewable developers um those that are seeking to facilitate decarbonization are are in the effort and engaged in a pretty challenging incredibly challenging effort to facilitate the decarbonization to present prevent entire ecosystems from collapsing and it is a sad uh truth that in oregon um but due to you know other land use laws that fsec did not write um but that you know limit the agricultural development of land and other states you know reduction of water use and development of farmland is favored and supported but in the state of oregon there are habitat impacts that are undeniably and unavoidable in achieving these other objectives which pains us to no end but is an unavoidable truth of the bigger job at hand and and these you know has memorialized in the statute and it's complex the gentleman before you know described these these issues um no doubt accurately and simultaneously",

        "text": " site plan approval at this point. So it's got to go through site plan approval and building permitting. So I'll be surprised if we're under construction in the next, next six months, is my concern. Okay, we've got a motion by Commissioner Bryant. Thank you for going through those details. And I need a second. I'll second it. Have a second by Commissioner Zalik. In the additional conversation. I'll call the votes. So Commissioner Gold, get ready to send your email to attorney unless you want to verbally voice your v. I'll do a verbal. Okay, so all in favor, say aye. Aye. A aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. Thank you. All right. Thank you for your time. That was obviously arduous, but we did make it through it. Thank you very much. That's what happens whenever you come in with a lot of issues. Thank you. And thank you for the play that's gonna take place on that property. Good luck. Wishing you the best. Absolutely. Okay, our next item'fifteen. One, two. We're just getting ready. Mister Rison is going to take us through that and tell us that it is being continued. But if there is anyone here, we are going to call you forward if you'd like to give any public comment. So, Mister Ryon. Good afternoon. Chris Reizman and the gross services staff. This item is case number 23 Dao four. It's a request regarding a development agreement for the property which is Ocala TDC Deltona, which is located off of the northwest quadrant of the I 75 and highway 44 interchange. We've got to reset our thing there. This is I 75, highway 44. This is the TDC Deltona property. Their developer'agreement is a proposal related to a comprehensive plan amendment and pud rezoning. We are recommending that it be continued to June 6, 02:00 p.m. to be able to consider it comprehensively and currently with the comprehensive plan amendment and zoning case. And then also there is a consideration for a Platt vacation related to the site as well. Thank you, Mister Ryen. Is there anyone in the public who is here to speak on this item? If not, I'll make a motion to continue to June 6 2nd. We have a motion by Commissioner Alec and second by Commissioner Bryant. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries. Unanimous. Thank you okay? That's going to take us to item number 1513. Miss Hriizon, are you going to be presenting on that one as well? Yes, ma'am. Okay, this is item number 23. Dao five is the case number. It's another development agreement related to Okela Southwest 100th LLC. This is a site related or a project related to two Pud which were previously approved by the Board account commissioners. This does relate solely to the development agreement related to the project, which is for the construction of Southwest 100th street extending from 49th Avenue to the east westward to Southwest 62nd Avenue Road. It would be along the southern side of the Meadow Gland subdivision, north of the Cherry Wood estates and woods and meadows east subdivisions, and then the two pud that are located east and west. One is referred to the western PD and then the eastern PD. This is an area that's surrounded overall by 49th Avenue. 95th street is just to the north, 62nd Avenue Road. Then 103rd Street Road is to the south. And this is just a clear aerial. You can see the Meadow Glens subdivision. Cherry Wood Est states East Cherry Wood states phases ten, b and eleven. This is Oakrest and woods and meadows. East Emerald Point, Sandy Pines. This is alejandriaates and then there are some other parcels here. This is a power substation from CEO. This proposal for this development agreement will provide for the construction of Southwest 100th street, creating the two intersections at 62nd Avenue Road and 49th, along with creating an intersection at what is Southwest 54th Court for that roadway. And then what occurs is this will also be addressing some mitigation related to port ##ortionate share for other intersections which are 49th Avenue and Ninetyutty, Fifth Street, 100th street and then 103rd Street Road. The concept here for 49th and 100th street is that it will ultimately require signalization in time just for reference. For the surroundings, the area is generally designated for medium denser residential. Currently, there are zonings in the area are one zoning with the two pudds that were approved previously by the board, and again, existing uses are a variety of single family homes, a few vacant scattered single family lots or parcels, and again, the two pud just for reference. These are the current pds which are under review. They will come back to the board of Keninet Commissioners for your separate specific approval once they've complete the review processes. This is that western ped that they have preliminary submitted and this is the eastern prudity that they've also put onry submitted. Generally, however, this development agreement will enact the condition of those pds which is the creation of 100th street. Each one is proposed for residential development. Currently the designs provide for 203 units in the western PD and 180 lots in the eastern PD, which is consistent with their approvals. The agreement does provide for traffic analysis study and provides for that proportionate chair addressessing. And I will note the design specifically provides for a twelve foot wide multi use trail. And this is that general cross section. This would be a drainage swale, the roadway, another drainage area, and then the twelve foot multi use path. And then this is expected barriers. This is the metadal gloand subdivision and then this would be to the south. Generally an agreement is mandated by the state for how it's structured and provided for. So they providing a series of components that are required. The key component is talking about impact fee credits for the construction costs that they are going to be involved with. There are some crediting for their proportionate share, for instance, that would not be reimbursable costs. And then also there is an escrow on file for the charrrywood estates for their portion of that right of way. And again, the three streets that have proportion share generations are the intersections with 49th Avenue. And again, other general sections which are somewhat typical. And so staff is recommending approval of the request as it's been proposed. Very good. Thank you, Mister Rison. Yes. So Chris, on there, there was just a couple red spots on the pud. Is that because the athletic field or whatever's on the right spot? And corct, what's the issue with the cul de sac? There is two lots. The field, we have noted, it does need to shift up tucked into the corner, which is what their PD master planner will provided for. And down here, they have proposed a reconfiguration of this area. The original design provided for two lots that would back up to this property to the south, not a cul sa. Now they've kind of brought the cul de sac down. There is a buffer between them. And since the PD was approved, there has been a house built on that lot and it kind of lines up almost with that cul de sac. So that is a potential concern. So we want to make sure that buffering is very well done. Yes, ma'am. So basically the concern is instead of having two lots or a house at the end of it on their side, it's just a road with street lights coming down at Corct. Yes, that's part of the concern. Thank you, Chris. Thank you. Yes sir. Any other clarification or questions for Mister Ron, attorney mentor? You have anything? Okay, applicant? Mister Gooding. Jimmy Gooding, 1531 Southeast 36 Oa, 36th Avenueala, Florida. Three 4471 representing the applicant. May I ask a question that mister menor first? Of course. Under the county impact fee ordinance, if a improvement for which a developer seeks impact fee credits, it's not on the five year county tip plan. And understand this one's not. We have to get a supermajority vote. If you would advise us formally, does that mean. Okay, so there's four of them, counting commissioner Gold. Does that mean three out of four can do it or does it mean we have to get four out of five? Of all the county commission members? I think you have to get four out five. Okay, so I have to get four votes. And if commissioner goal wasn't here, then I couldn't proceed with the hearing. Okay, so I would ask Commissioner Cole to stay with us if he would. If the rapture comes, I think we get hear some horns or something, don't we? M so perhaps we would know if he's gone. Well, I won't be here. Let me just tell you and you'll know you missed it. Thank you. I hope you are with me. I'll talk to you afterwards. If not, thank you to help you get there, as Mister Risysen pointed out. I think he'll talk to him afterwards, after this meeting, make sure he's ready. I thought you met after the rapture. I know what you. I'm not sure Lazarus said that, but that's another story. Madam Cl, if you can decide if you'll add that to the few minutes or not. You could just put bracket theological discussion concerning pre mel or postml. But in any event, this is, as Mister Eisen indicated, this is a",

        "text": " entire line or should it be based on individual nsrs where the actual high levels of noise will occur our position on the ladder is very straightforward you shouldn't be granting anybody an exemption for an entire facility that goes for to almost 300 miles it should be focused on the nsrs where there actually are exceedances as to the whether they meet the standard they don't as ms gilbert just noted that there isn't an infrequent issue here because it's 48 days if you're in union county that's not infrequent there's also no special circumstances here that render compliance and practical there are other routes where there wouldn't be this problem uh one of them would be the nepa route but the other routes would make this perfectly feasible there's also exception allowed if substantial compliance would result in substantial controlment or closing down of the business well the business doesn't exist right now i wouldn't be closing anything down and if the applicant can't comply with the noise standards then they shouldn't be building the line you shouldn't be approving things because simply because the applicant can't meet your standards you should be saying meet the standards or your certificate is denied that's how that's supposed to work then the lat one of the other points to think about is you're obligated if you're actually applying the deq noise rules to balance the equities here and that wasn't done if you look at the order the public health welfare and safety on noise issues were not balanced against ipc's the only thing that was balanced was the cost and the difficulty for ipc of building a line that actually complied with the standards thank you mr anuta are there any questions from council okay thank you so the next is mr horst excuse me my name is joe horst just regards to contested case in c2 um oar3400350010 uh regarding exceptions reads specifically i'm establishing exceptions the department shall consider the protection of health safety and welfare of oregon citizens this does not do that you know there might be an argument made that this might be for the greater good of the northwest but the oar specifically says health safety and welfare of oregon citizens and not idaho citizens regarding variances read specifically conditions for granting the commission may grant specific variances from the particular requirements of any title regulation or order to a specific persons or class of persons shall specific noise upon such conditions as it may deem necessary to protect the public health and welfare well this actually does the opposite of does not protect the public health and welfare so that therefore that does not apply um the oregon legislature has made it very clear ors-467010 reads the legislative assembly finds that the increasing incidence of noise emissions in this state at unreasonable levels this is much of a threat to the environmental quality of life in the state and the health of safety and welfare of the people of the state as is pollution of the air and waters of this state the oregon legislature makes takes noise pollution very seriously while the oregon department of quality no longer does the variances their exception they did set the standards to what maximum maximum noise levels should be if a company wanted to pollute a river and their guesses could be 10 to 20 over what the maximum allowed is or if a company wanted to put smoke in the air you know just saying you know it might be 10 might be 20 we really don't know that for sure over the maximum allowed i'm sure they would be uh rejected um they're they're department is and idaho power's asking exceptions it would be determined over the maximum level that the odeq has you know made maximum level should be so i'm asking that the that you guys reject the their uh exceptions or variances at all i'm just gonna make a quick comment uh from what i've seen this process so far um yesterday i made a comment on this uh that the legrand uh city council does not want this route to be used there's many citizens don't want it to be you guys aren't listening to us they're not listening to us at all mr white came in and he was concerned about the the blasting you know he lives on the bottom of a huge steep hillside and he's concerned about his house and you guys say well we're gonna give you a week weeks notice you know so you can get out of your house so if the rocks come down you're not in it you know it's it's it's just wrong you're not listening to what we're trying to say um he doesn't he doesn't care about the notice he wants he doesn't want his house flattened you know while that road my road might be 15 to 20 percent it goes up it goes up at an angle that if you ever look at that hillside right at the bottom of those houses it's big and it's steep if a car if a cement truck is coming down that road and there's another car coming the other way in this blind corner either the two are going to hit or want it that cement truck is going to go off the road if it it's going to land right on a couple of houses there's no way it can't thank you mr horst yeah okay i apologize thank you any questions of mr horst good morning again for the record arguments that the parties have made on this issue are far-ranging and i will try to just briefly touch on as many as i can in the time that i have first as mr ratcliffe explained essec does have expressed jurisdiction to assess an application for a site to make sure that it complies with state statutes and rules that are normally administered by enforced by others including odeq's noise rules and fsx regarding compliance with such statutes and rules it is binding on those agencies accordingly the council does have jurisdiction to issue a variance or exception in this case and as we explained in our briefing the legislature when it adopted the noise statute it clearly didn't intend that it would be inflexibly applied in each case because it allowed for variances and now neither eqc or deq are currently employs enforcing their noise statutes and rules so in order to give effect to the legislature's intent fsec is the only agency that can consider a variance or an exception in this case so you have the ability to do so and as a matter of policy you should do so and with respect to uh mr anuta's suggestion that the applicant or odo should have consulted with deq or odo i can tell you there's an affidavit in the record here that on another issue related to noise the applicant did contact deq to try to get some advice and we're told very clearly we don't have staff to even talk to you about this issue that was on a different issue not the variance or exception issue but to give you a sense there is evidence in the record that there is no one to talk to there about based on idaho power's noise modeling analysis the corona noise exceedances caused by foul weather events are in fact infrequent and unusual therefore warranting an exception to deq's anti-degradation idaho power has demonstrated that on average and applying conservative assumptions the project will be in compliance with the noise rules 98.7 percent of the time and when you specifically look at the legrand area which was the subject of some controversy here b2h will be in compliance approximately 97.3 percent of the time now both stop v2h and ms gilbert have focused on the fact that idaho powers analysis does show that if you look at data on a daily basis there will be 48 days in a year or 13 of the days where there will be an exceedance but we think the sole focus on that data point is it's misleading because it treats a day in which there's a an exceedance in one hour the same as a day where there was an exceedance in every hour so while that's an interesting data point we're not ignoring it we think much more salient is to think about how many total hours of the day is there going to be an exceedant and it's a tiny little finally a variance is appropriate because strict application of the noise given the numerous other constraints the company needs to avoid would could could render b2h unpermittable which would deprive the region of critical infrastructure that's necessary to achieve a clean energy grid and it's been supported and prioritized by the state and the nation and with respect to mr um anuta's claim that if that the nepa route wouldn't have had any of the same issues there's absolutely no evidence in the record to suggest that then there would have been no exceedances along the nepa route and finally and and thank you the other parties went a little long so if you'll indulge me just 30 more seconds in mind also that health and welfare is one of the bases what one of the things that you have to consider when you would grant an exception or a variance keep in mind that corona noise that is predicted to occur will only be during foul weather and it's most likely to cause an accedence in nighttime hours when it's particularly quiet under these conditions most residents will be indoors where sound levels will be significantly attenuated and under foul weather conditions where the rain is heavy then corona is frequently masked by the the sound of the rain hitting the foliage so our prediction of exceedances is really quite conservative as idaho power's acoustical expert mr mark bastash explained the evidence confirms that b2h won't cause exceedances of deq's maximal allowable sound standards for industry sources the maximum amount and oregonians can reasonably be expected to hear sleep and go about their daily activities without interruption therefore the granting of a variance and exception together with the site conditions that we'll talk about a little bit more in a few minutes are fully protective of oregonians thank you thank you miss rachner are there any questions from council so i can face you without turning so thank you cindy condon uh one of the things that is concerning to me is um there's certainly reliance on modeling i certainly get that and there are certainly comments made that people can reasonably this or that so when the project is finished if there are exceedances what's the consequence of that does the just live in in your mind does the public just live with that you know yep we've tried to protect health and welfare or is there can be done for that let me um talk a little bit about the mitigation and the",

        "text": " do we usually have our action items after public hearings yes it would be right after there okay so we'll do that do you want to take questions in here or do you want to wait and have them out there um no I was going to suggest we have them here because I have another one too but go ahead commissioner Rogers all right my questions are these when we originally heard that the other evening and that was taken off as you all know uh to allow people to talk they were fairly angry and needed to hear what their their concerns were um they gave us a number of issues and again I have a dog in the fight only from the standpoint and I think we need to cite to these activities and I think that Business site might be the best but uh so I don't want staff to feel that I wasn't supporting there but I still don't know that I like the messaging and the reason here's what the message is that because somebody from a different District a different area we're going to have later this month a meeting in which they're going to express their issues when they came that evening they occurred at least I heard and this was in my head and maybe other certain different things we don't have bus service and the staff did their best to say we do and but I didn't see that we've communicated that really clearly again our property values are going to sink we know that that's never been the case but we don't have any issues there uh there's going to be all of these activities in our community that maybe we won't allocate policing services or Support Services to deal with uh we've spent a lot of time and money again there's no criticism but I'm just saying you didn't what you have to do but it sends a lot of time saying the governor said we had the right right where we want and we're just buying these units because we couldn't sign them somewhere I think we with a different messaging could get over the line but that's just my impression so my questions are these uh one why are we doing now in this particular purchase item why don't we wait until after you have your meeting in a week or two that's number one number two is there going to be a factual sheet that's public not not what you've been doing internally but probably that answers some of the basic core questions so that we don't sit there and look flat-footed and I know you're not flat-footed now or your staff but they aren't very good but it looked flat-footed you know they have all these concerns and we've now taken into consideration so my question so before you start on that um I realized uh and uh you sent us an information packet late yesterday and I did read the email though I didn't have brain power to read each of the documents could you start with summarizing that information for us and what will be public facing specifically before getting into some of those things they said we're not they're only internal at this point not external thank you for your question um so um the the agenda item today is to purchase the pods the palletized pods that we can use in various locations so it's a separate issue again I would offer that this board sets the policy for how we determine a site and we're happy to come back and have further conversation but we have we have updated materials we have put materials we have been Distributing these materials for a couple of weeks now that talk about how the sites are selected it talks about what what the provider offers on the site including fencing security 24 7 um we have information about connecting to services so I think that what we hear is that people are upset that we don't go to the the community to the neighborhood and say would you like a shelter at this site and that's true we don't do that once we've selected the site then we go to the neighbors neighborhood and we say we're putting a shelter site here what are your concerns and what can we do to be good partners in this what reassurances what services what do you need to feel more we we do address questions like my property value is going to go down but you you know you have been in front of me when I've cited data or information and people say well you know I don't believe it um they believe that their property values are going to go down there's no evidence that temporary shelter citing reduces property values I think that the really important reminder is we're also bringing the ordinance for camping to this board in June and that ordinance if we don't have shelter available we will have we will continue to have encampments and camping and so we're trying to move both of these processes forward so that we do have shelter sites so that we can close down and prohibit camping and encampments in Washington I'm process for today we're going to have this as an action item are there any staff preparations for having a short presentation about that this is specific if you purchasing Palatine shelters and and as an aside here is the process that we use for identifying where uh shelter sites are how the process works for engaging the community for a neighborhood plan if that presentation isn't already ready then uh I will speak to what uh as an overview of what it is and we'll direct people to the Washington County website for the information and that is assuming that the website has already been updated uh as your email um thank you chair Harrington so staff did learn this morning that we would likely be asked to make a short staff Our advice to staff was to focus on the actual agenda item and then just to mention but we can do a high level this is the process that we use so we can't incorporate that so it does have a no good repair for the community to continue to only tell their story about lack of process or anger at the process without us pushing out here is how our process works yeah we we can do a high level this this is the process not sure who you keep looking I'm I'm looking at Jess okay um Jess Larson is the assistant director of homeless Services um and I don't want to put her on the spot so they will learn visuals for people to see I don't think that we can provide visuals between now and 10 that's why I use the word presentation staff we'll see what we can put together between now and 10 o'clock which may just be pointing individuals to the website as well as for available in fashion Kevin bring up the web page that has has the diagrams and the and I had one thing all just verbal isn't cutting it the thing that I would add and at that meeting it's commission Therese tried to hit at the nub of the issue somehow we put all this together in one big issue instead of separating it to me we should have sent clearly said this is for the purchase of these units but we somehow got it with where we're citing him how we're citing is there any way to take that back apart could I yeah please after that was exactly what I said and I think that um I learned and I just went on the web or went to the information and clicked on the the contract and it does say that the pallets are going to be delivered to the United Methodist site so that I think that that was that was a big trigger I'm just pointing that out so that we all are aware of that I was not aware of that um that evening that doesn't mean that they'll be used there but it is but they did only that in their testimony well and unless this board directs differently the intent is that used there we would use them so no one is suggesting that rather um it uh after your board meeting that was in the evening in May uh staff did uh do the work to put together assets to make it clear in terms of what our engagement process is and we need to not be so afraid to just say look this is the Pod shelter and here is how our neighborhood process works and just keep telling our story loud and proud you know we're our staff's doing good and we're going to keep doing good work the other thing that I will be correcting uh is Heartwood Commons is an affordable it's not a homeless shelter and that's our story because that's the and people are living there and thriving and we're going to keep helping people thrive so if I could just ask a question Marney this uh you know that I've got this scope of work um and it says draft on it so I'm not sure if it's if we've approved this or if it's just more draft or wet but this outlines what our agreement or our what our expectations of how the Camp's going to be ran and some of the parameters I I would think this might be a good document to hand out to them if if it truly is a draft or if it isn't a draft or whatever but our website has uh neighbor agreement on it hey this is this is a um that's with the vendor Open Door yeah this is an alternative shelter program attachment scope of work and I just found it to be a little bit revealing to me as to what the expectations and how all of this thing works by reading this document so if you went to the one that's on the website uh that provides information for the community along the very same lines without revealing the contract terms for the actual service the reason it says draft is because it it's the template that we use and until we actually haven't agreed contract so your version says draft um because because it's it's a draft until we finalize a contract so it's a well I understand it's just good information that if we could direct them to to have something like that and we have that information on the website it's not the actual contract but okay the those like you know the the um requirements of the vendor are included on the website chair Huntington I have a question for you Marnie I think as of now I'm not sure if somebody correct me if I'm wrong the residents submitted a lot of questions that they were looking for answers and I don't think of that I think people appreciate the transparency in your process like this is where it's gonna hopefully be used these Palace shelters so I don't think transparency is the problem here I do think that residents are asking for some questions to be answered and they're not getting some of those answers and then they're painting a scary picture for themselves which isn't you know fear is a real thing what is the next meeting scheduled I'm not done asking my question uh chair Huntington if you don't but",

        "text": " that um council members chak and neelin can um hear us and can speak yes great thank you excellent I heard it I heard that yes okay Tom the floor is yours okay again uh Thomas Jackman for the record uh and we are now here on agenda item C the 2024 s certificate Amendment rule making so uh go ahead and go to the next slide here so again the background slide but you'll notice we are now at the start of the process with the initiation of sort of informal rulemaking as we call it um the formal rulemaking process being when you filed the notice of proposed rule making so as uh part of the 2024 2026 R making schedule uh Council directed staff to prioritize work on the 20 24 Amendment rle making and it's called the 2024 Amendment rule making because five years ago we had another amendment rle making so we just threw a year number on here so that it would be clear in the future when you're referring to an amendment rule making which one uh you're talking about so this project is sort of timely as there is a 5-year of the previous Amendment rule revision is due in January 2025 as the previous version went into effect in January of 2020 uh and that rule that revision doesn't have to be very extensive but it was sort of Cons considering the scope of that that rulemaking and how many things were changed uh you know staff felt it was a an appropriate time to sort of take us you know an assessment and as you'll see there's quite a quite a few things that we hope to sort of clarify and address with this so let's go through and just yeah so if council's agreeable with the proposal today what would come next is the creation of Iraq uh and the development of a draft set of rules so let's kind of go through a little bit of the scope of what staff is proposing we Tom at yes before we get too far in I just want to say that um I'm GNA ask you to pause regularly so we can check in with council member chaku and council member delin since we can't see them now we know we hear them but we just want to make sure that we take a pause periodically okay all right I will any question pause thank you okay hearing that let's go to the slide oh that no okay uh all right so the scope here is it's everything really but uh to just break it down into three sort of categories again we want to improve the clarity of the rules by resolving ambiguities that have sort of revealed themselves over the application of the rules as written over the last five years um and as part of that we're also potentially going to be proposing substantive changes to improve the amendment process based on Lessons Learned so so not just not just you know clarifying the process but potentially changing the process uh to improve the you know the outcome and third is sort of always a sort of um staple of the ru making process but updating the rules to ensure you know while we're doing a review of them all are they in compliance with any new statutes any other revised rules and any recent Direction we've received from the courts regarding our amendment process any questions about the scope and objectives nope all right so I just have a couple of slides here that sort of touch on possible areas of focus this not uh sort of the entirety of the list but this just should sort of flag anybody who's potentially interested in this Ru making these are the sorts of things we're going to be looking at and so if you care about any of these things definitely pay attention to this Ru making uh potentially sign up to or let us let your voice be heard and and let me know you're interested to be a part of this uh this rack even uh as it has not been formed yet we'll discuss that in a second but so we have issues around uh partial retirements of facilities um so only part of a facility is up for retirement you know there's 100 turbines and they decide to retire 50 of them what does that look like the um return you know returning sites to a useful non-hazardous condition site changes that trigger an amendment process how Amendment types are determined pre-amendment conference issues uh information applicants need to submit in the preliminary request for an amendment uh any thoughts about those possible all right let's go to the next slide so this just continuing on issues around notice requirements how the public comment perod is structured uh during an amendment how to properly raise issues uh sort of matching the changes we've made with sufficient specificity sort of I should say matching the additional Clarity there is some changes with the standard uh for an amendment with raising issues so there's a reason why we didn't just copy what we uh proactively this sort of needs its own lens uh to examine what how exactly the language should read uh for the amendment process but sort of matching how we clarified it for the contested case generally and then just any other issues identified by Council staff or or rack members so it's pretty broad this is a this is not a sort of we identified one little issue and we want to fix that this is a um uh kind is going to be a what sort of what we did with the contested case RS where we're going to start on you know and we we already have internally just sort of look look at each rule in the amendment process one by one and ask ourselves does this make sense uh can we improve this uh so that is what we're going to be doing with the rack and going forward as part of the draft uh creating a draft proposed rules any thoughts or feelings uh the amendment Ru making any areas that you already are concerned about that you don't see reflected on those slides that you want staff to look at and of course you're this isn't the last time that you'll be able to you know raise any issues or concerns but you know if something was already in your mind can you click back a slide please the site changes that trigger this is chair Grail the site changes that trigger an amendment process are the things that I feel like we G that people look for or find Opportunities to expand perhaps what the intention was so that's one that I think as we keep seeing changes we've had a lot of conversation about uh people changing own ownership and when we need to be concerned I think earlier when we talked about the battery storage so that's what I'm just super curious about myself definitely definitely counc cond um thank you the uh next one on that same side the amendment type A B has been questioned a lot and so that is H to me an important area for us thanks for and we're going to check in this is chair Grail council member choor council member delin do either of you have any comments uh no Madam chair thank you thank you I heard them though I got supers Sonic mom hearing all right let's go two slides I guess go to the yep so again we are asking for uh or or recommending that we form aack and requesting that uh Council uh approve staff to create a rack consisting of again roughly 12 members and just sort of based on how the last of you have gone this sort of seems like a good number uh sometimes we get interest matching this uh I think with the contested case we had eight but you know sort of matched the distribution that you see here um but uh if anybody has any questions or thoughts about rack makeup for this Ru making council member Condon I I just I I really a comment about it I I appreciated the um Bri the diversity of this group but also just want to mention that um you know the SL SL suggest there are two members of the public here and really as I look at it the reviewing agencies certainly represent a public view of it they have a constituency as well obviously the two members from the Public Public and the two resource interest groups and environmental justice groups are members of the public to me I mean so there is quite a bit of public representation there um and sometimes I think the maybe the racks aren't looked at that way but this one particularly um I think it's a a good grouping of both stakeholders uh that are the investor owned utilities and the independent power producers but also members of the public and diverse Todd sorry Mr secretary thank you madam chair um for the record Todd cornette and just a reminder you know and we will make these you know we'll provide the notice about these rulemaking advisory committee meetings and we encourage any council members to you know either show up person or show up online as long as we don't have a quorum of council members we think that's helpful you know we appreciate you know all the council members who have done that in the past we think being part of that or just listening to those conversation also helps really inform you later on when we provide the rules to you when you hear other comments you can help translate that to the rest of the council members as well so it's certainly not required but we we encourage it and we will provide that information to you thank you and I would just say this is chair Grail when I look at this list um and we say to investor own utilities well in the state of Oregon you can pick how you want to do that but where would the co-op so imtil Electric Cooperative is huge and it continues to grow and where would they fit on your list if you just were plugging them in yeah I would say that we would put them in that category as well and kind of depending upon the ru making you know they may or may not be interested typically like a a public utility district or a consumer owned utility wouldn't really be part of our process you know and UMO electric is kind of a weird one because it's sort of in between um it's certainly gotten a lot bigger you know and it's not a Pacific core it's not a Portland General Electric but it's also not a consumer own utility and I don't know exactly what category it's in it's kind of in that sort of um in between category between those but but it's a good reminder that I think they're a valid um uh one and and while that may not be a perfect categorization we would I would see that they would fall within that thank you for that I just I want people to recognize that the emphasis on guidance like we have the ability to make change and",

        "text": " the application so that because in our experience you need to sort of like draft everything in a separate document to like have everybody review it that needs to review it and all of those things before you just kind of put cut and paste it into the portal in the end so the portal it's there's nothing there that you don't already have and the idea is really just so that we don't have to delay getting the money out the door to you all to do the projects that we know you want to get going as soon as possible because our it folks are not able to get to opening the portal right away so hopefully that makes sense and you agree that it it seems like the right approach to here's everything you need and then in the end the thing you just need to cut and paste to will be open and hopefully that will all um open in time for you to do it but we didn't want to like slow everything down right that's exactly right CH see the only thing is we won't even have any cut and pasting it this will be strictly document uploads like a Dropbox a few check boxes and you know attestations and a digital signature you know submission button and you'll get a chance to to make sure all your documents are uploaded um and then you click submit and that's basically it on this it will require um a log in a username and login to the Odo customer service portal um and we'll have full instructions to that um at the same time that we do open the portal great thanks Clay uh then Joshua Reed I wish I knew you're from Joshua um what about projects that do include new re new renewable generation can the cost of that component be excluded and the resilience component still be eligible for the program the reason I'm asking because if you're from a consumer owned utility I feel like we've got a different program for you but yes the answer to that is yes um again all of the details will will be be looked at and stuff before you know I give definitive answer on any particular cause but the short answer is yes um as long as those resilience components are for um you know reducing frequency and duration of grid disruptions great thanks so much and then um finally we have a question for you in case we get more questions in the um in the chat or any hands raised so we are just curious um you're on that's so great are you planning to apply we're just curious if folks are planning to apply this round um we know there will be multiple rounds and just curious if anybody has started pulling together application materials just kind of wondering where folks are and what folks are thinking a little finger on the pulse if you will and you can put it in the chat you can raise your hand you keep it to yourself if you want but we'd love to great tan great to hear Idaho Power great hope that yeah we know how we know how capacity issues go too so good luck on that Lisa good well we're glad some people are thinking of applying and it's a competitive application process so you know my help guess for the first one if we don't have so many maybe um great otch and G planning to apply that's potentially with tiger cool great well um we can just we'll plan on sticking around and see what other questions come up we can sit here in awkward silence all day but um at some point we might just say we'll let everyone go and then usually a couple people stick around and ask us questions oneon-one which is totally fine too um for those that that are done and and take off even though we're going to stick around for a little while thank you very much for coming um we appreciate your the time and your interest in this program okay for those of you still on too feel free to come off camera and talk with us it's a small group now it's mostly just Odo have all right clay we can probably call it if you want in my experience or we could just hang out together for a okay well we're we're past 30 minutes so if somebody was really late I I would think that johnner John Warner asking how to come off oh perfect we can if you raise your hand then we can unmute you Patrica can you unmute John Warner I've been unmuted um hi hi everybody sorry I was trying to figure that out I couldn't on my end so I appreciate the assist there um you know I um if we have a moment and I know we're after the half hour so cut me off any we have time we were planning an hour so you're fine okay so my my question about PGE and um really is getting to a question about collaboration um in terms of your competitive scoring um would PGE benefit demonstrating um collaboration or or cooperative strategy working with um either private parties um perhaps um someone who is proposing to finance the development of a batter battery energy storage system um and then um through a PPA um uh have PGE be the off-taker for use of that that could be for um you know under Blue Sky conditions used for um load shifting and you know reducing the need for uh fossil Fel fuel peers um in the um in the evenings let's say but um through through through further collaboration let's say with the city of tiger wanting to pursue a grid um a micr grid resilience strategy that that best was a p a portion of than have that system be able to if there's a grid outage be islanded and um um support critical infrastructure such as a community resilience Hub um the police uh emergency response Command Center a public works facility so it has a you know has a a benefit under blue skies but in terms of resilience it's um it kicks into high gear a black Skies event okay so um yes is the short answer I mean what I'm imagining is it would be a a PGE project PGE application because they would they're the utility they would be um you know providing the micro grid Services right right in the in the event of A disruption of their um of their grid and so the the improvements are the reduced numbers of customers that are out in A disruption or um reduced amount of time um things like that based on that on that micro grid scenario that is you know connected to PGE um on you know Partnerships are allowed but only one Grant subgrantee or subrecipient of of Odo of us um can receive the funding um you know but they could have agreements or Partnerships and how they distribute that um you know outside of our agreement with with the subgrantee or the subrecipient um you know would be would be under their own rules and in procurement guidelines and things like that you know so we we've seen similar things in the community renewable energy grant program with Partnerships and and Partnerships are certainly allowed the only thing I've seen in the US Department of energy on Partnerships were um a discouraging a small utility and a large utility from partnering because the cost match would end up being the large utility at 100% on the cost match on that kind of a partnership um and so they want um you know they were recommending that if there are Partnerships that they be of like kind you know that that large utilities would partner together or small utilities would partner together great that that all Mak sense um and like clearly PGE would need to be the um the applicant but um I'm just you know reading the the um OA it's pretty um that just a large scale battery storage system you know um in a vacuum isn't isn't eligible but if it were if if it were instead embedded in the context of a of a micro grid and a resilience District um that the city of tiger um wants to pursue and in in obviously in collaboration with PGE since they are the grid provider and would um you know be overseeing um uh uh and and and you know operating um uh this facility certainly under Blue Sky conditions but and having supervisorial control but you know under a black Sky event I mean there need to be delegated or some kind of autonomous control for the micro grid so it could run in Island mode and support uh the critical Community facilities in um within the uh within the resilience District such as that Public Works police facilities resilience Hub out of which the community Emergency Response Team could be operating as well as other um you know loads that are um within the island District but those would be the key ones um uh from the perspective of um you know assuring um that U structures or facilities that are essential to the public welfare and that energy dependent critical Public Services have continuity under a grid outage scenario no absolutely and you know that is a uh a sort of priority criteria for this program and so as they would B PGE customers normally MPG would be involved in this project then those customers are the ones that are benefiting especially the Emergency Services emergency preparedness aspects of it um definitely seem to fit under the guidelines of the program also want to point out the the the community the the community grid resilience grant program which has aspects um specifically for up to a million dollars toward um you have to have some some renewable generation connected to you'd have to have like a solar with the battery backup but that is a standalone project that the city could apply for and get up to a million um for uh solar plus micro grid project um so I would definitely take a look at that program if you haven't already which which program I'm sorry I was distracted for a moment yeah go ahead CL no it's the um Community the community renewable energy program the exactely program yeah we're looking at that as well a question for in that regard and I know that's way off topic so just waved me off but um the expectation in this district is that it will be built out over a series of years and as vertical um facilities or infrastructure are built with that would come rooftop solar carport solar so um the the the the the PV generation will come online over time um and um you know so I think that uh being able to demonstrate the expected full PV um generation upfront isn't realizable because of the incremental nature of the buildout of the district but you you know you got to start somewhere and you need a micro grid you need a large B which could be in the near term um substantially fed in the evening with clean power and then be able to used by PGE under a PPA to do load shifting you know during the daytime to",

be on the recording uh might not be the best space for you um U and our presenter just showed up so I won't Portland traffic um so max I just uh mentioned that we're being reported but uh we're good to go are you presenting let me introduce the team real quick um my name is Tom Cecilia I'm the Hampford hydrogeologist and fuel specialist atono um I'm joined by my assistant director Max woods and our Contracting team Dr Casey stman and Andrew e thanks everybody thanks for bearing with me as a few minutes later uh I live in Portland say no more um so we'll talk about the Oregon energy security plan I know you already know that uh because that's why you're here and so got a brief agenda and I go through tell you what we're going to tell you about and we'll tell you those things and we'll tell you what we told you kind of that typ typical pattern uh we'll talk start a little bit about what the project is um why it matters talk about the timeline the structure of the project methods uh take bre break and then we're going to dive into preliminary results um this will be led by Dr stemman and our team uh Contracting team and kind of see what we're going to get through there next steps talk about the energy strategy which is a separate project that oo has ongoing Michael FRS from our shop has already talk about that a little bit do some Q&amp;A uh and I'd like to say at the beginning uh we're g to make this an interactive time here today an interactive Mee uh we're really looking for feedback we're looking for input from people here from people online uh to talk about sort of give us input on the results that we're going to roll out here um you know you probably sit through in your days many many many PowerPoint presentations someone like me telling you information there's a little bit of that we're also going to make it a little more interactive uh we have a program called slido which you can access on your phones your computers I think we also have some hard copies of the um if you don't want to use your phone or it just feels a little comfortone if you're in the room here we have some hard copies of the document if you're online uh using your computer is a good way to do it it's it's pretty easy on a laptop is a little more tricky on a phone we'll get to that so anyway before we get really diving in let's talk about who we are here you are in the building the Oregon Department of energy thanks for coming or you're online Watching Me Talk um I work for the oron Department of energy about Odo got a couple things here about all the stuff we do um and uh you know the energy security plan that we're leading here fits right into our strategy and Miss so there another sort of wrap up of a wire here share project uh progress discuss risk assessment results led by Dr stman as mentioned and trying to get input on mitigation measures to reduce those risks let say Regional uh you should note that I think Tom mentioned this very beginning this is our L Valley regional meeting um the state we have a map well we got a map somewhere in there uh the state uh We've sort of divided it up into six regions just for purposes of uh sort of cordination on our project uh the regions that we use are also used by the Oregan Department of Emergency Management so it's consistency with other state agency six regions and between last week and this week uh we're going to every one of those regions for a similar meeting like this uh where we'll talk about there's some general information we'll talk about and we'll talk about some specific results for the region here um the L Valley region is Maran County Lane County Lynn County Douglas County hul Hulk Y is that right I think that's the county we have a map we'll show you that map uh there's also a Northwest region Portland metro region Cascades region yesterday you guys were in Bend yesterday talking about the Cascades regions where the part of the state east of the Cascades Eastern region last week Tom and I were in Pendleton uh we were also in till mon last week in Portland and then after this meeting we're driving down to Medford and having a similar meeting so trying to get out across the state the best we oh and on this side oh this is just who we are again so led by Department of energy our Contracting team from CNA and they have a partner with subcontract bu Halen Aldrich and works in um geotechnical analysis in the state or seismic risk seismic hazards hey Al who a leader in the state on that type of engineering and Analysis they' done a lot of work for state government and other partners on seic risk and geotechnical Hazards across the state of which there are many probably know uh Oregon pu staff they're not here today but Oregon Public Utility Commission staff has been involved with us make a note of that and then you we okay we'll talk about why we're doing a state energy security plan and what the contents of that plan have to be so we got two boxes up here in the in the room on the slide sort of the upper right hand corner there the infrastructure investment in jobs act and Oregon Senate Bill 1567 fundamentally we're doing an Oregon energy security plan because it's a good idea we're also doing it because the federal government and the state government told us to do little bit so we're doing um why is it come to the Department of energy it makes sense it's a good fit for us but also because legislation tells us to do this project so we are um the federal legislation from we call the iig infrastructure investment jobs act acted by Congress in 2021 um provides money so this project is funded by federal grants uh to state governments like ourselves to do this work um and it has requirements that the plan has to include these are the six required elements of that plan uh you can read them there I won't read them to you um it's important just for for note uh the federal government says we have to do this all states have to have an energy security plan uh those plans due on September 30th of this year will actually be scored and graded by the US Department of energy our federal counterparts they use a contractor Pacific Northwest National Lab to do that scoring uh we have to have a passing plan in their eyes uh if we don't have a passing plan we get put on the medial track and they can actually withhold further funding from our agency not for just for this project but for other funding that receive so we really incentivized financially from our feds to do this were also incentivized because it's a good idea as I mentioned help out the state well that's about the the Federal Regulation the Senate Oregon Senate um Oregon legislature I should say led by sen Bill 5767 two years ago that was in Spring of 2022 I believe uh passed a bill similarly directing Odo to do the state energy security plan uh and in that bill there were a few additional elements added top of the federal requirements particularly around fuel uh fueling uh infrastructure fueling resilience fueling risk in our state uh liquid fuel shall I say gas diesel jet fuel uh primarily those 3D FS we'll talk about that a little bit here uh and why that matters but just suffice to say the federal um legislation is more high level the state legislation has a little more directive particularly around fuels if anybody Works in this space s SP 1567 is also the bill that directs Oregon DEQ to do their seismic upgrade assessment at Major tanks major fueling tanks uh in Mol county Columbia County Lane County most people think of that as the Portland fuels terminal if you you're familiar with that area which is on seismically risky land that bill also directs DQ to do a siing upgrade and then it directs us to do um a new security plan considering the fuels so little bit of the background here what is the energy security goal uh the blue text is adopted from the federal government that's sort of a standard definition um and then the red and underlined is words that we added in at the state level to acknowledge that price affordability is important and it matters um and you can have all the energy you know Supply available but if it's at a price that people can't really afford that's important consideration that's we talk a little bit later today about mitigation measures and that really is an important consideration that there's all sorts of think we could do the Harden our infrastructure systems um but they can get pretty expensive pretty quickly we have to be realistic about um yeah so there we are so maybe I should mention at the very beginning but we're mostly talking natural hazards to energy infrastructure as well as cyber security and some physical risks um that we'll talk about a little bit as well physical risks you may be familiar with news um the last few years of um individuals actually attacking substations or electrical infrastructure with guns that kind of thing so that's kind of that's in our scope here just got strategy this is kind of uh what we've been Guided by or directed to ourselves to do this plan really this is acknowledgement the top line that there's a lot of information that's already been done around energy security um and energy resilience in the state by other state agencies by mostly by utilities so utilities have done a lot of this work uh as already um and some other state agencies and various organizations so part of our task is to get that information Consolidated into one location and make sure that the state can help our partners uh with information collection that's part of our test and then we also are doing our own analysis based on information and data we collected get that today as well so I just want to make an acknowledgement that a lot of information exists in the street we're not necessarily replicating what uh paic or or nor natural is doing uh for their own resilience and security purposes we're trying to coordinate with them and understand their programs and how we can figure out how so this is what the slide about the fuel sort of before we get into uh some of the details I mentioned about the fueling piece the fuel resilience piece that was added into our",

        "text": " problems when issues come up between a city or in the could be the county and CWS doesn't really talk about SDC waivers and other types of things that's right okay thank you it really comes to dispute resolution with regard to some details of implementing the particulars of the operating agreements yeah correct thank you beyond that we'll hold our questions until we get to next steps yes I have a few more slides thank you chair so the status of our discussions with both cities and I've said this I think to the board in the past most of our time since it started has not been negotiation I want to really want to stress that it's been building relationships uh building understanding between the city staff and CWS staff for why we do what we have to do I think one of the the big lessons that the AHA moments for uh the two City staff is they now have a much better understanding of our permit and how important our permit is to all the work that we do I think Bob and Jamie have done a great job of building that understanding in terms of the Cities they didn't really understand that as much in terms of how important that was and when I was at Sherwood I've said I didn't understand how important the permit was as a city manager in Sherwood until I actually came to CWS and learned how important it really drives everything we do so a lot of time has been building relationships and understanding so we can work cooperatively together these new agreements as you can see on the slide a lot of emphasis on collaboration and coordination together we do this work together it's in and that's an important theme in both discussions we want to enable the cities to set their own standards to align with Community Values so we learned a lot when we talked with Hillsborough the north Hillsborough industrial area that's a priority area for the city of Hillsborough and how do we work together in our work to make sure that that area that important uh Development Area for the City of Hillsboro moves forward on the flip side downtown Beaverton Old Town Beaverton and the constraints of storm water and how do we help Beaverton achieve their Community goals in alternative ways the the idea that one size fits all is not the way we do now we have to be more creative and and provide Alternatives because what needs to happen in downtown Beaverton is very different than what needs to happen in Cooper Mountain especially in the areas of storm water so I think building relationships and understanding what are important for the cities and what they're trying to achieve and how to CWS fit into that and help facilitate that and then lastly that we have joint responsibility for complying with the permit as some of these areas shift more to these bigger cities in terms of taking on responsibilities they are still responsible for permit compliance as well and that's a shift in terms of how we approach our relationships with these cities we're now in the negotiating stage and in terms of language and I want to highlight Bob and Jamie Hughes from our team with both cities really have been spending the last few months negotiating language co-creating language so we're not taking the existing IGA and just amending it we kind of threw it out and starting with a clean fresh piece of paper in terms of co-creating these documents which is taking more time but I think they're going to pay a lot of dividends and these two igas when they're done will become the starting point for our conversations with the other 10 cities in Washington County in terms of our ongoing discussions with them in the anything more on that no in your perspective well next steps we're again uh in the midst of finalizing the the draft agreements I would say Hillsboro we're pretty close to being done talking about things Beaverton we still have some some areas that we're working on in terms of uh as Mark had said uh Hillsborough officials will be here early next month to talk about the Hillsborough experience in the Hillsborough document and then in September Beaverton officials will be here in front of the board to give an update these two igas will not be 100 exactly the same because most cities are different most of the material within the igas will be consistent but there'll be different language to meet the needs of both cities within the the final documents and then once we are done working with you as the board we'll start the process to actually go to the governing bodies uh both at the City of Hillsboro and at the City of Beaverton and ultimately back in front of you as the board to adopt these new igas hopefully by the end of November that's the target so that concludes my brief presentation happy to answer any questions that you might have Commissioners I don't have a question Joe but a comment I I think Clean Water Services has done a great job of improving the communication between the cities I can say when I was mayor during that eight year period of time there wasn't a lot of good communication between the two organizations and there was certainly some misperception as to what exactly you guys do other than charge us a lot of money and there wasn't an understanding of the breadth of the services and the and the need for those things so I I give you kudos for uh improving that communication and that education with the cities and I think that's going to significantly enhance your conversations with these igas so um your good job on improving that thank you I was I was just going to add the communication around the IJ igas is great it's a spillover effect that is equally great and that affects everything that that we do so thank you for your work thank you um chair I don't have any questions just to say you're doing great work and thank you for both of you satisfying my Curious question out there and um I got some comment will be when you do come back to the board I'll be interested to hear what that experience have been for the cities to go through this journey of co-creating this since this has been a long you know it's not a new thing that's happening but you're taking a different approach than normal so I'll be interested to hear what the learning lessons were thank you so in advance of our upcoming work sessions I want to highlight a few different things that I'll be looking for for clarity um first I'm hoping that your presentations will just provide a few success stories because I know they exist and it really goes to the heart of geography and topography matter so I would encourage you to include that great Washington County watershed map that you have with all the different streams in it and if there's a way to also put in the topography on that at the same time some examples that I remember just because I've lived here a long time and I find these things interesting and uh you talked about Beaverton uh it's not just the old town but a slightly larger area Cedar Hills Boulevard used to flood on a regular basis it doesn't anymore because the city and CWS have worked together to make the uh Public Works infrastructure uh improved a Tanner Creek in Hillsboro similar um so um you know and having major weather events in the national news really underscores how times they are changing um we see it and feel it in communities all around and you all have done great work and I have full confidence you will continue to Long After I'm Gone uh second thing I want to ensure that the operating agreements particularly with Hillsboro Beaverton and Tigard denote is flexibility on the geographic areas yes this refers to Urban unincorporated Washington County and when uh in instances of development applications coming up provisions of servicing annexing into City the answer needs to always be yes of course and the operating agreements need to reflect that and assure that those darned emergencies right especially natural hazards so uh those are times especially when things get really intense and uh I know while I've been on the commission we've had many of them but not the full range of them and observing how City councils change over time I want future County commissions Board of Directors for clean water services and City councils to be assured that we have Clarity of role and uh the spirit of collaboration and cooperation so when natural hazards like heat fire floods and Public Health which we've had all of but there's the last one darned human activity I think we've been really fortunate we've heard about the electrical grid elsewhere in the nation being under threat uh were I think very fortunate that we haven't had the extent of that in our but just to reinforce so um you've been doing great work and I look forward to learning more with seeing those draft documents uh with the work sessions and um and going from there so keep up the good work oh uh uh you oh sorry there was one more thing built you've built the understanding of the importance of the permit so in that presentation uh if he could also just have some information about what is it about that that Reliance that um codependency for a a healthy Community healthy Watershed uh for the importance of the permit I think that that will be helpful as well thank you chair so sure thank you very much I I that's last point is a really good one to I want to point out is we've had these intergovernmental agreements in place for 33 years and this go around the role of Regulatory Affairs and particularly of Bob and of Jamie Hughes has been really elevated because that is a big part of it as we look at how do we look at joint compliance I mean I I know we joke sometimes that Diane's the jailable official right yep um under our permit and it's a joke but it's not a joke yeah that's exactly true so how do we share that joint compliance responsibility and it's a responsibility cities have to take on very seriously and I think Bob and Jamie have just done having them lead a lot of this has been it's less about operation I mean it is about operational but the importance of that compliance piece has been really good and that's I want to thank both these two as well as Jamie for leading that work yeah I've told our staff and I've told our city officials we're going to have a brand new IGA which hopefully will be clearer and provide more clarity but the reality is the benefit the long-term benefit is we've built a on a day-to-day week week month-to-month basis that we're working together rowing in the same direction versus as",

        "text": " those electricity systems with your electric provider uh you may even think about um helping with training on I mentioned cyber security maybe it's training County staff or energy companies with increased Advanced uh training on cyber security risk uh so that could be a res I uh effort as well so um that's kind of the opening setting the stage I wanted to give I'm going to pass it back now to Hannah and she will dive into some of the program details thanks thanks so much Max I had to get myself back off mute there um yeah I really appreciate that so um now we have some context for Community energy resilience what that can look like connections to larger State work in terms of um Oregon's overall energy security and resilience so we're going to dive into the nitty-gritty of the county energy resilience grant program so I think as probably most of you are aware at this point this program provides up to $50,000 per Oregon County to develop an energy resilience plan um as Max mentioned this program um was part of House Bill 3630 that passed in the 2023 legislative session um and really the goal of these plans are to increase count communities energy resilience so um ability to uh have critical Public Services function during non- routine disruptions to Energy Systems larger Energy Systems in terms of Eligibility this program is open to all 36 counties in Oregon um and the other eligibility requirement is that a county does not have an existing plan meeting the requirements of House Bill 3630 for that plan content we're about to go over what that those requirements are so if you don't know yet don't worry we'll we'll cover that in depth um but if your county has an existing energy plan or energy resilience plan more than likely you'll be able to access this funding to update that plan in line with these requirements um we just ask that you reach out so we can talk about it uh um importantly this is a non-competitive grant program um and there is not a match component match funding requirement for accessing this program uh the application window opened on May 22nd of this year and it'll be open through February 28th 2025 of next year uh our program deadline is August 1st 2025 so now we're going to dive into these plan requirements the requirements for plan content are stipulated they are laid out in House Bill 3630 um but we wanted to spend some time to make sure you know it's clear what we're talking about when we're talking about the plan content and requirements so the first requirement for energy resilience plans produced under this program is that they be based on and plan for short-term medium-term and long-term power outages uh next is that they identify and map existing energy infrastructure in the county so this includes transmission lines distribution lines substations and energy storage systems um identify and map natural Hazard risks as well as communities that experience social vulnerability and this term social vulnerability if it if it's not top of mind for you um it refers to a group or a community's resilience in the face of external stressors be that a disaster an energy disruption um and it's a measure comprised of a variety of factors that uh can increase vulnerability right so um age housing type vehicle access level of proficiency with English things like that it's a comprise this measure so the next requirement is that counties consult with representatives from in environmental justice communities to identify and map those socially vulnerable communities uh plans need to identify potential locations for Community resilience centers and communication zones that the public can access during a power outage and so what do we mean by Community resilience Center or communication Zone um these would be places where residents could go to access Emergency Services during an energy disruption or disaster another emergency um and particular to energy this would include things like charging stations heating cooling air filtration things of that nature for communication um certainly charging for mobile phones there might be additional emergency res resources in these spaces um as well and counties must use locations of communities that experience social vulnerabilities to prioritize potential locations for these Community resilience centers communication Zone plans need to in inventory the energy consumption needs of critical Public Services facilities and this term critical Public Services facilities is defined in House Bill 3630 so that's things hospitals uh law enforcement Public Works Emergency Response communication Fuel and fueling um and that those are specifically laid out as code if we can okay um so plans also need to identify critical Public Services facilities where the development of alternate energy generation and storage resources will meet local energy resilience needs um and you know this photo shows this image shows um wind power solar power but that could also look like generators it could look like um more fuel storage you know it's it's really County driven to figure out what works for for your County's needs let me go back over here um plans need to identify opportunities to coordinate and locate energy infrastructure development to align with and support critical Public Services facilities identify time schedules priorities and potential funding sources for developing energy resilience and identify other actions and resources needed to implement the energy resilience plan so you can see with these last two bullets um these plans are really pushing towards implementation the goal is to do this really great planning and also start thinking through how these projects can come to your county come to your communities and make them more resilient um these are the the plan requirements that are laid out in statute and you know truly they're they're pretty Broad and within that there's a lot of room for you to use these plans as a tool to um meet your your local community your County's needs and your aligned goals around Energy emergency preparedness Economic Development and we really really encourage that um Beyond meeting requirements in terms of the application process um our applications are up and available on our program website and at some point we will make sure that we drop a link to our program page in the chat I know I've sent it out over email but just want to make sure that you get it again here and it'll be up on a slide um if you haven't you know taken a look at our applications I definitely encourage you to we have one for um individual counties that are applying just for their County as well as for cohorts or counties that choose to work together and I will go over the cohort option for the program in more depth in a moment um but we really aim to keep these application simple brief or you know getting the key information that we need but we don't want applying to be a burden um Beyond just getting that information that we need so they fillable PDFs they're up on the website um once you submit your application we'll get give it a review for completeness and eligibility if we have any questions we'll follow up directly with you um and then applications should be submitted to our program email we'll use this program email for formal Communications around um the application performance agreements and um reporting forms things of that nature so other program requirements to highlight here um we will do a funds dispersement uh one time upfront following following a performance agreement so our goal with this is it's not a cost reimbursement program we really want to get funds out into your communities so that um into your county so that you can access them to get your plan um going and not have that be a concern um that you have the funds there when you need them uh we can do funds dispersements directly to technical assistance providers if if desired um but we'll require a little bit more information and that's laid out pretty clearly in our application and performance agreement for uh eligible uses of funds include um paying for County staff time to work on the plans hiring a technical assistance provider or providers um Outreach travel needed and then we have another category if you think you're going to access funds and other just reach out to us and we can talk through what that looks like those um costs need to be necessary for development we will have two um interim reports during the program lifespan one due end of October 2024 one due end of 2025 um and the goal with these reports is again not to be arduous as just what what have you completed on your plan so far what are your next goals and are you encountering any challenges are there any areas that we can support you to uh work through those challenges uh the deliverable is a copy of your completed plan and your program completion form due by our program deadline August 1st 2025 um the program completion form uh is essentially the major components are self attestation that you met all those requirement plan content requirements um as well as just asking you know how did you use the funds which categories approximate amount in each um we have built built in a bit of flexibility into our program structure uh in regards to this deadline and that's laid out in our application um in our faq's document but I'm also happy to walk through it with anyone if if you have questions about it um so the other the final program requirement here is that these plans should then formally once complete should be formally adopted by counties by each County and then incorporated into your County's natural Hazard mitigation plan um this is in house bill 3630 however we're not requiring that this be done by the August 1st 2025 programmatic deadline um we understand that County adoption processes require public proc process that might take some extra time and that natural Hazard mitigation planning processes are on their own 5year cycle with OEM and FEMA so if your County's just completed their Hazard mitigation Plan update um you know you can work in the incorporation of this plan into your next round of revisions down the line so the cohort option that I mentioned um in this program uh counties can work together and pull their funds to produce a multi-county energy resilience plan we don't have a minimum or maximum size limit or requirement for cohorts um if counties choose to work together in cohorts um the cohort needs to identify a lead County and so this county is going to be responsible for completing the program processes and paperwork on behalf of the cohort um they'll receive the funds Distribution on behalf of the cohort and they'll also be the respons they'll be responsible for upholding the program requ requirements on behalf of the cohort um so if you work in a cohort we have a cohort specific application um we'll ask for information on each of the counties in the cohort and ask each of the counties to sign the application but once we move through into the performance agreement process that will be done with the lead County who",

        "text": " of customers on it interesting good um Steve can you skip this Slide Five um I think I'm on Slide Five actually oh you customer pricing yeah you are great um like I said Steve just will intuitively know where where to go except when he get gets the wrong screen up yeah that was that was um it just showed some of my political ignorance um okay so you know this is showing you sort of with words what this is going to cost and I want to be really clear about what we're asking communities to pay for we are not asking communities to pay for every cent of what a new resource is going to cost we are just going to ask communities to pay for what percentage of that new resource is above what pge's cost would be otherwise so you can sort of think of us as having a baseline cost which um all customers are going to pay and then the increment above it is what residential and small commercial customers in the City of Salem or anywhere else would pay um so Steve let's go to uh slide seven I think that's the the cleanest pictorial example of um so that that chart on the right shows this with um it's a bar graph basically so you're going to want to know how we figure out what pge's cost would be without this program answer is it's a forecast um so in our integrated resource plan or our clean energy plan which was recently acknowledged by the Pu um we have a forecast for what energy is going to cost and what capacity is going to cost and and collectively that's pretty much what it costs to customers energy is the total amount of megawatt hours that we're going to need to sell to all of our customers and the capacity is the ability ability to meet instantaneously um you know historically it's something we've done by turning on our gas plants as we look into the future it's something we're planning on doing with batteries for example um so that amount and again this is just ballpark numbers or not even ballpark they're just indicative numbers um or demonstrative I guess um you know if we say that's going to cost $60 per megawatt hour um but then you all are choosing resources that collectively cost $90 per hour people in Salem are going to be on the hook for only that $30 this is the hardest thing to explain in this program so I'm just going to be quiet for several minutes while you all think about this and ask me can you repeat that last line one more time please so if pge's forecast for serving all customers over the next 15 to 20 years is $60 per megawatt hour and Salem is signing a contract or having PGE sign a contract on Salem's behalf that cost $90 per megawatt hour we are only going to ask people in Salem to pay on an incremental basis that $30 between 60 and 90 because that first 60 from 0 to 60 is a benefit to all PGE customers because we needed to do that anyway it's that last 30 bucks from 60 to 90 that we didn't need to do so that means but everyone pays the first 60 correct for Salem residents and your example would still be $90 yes but in terms of like you know if if if there's going to be a line on your bill that says you know Salem Community green tariff or whatever you want to call it it's only going to show that $30 divided by whatever number you're going to divide it by so are is there any thought to any of these projects like like grouping like let's say Salem Milwaukee and Portland all decided to sign in I'm ass sign on to this I'm assuming that there are efficiencies that are created by bigger projects is there any way that we're going to capture that efficiency and cost savings by grouping these together does that make sense uh potentially yeah I I definitely think that's a a conversation worth having uh both um just between different local governments um and then also with p as well once we're at that um uh participation agreement stage you know where we are right now and I'll get to that in a minute where we are right now is getting approval at the commission for this overall tariff to enable all of this to happen um but then yes once we get to a spot where communities are thinking very seriously about doing this um I absolutely think it would make sense for um communities to work together to try to get you know a better deal more or less thank you are there any questions about this are people comfortable with this concept so far conceptually yeah get it I didn't mean I wasn't asking weigh you like I vote Yes right now sorry I just me are we are we at kind of an understanding level where we're ready to on yeah I'm seeing a lot of nods so I think I think where're your pause was effective so we're ready to move okay great um Steve you want to go slide eight so that there are um a lot of I would say some open questions and then some logical questions where there are answers already either because PGE has made a policy decision or more cases where the law just is very clear on what we can and cannot do um the the biggest thing to highlight is that this is a program that a local government is choosing it's not a PGE program it's a City of Salem program um we of course Partners in that and designing the program um and explaining to our customers because they are and will remain our customers how it works um but communities will have significant control over the program design resource selection and therefore cost um so it's going to be first and foremost the responsibility of local governments to explain those benefits to their residents um and also to sort of you know be politically accountable for What's Done um because at the end of the day you know a city council will be voting to increase costs on utility bills um for everybody for small commercial and residential customers in the City of Salem OR or whichever municipality we're about um the other thing to to to clarify is that um whatever amount of energy we decide collectively you need to meet your climate goals that doesn't decline over time even as PGE system gets cleaner and um that's simply because there's no way to sign a long-term contract for you know a new Wind Facility for example that says you know we need 50 Mega today and only 5 megawatts in 2038 that that sort of contract doesn't exist um and even if we could make it exist it would be prohibitively expensive because of risk allocation issues um so it's going to be really important to Define upfront what you need and that's in large degree based on you know when those climate goals kick in um that's a discussion we can have at a later time but you know sizing the program appropriately is going to be really important to um meet goals at a cost that is you know as low as um you know and then also I want to mention about how how we are looking at this in terms of um helping out customers that are um that have lower incomes I hope you're all aware that PGE has an income qualified Bill discount program that can reduce bills by up to 60% um for our lowest income customers but then by other percentages I think from 10 to 60% depending on income um this program is designed to say that customers that qualify for iqb income qualifi built discount will not pay more because of this everybody else in the community though will pay um you know their amount their percentage of the bill basically um I don't know what that's going to be because I don't know what percentage of s on customers qualify for iqb um but I believe that that was um in the law um as but it's also something we think is fair important because we know that utility bills are a significant burden for a lot of customers and we want to make sure that um programs like this don't increase their bills even further so if I could back up for just a moment not not about the income qualified customers but what you said earlier about uh whose program this would be it it I'm not sure you intended it but I how I heard this is if you want to do this uh you're on your own it's your program good luck that's how I heard it and that doesn't feel like a partnership and that doesn't feel like something that we're interested and I mean we're not experts on energy and and this sort of thing um and so it I I'm not sure if that was your intended message that's kind of how it came across to me and I'm not sure that you're going to get any jurisdiction particularly interested if they if they're going to have to take this on themselves I mean so I'm wondering if I did I misunderstand you or is that really where what your what PG's position is like this is just something you're offering as an enhancement that we might choose or uh you're really entering into a partnership with us that's a really I I appreciate that opportunity to clarify that and I I don't know if if I misspoke or if if there was a misunderstanding but I'll just say if that's the message that I communicated then I did a bad job um because this is a partnership um we really value our relationships with the communities that we serve and if anybody if any city or county in our service area chooses to go down this path we will be there to help make good decisions what I'm what I really want to communicate though is that um if Salem OR Portland OR Milwaukee or any other community chooses to do this it's the community choosing to do this PGE will absolutely support you as you make decisions you know even like in the Tariff that we've drafted um we say very clearly that there will be a PGE Steve what's the word we use representative I think um somebody that can sort of serve as a consultant to help you um understand the issues that you're facing um we will be there the whole time my message is just that like you know this is a decision that only a local community to make um and we will support the communities that we serve regardless of the decision that we make you know if if you say no then we will continue to be the partner that we have been for very for many many years and if you say yes then we will absolutely be partners to um make this program successful thank you are there other questions about five or six questions but",

the um and materials for today's hearing including Draft rules are located on the Oregon Department of Energy's website energy just a few words about using WebEx for those who are new to the platform uh you can use the raise hand function to ask ask a question and use the chat function to tag questions um for those on the phone you can use the uh sta three to raise your hand um and I think the kind of raise hand function might look a little differently um depending on what platform you're but hopefully it's recognizable does anybody have any questions about using WebEx before we begin begin you can either raise your hand up up in the the chat if you do get started um so this hearing is being recorded to maintain a permanent record uh today is December 18th 2023 the time is approximately 3:07 p.m. the public hearing is being held online and all attendees are remotely this is the time and date set for the public rulemaking hearing uh the purpose is to take public comments on proposed permanent rules which would amend the Oregon solar Plus Storage rebate program uh the filing caption for this rule making is Oregon solar Plus Storage rebre program so brief summary of the proposed amendments to the rules um the 2023 House Bill 3409 amended the definition of a paired solar and storage system to allow greater flexibility for solar contractors participating in the Oregon solar storage rebate program the proposed rule amendments align the rule definitions with this language change change um Odo is also proposing allowing contractors to split the payment of a paired solar and storage rebate into two one payment for completion of the solar portion of the installation and one payment for completion of the storage portion of the rebate the proposed amendments outline that a reservation where the rebate payment is being split does not change to a rebate request until the total rebate amount has been requested meaning the reservation would still count towards the contractor's reservation count until the full rebate amount has been requested um the rules also detail information required when a rebate payment is requested to be split uh another amendment uh being proposed is the reduction in the rate at which a rebate is calculated for those residential customers who are not eligible for utility incentive and do not qualify as low or moderate income um that changes from 50 cents per watt DC to 30 cents per watt DC are the proposed amendments include increasing the number of reservations for low and moderate income customers and low income service providers any one contractor can have at a time from 20 to and uh another proposed amendment is uh extending the time a reservation for low-income service provider can be extended by by an additional six months um other amendments included in the draft language are being made to provide clar uh Clarity to the rules such as removing old dates from uh the section relating to how Odo will make funds available um or to correct reference es in the rules so the Oregon Department of energy appreciates the information and feedback the stakeholders have provided through the rulemaking process um a notice for today's hearing was filed with the Oregon Secretary of State on November 2nd 2023 and published in the December 2023 Oregon bulletin uh this hearing will be conducted according to the Oregon administr administrative procedures act uh or ORS chapter 183 and the Attorney General's model rules in addition to the opportunity to present oral comments this hearing anyone May submit written comments by email or mail until 5:00 p.m. December 22nd 2023 which is the close of the public comment period for everyone comments received after this date will not be reviewed or considered by the department unless the department decides to extend the public comment period for everyone after the close of the comment period the Oregon Department of energy will review issues raised during the public comment period and prepare a hearing officer's report the Oregon Department of energy will make the ultimate decision regarding these rules um if anyone's joined since the beginning and hasn't introduced themselves um I'd like to ask you to please state your name Affiliated organization and whether you wish to offer comments during the the rule hearing and then we'll move into the testimony from participants so I stated earlier this hearing is being recorded to maintain a record before you begin your testimony please state your name and affiliation with uh an organization if any um when you introduce yourself um if you happen to have written statements you can email them um to me so it can be made part of the record my email is on on the slide it's james. cogal energy. oregon.gov are there any questions before we begin uh you can raise your hand or pop them in the chat okay so um we'll begin in the public comment section now uh currently I see Angela Crowley um say that she would like to make comments um those have introduced in the chat um thank you for putting your names there if you do wish provide comments please just pop that in as well otherwise um yeah uh it'd be great if you could just indicate if whether you want to provide comments so that we make sure that we can uh get you unmuted to so you can provide those um so we'll start receiving the public comments now um if Patricia you could unmute uh Angela that would be great this is Angela Crowley cook Angela hi the executive director of AA the Oregon solar Plus Storage Industries Association I'm not sure how to turn on my camera or if you want me to but don't know how yeah we can't uh see your video so uh audio is good okay great well thank you for having this hearing and spending time with stakeholders and oia putting together the Draft rules oia is in general in support of the rules the Draft rules um we appreciate that the language has been updated to allow storage and solar uh solar and storage to be purchased together but installed separately and give uh the rules give good guidance about how to claim those rebate payments uh we're very supportive of reducing the rebate rate for systems not eligible for another utility incentive from 50 cents for watt to 30 cents um we also we we appreciate all the other clarifications and the additional extension provided for low-income service providers and then lastly I'll talk about the the change to the cap we do appreciate the cap being changed for low income service providers and low and moderate income residential projects from 20 projects to 25 I will say that there are at least two oan members who have a different view um who would like to eliminate caps completely um that's the majority of ocm members prefer to keep some sort of cap and so uh you may be seeing comments from other ocm members before the comment deadline that reflect another position um a request to remove the Caps entirely I wanted to make sure that you're aware that um there's not 100% agreement and that more comments might be coming um but in general we think increasing the cap on the low and moderate income and low income service provider projects up to 25 is a good idea because we hope to see more funding coming from the federal solar for all Grant into Oregon with a focus on lowincome solar projects and potentially storage projects too um that's all of my comments on behalf of oia and I'm happy to answer any questions or just pass the Baton to the next person thanks thank you Angela appreciate your comments I we go on to larara was this uh what from an Sol um Nicole uh just you haven't put in the chat whether you'd like to um provide comments if you want to just indicate whether you do that would be great um but yeah we'll take comments from Lara now yes thank you James thank you everyone hosting um I just wanted to Echo and um yes us to at an anr solar um echoing Angela and oia's statement um we uh support any attempts to lower the rebate amount in the hopes that it extends the money as long as possible to as many oregonians as possible we want a rebate program that's stable and durable with less dramatic Cliff events where the money Runs Out quickly um and we uh we hope for a rebate program that's designed to be durable and transparent um and and very much appreciate all the the changes that have been made and um thank you thank you Lara appreciate your and thanks Nicole for mentioning that you have no additional comments um so we do have a Callin user on the line um want to make sure we give them the opportunity to State whether they um want to provide comments or not P sure you able to unmute",

that the city passed at the same time as the ugb proposal and is not yet approved by lcdc expressed concern that North Plains has an existing lack of affordable housing homes in the city's newest development start at 45,000 and single family detached housing increased from 84% in 2000 to 8 8% the plan would reduce this by only 4% this housing type is the least affordable most expensive to service and most wasteful of land the city's justification for growth is to increase tax revenue but that is not a land use criteria for your decision and it's unclear how industries that receive tax breaks and expensive disservice homes will add net revenue poorly planned development got North Plains into a deficit and will not get it out lastly the city obstructed public comment after improper for notice and validated their first vote the city claimed the first decision was Final and that public could only comment on amendments they also call this estat mandated expansion when the city is only required to plan not to grow at this scale or location the city says most opposition comes from outside the city but most support comes from outside the city land owners who want to get rich in developers most North Plains residents I've spoken to hadn't heard of the expansion and many farmers who rent land near town won't testify for fear their landlords will cancer the leases for these reasons please vote no thank you you my name is Roy van Raiden I live at uh 2095 Northwest Rock Creek Boulevard billsboro uh I support ordinance uh 899 um I believe that the city has um done a complete and fair and uh comprehensive process as required by um yeah that's all I've got to say thank you thank you thank you very much next James and Jackie James Fay Jackie Dyke Jones following we have Larry Dyke and benach uh good good evening uh chair Lockwood and Commissioners uh my name is Jackie Dyke Jones I'm a fourth generation farmer I live uh off Roy Road in Banks and I'm a steward of the land not only banks but in North plains and Roy I am refreshed and hopeful tonight after experiencing a an Engaged and productive conversation among a Planning Commission I'm also co-owner of dyke Family Farm LLC and we Farm one field over from the West sub area of The Proposal as a farmer we provide carbon capturing safe and nutritious food and fiber for oregonians and Beyond I am strongly opposed to ordinance 899 I'm going to uh read a statistic from the Oregon Department of Agriculture a statistics directory PDF in support of my um uh as support for Oregon agriculture Oregon agriculture directly and indirectly 686,000 Jobs 29.71 billion in wages 12.12 billion in taxes and 2.85 billion in exports to the state there are approximately one farmer Ranch for every 112 people in Oregon but that small percentage is an essential con contributor to the state's economy the highest class soils should never never be handled as simply disposable or Lego pieces farmland farmland is finite and must be protected as well as the supportive infrastructures for the industry success and sustain sustainability it is not by accident that oregonians have been working to keep our state beautiful and bountiful for example in all the presentation slide decks the pictures it's about agriculture every single one I checked Washington County has among the most fertile lands i p passionately believe that it is wrong to destroy Farmland especially when there are 18,000 Acres currently in the metro ugbs in the region Q for provide providing thriving and healthy livable communities in in uh mentioning healthy thriving uh livable communities this topic of grocery stores keep coming up there's one in the Q and North Plains in the urban growth boundary so there's so much being talked about there's like a sense of like threats and fears going on it's really misleading and of course the land owners are willing to sell for millions of dollars and I think that Washington county is in a position to show dedication to preserving our finite resources for generations to come their aggro business is an economic driver not only in Washington County but the state of Oregon if Washington County has 25% of efu lands now and if it's potentially half of 1% I need to check that um Farmland being taken out just wait until which legislative session until North Plains goes and gets someone to say the next bill to expand the urban growth boundary again this is shortsighted um excuse me your your time is up thank you um please be a steward of the land with your North Plains Washington County Oregon farmers thank you hi hi my name is James Fage I live in 31806 northwest Belgium Court in North L Oregon I live there since 2013 um you guys are are planning Commissioners I found a need to uh serve the community so I was a planning Commissioner of for North Plains for a few years and then I became City Council on my second term a little bit of about when I first DED airplanes my daughter was five and uh we didn't know anybody we're strangers in a Strange Land so I told my wife hey let's have a really big birthday party for my daughter let's go all out this way our friends come over and their parents can say oh these guys are cool let's be their friends so I did that and uh how while I was there the mothers were uh lamenting that they had to go to the store they had to drive 20 minutes to go to the store and then drive back again for milk or whatever they're going for medicine there's nothing in a planes that is that is uh sustainable kids who have teenagers or sorry parents have teenagers kids have to drive to Hillsboro they have to drive at night or whenever to go find a small part-time job to learn to be on time to work and wear uniforms and you know do those first job things North plains as it is is not sustainable there has been some building going on but the way things happen is they do a little bit of time tiny tiny bits and that happens what leads to small places is houses so now we have a tax basis for North plains that is just income tax from the houses and that's not sustainable because taxes are limited by a small amount per year that that could go up while the employees make more and more money there needs to be businesses in North planes in order to have a North ples be able to survive without becoming a I don't know a welfare state there has to be that expansion the size of this is adequate it exactly what we need according to all the studies we had and also gives a chance to plan things as a whole not Legos or pieces of the puzzle at a time we get to have a big swath of something to plan and build accordingly and I just want to come here and uh share that with you guys thanks thank you thank you Larry Dyke and Dave Van Nash next then David Santoro and Katie Miller good evening chair Lockwood my name is Larry Dyke I reside at 34203 Northwest mountaindale Road in North plains I bought the 107 Acre Farm that I live on in 1981 42 years ago this farm that I bought for $33,000 an acre then today as a farm it's worth $10 $15,000 but for development for industrial use for data centers chip centers this 10 to1 15,000 an acre land is now worth $600 to a million dollar an acre so consequently 100 acres could be million do you understand why North Plains has had such good luck and talking to all the farmers around there they are more than willing to sell I'm not I'm opposed to North Plains I'm a farmer I'm sure most of you has seen or are watching the show Yellowstone the series Yellowstone if you realize it or not that series could be nor North Plains it's about land use that's what Yellowstone is about it's about protecting the land saving the land from development from casinos from ski resorts we want to save our land here too de developers and speculators are pushing their agenda the chairman of North Plane planning commission's a realtor the mayor's husband's a realtor the city council proposes bringing in to the ugb 855 Acres more than doubling the town in size as one of the people involved in the grand bargain Dave and I both were 2014 North Plains had a seat at that table for the Washington County um rural urban Reserve Coordinating Board the mayor of North Plains was on that with us and he had one vote Dave and I had to split one vote a got one vote out of 15 cities that all had their Mayors or Representatives on the Coordinating Committee North Plains their mayor picked he wanted to go north south east and west all four directions well in the grand bargain the grand bargain shut down the door to go south so consequently the land that you see it was where North Plains didn't know where they exactly wanted to grow but they um reserved the chance of going directions City officials North Plains have claimed the undesignated land around North plains as theirs This Is A Lie North Plains is not entitled to any land they can't justify or the residents of North Plains um vote to anx excuse me your time is up my name is Dave vanash I reside at 36130 Northwest Ren Road cornelus Oregon uh thank you commission for allowing us to testify Larry pretty well said it all uh we got involved in the Metro Urban Reserve process I think I was on the Coordinating Committee in 2008 so that went on for six years and like he said uh there were two farmers on that committee out of 15 cities there was two of us we got one vote every time we voted it was 15 to one we lost but we did eventually appeal and we won the appeal and uh the grand bargain was created because of that uh you've got my letter I think I hope you all read this um I just got a few things to add um those fingers that uh the chair asked about those are swales the land out here is rolling once once in a while there's a creek or a drainage ditch but most of the time we farm that and it's class one through four soil and sometimes class four in in",

Orsa project since it began the partner here with me today Kim Peters she'll she'll speak to the Navy aspects of this but uh just just From omd's perspective this has been a a very exciting opportunity to work on a needed Endeavor of the intersection between renewable energy and military training in Oregon and I think this tool is really bringing together a much cleaner situational Awareness on the military equities in Oregon some of our needs and and certainly bringing the conversation together about uh our needs as well as the renewable development in our area that very excited to see this thing progressing and there's been a lot of hard work and has really been a a privilege to to work on on this project yeah thank you Todd for the introduction and uh hello everyone my name is Kim Peter I'm the Northwest training range Complex Community planning and liaison officer uh bottom line is I work for the Navy uh the other hat that I wear is the Northwest Department of Defense Regional coordination team lead that brings together all of the services in Oregon Washington to be more cohesive and unified as we work on various challenges and initiatives so this uh Grant has been a great opportunity for us to fund a a proactive measure to really look at the sighting of renewable energy and transmission as it relates to the military and look about how we can kind of preemptively address any potential conflicts or challenges as renewable energy moves forward and as we look to sustain the critical training testing operating areas both on and offshore for the military so really this grant has allowed us that opportunity to facilitate additional transparency about where we operate as well as bring in additional parties and stakeholders to further Implement coordination so again couldn't emphasize early notification of coordination and the benefits that this tool has brought for us in trying to find that win-win-win between the military Economic Development you know streamlining proposals and moving forward with green energy and I'll pass it back to Todd yeah everything that Kim has brought forward has really been important to us as well starting from Little information that was available Consolidated information about what military equities we have in Oregon and and where it intersects with renewable energy this tool really brings together that uh that awareness and and starts the conversation with when it should when it should be at the beginning of a of a project and we're very excited to see that uh that happening in the engagements that uh we have from a DOD perspective uh here in Oregon thank you yeah we look forward to that continued implementation of this tool and fostering relationships and identifying conflicts early on to uh you know work through those as much as possible so happy to work with you all look forward to continuing to work with the State team both tlcd and Odo and appreciate the opportunity um to work on such an initiative thank and everybody I'm John Jennings I'm the community services specialist the department of land conservation Development I've been fortunate uh to be in a position to assist with the coordinable energy starting assessment project had been a co-lead for dlcd on that um our agency has been interested in this project and in a couple of ways and for for quite a while uh one we've had uh contact with the military uh and their concerns about preserving airspace and and being able to complete their mission uh and and types of operations in Oregon as well as the siding of renewable energy projects you know our administrative Rules promulgated by lcdc I have a role in determining how and when uh projects like solar and wind can be established and there's a growing interest in that and this project has really helped us learn more about the landscape and learn more about where things are and aren't uh obviously we haven't tried to identify the locations that should be or shouldn't be developed but we're hoping that the this information will help uh policy makers and decision makers make some informed choices I mean I think that the information we've gathered here um that has been enriched and benefited by speaking with our local planning community and a broad host of of other interested parties um we'll we'll help things out um you know we're planning uh directors have have frequently said yeah this is really good information this should help us understand uh the types of things going on uh energy developers have said you know this will help us in our prospecting um that is you know being able to identify early um the types of things out there in the landscape to look out for this high value farmland or uh sensitive species uh and then also who to contact uh that might have an interest like uh uh counties obviously the military and so um I guess that's what we see is our our primary benefit is that again helping us understand what's going on out there um you know our role in in the project is helping to facilitate one of the three assessments the natural resources environmental constraints and opportunities assessments I don't think I got that name quite right but but that's what it was um again it's helped I think move this issue forward it will help our commission and others they can form decisions about uh renewable energy policy as we move forward to help secure a clean energy future for Oregon hello everyone my name is Andrew L near I'm the Marine Affairs coordinator for the Department of land conservation and it's been my pleasure to be a project advisor for the Oregon renewable energy citing assessment project my role has been to help the project team understand complex and sometimes quick moving policy landscape associated with the development of offshore marine renewable in particular the project looked at both Marine hydrokinetic energy or wave as well as offshore wind energy and the state has had a long history in the development of ocean policy and policy associated with Marine renewable energy with the passage of part five of the territorial C plan which addressed within state waters the state's policies and priority preferences for development of marine hydrokinetic energy in particular this project had a potential Nexus with uh use of the water or air space out in the ocean either within statewaters or Beyond state and the Department of Defense has been a great partner in that effort promoting early communication and coordination as potential project ideas and potential project locations have been identified out in the ocean probably the the most significant amount of energy for offshore energy development was associated with the identification of the potential for offshore wind energy development this would be floating officer wind out in the outer continental shelf and that process is really a federal lead process by the Bureau of bush and energy management and as such I was a bridge between the activities and the efforts Associated and being led by the bureau with then state agency involvement specifically this project focused mainly on above ground level impacts to the Department of Defense activities and out in the ocean that's really talking about airspace above the water we did not have the scope and time as a part of this project for the military to undertake an assessment that would describe on water or underwater activities in a way that would not jeopardize National Security but we enhanced early communication and coordination message points associated with the process that the Bureau of ocean energy management is leading so uh as a project advisor on the arrested project team I worked to ensure that data and information that was gathered as a part of the bureau's data Gathering and engagement process was organized and provided to the arrested project and vice versa that data Gathering and organizations conducted by our Consultants conservation Biology Institute was the organization that helped lead that component of the project for for us and they did a great job at identifying resources information resources both on the natural resources but as well as the human uses out in the outer continental shelf of Oregon's ocean that being said the component of our project where we worked on the development of our aressa citing tool we limited the scope of what we were trying to address in offshore wind because of the challenges of that kind of fast-moving data availability in data um in that way the arrested tool when open up and and work to generate a citing report actually provides a relatively limited set of data on the return from an inquiry used by the tool for those users interested in viewing a more comprehensive set of information related to planning for offshore wind on the outer continental shelf I would direct your attention in um a user to go explore the aura wind map tool which is available at offshore this was a tool that was built in partnership with the West Coast ocean data portal in support of the Bureau of ocean Energy Management in the state of Oregon as they supported the intergovernmental task force on Marine renewable energy as uh previously mentioned offshore wind is a very different type of citing process from what the state is has experience with and that the outer continental shelf lands off of Oregon are uh owned and and leased by the federal agency the Bureau of ocean energy management and as such the state has a review Authority only through the implementation of the state's Federal coastal zone management act uh Federal consistency review Authority but the arrested project together with the aura wind map tool can provide a user with an understanding about the potential conflicts or the potential benefits of a new Marine renewable energy use out in the outer continental shelf of Oregon so hello I'm Wally Adams I work for the Oregon Department of energy and I was the lead for the citing procedures part of the Orissa project that's what I'm going to be talking about today um I think it's fair to say that facility citing procedures for renewable energy facilities can be confusing you get local jurisdictions involved the state gets involved at times federal government can be involved the military even so that was really the purpose of putting together this procedures report is to try to provide an overview of of those procedures at the different levels really what are the processes what are the requirements um and and to help Point people in the right direction to get more information so kind of leave a breadcrumb trail so if you are developing a project you can get some information from this procedures report you can get more and more detailed information from those jurisdictions directly um and the use cases that we had in mind for this the primary use case is really for a developer someone who's looking to develop a renewable energy project but you know it could also be useful for a member of the public who's trying to figure out how to navigate this world maybe they have a project that's in their area that they're interested in even for people who work at agencies um you know if you're not in the",

a proposal for these areas and they're they're getting so bunched together that I don't see why they can't be more spread out and share this burden with other communities thank you sir yep and for the record Mr Cooper was referring to a map that is part of our constituent communication that was developed from a Community who's next clerk Moss all right uh last call for Steve Park Isla Hoffer and then Monica Anthony as my friend here what's your name sir Steve Parker thank you I live on 207th and so does Craig and your arrow points right on our street now I'm wondering if 207th is going to

developed by a Community member yes this is not this is not Washington County provided information that you're asking questions on it's not Washington County's material uh okay so you're who's proposing these and where are these pods going to be sir we are entertaining a proposal today to purchase sheltered pods and through a program we have multiple sites that we're working with groups who've identified sites so the Aloha United Methodist Church site is one site for a safe rest yes I understand that today's action is on the contract purely to purchase a number of PODS that we will need for multiple sites the map that you are referring to is a map that someone in the community has developed you're asking questions about this map so a few things we're trying to get clear upon public comment is not an opportunity for question and answer periods it is an opportunity for you to share your input with all of us on the Board of Commissioners with regard to the proposal for a safe rest Village as hosted by the Aloha United Methodist Church there is I understand what you're saying but uh a lot of us are here to to uh where are these things going to be put I understand you they the Methodist you want they you want to put pods there but you have arrows here for other places this is not describing no this is not our map someone else has it then and who decided to put them the arrows where they are I don't know who developed the map I cannot speak to that someone else who did develop it and it has not been developed by Washington County thank you well I'm sorry but we're all here because these arrows are pointing who who made this thing up and we're always pod's going to be put other than the Methodist ladies and gentlemen this is not our map we cannot speak to this map that is all and you can't answer me whose map it is I don't know whose map it is Sir and why was just put on my door saying that the pods will be in the I cannot take responsibility for what other people generate and speak to Sir who would I speak to find out who want to speak to to find out where these other pods are going to be in the in our neighborhood not the Methodist but the other pods who can I speak to sir we have a community meeting coming up on June 26th that will be the best forum for having a question and answer period for community members ladies and gentlemen where is your map that what you're buying today we have an action item before us today to buy 60 pods say where are they going where are these pods gonna go sir where's the map we have an action today to buy pods the action today is not about our shelter siding program okay we're trying to be very clear we do have a proposal to work with the Aloha United Methodist Church I understand that for 30 pods for a safe rest Village for up to two years you do not know who temporary what these years oh my proposed other spots on the map as I have been asked and have answered I do not know who has developed this map that has these other arrows who can I contact to find out who did it I will do my best to find out uh how this information has been provided to us and I understand ladies and ladies and gentlemen thousands of them I walked every day and put them out I put down those circles because that's what your group to me about so sir so Mr Parker okay so ladies and gentlemen and I walked over three miles a day to do it would you like to have a conversation about you provided to me by your staff because that's where it came from and we didn't vote for that he's doing fine Mr Parker your two minutes has been in addition I believe you have gotten information about who generated the map and provided it to various community members thank you very much you got that information from new people yeah so if he got that information you're holding out information from us you're holding that somebody in the thank you Mr Parker thank you Mr Parker thank you Mr Parker thank you ladies and gentlemen if if you will not maintain decorum then we will be in a situation well we where we would need to pause this meeting and reconvene this meeting in Zoom so that we can get through our business ma'am you have two minutes thank you my name is Ayla Hoffler chair and Commissioners we're glad that we're getting to finally speak about this proposed purchase of coffins I am definitely opposed to this purchase not to mention where you're putting them I've been a nurse for 40 years I've taken care of addicts I've taken care of homeless people I've had them die in my arms I've had them withdraw in my arms I have no prejudice against these folks in any manner we do need to take care of our population that has nothing but I want to speak to why they have part of the reason is the land use laws that you implement in this County forced upon you by Luba this county has declared a state of emergency for homes well I want to speak to the people that own one acre five acres 20 acres Etc that aren't allowed to even build a house on their land imagine if you change the land use laws how many people that actually work hard for a living and have families and our third and fourth Generations that would like to stay here could build a house on their land that they either bought or inherited and what if we build not only single-family residences but multiple generational dwellings so that we could have our parents and our college kids have a house on our land as well we would have a lot less people homeless and people could afford to buy a home the cost of a house in this county is due to the fact that you have artificially created a situation that there's no land available this government owns 70 percent of this that's what's wrong so 30 is left to who warehouser Stimson the county the city how many properties does a city own in this County you can put these pods thank you on your city in parks in your parking lot how about ma'am how about the parking lot of the prison thank you ma'am or the parking lot we've provided you to monitor public comments thank you clerk Moss who do we have next so next Snapchat Miss Hoffler thank you next we have Monica Anthony and Amanda I apologize if I mispronounce your name there and then on Deck we have John woods and Lori Snyder hi please state your name uh Monica so I have six plus years of earned practical knowledge and experience in all aspects of planning building and the running of safe rest Villages tiny house communities homeless shelters and I also live three blocks away from the proposed tiny house village with my and have vested interest in the safety of my teenagers being able to bop around the real neighborhood and keep their friends safe I heard they were going to open one in my neighborhood and my first thought was that's great you know it's really great that people will have a place to live and then life got busy and I didn't think much about it until I saw a flyer posted with to me with my experience was blatant misinformed fear-mongering because words mean something when you use them they use the words not sober obviously was attempting to imply that our children are in danger there's going to be drug use everywhere when what it really means is this is not going to be a sobriety house which is kind of to let people know that if they are in strict sobriety like fragile recovery that this might not be a safe place for them but what that really looks like is getting a beer after work with your friends maybe having a margarita at a karaoke party for your birthday it might even mean you know a relapse without repercussions and losing your and so I have I would just like to implore everyone to maybe not let their biases get in the way of something that would only be a net positive for our community tiny house Villages statistically do not Trend crime upward in almost every case the crime Trends downward because they then have a vested interest in their Community because it's taking care of them because it's giving them a place to belong because it's making them people and I don't like the words that people are using to maybe plant this in a negative way thank you Miss Anthony yes ma'am um hello I'm Amanda everard you nailed it by the way good job I am a homeowner business owner and resident of this community I live less than a half mile from a lower United Methodist Church and I fully support the County's decision to open a temporary emergency shelter at this location some of my neighbors disagree with me but I believe most of their opposition is based on fear bred from stereotypes misinformation and Prejudice and the county should not be swayed by complaints",

        "text": " terms of of the public hearing here your noce said that the public has an opportunity to provide their comments in writing or at the public hearing and so without telling us that we were going to be limited to a certain amount of time obviously I did not do a good job of presenting the issues that were not in writing I would really like to have the time to send those to you in writing so that you could understand the scope of why you heard those comments in particular the ones that I didn't send in the one the comments that I made here vertually with the exception of one area I talked B about so that's my reason why I think yeah so you did submit comments I sub comment you're saying now you want to sub submit more comments I'm saying I submitted comments on some issues I did not submit comments on the com I didn't send written comments that were consistent with what I planned on saying tonight here or the topics that I planned on speaking to tonight here that would support a potential future well and I just suggest as many of the other council members have already that the written comments are so valuable um of course being in person is a wonderful thing because you know this face to-face interaction is so important um but also the written statements is is what is we are going to go back to and read over and over again um so I'm still trying to find a good cause here and I'm and I'm not sure I've found that tonight because you've had 45 days to review and you've already submitted one set of comments but now you're saying you need more time toit more comments there were there were additional issues that I did not have to write up that I gave in in written okay than you okay thank you councelor um discussion by the council Mr chair um I think you need also if you're um seeking input on good cause I think you need to go back to miss King and Miss krider as well because they both requested time okay um are Miss King and M Mr and Mrs krider still with us on the WebEx have um unmuted your mic wait oh um you are unmuted yes hello yes Miss King H go ahead we hear you okay um we're giving you an opportunity to State uh your reasons for uh needing more time um to get your written comments into us right right oh I have the written comments in for the Coalition um some of the members tonight that spoke said they needed a little more time for um kind of cons I believe probably to wrap around their uh specific specificity with O and 's or something so I asked for more time maybe by tomorrow the end of your meeting even that you know they could get that part in and submit that in writing to supplement their verbal tonight that's allk okay thank you Miss King are uh Mr or Mrs krider that was m C oh that was Mrs krier sorry okay Wendy here yes Wendy you know thank you Wendy you are unmuted okay thank you you know it it it wasn't um until I heard someone else spoke speak today about the um the site conditions and the Fish and Wildlife that I realized that it actually impacted our potentially impacted our farm and at that point I I realized I had not efficiently studied this I only studied it in terms of the expanded site boundary and all those implications and so um is good cause uh what is that a question um Miss King yes could you clarify your last sentence there oh I I just um it was kind of like I was um agreeing with with with the counsel bber and um when another comment was made during this public comment period about of the site conditions um that were being adusted the originals site certificate that I realized that that too might impact our family farm and it wasn't until then that I realized those may have as well so um that's me if if that's that was the reasoning for me not having enough time because I didn't study those um I didn't think they really applied and so um that is my ignorance and I don't know if that is um cause for giving me extended time okay thank you Miss King okay Council um quick discussion where we at for whether there's good cause to extend timelines and remember um there's timelines that are down the road from tonight to the applicant to staff and everything at effect Vice chair Condon thank you um Cindy con for the record and I have not said this but thank you so much to everyone who testified tonight came um and gave voice because that does um just provide a whole lot of context and input to our work um I would be inclined to extend till the end of tomorrow our meeting tomorrow and I know staff is probably just gritting their teeth about it um but I do think we have an issue with things that are stated at a hearing that people ruminate about um and I think we should consider that and so I I would certainly be open to holding the record open for a day councelor berer this is counselor berer I agree with Vice chair Condon um and I think I know we are concerned about setting precedent of just having rolling deadlines and that is not the intent here the intent is to give a very short window for people who have expressed an interest in submitting additional information and at this point it will be written um um and by limiting it to will close a business tomorrow which I think is May 31st um we put a a limit on it um and again I would recommend that our notices of public hearings include the caveat that we may have to limit time so we give that fair notice going forward you any other comments Mr chairman councilor Devin obviously uh there may be an issue here as to justification but if the council feels like you know a simple day extension I'm not going to have a problem with that I would just say that I doubt that a person out there is going to track our meeting theoretically we're supposed to be over about 11:30 or noon tomorrow it would be better just to set a time right now so that people hear it and just qu the regular close of business which would be 5:00 p.m. of course we'd have to extend the time for the applicant um or additional time to respond to those comments do we need a motion I have a question CH counc does the department have any input into this decision at the time at this time on the right like verbal input so just for clarification the next agenda item so we still have another public hearing tonight yep that we have to go through um that common period doesn't end until next week um and so we have that one on the agenda also for the council's review of the DPO we don't expect the same level of comments on that one so I mean I think you know if if it was tomorrow at noon end of the council meeting uh end of the business day um you know that's I think that's fine that gives us at least the ability gives the applicant the ability um the applicant can request you know additional time to respond depending upon the volume of the comments but um I think from at least staff standpoint and I'll speak for staff um I think through tomorrow would be fine I think if we start going further and further then you know then as chair how said um that there there definitely will be a domino effect will suggest that respond yeah I so um Council roow talked about the time frame for um idah hope power to respond I think we leave it still at the end of the day on Monday and they can have the ability to request and what we have in there is requests from staff not Council so I think you delegate to us that ability to extend that out if they come back to us request additional time yeah um and know I'll look to Patrick I mean I think you know for my preference you know basically you just have sort of acknowledgement that that's what you want to do but I'll look to Patrick to see if he wants to um have a formal vote it I I think it's fine if you acknowledge that that's what if you have concerns about it then letast talk about it but if you're okay with that approach then you don't need to vote them let me see if there's head nods for that okay it looks like end of business day tomorrow and that's what we're talking yeah five o'clock tomorrow May 31st and um and as previously I'm going to move on now as previously stated the comment deadline is the close of the public hearing tonight but we're changing it for till 5:00 tomorrow uh the certificate holder will be given until Monday June 3rd at 5: to provide responses to comments however if requested by the certificate holder the Department's authorized to grant them additional time to respond so does a certificate holder uh wish to provide any responses tonight we do hi Joe stipple Idaho Power 1221 West Idaho Street laptop died so I gotta go off my phone here make sure I don't forget anything thank you Council thank you staff um for for the preparation of RFA 2 I know a lot of work went into it so I think there's a lot of confusion around exactly what we're trying to accomplish with the expanded site boundary we're we're proposing the expanded site boundary to be a quarter mile on either side of the center line of the transmission line Corridor to really facilitate negotiations with land owners this change will allow IPC to work with landowners and accommodate change during the construction process as you know Wardman hemway is a 300 mile long transmission line and things will come up during construction and it's it's a key uh Energy Corridor uh energy pipeline for um to bring renewable energy from the north from the Northwest to Idaho and from Idaho to the northwest so to clarify the original site boundary really is a micro siding Corridor so we can move project features anywhere inside that um based on engineering as we develop final engineering work with land owners and that sort of thing what we're proposing is to have an expanded site boundary and changing the original site boundary to become the microid and Corridor so that doesn't change when we have this expanded site boundary which is that quarter mile from the center line of the transmission on on either side it allows Idaho Power uh to move a project feature with landowner support only we're not we're not going to move that without agreement from the landowner uh but we",

        "text": " it continues to grow and where would they fit on your list if you just were plugging them in yeah I would say that we would put them in that category as well and kind of depending upon the ru making you know they may or may not be interested typically like a a public utility district or a consumer owned utility wouldn't really be part of our process you know and UMO electric is kind of a weird one because it's sort of in between um it's certainly gotten a lot bigger you know and it's not a Pacific core it's not a Portland General Electric but it's also not a consumer own utility and I don't know exactly what category it's in it's kind of in that sort of um in between category between those but but it's a good reminder that I think they're a valid um uh one and and while that may not be a perfect categorization we would I would see that they would fall within that thank you for that I just I want people to recognize that the emphasis on guidance like we have the ability to make change and I don't want somebody to see that list and automatically think they're they're out because they didn't fit in our box somewhere so uh to be just as a reminder what we proposed at the last council meeting and I'm just going to begin with this but essentially I'm going to distribute a a sort of 2024 outlook for all of our potential rule makings it will include this one and we are going to cast a very wide net in terms of seeking interest so whereas previously we were sort of like doing targeted you know let's Okay we want two investor own utilities let's contact investor on utilities and grab two of them you know sort of an approach uh I think this time around we're going to we are going to cast a very wide net uh for all the rulemakings and so you know if the um matilla Co-op you know follows our process and it and expresses interest in joining like we would certainly you know if it made sense given the other interest we would we wouldn't say you don't perfectly fit one of these you're not going to be not going to be and this is just sort of a a general guideline we're trying to sort of balance you know essentially applicants and non-applicants and with sort of kind of reviewing agency kind of straddling the middle there um but you know representing the public as well uh so yeah it's sort of remain we sort of this is kind of a hope but we kind of have to go off of what you know actual this is a volunteer process so we kind of have to base the rack based on who actually calls us you know responds to our our um requests for interest but we are going to be attempting to really spread the net widely and um hopefully that allows us to make the best racks that we can for each of these R makings thank you for that and I just will add that that's one of the reasons why I think everyone on this Council now no pressure Katie uh but we've been very committed about making sure that we go to the areas where the projects are because we want to get that involvement and I think this is just another way that aligns with that objective that we share okay um that brings us straight Council deliberation decisionmaking thank you Tom so um Tom has concluded his presentation on uh the 2024 site certificate Amendment Ru making and at this time I would um ask that if we have a motion on this action council member oh I'll go for it okay um Madam chair I move this is Kent and I move that the council authorize informal initiation of the 2024 site certificate Amendment Ru making as presented and recommended by staff thank you Vice chair how do we have a second council member Condon um thank you I'll second that motion thank you are there any additional comments council member delin council member chak we don't hear any comments we're going to call the role Mr secretary please call the role yes Richard yes thank you council member develin Kent how yes Cindy Condon yes Ann berer yes Perry choc toot yes thank you coun M CH toot Marcy Grail yes motion carries Madam chair thank you Mr secretary Tom thank you apparently we'll be seeing you a lot this year so I will be out next uh next uh month so I I believe Chris or someone else will be handling the public hearing for the contested case r making but yes uh for the rest of the year you'll be seeing a whole lot of me right on well thank you we appreciate your efforts we will look forward to hearing about it all right well that concludes agenda item C and we have already taken a break so I think we're going to motor pass that for now and that gets us to agenda item D which is the public comment period this is an information item where this time is reserved for the public to address the council regarding any item within Council jurisdiction that is not otherwise closed for comment um at this time we have we you have uh a member of the public here in the room three four oh I just saw the stack sorry we have uh members of the public who do wish to address us so um I think we will be going through them yeah start with the green ones in the I'm sorry start with the green forms okay okay um we're we're juggling here Nancy usually it's got me lined out here all right so we have our first um person on our list is Terry Hamilton and if you would like to please come address Council just speak right into yes ma'am you hi thank you all for having us today and and giving us an opportunity my name is Terry Hamilton I'm a resident of the ly County Harrisburg area and with all this new renewable energy stuff coming up there's a lot of uh unanswered questions or unknown questions or and answers to uh my biggest one is with these uh not my biggest but one of the main concerns is with these renewable energies and storage and and uh uh possible contaminants from all these things is there a a way to monitor contamin an in groundwater I live in the wamit valley groundwater moves a lot we get a lot of contaminants from a lot of nitrogens that we've taken as uh a family when our kids were young to mitigate any possible contaminant for them because The Young and the old are the most susceptible so we brought in bottled water so our kids never had to drink our well water even though we had it tested many times it's below uh contaminant levels that were that was still acceptable for for consumption sometimes it would be higher and so our groundwater moves a lot so if there's any contaminants that go into the into the water that water is going to travel to many many Wells um the other thing would be food source so with these new solar and and I'm assuming uh uh wind also so sheep are going to be used a lot at least that's the proposed so what's the contaminant intake to these sheep so when the the Lambs are born are these contaminants passed from the mothers to the babies and then the babies go into food source now some of the adults will also go into food source how do we Rectify or or quantify all of those contaminants that could be possibly passed into the food chain not just the water chain do is is there any studies that anybody knows that any of this taken place I have no idea so I'm going to tell you thank you for your comments so the way public comments work is we get to listen to you but we don't respond uh and address your concerns as we move throughout the process there will be opportunities for you to share those as you heard earlier today okay um and my belief is that the developers and other stakeholders listen and pay attention to that and that's something that I would expect a developer pay attention developers to uh hear and and respond to but I'm going to look at uh Todd our um Council secretary to correct anything I may have said yeah no no Corrections Madam chair um just clarification that you know um we do have standards related to um the the issues that you have have brought up and what I would say is you know please you know connect with myself or other members of the sighting division team and we can walk you through um how that process works how those issues can and are evaluated in an application um that way you know if you're interested in participating um and reviewing an application we can help kind of get you prepared to do that um in terms of what to look for and how to look for it um and then when to comment and you know everything you brought up yes can and should be evaluated in an application um and we want to hear that kind of information okay thank you very much for the clarification that's all I have for now thank you very much just a second um um council member Condon has a question and we're going to see if it's a question we're supposed to ask and if we can't then Todd's going to tell us yes thank you one thank you for being here today um a question for you with the concern about grandwater which I think is huge issue across across the state but um certainly is we've got a project in the wamit valley a large project um understand the concern but is is your concern um the a property that is currently used for agriculture a crop of some some sort um converted to solar all right Council remember con just as a reminder and and not just you but I keep seeing people do this when they're speaking and they're blocking the microphone when they're speaking I know it's not purposeful but I'm just worried that people will have a hard time hearing Us online okay hold my hands um are are you concerned about an increase in contamination to groundwater you know it's relative increase from the current use I I'm not I I don't know much about groundwater but I'm interested in what your concern is is uh the the current use is is pretty much all Agland around um I've lived directly on the valley floor now I'm on the Foothills so the wall consump the water usage from the down is a lot sorry didn't mean to block that it it's much different now from where I was to where I'm currently at but I'm only three miles away from where I used to be but the the water table and the water saturation is much higher now where I'm at compared to just a m three miles away so the water flow is different the the",

        "text": " because i'm getting some a question from another staff or an odo is actually reporting out from each group but just doing it by um no i was just gonna have adam insert everything to the slides and we don't really do it by group we just kind of talk about all the recommendations oh okay i mean if that works yeah just somebody suggested we share out and i saw it on my screen but okay okay if we want to report out we can do that while he thinks so um let me stop sharing my screen so i can access my notes because i was group one and we did not elect somebody else to present because that was we were just too busy okay so my group was ryan davies james valdez and tom mcfartlet and we mostly focused on interconnection and transmission and other so um the first suggestion or recommendation we had was meter aggregation allowing for a single interconnection point for multiple users and other states have done it for example right now in iou territory it's limited to a single owner for an interconnection this would allow for a shared benefit of multi-family property or manufactured home parks to distribute the benefits to the residents in the property or park um and this would be similar to virtual net metering in cou territory one con in this was there's a hurdle for billing departments for um the whole interconnection i mean the virtual net metering part um another recommendation was a better understanding of interconnections getting data on the different interconnections and projects getting better transparency transparency of capacity interconnection wise loosen the limitation on adding resources in bpa territory to develop more renewable development in the area and then with the community solar program for projects 365 kilowatts and allow connection to the load side of the meter to allow for storage and resilience benefits so let them island off and add storage um and then in our other category we had perhaps adding like a forum to share best practices amongst communities ceos community solar projects et cetera to allow to learn from others and to save time and money and that was all for group one all right group two i have no idea what group my group number was i'm sorry i forgot to look no go for it you can go i don't need to go um we put all of our stuff into the slides so i think we're good unless there was um anything that anyone from my group wanted to bring up we spent a lot of time talking about like ownership and community engagements and involvement and how we can have a recommendation around that so we put that under the on the other slide but otherwise we put our notes directly okay um so as we typically the time comes you'll see our stuff in red so was it jessica or wendy um this is wendy am i mute um you're good great uh so i was not very efficient at how i took my notes so my apologies i was trying to work on making them easier to put into a document um but i will convey what i can remember um number one was um some a couple of possibilities for uh studies of looking at the cost of small scale projects versus prices that utilities are paying generally for their renewable energy and also at how closely avoided costs have tracked actual costs over time for renewable the second one uh would be to increase the maximum cap standard uh contracts under purpa for solar from 3 megawatts to 10 megawatts at a minimum and possibly higher to match the definition of small scale renewables at 20 megawatts there was also a recommendation around just working on a common vocabulary and realizing that there are some specific definitions for eligibility for instance under the c-rep but that puc is also working on a broader definition of resilience for hb we also have a recommendation to consider a feed-in tariff for small-scale projects we had a few different types of recommendations around making community easier to use perhaps increasing the and dealing with interconnection issues and it seems like i've got one or two more um oh also maybe some consideration around how our under some of our current programs and systems that energy system energy storage can be compensated in general uh i think there was support in our group for expanding the uh c-rup program and the thoughts that that would be popular especially as a lot of these projects come to fruition and then our last or no sorry we had two more um maybe trying to make something a little bit simpler than the current the current community solar structure for affordable housing and manufactured home and then the last one was to recapitalize the self program small energy loan program or small-scale energy loan program that the program itself is still on the books and given that interest rates are currently increasing that um that could help with financing for some of these small-scale projects so sorry long list thanks wendy um so orianna we're gonna take you up on tagging in for so our group uh had more of kind of a philosophical weedsy discussion on a few different issues rather than uh adding a lot of new ideas to the space and i'll just hit on a little bit of kind of where we spent some time processing and thinking and had some really thoughtful conversation um the first was on the issue of um what kind of the balance should be between grant funding and dollars that come from taxpayers or the state general fund versus rate payers and naming that the word rate based is perhaps not the correct one in that slide um because that can have a specific connotation associated with um how are are paying for something or or the nature of that project and that also triggered us to add a new idea which is um performance-based rate making and and that conversation which at some point will happen in the public utility commission and came out of the senate bill 978 process um but shifting that utility business model or how rates are said and and the way utilities are are valued for their elements of their system rather than necessarily what they are are building um is a way to potentially provide that ratepayer contribution to small-scale projects to supplement uh the grant side of things but some concern from folks about you know what should rate payers bear the cost of versus tax payers and we had some very robust discussion on that front uh the second area we spent a lot of time discussing on the the contracts and rate slide was the issue of expanding the the standard contract language and some discussion about whether uh three megawatts meet the economies of scale versus like a 10 megawatt or a 20 megawatt project but then some questions about are there going to be community projects or community based work that happens at that much larger scale than than three megawatts and some discussion whether community projects should be relocated to that smaller size or whether they could be more expansive and that um kind of ballooned out into conversation about community ownership and the opportunity uh for uh collecting profit from from larger scale projects they're looking at a developer type model but through a community uh cooperative ownership uh model for for energy and has some discussion about how that might work in a market space and and how that might play out and then with that with some discussion about the costs and risks associated with community owning anything and where there's opportunity for wealth building uh wealth loss in in the process and what some of the responsibilities and risks are associated with allowing communities to own a project and not just receive the energy benefits but also potentially receive profit as and then as we got through the the last couple of slides we we had some discussion uh on um the the transmission side of looking through some of those those different issues and and the land use and conservation and i would maybe turn to to to kesha and jimmy who had some comments there if they want to add their thoughts on both of those slides uh this is keisha and i was just pointing out i didn't have a an idea for legislation but just pointing out that the dual use issue goes beyond photovoltaics and agriculture to farm waste uh with and you know biodigestion and uh waste stream diversion or hydroelectric projects that generate water efficiency as well and that those are the kinds of projects that can only be developed at the local where the resources community scale so maybe something that focuses on ensuring that we're going as a state that we're going after those types of projects dual use dual benefit or multi-benefit yeah this is jimmy i just with those sort of two things that came up in group discussion worth calling out us i think it felt like there was uh you know at least there was support over multiple members in the group in in recommendations that were centered around um sort of expanding the funds and the duration of funds to support sort of the program support effort that was described earlier this morning and then sort of separately just in the last slide we had some discussion about the suggestion with respect to regional transmission organization and i at least was sharing my viewpoint that that given just like the scale and nature of that uh you know particular sort of change in our energy market infrastructure that um it felt like a little bit of a tail wagging the dog and that perhaps we can note perhaps it'd be appropriate to note that um you know a market design change could help with can help and select instances for making bringing bringing renewable small-scale renewable resources online in a more streamlined way but that we not go so far as to say that uh you know the benefits and also like costs and detriments of a rto have been kind of evaluated by the working group so sorry adam uh was is still experiencing a technical difficulty difficulties but those are a couple items of discussion i wanted to thank you and so finally we had that was everybody right all four everybody's group is represented all right adam i know you're having technical difficulties but how goes the inserting into the slides is it about ready if i start on the first one are you good are we going back with the silences acceptance thing christy yeah he said he's good okay it's in another another venue great i'm going to share my screen then give me just one second and i did test it so as he updates it continue um screen to there we go all right here is the first page let's go ahead and talk about contracting and rates to start things off um would anybody like to comment on any of these we've mentioned all of them except for the",

        "text": " included and then also just reviewing the proposed timeline and budget so you'd need to return this worksheet on June 16th I also just want to point out uh which is tomorrow I also just want to point out that this does not substitute for any local processes so local land use and building permits are still required in any any historic design review that Mr weathers hasn't already completed would need to happen as well and also um in Salem because we're a certified local government local historic design review can substitute for a shippo design review so your choices are you you don't have to complete the evaluation if you don't want to um it's not a requirement but if you did want to review it I know that um uh shippo staff Joyce Sears would really appreciate it and you'd need to complete that worksheet and get it back to Zach by tomorrow I'll stop sharing does anyone have any questions if you have any questions my question is on the previous design review wasn't that a unanimous approval of the commission that there was a condition of a I'm sorry what was your question was there was was uh was the approval by the commission unanimous my recollection is that it was yes I believe it was thank you any other questions for staff um we should email this back to you or fill it out now send it back um there is a film PDF included in the email I sent out last week and see if you can either fill that out it's part of the entire packet so that's a little bit annoying I can't send you just the form if you like or if you'd like you can fill that out now give it to me at the end of the meeting you can fill it out at home take a picture of it and send a video Back to Me by tomorrow in whatever form um or your vision is not acceptable okay thank you are there any other comments for that oh okay I just have a dumb question is this the first yes okay that's not a dumb question only one familiar with the program would never would know all right thank you Kimberly thank you Zach for uh the options to uh fill out the uh the form for tomorrow uh the next thing we have is the ainw history articles the mitigation for the north campus it relieves yeah thank you uh so this is another uh fun worksheet that you get to fill out if you so desire I'm going to give you a little bit of background for those of you that weren't on the commission when this came through uh so the Oregon State Hospital historic district actually used to be much bigger than it is now uh this is actually a a plan of what it looked like when it was originally designated in 2008 there were 61 contributing resources on the site and and just a six non-contributing in 2019 a new boundary was proposed because a significant number of resources have been demolished and you can see the revised boundary here now down to 36 uh contributing Resources with four non-contributing so the additionally an archaeological site was identified on the north campus and the property owners so so both Das and um the developer on the on this property have been coordinating with the Oregon State historic property historic preservation office to do negotiate stipulations for Mitigation Of This adverse effect and in this particular case what's before you is part of that mitigation so there there are two um which are have been written by ANW they've been hired by the developer to develop these historic articles for the Oregon encyclopedia as well as the newsletter current archaeological happenings in Oregon or kahoe and so hey ho I said it wrong so um so just like the other uh you're in because we are a certified local government and you are a qualified landmarks commission you're invited to review and comment on the article there's a worksheet similar to the other one I I just went over and in this particular case if you can complete a worksheet for each of the Articles they're very similar but they're for different audiences and generally if you can look at whether or not a concise history is conveyed and as well as the significance and context for the history of the district uh check out their facts and sources and supporting material and again as with the other one if you can return to Zach by tomorrow so and just like with the other one you don't have to do it it's not a requirement but if you do if you can get it to Zach by tomorrow that would be thank you Kimberly are there any with the uh significant demolitions uh on the side has there been a reevaluation of national register eligibility for the um yes that was that was also done in 2019 and it went back through the state advisory committee on historic preservation and the boundary was adjusted and the nomination of data but what remains is still considered listed and eligible thank you are there any other questions um the Oregon incentives or is it the whole Hospital I gotta get the disclaimer yeah I'm on the editorial board of the organ encyclopedia and we have been needing uh an entry related to the entire hospital um the Oregon state hospital so so the short answer to your question is that we did not um request an archaeological entry just focused on the north campus but that's what was provided anyone else here to comment uh I'm having a hard time wrapping my head uh what what the the purpose of the history articles are so I get them as as being uh terms of mitigation but yeah here so so um it's only one of the many stipulations that are mitigating for the adverse effect to both the loss of the structures and the adverse effect to the archaeological site on the north campus and if you bear with me I can I can say I I wonder if um just because I have a hard time accepting this as a complete stand-alone completion um so maybe if I saw with the other stipulations were in the mitigation it might help it's it's very well you're wearing a different hat Jessica and I know because of your feet yeah your role in this case is not to review the whether the mitigation is sufficient it's whether or not the history itself um is adequate and and let me pull up I'm pulling up some of our code relating to public historic mitigation so you can and the the Moa the stipulations that that agreement is not with us um it's with the shippo so I can certainly request um I do have a copy of the Moa but it's quite lengthy and I that's okay the main reason I was asked about the the other stipulations is because um just looking at this by itself and yeah and then the questions on the Forum is this so let me so you can see so the the this is our code relating to public historic mitigation and this was determined to be a level three adverse effect and so the other um so looking at level three so it photo documentation which they did before the buildings were demolished um ILS including ILS level documentation I'm not going to read all of it but this piece of it is just a section of the education portion so in this particular case the other stipulations included working with the museum the state hospital Museum to create a traveling exhibit and and updating their website so this is just a portion of a much larger yeah so I guess I guess my next thing then is uh just again I'm trying to I'm trying to convince my brain not to tear this up on because well you're free to provide whatever comments you want on the article itself yeah and I'm certainly I can certainly come back at a future meeting and request um I can bring the larger MOA and perhaps request someone from Das or shippo to come and speak to the overall mitigation I think um I think I'll be able to just look at this and not worry about what else is being done um okay but my comments might be uh a lot so just um feel free to reach out to me if you're like okay so you know where they're going um they're gonna go to internet W and then to Jessica Gabriel and I and Jamie French so you know you could just put your name on there and say call me right oh it's karma okay thank you are there any other questions for staff I won't okay um no apologies if you've already stated this but um what is the what is the final end result plan for these articles is this is going to be like published somewhere is it going to be like panels interpretive handles somewhere what's the what's the what's the final thing like what are we interviewing yeah so there's there's two end results um I'm going to say it wrong again the kahoe newsletter so that goes to um professional archaeologists in a digital form and I believe they also have um their newsletters archived on their website so you can go back and look at older ones and then the organ art encyclopedia that's um that so just so you know the process it'll it'll go through the the internal the shippo review but then it goes through our editorial board so I'm I I'm just one of um many people on the editorial board and it will be vetted um and and I can tell you right now that we've already had concerns about the narrow scope so I don't think you need to solve that problem that will be solved by the organ encyclopedia editorial board but you know I think we would welcome any insights or comments that you might have because those will be forwarded to the editorial board and then once it's finalized you can go check uh when you get home you can just look at the Oregon encyclopedia there's lots of entries on there okay my primary concern was that this would be something that would not be something successful but if it's going to be earnings of the media that the latest that yes thank you are there any other comments thanks everybody thanks Kimberly uh next thing we have on our agenda is the board client assignment updates and I think that's another Kimberly um just real quick I did send you all an email with the short version of just before in all of the boxes should be expandable so add your typing it should just keep going if you need space It should the way I said that you can you can write a novel and that's a good thing that you do that are you ready for me yes please okay so so I'm just going to do a really Brief Review uh I know commissioner strong you've joined us uh halfway through the year and I can't remember um Chris I feel like you've been here forever but I can't I don't know if you were here in January um so oh well",

        "text": " fall hi again uh so as the role making coordinator i will be working to kind of um take care of the various steps in this process just looking at the attending list it looks like many of you are very familiar with state agency rules and the rulemaking process uh some of you may not be um but basically uh state agency rules are the way that state agencies fill in the details from uh from statute and bills that are passed by the and often set up guidelines and processes for four agencies to follow and participants and programs to follow so in this case uh as andy mentioned we are doing our best to preserve continuity for participants in the program so we do have a number of changes that will be need to need to be made to the rules but in many cases it will be kind of adding some of the eligible uses for uh diskid or distribution system connected technologies and just making sure um that we're very clear about uh kind of the definitions and then the names of the different uh portions of the public purpose charge and also for the cost-effective energy so as we have our three main bullets here uh the purpose of this rule making is to revise our processes to implement any changes that were made by house bill 3141 to the program most of those will be relatively minor but we are uh trying to do our best to keep things uh uh to provide continuity for current participants and the process the steps in the process will largely be the same with pre-certifying and then making sure that the expenditures that are made were our eligible expenditures and then providing credit for the self-directing sites there will be some housekeeping that we'll need to do to the rules as well we do have some language that's obsolete and we'll need to um we look at the program administration fee for this program uh we will have i think uh maybe some database work that tom or andy could talk about if people have questions and you'll note there's a link at the bottom of this website uh on our agency rulemaking webpage where we we have information about all the rule makings that are currently or recently underway at odo we can post the recording of this slideshow are of this meeting as well as the slideshow so we will get that up there as soon as we're able to but on that rulemaking webpage you can also see the draft rules once we have draft rules you'll be able to see when the public hearing will be and all of those other happenings so uh andy if you could flip forward to the next side and i'll talk a little bit about that schedule thank you wendy great so we are as andy are fairly tight time frame we need to get rules into place by january 1 for 22 january 1 which is the operative date in the bill uh so we are trying to build in as much uh opportunity for stakeholder input as we can and also as uh andy mentioned there there's also some work that's going on at the puc that is scheduled for this fall so i've put a couple of items into this timeline that are highlighted in kind of a greenish bluish color that some of you may be very interested on october 21st there's a discussion of the puc of distribution system connected technologies and definition uh and i uh we do have a couple of people from who are in this meeting if any of the attendees have more specific questions but as far as i know they will have a staff memo that will be coming out sometime later this fall and there will opportunities to look at the memo and to give input and the puc the and that's the public utilities commission will have information on their website now skipping over to odo's process uh november 1st we will have the draft rules and hearing notice published that's our plan and that is published by the oregon secretary of state as part of the official rulemaking process november 1st to approximately december is when we plan to have a public comment period so that is an opportunity for people to read the draft rules give us comments give us any advice on how to make the rules easier to use or if there's anything you see that we may have missed or other changes that you would recommend this is an opportunity to to let us know around december 1st we plan to have a public hearing and at the public hearing uh participants can give us oral and as well as written testimony up through up through that date uh november 30th is the planned uh date for the puc for the commission itself to adopt a provisional definition of distribution system connected technologies and the plan is for that uh definition to be in place for 2022 and uh at some point later uh i think in maybe later in 2022 there will be a process to put in place a more permanent definition will take all of the input that we get in our public hearing and through our public comment period and uh take any of that into account with our rules and then we plan to actually file the rules december 22nd is our target date just before the holidays and again it will be effective january for those of you who have worked with a room making process before hopefully this sort of timeline is very familiar to you that all agencies need to follow certain state procedures for rulemaking but if you're not as familiar with rulemakings please reach out to us and we're open to hearing input and will with any guidance you might need to understand the process so please reach out to us thank you wendy we will have some contact information uh wendy as well as tom elliott our self-direct program lead at the end of the slideshow which again can be accessed on the odo website at the end of this presentation andy can you hear me i can thank you for joining us tom will you please introduce yourself to the the audience yes good morning tom elliott i'm the self-direct or let pep program manager apologies had a little technical glitch this morning so i'm joining by phone and actually that moves kind of in the next the last phase here is actually perhaps maybe the most important part which is to gather some input from you answer any questions you might have and then if there's follow-up items then we wanted to be sure and capture those but as wendy just mentioned there's the rulemaking process that we're kind of at the front end of now and this is really your you know one of your chances but you know one of the good ones to be up in the front end and we showed you or showed and told you kind of conceptually what's going to happen and we'll need to translate that into the actual rule but what we wanted to do now is make sure that you understood kind of how the program works and what the changes are so we'll entertain any questions and input that you might have now thank you tom i'm not the most familiar with webex but might be beneficial for folks to chime in in the chat if we don't notice uh a raised hand or other ways of trying to signal us and andy you're gonna have to give me the chat because i can't read it i'm i'm audio only okay great let me rely on on stacey to do that she's running our excellent thank you any questions for tom our subject matter expert or wendy on the rule making side of things and again we have some some folks from the puc here as well if questions need to be directed towards them this is christy i don't think i see any hands up i see a bunch of people with exclamation points next to their name i don't know what that means but i don't see any hands up i don't think so definitely if people are raising their hands and not seeing it do post in the q a and let us know that there's some sort of problem because i don't see any hands up to make things easier i might stop sharing the slides and go back to the normal webex version splashed the contact info for both tom and wendy on the screen now again this can be accessed on the oto webpage if you don't capture those emails right hi andy this is stacy hey stacy hey um i got a chat it was just sent directly to me it's from robert hart he's asking what does it mean that conversa uh conversation is covered through raids i'm sorry conservation conservation that's a great question and thank you for asking that i'll let tom uh take a swing at that one yeah that that is an excellent question so the same intent is to to collect monies from all of the electric consumers and to use them for conservation energy efficiency it's more really about the mechanism now and so whereas before it was a separate component within the public purpose i believe it was what 56.7 of the three percent of the purpose charge and then there's other monies it's all been sort of consolidated rates and so the utilities will include some portion on everybody's rate schedule to to capture and or capture to to fund it so um some small incremental amount will be added to the rates and then when you apply those to everybody's usage and then you know collect all of it across all of the customer bases then you'll will collect all of the monies needed for the energy trust to to administer the energy efficiency program so i'm not sure if that kind of answered the question so effectively it's the same end goal with a little bit different mechanism and i would also invite the bc colleagues to make any corrections if i didn't get that exactly right but that's i think generally probably correct great thank you tom andy again i see a question now from tyler and i'm going to unmute him um so he can ask that great thank you stacy tyler what's your uh it's not really a question actually it was just a note following up on that question that public purpose storage had a three percent cap for customers over one average megawatt um energy efficiency being moved to recovery through rates um that cap remains that's actually a 3.2 percent gap now but um i just thought it would be worth clarifying that that cap still exists through 2025 even though part of the cost gets recovered through rates great thank you tyler that is an important clarification appreciate you chiming in any other questions for tom windy or our friends at the puc stacy do we have any remaining hands up or chat messages i don't",

Washington County so welcome director Samantha and we'll turn it over to you and Ms Miller thank you so much well good morning chair Harrington Board of Commissioners it is my pleasure and honor to be here this morning as the chair said my name is Mira samantel I am the director of Health and Human Services I use she her pronouns I'm really thrilled to be here today with Rebecca Miller who is the supervisor for our disability aging and Veterans Services Division within HHS otherwise known as Daves and Rebecca will be taking you through today's presentation and asking your board to Proclaim May 2023 is older Americans month Rebecca you good morning chair Harrington and Commissioners good to see you as mayor said I'm Rebecca Miller I use she her pronouns and I'm the supervisor for disability aging and Veterans Services and in that role I also serve as the Area Agency on Aging director for Washington County of note it's the 50-year anniversary of area agencies on Aging Across the Nation so it's a big it's a big year here and Across the Nation so I'm here to request that you Proclaim this month as older Americans month and you'll be joining hundreds of other jurisdictions across the the U.S in doing so and really it's about honoring older Americans and lifting up the diversity and power of Aging in our community and you can't see them but I have about 30 plus staffs behind me that Empower older adults across the community and countless other contracted providers that really help uplift our older adults in the community and where do I point that right there perfect so on this slide I'll just tell you a little bit about older adults in Washington County we have approximately 109 000 residents who are over 60. that's 18 of the population about nine percent are 85 and over there are more than 40 languages spoken at home by older adults and 11 are non-white and are Hispanic or Latino at a disability aging and Veterans Services we serve people 18 and older with physical disabilities adults age 60 plus and their unpaid caregivers and Veterans as we live longer and healthier lives and the Aging population grows more diverse there is many ways to age well as there are people there's no one way we all need to find Creative Solutions to ensure we Thrive as we age today I'm going to share a little bit about how Washington County empowers aging without this is a little hard to read on the slide so I'll just I'll just say that read the slide for you so for those at home or with a low vision they can they can also participate so these are the key services and programs this doesn't represent everything we do but it's really the Highlight so Veterans Services information and referral through our aging and disability resource connect or adrc in-home services for aging well at home a family caregiver support nutrition services legal assistance and Elder rights production long-term care Options Counseling Medicare counseling training workshops and public education and system navigation and of course advocacy for services we're busy so these programs are delivered in the community based you know they're in community-based settings and in the home they're delivered in a person-centered way which allows the individuals to interact with our system in a way that best meets their needs and honors their choices we know from evaluating widely available data about economics Health housing and other indicators and through our own needs assessment and of course valued relationships with our partners that disparities remain prevalent in our and all the personal choices can impact how well we age we also understand the structures and societal impacts of racism homophobia ableism ageism and other forms of Oppression that play a critical role in how a person is able to age well or not and can really impact over time for these reasons disability aging and veteran services is working to increase our success in reaching and serving more of the community especially those that are most impacted by these structural this also is a little hard to read but we had the opportunity through a grant we received in 20 was last year 2022 to develop a service Equity plan to stand up an equity focused committee and fund activities and services including data investigation around how we could achieve the goals outlined in our Equity plan I won't go into detail on that today just we don't have time but I'd be happy to share more at a future time for now I'd like to just show you this graph which compares the population of Washington County older adults to those that are enrolled in what's called enrolled services so many of those that I outlined and those that we are easily able to capture we do have challenges in our Data Systems as sort of discussed in our budget Equity tool that we shared as well so these are these are all free services that enable health and well-being in the community so this is looking at congregate and home delivered meals Options Counseling family caregiver support case management legal services and more again it's just one slice of the pie of services offered at Dave's so the blue bar that you see there represents Washington County residents 60 years and over this is data from the American Community survey and the orange bar represents the percentage of Dave's and clients that are enrolled that are over 60. so each set of bars Compares population to who we're serving by race and ethnicity and also I just want to say that we know that people are way more diverse than these five buckets six buckets that are out here but federal census data doesn't really allow us to to dig in so we have the data for our clients but the general population some of those are we're limited in our ability to disaggregate and so we're focusing the first year of our service Equity plan on the black or African-American community members and the Hispanic or Latino we needed to keep it finite and really drill down there um oh wait let me go back I want to say a little something more here so we know that a well-trained staff and culturally specific and culturally responsive Services make an important difference the successes we have had in reaching underserved populations over the years has been Amplified through Partnerships with community-based organizations notably you'll see that the services utilized by Asian older adults is nearly three times that of the pop their population as a proportion and we believe that's because funding for culturally specific services at our organization over time has been directed to organizations serving the Asian more than other groups so we think it works well and it's a model that we'd like to sustain and build upon so that was the macro level now I'd like to go micro level about how do we Empower older adults and what you're looking at at this slide is let me get my page turned here so this is a program called Time Slips and a memory Cafe that we did so Time Slips is a program that uses creative engagement techniques to help Inspire connections through ART using joyful non-judgmental and open-ended conversation with people experiencing dementia and their care partner so again aging Unbound there are no limits on kind of what's possible for folks so we trained three staff at Asian health and Service Center and they in turn taught 15 members of their of the Korean Community who worked with their family members to reframe everyday interactions into opportunities for really meaningful connection um storytelling and also creativity so these newly trained family members and their loved ones with dementia toured the artwork at the Walter Center so the top photo is one of the pieces of Art and then using these engagement skills they engage they had a conversation and then they took notes so the bottom picture is the in Korean the kind of that the poem that is translated over there on the left so it's really about helping make that connection and and find those moments of Joy because it's a hard hard road to hope there so um this is what the person had to say about the art and and this was the engagement so I'd like to read read the poem for you so the title and again this is translated from Korean life is like living living life that's the",

        "text": " power was uh founded in 2017 under a different name it was acquired by Blackstone one of the largest uh asset owners across real estate energy and and other Industries globally uh in in 2020 um and we have been developing utility scale uh again battery storage wind and solar energy facilities and and hybridizations of those different Technologies uh across North America since that time uh we're currently 114 uh people strong or heading headquarters are in Austin Texas and uh I'm based in in Portland uh Matt who I'll turn it over to in a in a minute um is based in Idaho um but our sort of majority headcount sits sits in Austin uh IPA is a very credible developer owner and operator of these types of facilities um most of our team came from other independent power producers and have been working in this space for 20 plus years um we're currently operating uh 150 megawatts in Texas we're under construction on another 150 megawatts in Texas 100 megawatts in Los Angeles and California uh and then we just achieved notice to proceed meaning we've just signed our construction contracts and uh have sent some some large checks out we'll be imminently starting construction on 150 megawatt battery storage facility in Cuna Idaho outside of Boise um and we have a lot on a lot on the way we have roughly 2 gws uh so 2,000 megawatts of what we called contracted backlog um meaning projects that have uh achieved a power purchase agreement with an ultimate buyer uh and therefore are in the late stages of development and will be entering construction and operations over the next uh two years um we're operating across uh operating our development business across 16 States all major power markets in the the US um and uh for a relatively young company um again only having been initially founded in 2017 and then acquired by Blackstone in 2020 um are are are moving quite quite well along um Matt's gonna talk about the project in detail um Kate uh I think you did a good job of maybe heading off some confusion around um why why we're here today for for a notice of intent for a project that many of you are familiar with and has been under development for a long time and uh in a slightly different iteration um previously held as site certificate that's currently in the process of being terminated um again you're you're welcome to review the notice of termination on FSX website it'll give you the full color on why we're doing this um the very short version is that you know we as the the applicant and the developer felt it was most prudent to terminate that application and start fresh uh we have the time to do so um Matt will get into the project schedule in detail um but in short Bonville power who we are interconnecting our facility 2 currently estimates an earliest um uh or I shouldn't say earliest an expected inservice date for the interconnection facilities of the fourth quarter of 20127 um and uh well we will work to accelerate that with bonnaville in order to just drisk that element of the project um the project will not be built until 2027 and so we have the time to see through through a new application to simplify the process um clean up the the project record so it's all Consolidated within within a single application for site certificate and and hopefully eventually a successfully granted uh site certificate for the facility um so um with that said I'll I'll turn it over to to Matt Hazard who again is the the PM for the project to talk through details and look forward to answering later thank you again for your attendance uh so this is the project area map um the area kind of outlined in purple is is basically our project area that we've done our surveys on and and will be the area that we'll develop um again the project will be up to 201 megawatts of wind and solar um we may do with also what was called the best which is an AC coupled best uh with with the project um and that will be located on approximately 10 acres within the project area uh interconnection we're again interconnecting with Bonville power Administration and it will be on their 230 big Eddie to moop and line and they'll have a new substation that they'll be building which is called boy Ridge and if you're kind of looking at the project map if you look towards the west of it and it kind of hooks down that's kind of the location of of boy Ridge proposed substation and that's there's an existing 230 kV line that runs through there uh BPA will be um permitting that and constructing that and designing it that will all be on Bonville power Administration um and again like Sam said their proposed inservice date is 2027 project studies um again the purple area that that's outlined on that map is the area that we've studied um and we'll continue to study um with with the relevant studies that are um we'll update our survey results that have been done in the past um to account for uh new Aven studies and things like that that are needed in in biological studies um and then site control again it's 4,601 acres under lease and uh the pro proposed land uh use out in the project area is mainly Dryland wheat next slide please um this is a little bit more of a detailed map of the project area um if you can see the yellow dots those are proposed turbine locations um the yellow a area uh down in the Southeast corner of the area that's our proposed solar area and uh storage um and then again the purple area is that heads to the West that long line um of eight miles is our proposed genti route to the proposed boid Ridge substation um next slide please uh this is a tenant of project um again the Environmental Studies will have been done in the past and they'll continue in through uh 2024 um for refreshes um our agency Outreach will continue all the way up construction um as uh we are here today with the noi we've uh submitted for that and with our application for um site certificate will be coming up um and then um late in 2025 we're sus expecting or approving going to have our approval for site certificate and then engineering uh will proceed through 2026 with construction basically occurring in 2027 and then a commercial operations date in late 2027 um as far as estimated homes uh to be powered by the project to be around 52,000 um operational life uh for the project is around 30 years again project acreage is around 4,601 acres and then estimated capital expenditure is around million next slide please uh Summit Ridge renewable energy facilities project uh will be designed to align with the Wasco County's Vision um ensuring environmental Care Community safety and economic viability um we're committed to doing this right respecting the neighbors and contributing positively to Wasco County's future uh with a submitt of the noi The Summit Ridge renewable energy facility project uh will proceed through multiple uh permits dependent process um ensuring a timely process towards renewable energy generation and then just on the far right just kind of the steps that we'll be going through uh with the noi um the submitt of our site certificate um and then into engineering um then um eventually into Construction and building permits next slide please that's about all I had um so thank you for your time okay can you scroll up Nancy to slide number 16 no this one okay so now we have reached the public comment period um I just want to go over a couple of things as I had noted before the public comment period is open it closes on May 3rd so a month from today um at 5:00 pm there are multiple ways to submit comments you can submit them via email you can make comments orally you're not limited to comment one time you can do it again um you can also use our comment portal we have comment cards back there on the table if you wish to make a public comment oral comment tonight we do ask that you fill one out so that we have your name for the record um again this public comment period is not a public hearing and participation is not required to uh establish standing in the contested case process so if you can scroll back down we'll get to the open public comment so the way this is going to work is we are going to open it up for public comment or questions you can ask questions too um to the people in the room if you do want to comment or ask a question we do ask that you come up and use the microphone so that people on the webinar um can hear as well and state your name and the spelling of your name would be super helpful if you're with an organization if you can tell us the name of the organization that you are with or represent and then once we're done with the commenters in the room we go over to Nancy and she will tell us if there are people that want to comment on the webinar or on the phone and we'll walk through that as well so there might be some webinar participants that want to ask questions or make comments but our first priority is the people that actually came to the meeting in person and so we wanted to open it up to you so is there anybody in the room that would like to make a comment or ask a question okay please come come up have a seat speak into it good evening I'm Phil Brady and live in the Dallas Oregon and I am a wasow county commissioner so y got a couple question questions first uh as a comment I find it interesting and a good thing actually that the applicant kind of drops out of the process or takes a backseat to the process in that latter half and why I would say that as a good thing is um from the public understanding it's you know the it's now the uh OD representing the applicant to the FSC and so it's not like the applicants can't push in there am I is that the way it's designed am I over interpreting this take okay all right I'm going to do my best and if I am wrong Todd will quickly correct me but we are we are support staff for the council so our role is not to represent the applicant it's really to give an objective review of the application and whether or not it meets Council standards and that is our role from Once the application is submitted the compl application is",

        "text": " to have been through several and have invest in face hearing sure based on the experiences I think that's a great suggestion so I um yeah kind of like you know this in in this particular area whether it's a pre-commering you know the the model rules are big on this issue but the OA rules are more clear about how this works or whatever yeah yeah absolutely any other okay okay keep going please all right um so uh yeah uh at this time staff recommends the formation of Iraq which will be relied upon to provide feedback from interested parties about the proposed modification to the rules and we are proposing Iraq consisting of 12 members however this I kind of view this as a uh limit I don't I don't know for sure based on kind of the feedback preliminary feedback I received right now that we will get 12 members so I'm not worried about the rack being too large but um kind of the idea is that we would have no more than two three three two two from each of those categories um that we're going to be inviting to the rack but um yeah tell everybody sure how thank you uh Mr Jackman I was just wondering I I see it says included but uh on the third bullet reviewing agencies Does it include cities it does not include cities shouldn't it I mean the facilities go through cities as well as counties the record Todd cornet um very limited well most of our facilities are not within City boundaries there are limited you know places where some of them do cross it or could be within the analysis area or they could be affected potentially by public services but by and large most of our facilities are in unincorporated areas and counties yeah okay I guess I was thinking b2h which which says and that's cross a little bit but yeah I think those cities you know didn't participate tremendously you know in the process either okay thanks thank you good question so I I think Tom excuse me yeah help the member Condon thank you I was just curious how you came up with the Divide like two investor owns verse three Independence what's the logic behind the number the individual number the logic is kind of a recognition of the uh the number of potential Parts in that yeah so if you were to look at the pool of like potential uh participants uh there are more investor or independent power producers then investor on utility so it it it's the goal the goal for this particular rack is going to be get people who can actually provide feedback so it's going to be people who actually have participated in the contesta case um but yeah I mean then yeah I don't know if that answers your question but I can take a shot at that as well essentially we want to keep it to a manageable size um so like number of people you know too big it's hard to get people together um you know and participating do you want to keep it to a manageable size we want to have you know who really are have are and have and will be our stakeholders and then we want a fairer um we want you know sort of not an oversized you know industry perspective or public perspective or reviewing agency we want to have as much balance on there as possible so we can truly get all kinds of you know opinions representative of our stakeholders but but again balanced okay thank you all right you could have before back Tom okay thank you council member Devlin so remember Devlin can you pull so both for council member buyer and Devlin um I've been told people are having a hard time hearing you online um so if you can move the microphone yes or closely and press the button I'm not trying to pose a problem here but having some experience with this um how are you going to go about getting the nine tribal governments to agree on one representative well this so This rack is kind of based on historical experience and truthfully um the the we will we will send an invitation to any to all nine of them but I it is highly likely that zero of them will be interested so uh we'd like them to be interested and if you know six of them wanted to participate we would probably would probably try to you know make an effort to make room for them but uh I you know I anticipate zero and then we'll respond but that's kind of we could they're considered a reviewing agency and we I mean that's where things go on this rack you know in terms of the allocation I mean I believe they should be there and there should be representatives there but I know at times when we've tried to select from amongst the recognized tribes who to represent a particular issue it has been difficult at times gaining um approval from other tribal interests it's sort of one of those problems we we kind of wish we would have so I it would be nice if uh if we if we had more interest in from the tribal governments but at least as of late um they haven't seemed to be too interested and haven't responded uh however we are going to be having a rulemaking uh coming up that's going to deal with tribal resources and involvement with you know uh travel government so we're hoping that they'll be more interested with that one but yeah good question though might I just this is chair Grill my experience is that uh they they communicate and they will figure it out that's been my experience with my own personal world when you look at the invest your own utilities there are more than two that roll through the state of Oregon and they usually often I shouldn't say usually but they frequently have discussion and they may submit comments together and come to it so I think some of that burden is on them to work together and collaborate chair um again for the record Todd cornet it's also important to know this is not the entirety of the rulemaking so this is to help us vet um ideas Draft rules you know there will always be at every rack meeting it's a public meeting so at every rack meeting there will also be an opportunity for public comment so you know if an entity is not chosen and it still wants to provide some ongoing input there is an opportunity there's nothing that precludes them from communicating with Tom and and writing information to him you know and then ultimately we will have a notification and a comment period and a public hearing so this again want to make sure that everybody's tracking this is not what is going to absolutely create the rules it will help to create the rules it has a tremendous value in creating rules but this is not everything there are other opportunities to participate as well thank you any other comments questions okay Tom all right go ahead next slide okay so at this time staff recommends that Council initiate formal proceedings on a contested case rulemaking which was approved for the 2023-2025 role making schedule staff recommends that Council approve the scope and general direction of the changes that staff has has suggested and presented today and staff requests that Council approve the creation of a rulemaking advisory committee for this rulemaking with memories to be assigned by staff through invitation and pleading thank you questions comments all right at this time I am seeking a motion uh on the recommended action Madam chair yes Vice chair how I move that the council initiated the contested case rulemaking with the scope and objectives recommended by staff and approved the creation of a rulemaking advisory committee as presented in the staff report I further move that the council delegate the authority to appoint specific members to the rulemaking advisory committee to the department thank you for that motion do we have a second I see council member Condon willing to make that second thank you any additional comments hearing none Mr secretary please call the roll Jordan Truitt Richard Devlin Ken Howe yes Cindy Condon yes and buyer yes RC Grill yes motion carries Madam chair thank you Mr secretary Tom thank you for your efforts and we will look forward to working through this with you Madam chair if I may just make a note for I think there's probably been some confusion those who come online and walked into the room while we're handling other agenda items so just for clarity um everything we've done so far is not related to the Boardman Hemingway draft proposed order hearing for tonight there's some other other agenda items administrative matters that we've been taking care of so we set a time certain or at least no earlier than 5 30 which is 5 31 right now so um if Council would like to take a break you know we can take a break um but shortly we will be getting the Boardman Hemingway agenda item thank you so the times 531 and I propose that we take a 10 minute break to get ourselves back ready to move into the Boardman to Hemingway project so we will resume at 5 41. thank you foreign to hand the remainder of tonight's meeting over to Vice chair Hal thank you chair Grill this is the public hearing on the draft proposed order on the request for Amendment one for the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line site certificate I can't how energy facility citing Council Vice chair and serving as the presiding officer for this hearing today is July 18 2023 the time is now 5 44.

want to say there is a little bit of lag in between when I uh um because I'm running the PowerPoint presentation there's a little bit of lag in between when I change the slide and then when it goes on our screen here in the room and I imagine online so um just bear with me but if I'm talking and you're not seeing anything just give it a give it a couple seconds so this is um generally what we're

        "text": " should have a conversation about that one again, because I remember our public hearing last year and we didn't see that cost increase that much from last year. And I think we told the community when they were here last year for that public hearing that we would reconsider it in a year. I defly, this is the only project, we actually had a bid on it. Right. I definitely am in support of the Cedar Hills, plus I'm thinking just the capacity of the ability to manage six projects anyway. So I would say that we should prioritize these, but Cedar Hills would be my number one project that I do think we should continue to move forward on. Commissioner, I categorized it yesterday. The top three projects were Cedar Hills. They have what was their PCI, 46.89. And then the second one to probably move forward was Lakew we gardens and then Oakhurst, and then beyond that it was what is that per gram? So any additional comments on any of the question? Go ahead, commissioner. Go commissioner'done. Good. That's okay, sir. You are now on Cedar Hills. Do we see the extra cost because we waited. Is that going toa be on the utility side? Because we were doing utilities at the same time. Utilities is done. Okay. Cost is only road, so it'll be over that. Okay, because I remember we talked about it, cutting that up. Cedar Hills is pretty equal. It's a $19 difference. Right. And then. I know, Matt, when we had our discussion, we kind of talked about road abandonment, but I think I did was first with you. So did anything come up with that or any thoughts about that anymore? No, we've had very preliminary discussions with office, the county engineer, and just previous discussions with previous staff. Nothing's really materialized of it. It's just kind of an idea of what we would, you know, we're thinking about moving forward. But again, it's just in the very infant stages of a thought process on alternatives to the PCI program. Commissioner, my only thought is, you know, if we're going to do these, like Commissioner Ze said, we got to go through with them at some point. I know Cedar Hills was hard because they filled up the auditorium here and I think that was a big factor in some of the thought process. But some of the roads, we're just spending a lot of money doing them, have this program in place for a reason. I. Mister chair, my question is, at the time that we were looking at these, were we also providing the 15 year repayment process as well? No, ma'am, not at that time. It was in July of 2022 when that's the discussion that came up, was actually just after the Cedar Hills hearing or which you, again, I think is another reason. Maybe we picked the top three and move forward and having those conversations because it does give them a better option should they choose to extend that out and a little bit more palatable annually. And it's not a huge difference of what they're going to pay overall to provide that annual savings for the family as well. Yes, ma'am. Well, when you say the top three, the three that I mentioned, are you considering the top three? Yes, sir. Ye, that was Lakewood Gardens, Oakhurst and Cedar Hills. Yes. Now do those Cedar Hills two was lake where gardens three was occurs. Right. So those have to have engineering done or you can just, we can have the meeting and the public hearing without that. So Lake Weir Gardens would need to have engineering. Oakhurst would also. And Cedar Hills already has the engineering, but we would still go back and have all of our community engagement meetings and workshop discussions. But commissioner, Cedar Hill is ready, right. We will have to go back, engage the community and then do a new bid and then bring it for final hearing in. Commissioner, this is only a list of few projects countywide of all different subdivisions that they are in a very bad condition. And it's not only the dollar amount we are spending on maintenance on an annual basis. It's the workload that is being put on oce to respond to calls and to work orders in those subdivision. It's consuming all of our workforce instead of putting our efforts on the major roads and where we need to spend our efforts. Yeah, we can live with those roads and we can continue doing what we are doing, but it's consuming all of our efforts in that department. The short staff to start with be to be able to keep up with the road system that we have in the county. It's a huge county and we have public road subdivision throughout. All right. Any other comments? Ready to take action. So mister chair. So monir, for the rest of the subdivisions, I mean, is there a way to go back and just install mstus in every single one of our subdivisions at a low cost, let that dollar amount build up and at a certain point execute the bond and every 20 years have a price line in it for money to just put them on, putting them on everyone in pretty much every subdivision that needs it or that's more than 20 years old. Right. And putting it all on a payment plan. Basically it is. And we can do this, but I think we will be going through the same process. No, no, I know we would, but, and they will. But we could even, even for some of these that are bad, we could put them on possibly a payment plan for five years and say, okay, in five years, no matter what, we're going to recruit this amount of money and then it's going to self execute and then every 20 years it's going to repave. Right. And it basically puts in not an hoa, but it puts in a system of road repair so that we stop, quite frankly, waiting till these things are absolutely broken. I agree. That's another tool that can be used and we do have that in some subdivisions. We do have it in some subdivisions, but it's a newer thought process than the what we talked about before. We're installing them if they're not having an hoa or something now in any new subdivision. But how do we get, how do we, is there some funding that we can put in place to help bridge the gap, to kickart it and get the program started? Right. I think you're go goingna start with subdivisions that they still have a good PCI. Yep. And put that in place, go with the ordinance and establish what the rates would be and move forward from there. That's a great idea. The subdivision like the one we showed you today, they are behind the eight ball. That wouldn't work in those cases. We do have, for example, we do have a subdivision of Northwest 44th Avenue. We already have an ordinance in place establishing the MSB for road maintenance. We have not been able to execute a resolution to establish the rate and start to impose that annual fee so we can build a fund to take care of those roads in the future. And recently it didn't come in front of this board, but I recall from my past history, maybe five, six years ago or ten years ago, it came in front of the board and it was denied. Well, and that's why it needs to be done as these subdivisions are being developed and the lots are flatted. So it's already, it's a lot easier. Yeah, yeah, it's a lot easier. What about also going back and all of the projects that we've had success on with these MST, or maybe even the ones we do in the future, putting in place a mechanism so that you do an MSTU, you get our maintenance, but you also, at the end of that ten year timeframe, it automatically kicks into a smaller amount, collecting enough money so that in 15 or 20 more years it can automatically repave. Right. I mean, there needs to be some kind of mechanism to solve this issue that's long term and not just every single time. We can bring you back some options other than this list of, I don't know, on the, try to institute an annual fee for 20 years, for example, and then you will be able to go into overlay. It all comes down to one thing, though, and that's you are taxing people. And when we're looking at what we're looking at as far as what we're having to do to prioritize our spending every year to provide the services that we have to provide, that's where it becomes an issue. So would we also take into consideration the risk associated with not doing it as well? I'm just the one thing I would say I totally understand, commissioner. The problem will not go away. You have an option. We can abandon those public roads and become non county maintained. But what message are you sending to your community? Well, I mean, I think though, after we have, that was kind of my point that there needs to be some kind of end of this process as well. Soam, for instance, if you don't think Roosevelt Village is ever going to be a good example, okay, well, we do this three times, right? We have public hearings. We go after we try. We try three times after that third time, if the community says no, we absolutely don't want it, we say that's fine and we give them back their roads and let that become a self governance issue. That is. And I think there is a process, something to think about. Yeah, I at some point had some conversation with the administrator yesterday about that as well. At some point, I mean, if we're taking the risk, if something happens when someone does get hurt or car get damaged on those",

        "text": " those could increase the cost during the review process but we do want to say that enhancing an opportunity for public Parts this patient giving the council to address the opportunity to address the issues raised by the public and hopefully disposing of contested case issues in a manner that's amenable to the parties uh will make the process more efficient overall um even if it does increase some of the upfront time needed to get to and through Innovative request okay so that said we do need to get public input on what the proposal changes will be the council is already committed to having a rule so the advisory committee for this rule project um we still believe that's the appropriate way to get input on the development of the proposed rules but before we get there uh we're recommending that the council go through this five-year review process and we're recommending that Council and by public comment to assist in that review just written public comment uh and and that when we send out the request we're written comment we also ask persons to uh basically State whether they're interested in participating in the rack um and giving us kind of a brief mini rack application which we can kind of compile and bring back to you so you can decide who you want to actually be on that committee based on the way that the five year review statutes uh written we're recommending that this notice be given to the advisory committee members from the the 2017 rulemaking um and we didn't have a rulemaking in the 2019-2020 rulemaking so we'll give notice to them we will also be giving notice to everybody that signed up on the Mickey mailing list which is a few 8 000 subscribers uh so thank you for the next that you'll have who signs out of Florida um but are you deserve any concern about who made this thinking is I don't know five years in my world has there's no there's very few people that are I mean I guess organizations don't change but companies that just killed his mother well I don't think there's a limitation that you have to wait five years I think it could be devastated just you have to do it within I I mean the the people that were on the last rack This Is Us people the notice to give to the advisory committee that was appointed to the 2017 woman so I'm just taking a comic five years is a really long time to think that many folks are in the same space as unless that's all I'm coming up in this list is provided to us is just organizations so you're right it may be different people but plus the public notice notification list for rules changes that Christopher has so it's going to be very extensive notifications yeah 100 and people will have changed in these organizations check out if I if I make RFI one thing the the administrative procedure act requires us to send the report to all the members of the advisory committee that was appointed to review the track direct rules um it doesn't I I have to go back and actually check to see if it has this notice but the typical practices that you reach out to those people to say well this is what we all talked about what did it actually happen the way we thought it would um yeah but uh there has been a large amount of staff turnover agents and those organizations that participated so whether or not they'll have anything to say or even really if you're not at the detail since thank you just as a quick update uh on kind of what this five-year review looks like um five questions that the statute uh requires be kind of responded to uh it's whether the rule add the intended effect whether the anticipated fiscal impact of the rule was underestimated or overestimated uh whether there's been some subsequent changes in law that are required will be repealed or amended um whether there is a continued need for the rule and what the index the rule has had on small business um there's not really a statutory requirement to make changes on that but since we know there's other changes that the council needs to make and other issues that we want to consider we're just assuming that this will beat into the report will be feed into those telescoping exercise further making um so if you approve our recommendation today and initiate rulemaking we will try to get that uh a notice requesting the comments on the five year review and soliciting interest in the rack out next week There's an amended or there's a draft sorry a draft notice attached to the staff report we would we we don't have to set any specific deadlines with us we've recommended that we set the deadline for December 1st to give a full 30-day comment period and that would also allow us to kind of Bring Back Our preliminary findings or if we're guiding on the complete uh five-year review to you at your December um but I would say depending on the volume of comments we get back that could very well like the day later than this so this is Marcy and I'm just gonna ask the question we are coming up on the holiday season what impact is there because I know when we as an observer of the audience listening to speed age and forget what holiday was happening and we heard that from the public more than once are we going to get ourselves in an entire boat and get it it's a different volume but you know what staff or Todd or anything you know take vacations and things during the holidays we don't want to have vacations no I mean it's for the record time no it's a good question you know because we get into this time of year and you know people take you know vacation you know before and after the actual holiday so it's a it's a good thing to ask in terms of yeah I think you know our recommendation is yes initiate this notice and solicit comments but I think the question then is is that date the right date so is that enough given you know sort of that week around Thanksgiving you know that people are going to have are they gonna have 30 days they're really gonna have 21 days or 22 days based on what kind of holidays and and is that enough um and if that's referred to you and the team because that number one is going to be processing things I just I I'm going away for Thanksgiving song uh with all seriousness I just want to make sure that we don't overburden your staff when people are trying to actually get to this time of year and then I don't want anybody from the public coming back and chastising this included that I thought that it had been kind of vetted through can we do this um on this schedule comfortably are you going on vacation well I've been here yes and uh I both but these are generated items I would have a common period while I'm on this one also you know it's probably it's not like when we bring this back to you we're looking for your conclusion to do pull me I mean to to create new rules we're soliciting input on what people think about are the rules working are they not working and so that's going to then you know help you know as Chris said scope out the actual rulemaking which then we would trigger in 2023 you know essentially identifying rulemaking advisory committee you know having then whatever the number of Iraq meetings trying to you know create rules so this isn't sort of a full packaging of new rules this is simply soliciting input on what works and what doesn't um thank you for that reprinting that makes me feel better for you I think Christian correct me if I'm getting any of that a little bit off but at least it was my understanding is you know we're we're looking for input from people you know and it could be that the conclusion the council is thanks for that input we're going to stick with the rules as they are and we're going to conduct rule making that's not what we're recommending we're already recommending we're at a minimum you know the the two rules that are not consistent with the Supreme Court decision we also recognize that you know the applicants certificate holders you know Atkinson some concerns about the rules the public does we have some council members do we do as well so we think that you know legitimately you know this will be a pretty significant and Rule May community three this will just help us kind of create that new scope of it so again I'll look to Crystal see correct me on anything that I got on yeah secretary I think secretary corn that's exactly right and the next step for us is to come back to you with recommendations for Iraq that process is probably going to take years you know um well a year ago but um one one thing I I will point out so this exercise is really limited to answering these five questions and then seeing who's interested in being in the um we have a lot on the record already about these five questions and what people think about it um but uh chair draw I will say I you know kind of projected that timeline based on getting us back in front of you uh you know as quickly as possible but that doesn't give people a lot of time to provide their comments or gather their thoughts so if so one other point on there so I mean if we wanted to get more time you know getting into December that would be fine I would also this probably goes with a lot of things we're about to hit the long session uh and so once we get into the long session there are a lot of people who participate in the process that may be occupied during the long session as well so also we push it too far in we may be bumping up into limitations of the legislative session sorry that was Marcy's commentary um just a question about the process they don't remember because I've um sat in on a five-year review uh process and so with respect to the first two uh bullet points uh specifically so when notices given you know when you send out the notice her rule making art for um input are they reminded of what the intended or you know they're they're answering that question based on actually what was said in 2017 or are they just oh I like it or I don't that's okay and uh typically we don't and I will say thing about this tool making is that you know one in that original 2017 rule making uh because of the procedural issue related to statement of objectives like I think there's controversy about well-be-intended effect was um so we can well what we've said and and I think we do in that track notice which I can blow up um but uh",

        "text": " quality energy efficient transportation cost effectiveness and providing impartial and objective information and then finally the oregon department of energy has a new strategic plan which i'm hoping casey can put a link to in the chat our plan has five areas of focus which you see on the right column of this slide so as we're looking at this federal funding and where to invest it we're keeping in mind our priorities to expand and improve stakeholder to build practices and processes that achieve more inclusive and equitable to enhance organizational data modernize our programs and optimize efficiency at the agency so luckily all of these priorities seem pretty consistent with what's coming out of usdoe in the guidance documents around iija including justice 40 and climate change now before we ask you a bunch of questions i will pause to see what questions we have from you oh interesting question in the chat what are the attributes or strengths that you see for oregon that will make us likely to win certain grants and thus become a lens for what we should apply for uh i think we have so many one that came to mind uh as we were talking about the hydrogen hub for example is oregon's leadership on clean energy we have a clean elect a clean and a getting cleaner everyday electricity system that could be leveraged to create green hydrogen in a way that not a lot of states have we have really strong climate change policies and goals and leadership here in the state that i think especially to this administration will make us pretty attractive jen or casey do you have any other attributes or strengths that you want to and i see that ryan has suggested that have strong labor standards for renewable energy projects in our state too thanks for pointing that out i think those are some great highlights that make oregon competitive in different opportunities question for you jen is there a federal or state definition of disadvantaged communities that will determine eligibility for beneficiaries at this time we are still awaiting guidance from the u.s department of energy as to the definition of a disadvantaged community i do believe different federal agencies may have issued guidance on this already but they are interpreting it by issuing their own guidance based on their agency and the types of programs that that they operate and so we're waiting on that information and we're not quite sure how detailed it may be when it is released i will say that within oregon we do have a definition of a environmental justice community and so that has served to inform us as we're preparing for what a disadvantaged community may look like under the federal definition we're still waiting for that for the precise details all right don't forget you can raise your hand you would like to ask a question live but i really appreciate these questions and comments coming into the chat and let's move on to the next slide so underlying all of what we just discussed are the values of efficiency equity and transparency and this is really the essence of how we'll hope to work on these programs and funding streams we will aim for an efficient effective equitable and transparent use of resources however we recognize that there are natural tensions that will arise in this and sometimes tensions between these different values for example we are presented with a valuable funding opportunity in which there's only 40 days to apply odo may struggle to keep the public fully informed or really you know get that feedback that we we know we'd like so our question for you is keeping all of this in mind what does successful implementation look like so stacy has launched another poll and uh please take a minute and a half or so to to type in a short answer and then don't forget to press send when you're done hey should we give maybe 20 more seconds all right please wrap up your response and press send and we will move on to the next slide great thank you let's see full disbursement of funds yes we want to make sure we get the money out the door distribution across beneficiaries um giving people ample opportunities to develop and submit projects grants for both development and deployment cooperative effort in diverse communities and industries keeping in mind the executive order for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions clear scoring of applications making um oregon is all of oregon is served career development focusing on benefits for historically marginalized groups great thank you so much for those for that that feedback core focus of our strategic plan is to ensure that we are working with a diverse range of stakeholders and having a meaningful and inclusive discussion throughout our process to apply for and implement federal funding we will prioritize this inclusive engagement so we have a question another poll for you on that given the limited time to apply for federal funds how can odo support inclusivity and design and or implementation of federally funded programs what is your advice to us on how we can be inclusive and equitable in our engagement on this topic and we've got another bowl while you're thinking about that i see that tim miller has his hand up stacy please go ahead and take tim off mute tim you're off meeting your question yep okay i uh missed the five second countdown on the last one so my suggestions on the last one didn't make it in and i would was just going to say i would suggest based on balancing those values if you could emphasize winning the grant if you're under pressure and then once that's in place you could then double back and focus on gathering more input and being more you know during an implementation or a procurement or a refining of the design really round out some of those other values so there may be a push and pull on those values that way where you can focus on winning first and then do the other later and um the other comment was um oh to consider on which grants or proposals you have stakeholders sort of standing by and ready to ready to help or interested in participating and and leverage those uh partners community partners businesses whoever they are to help you get some applications out the door or information you know prioritize those where you can get help great thanks tim appreciate that yes definitely we want to get the federal dollars here to oregon that is okay i've seen we've got a couple people who have some ideas on how we can support inclusivity and program design and implementation let's give folks another 20 seconds okay please wrap up what you are writing and press send okay great posting requests for input on our website but also sending emails to broad lists of interested parties um great hopefully all of you will sign up for our email so that we can send you emails um advertising communities with low incomes direct outreach and person if possible to racially socioeconomically geographically and otherwise disadvantaged communities staff point people for key groups um a labor staff person yeah that's a great idea and we don't i don't know that we have a specific labor staff person we don't have enough staff people to be able to designate someone specifically for labor but we do some folks who focus on outreach and engagement who try to keep labor in mind and are working to develop those relationships casey is a member of our strategic engagement team which is prioritizing those relationships so thank you for that all right moving on so we also understand that applying for federal funding involves several resource-intensive steps such as drafting an application collecting letters of support and tracking project activities and reporting back to the federal grant agency once you receive the award understanding and administering federal funding can be very time intensive and difficult due to lack of capacity or expertise on the other hand many others already have experience managing federal funding and are ready to sustain or expand this level of activity and or implementation of federal funds and so our question is whether there are ways that odo can support communities applying for energy related federal funding under the iija so with that um we also have another poll that has been launched so go ahead and take a couple of minutes to to provide your response to how we might be able to support communities who are thinking about preparing applications all right let's give folks about 20 more seconds okay please go ahead and wrap up your response and press send okay some good advice on partners who've already scaled up their capacity and get them to help those that don't have capacity or stand up a team in oda that has capacity yes that's great we have a legislative concept for providing access to expert consultants may guide may help guide through the process step-by-step tutorial distribution areas decided instead of first come first serve application which favors people who have the time to holistic approach to working with webinars are helpful good grant writing expenses yes can be formidable for many applicants consider subsidizing it for disadvantaged groups yes first come first serve has has some benefits but definitely runs the risk of benefiting those who are already all right thank you for that feedback moving on we understand that the effort to bring in new people or new organizations to the level that's needed to manage federal funding can be very time intensive as well as a high learning curve and as was pointed out in some of the comments there may already be people who can sustain that level of activity so we've learned lessons as an agency from our past experience and our current experience with managing federal funds they're an amazing resource but the aspects cannot be overlooked the management of federal funds um to manage it effectively it needs a certain level of expertise and that level of expertise can grow if a project involves construction which carries more federal requirements than other types of and so with that we're wondering about what best describes your capacity to implement and administer federal funding would you say that you have the capacity and expertise to implement an administer if you're or are you unsure if you have the capacity and expertise or are you at the stage where you know you lack the capacity and the expertise and would need assistance from some other source in order to to be able to apply for federal funding so if you could go ahead and mark where you think you're at in the poll that would be helpful as we're gauging um the from the self-assessment of where different community members might be at all right let's have 10 more seconds on this one please get your response in and don't forget to press send great a lot of people unsure or know they lack capacity to know thank you and that's the perfect lead-in for our next question so if you are among an organization that lacks the capacity or um is there substantive energy education or technical assistance that odo can provide or offer to your community to help you be better positioned to apply for and receive federal funding so if you can go ahead and type in your short responses to this",

        "text": " one on the advisory committee says, well, there's a subdivision. Don't you think maybe you better look into this more? Then it goes to the commissioners and no one says, well, it looks like it's good to go, so they go ahead and do it. They did say that there was a orange sign that says zoning change on the highway, on highway 40. And they said there was a sign there. Well, I told them, I said I went by there for ten years, going to work downtown Ocala. I looked over there every day for the past ten years when that TNT distributors distribution built their building there and everything, and the road going back there, and I. And I'm thinking there was. I didn't see no sign. If it was, it had to be way off the road. And when you're going 55, 60 miles an hour, you don't see a sign like that. So this past Thursday, it was so bad that I stayed in the house, and I've done it before, because it's repetitive, over and over and over for five or 6 hours. So Friday I decided I drove around a mile and a half around the gun range, a mile and a half away. And you can hear the gun. If it's quiet, the winds and everything, you can hear it a mile and a half, 2 miles away, but we're at ground zero. We can hear it. It's terrible. I'm in the house and you can hear it. So I had to go to the airport, Ocala airport, there's an issue. And so I went over there and talked to the administrator, Matt Gro, went into his office, sat down, introduced myself. He says, oh, you must be here for a reason. I said, yeah. And he said, well, how can I help you? And I said, well, the Marion county sheriff's department. And right away, off the bat, he said, God, it was a war zone over there. Thursday, I could hear it in my office. He's in his office at the international airport, and he can hear the gun ranging. Mister lamplight, I just want to advise you about your time. Okay. So, you know, after he told me that, I said, there's something wrong with this. So something needs to be looked at to find out how zoning got. So I can quickly tell you, zoning is. It's a 300 miles. Excuse me, a 300 foot notification. So anyone who's living within 300 foot of the proposed zoning change does get mailed a letter. Your 150 yards is probably outside of that. So that's why you didn't get a letter. But we do notify people passing by based on what they told you, a posted sign. And also we do put it in the newspaper for public record that this is public notice. I would say that it will be being considered by the board with the time and the date, so it is approved. They do need a place to prepare and practice. That is a gun range that has been established I don't know what we can offer you at this point, unless. Mister Boylenes, you have some suggestion? No, commissioner, we made. We were made aware of the incident that happened, I believe, last week. And our facilities director is coordinating with the sheriff to see if anything else can be done to mitigate any impact or any concern. Thank you. We'll do what we can, but thank you for bringing it to our attention this morning. We're going to pause public comment at this moment, and we're going to go into our advertised public hearing. So, proof of publication. If I could get the clerk to give us proof of publication. This is the public hearing, which is the first of two public hearings to consider an ordinance to amend the Marion County Land Development Code Division 4.2, zoning classification, to reformat the list of permitted and special use permit uses, development standards, setbacks for uses and structures for principal, general accessory and specialty uses, from a list format to a table format, as well as provide for any scrivener corrections. I have proof of publication of legal ad number 995-1344 entitled Notice of Public Hearing, published in the Star Banner newspaper on March 18. Thank you very much, Madam Clerk. I'll turn this over to Mister Ken Rayrock. From growth services to present Kenway or Co. Gross services. This is a staff initiated land development code change where we're simply, for the most part, just changing the format from the list back to the tables. Years ago, we were with the tables, and then in 2017, thought it would be pretty to make it into lists for each zoning classification. And that turned out to be a problem with trying to give information to citizens. You have like say, b four. So now we're giving you all of b two and b one list. So you get a big packet when we could just give you a table. And that is what we're here today to do. And there's. So we can go through the material, but it's really just a format change back to the tables. With the exception of a scrivener error of changing four. 2.22. Rural. Rural recreation rural resort. Yes, rural resort, but it's recreational resort was the actual name of the zoning classification. It was in the intent, but somehow the title got changed. So we're changing that back. And then we have a few formatting errors in the pud section, where when you have the multiple indentions, some of those were. I can bring those up to show you. Some of those were a's instead of ones. And we found a few more that we'll clean up before the next public hearing. And it's literally just a formatting change there where we messed up the indentions. So again, we're not making any major changes other than the format to make it more user friendly to the public. That is correct. Today we are proposing no changes because I wanted to do this as transparent as possible, especially for the board, so that, you know, we're not trying to slip anything past you. After this is done, we're going to come through and clean up the tables and we're going to bring in some other changes like buff. We're going to propose a workshop to work with the board on buffers and stuff like that. So that's. That's the next step as long as we don't have applications from citizens or groups to change the code because that those take priority because they're paying. Thank you, Mister Rayrock. Any questions for Mister Rayrock from the board? Just a comment. Yes, on page 30, your commercial zoning district intent and purpose table. I'm really glad to see that come back. I understood it was for some reason eliminated in the past in my briefing yesterday, but I think that really is going to be helpful. Thanks. A good job on that. Do we have anyone in the public who would like to address the board? I do have three people who had signed up previously. Dana Cawthon. Eric van Wagner. You'd like to come forward. Mister Van Wagener. And behind you we've got Deborah Van Wagner. Okay, very good. The wifely thing to do. You'll just give your name and address for the record. Eric Van Wagner. 4198 East Highway 329. Anthony, Florida. I originally signed up to speak today because the paper messed up and told us this was about the meeting they're going to have on the 16th. But I still have something to say. County and horse farms forever is severely overreaching and they don't realize the storm that's coming. Mister Van Wagner, is that pertaining to. Oh, yeah. It pertains to this because they're trying to. They're trying to take the words rule out and they're trying to change the code and it also pertains to. There's a zoning change coming. And this is all interconnected. It's a constant infringement on our land rights. And this is just a small part of it. And I'll go more in depth in the next meeting. I won't take up too much of your time, but basically what's going on is horse farms forever in conjunction with Grove services and LDRC. And I've had to learn all this in the last two weeks, I'm a farmer. I don't want to be here. I want to be raising cattle. But y'all have intruded into our public, our private lives and you're taking our private property rights away. And I had listening to the man that was here with the gun range talking. This is a big question we have about the zoning. You. You explained to the man that everybody that gets his owning change has to be notified within 300ft. What they're going to do on April 16 meeting is implement zoning change for all. A one, a two and a three properties. And we have not seen a sign. We have not gotten a letter and no one knows about this. And how does the county not send us a letter or notify us? We all, technically in a one, a two, a three properties should have a zoning change sign in our yard because you are instituting a zoning change. So how come we weren't notified? We were notified in the back of the sports section on a little piece in the back of the paper. But y'all haven't done your due diligence to notify us in the county. So I just need an explanation of why the county isn't responding. I'll keep it short so maybe these guys can tell me how we're not notified. Sure. Commissioner Zalik, if you. I mean, this is not. And I understand your frustration. Honestly, I think I understand. But just because you have a one property does not mean that you made application to",

        "text": " to the next slide okay so people always want to know what do these look like um this was a lot of one fun aspect of this is that what looks like a truck container in front of you is actually the one megawatt four-hour battery provided by a company called powwin in tualatin oregon so we're really excited to be able to do this work and pge is is uh learning and investing and we're doing that in partnership with a local manufacturer of uh energy storage products so um we're really fortunate in our area we not just pow wind but we have another battery storage manufacturer right in our backyard in wilsonville so there's a lot of and manufacturing expertise that's that's coming to oregon and that's pretty exciting so if you would the next slide we were we were in the infancy of doing this when uh i just really appreciated roseanne's presentation because they've done such great work into getting in the details of of planning these resources and understanding the economics behind them and pge was doing this without maybe the benefit of that great analysis but we did work hard to involve the community in this resiliency planning and i wanted to talk about that a little bit if you'd switch to the next slide please so it's clear you know the old utility model is we're delivering energy to our customers and we know how to do that and we know what's best and you know and we'll take care of this and i think that probably was um fine 40 years ago but as we all know the landscape is changing so much with safety power shutoffs resiliency requirements climate change you know there's a there's a whole list of reasons why we need to change that utility model and this project that we did in beaverton i think was a great demonstration of that if you would the next slide please so this speaks to you know the resiliency part of it a little bit i'm going to talk about two things we're going to look at the resiliency reliability and then we're also going to look at the grid services because i'm an advocate that says those things need to be looked at together you would have a very difficult time excuse me lost my training thought for a moment you'd have a very difficult time justifying these projects solely on the basis of resiliency and reliability and you know roseanne used the term superpowers i love that um because these systems do have the ability to to provide value not just when there is an outage but you know when when we're grid connected as well okay if you go to the next slide please we did a fair amount of work um internally with community uh stakeholders also with the oregon public utilities commission um in determining where would this this was our first behind the meter microgrid where would this be located um we had at least a half a dozen options and we had some people very enthusiastic about uh you know saying hey put it in our backyard and we needed to be very thoughtful and careful about how we did that if you would the next slide so with those stakeholders internally in pge also with our stakeholders and with the um public utility commission we created a fairly complex um matrix uh and and uh a scoring sheet for how we would analyze where does a microgrid go and i just want to kind of hit some of the the high points here the criteria on the left-hand side locating it near a critical facility obviously hospitals law enforcement fire stations water treatment etc um you know as opposed to a privately owned manufacturing operation so in our rubric you were obviously scored higher um if you were if you fell into one of these categories um one thing from a technical standpoint so the next criteria location near a distributed energy resource having a battery as a resource is a wonderful asset right they work better when they're coupled with something else and that something else could be solar that something else could be a rotating machine but just a standalone battery as we could all understand has limited value because that battery is going to run out so locating it with additional um distributed energy resources is a value and and scored higher in our scoring um here was the third one seems really obvious but it takes some work to figure this out especially in western oregon is not having that in a flood zone or a landslide area um or someplace where the cascadia subduction zone you know will liquefy the the soils and and basically destroy your installation so we looked at a facility that has other distributed energy resources not in a flood zone not likely to be wiped out by a landslide and then some uh you know more socioeconomic impacts is it in a highly populated area you got scored higher for that and then located in an underserved community and i won't go into all the details this was a fairly complex analysis that we i did want to point out if you go to the next slide that in addition to our data that we have internally at pge um there is also a wealth of public information out there it takes some hunting to find it but there are overlays that you can retrieve um that'll work with google maps and what a wonderful technology that is then if you'd switch to the next slide just wanted to quickly show um i mentioned our dispatchable standby generation program dsg program what's interesting about these sites so all these little pins on this map in our service territory these are sites have an interconnection to our grid they have a full communication system normally with fiber optic they are very tightly and directly integrated into our system these make wonderful locations for battery energy storage and and micro grid development not that that we're limited exclusively to these it's just that they kind of tend to score a little higher in the matrix and beaverton public safety center by the way was one of it was a dsg site and does have that tight integration really helps you know from a technical and cost standpoint of getting this done if you would switch to the next slide i'm going to talk a little bit about the benefits um and i do want to can i just wait um you're at about the 13-minute mark and we've got a bunch of questions in the chat for you oh okay i don't know how you're feeling but if if if you can i can get through what you have planned real quick then we'll have time for the questions maybe i can do it i can go through this very quickly um i wanted to talk about the there's a value for the customer for this resiliency and roseanne went over that beautifully so let's go on to the next slide the next slide and and i want to stress on this slide these i wanted to put some actual numbers on there oops sorry back up one wanted to put some actual numbers on there um i want to stress that these are specific to pge's system okay that's really important but we have requirements for frequency response and we're getting pretty good at quantifying the benefits of these energy storage systems while we're grid connected for our grid support okay now if you move to the next slide there's a quick rundown of upcoming projects some of these are actually in construction and underway some of them are approval for capital but we're actively going after these projects next slide please this is one of my a project i get very excited about this is a front of the meter micro grid a community micro grid serving the city of portland's public works building and this project is just getting underway now we've got some initial capital funding but this will be a microgrid on a section of our feeder and that actually passes through an underserved low-income community and then ends up at the public public works campus up there and let's go skate through these next one please and i always like to end with a bang so if you'll put up my last slide we'll go to questions thank you perfect okay let's do all right first step this is a an easy one uh either or um who's or maybe both who's responsible for the maintenance on the project in beaverton pge or city of yeah great question the quick answer is um pge is we contract a fair bit of that out so there's a contract for the diesel generator there's a contract for the oh the city has to do their own maintenance on their solar but that's part of our contract when we sign these folks up that we do the maintenance okay great thank you and then a question from ariana how did pge land on the public safety center i'm wondering if you considered the relationship some communities have with policing particularly the black community and did you look at oh we certainly did look at alternatives i have to confess i can't speak to this issue of policing and and the black community i i'm trying to think time wise where that fit in um but i can answer uh very affirmatively yeah we we looked at it was six or eight different similar kinds of locations and then um sort of a related question and not meaning to skip around too much but just because this relates so closely um was pge approached by the city of beaverton to do a project in beaverton or the other way around no it was the other way around so we they got on our radar screen because they were getting into our dsg program and we looked at their site and said hey this might be a good fit so we included them in the list to be analyzed and they did turn out to be the favorable choice okay and then related again um so why was bieberton prioritized over other the question here is that there seems like there are higher risk in higher need areas i'm sorry i was looking at the question so why were they prioritized for a microgrid seems like there are higher risk and higher need areas i guess i have to go back to the the the matrix that we did and you can see it's not just risk it's not higher need um it it has to check all the boxes in that matrix so you might have a higher risk area that doesn't have that solar resource and as i pointed out they might be a great candidate for a micro grid but if all we're going to do is set a battery there it's not going to make a very functional micro grid and it's just not going to be you know the value is not going to be there so i i guess i don't it it's not as simple as one or two criteria there are many criteria that get matrix to him and then last",

in my thank yous I didn't specifically call out Community Services or economic development but every everybody has been working on Wildfire recovery and uh I forgot to say that we got that award mhm from the C pretty cool yeah okay consider adoption of an ordinance by emergency procedure authorizing property tax exceptions for Rural industrial pursuant to ORS 30734 Kelly all right welcome yes good morning course course here as as well uh my name is Kelly whis I'm the economic development program manager here at Maran County and like you mentioned today we're here to talk about the opportunity to reestablish our rural industrial property tax exemption program so this program provides an opportunity for our businesses to be able to forgo property taxes should they meet conditions that are based on the valuation of property improvements and the number of full-time jobs added the purpose of the program is really to help support support our businesses and our rural communities and helping them ensure that they're able to do Capital Improvements to improve their businesses and hire additional employees we established the program in 2016 when Senate Bill 1565 was adopted and then Maran County subsequently adopted an ordinance to implement it the original statute had a Sunset date of January 2nd of 2024 which we then incorporated into our Maran county code and then in 2023 the the legislature extended the Sunset date from 2024 to 2030 so now we'd love to be able to bring to you the opportunity to continue the program up until 2030 as was allowed by the legislature this last year so the ordinance that we're proposing today was proposed to be adopted via emergency procedure in order to ensure that we can continue the program without any delays and that we can continue to process applications particularly some that we know are coming along the path so we've implemented this program in partnership with sore and I really I brought our experts cuz they're the ones who are the ones out there talking to our businesses making sure they're aware this program exists figuring out if it would be a good fit for them so I have Eric Anderson said cor's president and Kip Morris said cor's Maran County Business retention and expansion manager to talk about how the program's been implemented the businesses that have participated and how we can move forward thank you Kelly welcome thank you Commissioners uh Eric Anderson with said core Kip Morris with sore and Kelly covered a little bit of this already but you how the program works you adopted the ordinance uh for eligible projects um a million doll up to $25 million uh the value of improvement is exempt from property tax for a period of three years uh once the project is completed uh the exemption cannot be improved unless the taxing districts representing at least 75% of the applicable property ta taxes agree so it's incumbent on upon us and the and the client to reach out to the taxing taxing districts and get their approval for each project and um the applicants are also required to sign a First Source hiring agreement which is similar to what we go through with the uh Enterprise Zone Program as well and that just means that there any the jobs that are created will be posted with job service and the employment department um we provided some just some general background on the companies that have been able to um you know take advantage of this incentive for their growth thanks to the the commission offering this program and and approving these um the first one is mar and a service um they developed a new Distribution Center just outside of Donald um you know once again these are for projects that are outside City Limits and outside um Urban growth boundaries um the exemption started in 2020 uh 2021 uh the cost of the investment was 2.6 million uh the exemption was roughly 31,000 for 3 years um six jobs were created I did work with Sarah mckin in the assessor's office for these numbers so these are public numbers um as this one was approved for or started in 2021 it is now this year paying those taxes so it is now on the tax rols for that expansion for that project um we did get a letter from um knowing that we were coming before you today um from Tom Wimer of mar nag U just wanted to read a little bit of this um the the um we were able to staff the warehouse and with five additional full-time hires as well as augmenting employment for additional team members of the bag Mar and egg service team who are involved with the product that moves through the warehouse the building allowed Mar and egg service to create efficiencies in streamlining product flow and increased storage capacity that helped improve its profitability ility Marin egg service would not be in this position as a fertilizer packaging and distribution industry leader without the help of the Oregon rural industrial tax exemption program that provided um to allow us to have the scope of the facility provides and the ability to hire Quality Personnel to operate in an efficient and pro profitable manner um and they you wrote a",

        "text": " a no-go decision from from our management in preparing for the in the second phase we go through the drafting of that which is where we develop whatever the project plan may be the narrative parses pieces of the application and whatever projected metrics or impact outcomes may be required as as part of that application to the federal government this is also where we begin drafting the budget in conjunction with what our plans may be and in the short phase there's often multiple rounds of in the final phase is when we seek our legislative authorities in order to proceed for the grant application because our legislature may not always be in session we can we can access this approval through the joint ways and means committee or the state emergency board and there are various processes that we can use to reach that authority and in order to be able to submit this grant and seek additional approval for additional positions that may be necessary or additional spending so if you're wondering how this fits into our overall agency budget it's rather through this emergency process that we're able to apply for these funds outside of that overall overall process for building our agency budget which we're in full swing right now um in this last and final stage there's also the requirements to proofread and make sure that all of our application documents line up with what we really intend and meet all the requirements of the federal and all this typically happens in just 40 to 60 calendar days and after we take out weekend and holidays you can see how quickly the entire program um gets planned in this sort of process and so it's the scheduling challenge of why we're asking for your input today we want to hear your thoughts early and broadly so that we can plan accordingly for the needs of the state and take advantage of these here we have a chart that describes some of the different opportunities and odo's ability to direct the work based on their at this point in time this is based on high level estimates of what we think the funds will be when we think we might see an application open up and how large they may be in the in the scale of things we also have some indicators for what we anticipate will be formula funded versus programs that will be competitive applications where oregon will need to prepare an application and compete against all the other applicants out you might also see that um we have a number of circles that indicate that there are many unknowns and that's the circles that are labeled and for those we we put them in the september box but there's really a lot that is is not known at this time of when those opportunities will become available and the size and scale and exactly which entities may be eligible for funding so we'll be watching that as information continues to roll out as the federal u.s department of energy puts together their plans and releases information as you can also see one of the programs we anticipate to be highly flexible the state energy program is slated to be one of the first ones to be released um either this month or next month is when we anticipate we might start to see some of the application materials so with that um i will see if there are any questions that have been compiled in the chat that we might be able to answer at this time thanks jen i see one question in the chat is oregon contemplating any multi-state collaborative efforts and um i'll start by saying yes one of those collaborative efforts is is ongoing right now and that is a potential response to apply for hydrogen hub funding the state of washington is really taking the lead on that so far and as jen mentioned at the beginning we'll be convening oregon stakeholders to better understand how the state of oregon can leverage those dollars but i think there are a number of other efforts that would benefit from some collaboration including energy security most if not all of our petroleum comes from washington state so as we're looking at how to make sure we have fuel for our needs especially after a disaster working with washington state on that is going to be key so energy security definitely will involve multi-state collaboration and i see we have a question will odo be considering priority funding for categories that do not already have other funding sources several opportunities that have been mentioned have a lot of existing funding um yes i i think that that is uh definitely gonna come into play looking things that we can't already fund under state dollars and actually that's a requirement of the state energy program is we're not allowed to shift things that are currently funded funded under um by the state to federal funds but i'll see if jen has any response to that question as well yes i think as we assess what the needs are we'll be looking at what the available opportunities are and trying to match up the specific funding streams and the in the landscape of what already exists in our state and so if there is significant funding that exists in an area and it appears to meet the need then it would make sense to potentially invest those dollars in in other places and so that's some of the information we're we're speaking from from everyone today of if uh basically help helping us to set those priorities for how we use these funds so that we're using them in the areas where they're most thank you another question does oregon anticipate that we'll need consulting assistance in developing programs or deploying funds or will it all be done with an odo we're looking at all of the applications as they come in and making that assessment for each one um for this uh energy security plan required which is part of the state energy program so we know part of those state energy program dollars will need to be spent on developing an energy security plan we are we will be putting out an rfp to get some consulting assistance um and other um programs when we know more when they when they go from their little unk boxes there to with more details then we'll be able to better assess where we can uh using this existing staff and where we might need to bring in some outside expertise there may also be some requirements that come along with those plots of funding about whether or not we can do that there's another question can you speak a little more about the large pot of funding that will be available for many types of projects i think uh the the questioner is probably referring to the state energy program which unfortunately is not 100 billion dollars but 6.5 million dollars um which is still a lot of money but um and jen i think you um spoke a little bit to that program and richie has put more information about the state energy in the chat and how that funding will be distributed that's what we're currently thinking about and hoping to get some feedback from you all for programs like that where we do have some discretion where there is some flexibility what should the priorities be for the state so i hope michael that answered your question jen is there anything else you have to add on that no i think that covers it not seeing any more questions let's go ahead and move on okay and i think this slide is mine right um so as i mentioned at the beginning uh and was just talking about our goal today is to seek input so we can draft those guiding priorities based on what we've heard and those guiding priorities will help us decide one whether odo should put staff time into preparing applications for specific funding opportunities particularly the competitive ones because there are many and we are limited number of staff and two how we should shape our program designs to best meet oregon's need needs where we have the flexibility and discretion to do so within the federal funding requirements so within that state energy program for example um the the guiding priorities that we glean from today's conversation and the portal input will help us figure that out next slide please so as we think about this how to spend and prioritize this funding we're not starting with a blank slate there will be a lot sideboards on the funding already when it comes to us from the federal government and the administration has shared their priorities with the state which are on this slide so these are going to ground us and i won't read all these but you can see that they're focused on avoiding waste buying american high labor standards equity resilience and climate change and and governor brown has also made it clear in standing up an infrastructure cabinet at the state level which the oregon department of energy sits on that she wants agencies to demonstrate how they will meet these national priorities in a way that addresses oregon's values of addressing climate change equity and racial justice she really has indicated she wants us to make sure we're including the voices of marginalized communities that have been left out of decisions in the past so layered on top of what you saw in the previous slide with the federal and state priorities in terms of where odo does have some discretion we'll be starting with our mission what are the priorities in our mission that you saw earlier in the presentation informing oregonians making sure we have a resilient and affordable energy system transitioning to a clean energy future in an equitable way protecting public health in the environment and balancing the needs and and next we can also look to our authorizing statutes which for those of you who follow along an oregon statute is and the priorities that we can glean from that language are renewable and sustainable diverse energy forms efficiency state leadership prioritizing human needs preserving environmental quality energy efficient transportation cost effectiveness and providing impartial and objective information and then finally we have our strategic plan which i think ruchi put a link in the chat to earlier our strategic plan has five areas of focus which you see on the right hand side of the slide so as we're looking at this federal funding and where to invest it we're keeping in mind our priorities to expand and improve stakeholder to build practices and processes that achieve more inclusive and equitable to enhance our organizational data capabilities modernize our programs and really optimize efficiency at the agency luckily all of these seem pretty consistent with what's coming out of usdoe and the guidance documents around the iija including justice 40 and climate change and i will here pause for some questions from you all before we're going to launch a series of polls and ask some questions for you so remember to raise your hand or put a question in the chat if you have one about what we've talked about so far and i see that we have a question from sela i'm sorry if i didn't get your name right but i'll let you know when stacy's been able uh bring you off new there you go you",

way to get to know the company and also meet their leadership so we'll be working with them on I know the ctec folks and uh the Career Academy folks are all interested in talking about what skills that their Workforce is going to be requiring um towards the end of last year one of the things we talked about what we had worked with um um yamasa soy sauce in the past and connecting them with local farmers to to supply them we see that as a model to um really try to encourage other food processors to to by local and to develop long-term relationships with the growers in the region so we hosted what we called the locally grown supply chain and we had uh seven or eight businesses uh food processors um from the region and a couple um from outside we actually had Bob's Redmill come down they want to talk more with Growers directly as opposed to working through Brokers um and we had uh working with the um processed vegetable commission um and food northwest we had um 15 or 20 different Growers come and it was basically kind of speed dating for Farmers where the they I think commissioner Willis I think you came by that day as well um had a chance to uh meet talk about long-term contract opportunities and uh it'll really get a feel for what what our businesses want our Farmers to grow in the region um speaking of supply chain Northwest distribution we've announced that project recently that's a 70,000 foot expansion of their business um they are a a vital part of the supply chain for our food and beverage and particularly the wine industry in the region um they also do the Fulfillment services for most of the regions wineries wine clubs so if you ever get a box a case of wine in the delivered that's probably coming out of that facility here um one of the recruitment projects that we just heard uh last couple weeks we on the short list to have them come and visit is um project spice it is a um Aerospace um project U we don't know much about it the state has a non-disclosure agreement with them um it is a foreign-owned company that does have manufacturing facilities around the us they're a big energy user so we've been working with Portland General on um how we would be able to meet their needs but we should hopefully be hearing more in the next couple weeks about a site visit for them we like Northwest distributions so much we included them twice um Innovation and Entrepreneurship um we've talked about our Latino microenterprise development program in the past we just finished our third cohort um 57 entrepreneurs registered 47 completed the course and and uh you know half of over half were women entrepreneurs uh we're starting a fourth and fifth cohort another one here in Maran County and then one over in McMinville in the coming in the coming months and that is funded through the state's uh economic equity investment program uh we just submitted last week uh our application for the Mid wamit Valley Regional Innovation Hub and this is something that's coming out of business Oregon to try to provide resources for Innovation entrepreneurs and um TR gred sector businesses that are looking to innovate um our opportunity with this here is I know you're all familiar with Mike White are you know Venture Catalyst in the region um we see this as an opportunity to try to fund that position we've never had State funding to fund Mike's work uh with entrepreneurs and his role is to work with traded sectors scalable businesses that are at that stage where they need investment capital or other capital and need some help making their pitch to get that investment coming in and hopefully taking them to the next level next stage of development um also speaking of Mike I included a photo here Mike uh was awarded a um a catalyst award as they called it at the Oregon entrepreneurs Network annual meeting up in Portland so it was nice to be there to support him and his wife uh when they're up there with the spotlight shining on them because we really have been doing some great work in our region and just our general business Outreach and engagement um we've hosted the Oregon district District export Council where we brought some businesses including High um uh high impact Technologies to come and talk about their sort of export experience with other businesses and entrepreneurs who um identifi kind of take some of the scariness out of trying to address International Market opportunities and I think you all would be like would like to know that uh We've um kind of revitalized the construction Alliance that was so much of Nick's baby um you know when he was at sore and I knew it was important for him to keep that work going on so the sore staff has all sort of thrown ourselves into this uh we have two board members Julie fcol from um Southtown glass and Tony shacker from um Salem electric uh are sort of the the faces of it um so it's businesses you know leading businesses but our staff has been there to identify where we can help we've been uh we've actually set up its own email account now and um look forward to actually one of the things just to keep in the back of your mind they're still looking for always looking for for Community projects to be working on they've um they've done their best work in conjunction with uh really great Community projects like the Detroit Community Center and others in the region so if you're out and about when you're out and about and if you see opportunities we'd love to talk to you about maybe how the constructional lines help noted I had a feeling you might take note of that um I talked about fraes before uh we had the chance to tour um the new um so much attention and rightly so that we have a v Airlines here in Salem um but uh one of the things we're also excited about is our airport to the north at PDX and the work that's going in there with local businesses um we had a chance to get a sneak peek I think it's opening May 22nd they just delayed it oh did they delay news oh I okay safety reason what the opening of the New Port the new oh yeah I saw that on the news um because I'm curious their plan is to basically close it for like 2 hours and reopen it like at 4:00 a.m. it will be at the new terminal and they'll close off what's been the terminal so um but at any rate um nine acres of the ceiling is fa's wood products and the when you start talking about technology the port staff you can point to a certain portion of that um ceiling and they can tell you what Forest that that wood came from um and uh as we're also trying to remind folks um uh Xena Forest Products over in rickel and po County um have the contract to do um pretty Innovative floor tiles for that so uh when you're at the airport and you're taking your picture on the carpet uh of your feet on the carpet maybe we're going to start getting people to take their picture on the wood tiles as well take the ceiling and start saying hey we got to look up and down at uh you know our local content in there um one of the things that's coming out as a as as part of this engagement with the port of Portland is that they've got this um project at T2 it's an in it's a mass Timber Innovation project that they've been working with many um Mass Timber companies around the state including FRS and um as a result of our kind of renewed engagement with um with the port we've met with their Economic Development staff and try to uh identify ways that we can be working together and and benefit from their Innovation um that they're working on for um using mass timber in housing in particularly Workforce housing and also for training and I think there's uh some potential opportunities to maybe look at a project in the canyon with some some uh using mass timber for Workforce housing I know that's been something that's close to the heart of FIS Lumber FIS engineered wood and uh just also as a highlight of coming up our March 19th uh egg breakfast at the Mount Angel Fest Hall and uh we also do have a PK County uh p in yamill County uh taking place on March 14th at um the Eola Campus of sha and just in summary you know in five years our we want s core it's part of our work plan to can to be a great place to start a business Equitable and inclusive business community and a region with unique strengths in agriculture food production manufacturing and technology and I'm really happy with the the direction that we've been taking with respect to kind of highlighting what we grow whether it's wood or grass seed or um you know fruits and vegetables and what you know because I think this region is known internationally for what we grow and what we do with what we grow and what we make and uh that really does seem to be resonating with folks uh that they start seem to understand now where we have Economic Opportunity in this region happy to answer any questions either one no now I just feel like I have to go get a project for them which I'll eagerly go figure out well I just I just want to say thank you for sore and obviously your predecessor in the U rural tax deferral or abatement program that you have used taken advantage of we're the only County I believe still to this day that is implemented that and uh you know our Economic Development staff and pre even previous staff worked really hard to get that and it's you know great place to open and develop a business and that one thing is is so good to offer to our existing businesses to say we want you to stay here and it also is another tool for to attract maybe somebody that's looking for a larger space or to move uh so thank you for being uh the facilitator of that the convenor of that appreciate it well we appreciate your leadership in having that on the books because it's uh I know we I know we have to uh we've seen tens of millions of dollars of investment in rural Maran County as a result of that yeah yeah t and some of those some of those are now paying property taxes they weren't before so yeah just after three years they out tax rols initially I thought it was a great idea to try",

        "text": " permits but we as the bureau of planning and sustainability are responsible for land use related and so just wanted to also note in terms of potential solutions there is a charter uh body that's been meeting and making recommendations to the city of portland about a change of that kind of siloed system of government and so there will likely be a a bald initiative in november to potentially change that structure which may be a partial solution and i have been engaged in permitting issues around solar for a very long time previous to this role but in a previous role with the city of portland and so it does seem like there's a little bit of deja vu of a lot of these issues and so i'm not trying to you know defend or make excuses but also just i think the perspective of some of the folks that work for bureau development services is that they are ensuring public safety in applying the structural code and then applying building codes which kind of as rob was saying regulations exist for a reason um and so one of the things that katie you mentioned that i think is really valuable to raise is looking at the state code itself and making changes there that can then be applied consistently throughout and including in city of portland um and i think that that is a place where there you know could be some solutions um that would resolve a lot of stress and pressure as well on particularly on the structural engineering side of things um and then also just want to note that is a jurisdiction that is not using but a different permitting system that was developed um though it also went online right as covet started as was noted and so there have been a lot of process pieces that we're working through and just i'm really grateful for the engagement of osea individual contractors and community members in helping to provide feedback because i think you know the city does want to improve these processes and needs that in order to make the make some changes and so uh i i would also like to share this presentation that you gave with some folks um in in the city if possible because i think you really simply put forward some some good um potential solutions so i'll stop there in the in the spirit of being succinct thank you it's good to see you thank you james and i think we will move on um we'll hear from let's see here there we go okay so um moving on to bpa contracts with consumer owned utilities lindsey bleithes is with us to share some some information lindsay are you with us and off mute linda can you um unmute lindsay i think she must be honest or elevate her to a sorry about that lindsay i didn't catch that you were not on as a panelist until now you should now your power yeah there you go there we go all right good morning uh as they said i'm lindsey bleifus from bpa and i i think i don't have very long so i will go through this feel free to ask questions though okay so we can go to the next slide so uh bpa operates under something called the northwest power act uh you may or may not be familiar with that but that's basically a law that was put in act in the 1980s that um says what bpa is obligated to do and what bpa is obligated to serve so we utilities around the region municipalities puds etc and if requested we have to re serve something called their net requirement and what that means is it's their total minus any dedicated resources they may have and then bpa is obligated to serve the remaining we have long term power sales contracts with these utilities around the region these are known as the regional dialogue contracts and they are in place for um 20 years these contracts that i'm going to discuss expire in 2028 and we are in the process of negotiating the next um okay so in the regional dialogue contracts uh we do require customers to list any resources that they have dedicated to load um in an exhibit in the contract all right next slide okay so under these contracts we have something called um take or pay and what that means is a customer is obligated to buy a certain amount of power up to a certain point um certain amount of their load from bpa and they cannot decrease that amount using non-federal resources unless they existed prior to the contract or they fall under some of the rules i will describe here and basically the point of taker taker pay is that it provides insurance that bpa can make its u.s treasury payment every year so in general the only way that customers can add resources to serve load is if they have forecasted load above their taker pay next slide okay so what resources do we require to be listed in the contract uh any utility owned or developed resource that is greater than 200 kilowatt name plate must be listed in the contract um must have a meter on it and it allows bpa to enforce that taker pay concept i just discussed um power and transmission contracts have similar size thresholds so yeah it gives bpa visibility and it allows us to bill our customers next slide next slide please thank you so when can a customer add a resource to serve load again i said if they have forecasted load growth above that taker pay amount and usually we look about five years out to see if they have that load growth another way they can do it is we allow customers to add small resources that can offset the taker pay amount but only one megawatt nameplate in aggregate so they could for example have five um or four you know resources that add up to one megawatt nameplate and then they've reached that uh cap there and i see i have a question i think james just still had his hand up maybe okay and i'll let you go ahead i'll i'll interrupt you don't need to worry about the hands i'll interrupt okay no problem all right so um and then customers can add resources less than 200 kilowatt name plate as they see fit there's no contract requirement or metering requirement under the 200 kw so how does a customer remove a resource from serving load well again we'll point back to the northwest power act there are some very strict rules about how to remove resources and basically you have to go through this big internal policy process and get permission from the bpa administrator unless the resource was lost due to you know catastrophic event etc all right next slide okay and then we have something in our contract called consumer-owned resources what this means is these are customers of our utilities we call them consumers so customers of our utilities are welcome to have resources um we just ask that if they're 200 kilowatt name plate or greater um that they're listed in the bpa contract have a meter on it and then the utility has to tell us um a one they get a one-time election on how this resource is going to be used is it going to be used like rooftop solar to offset that facility's load or is it going to be scheduled out and marketed so they get a one-time option on how it's going to be used we have a couple different categories serving load serving load other than on-site load and then serving both on-site and other than on-site okay next slide uh there are some other resource terms uh purpa for example i'm sure you're all familiar with that bpa does not enforce taker pay with purple resources and that's because customers are required by law to take the output of these resources so in some cases they have no choice so we do not enforce take or pay with that um there's also resources that utilities may own that they have not dedicated to serve their own load they might be selling them out um and in that case uh we just list them on the in the contract and require a meter on them um and then finally there is something called merchant or independent power producers that's when a develop comes to a utility service territory and it's just there for the sole purpose of developing their resource and then selling the power out um we do not require that those are listed in the contract but we do require a meter on them um so that we still have visibility into the resource and we can calculate the um customer's total load all right next slide any questions all righty thank you lindsay that was very concise and um informative that i know a lot more than i did before about these bpa contracts so thanks for that i do have a question in the chat for you lindsay um this is from diane representing small business interests again does the bpa track how many certified firms participate in bpa's listed or metered certified in this context would be companies that are certified by the federal government or state it was a it was too some i think she maybe missed a word at the end to maybe cobid do you know cobid certified firms that participate in the like the resource projects i don't know if diana if you can come off of mute and just share sure i i put it in the chat as well because in case it would be helpful to have it under the eyes diane henkels for small business utility advocates um representing small business interests and um uh just wondering bpa federal so uh and then we also have state so what i'm talking about is is whether whether bpa has uh been able to uh track at all the participation of by certified firms for the federal government it's kind of understood historically as like uh minority women owned uh and just spanish businesses otherwise and in oregon analogous i include the co-bid because in oregon the analogous is the certification office for business inclusion and diversity and in this way you can kind of track what is the benefit to these businesses of these projects or you know what's the participation level so that's that's the concept um for now that's what i'm asking yeah thank you so since we're a wholesale utility we sell power to the utilities um we do not track you know who's part of developing a resource or sometimes we don't even track you know where the resource is coming from we just track if they're offsetting load or not and they just tell us hey you know city of ashland for example sorry to pick on your tom city of ashland's developing this resource um we're putting it in the contract it's 300 kilowatts that's about the extent it's solar um of the information",

plan map Amendment and zone change case number CPC CC 2302 for property located at 5465 Road Southeast the criteria applicable to this application are found the Revise Code chapter 64025 and Ma amendments 2 65.5 qu judicial zone changes failure to raise an issue prior to the close of the public heing with statements their evidence sufficient to afford the Planning Commission and the parties an opportunity to respond to the issue concludes appeal to the land use board of appeals on that a similar failure to raise constitutional issues relating to proposed conditions of approval for cludes an action for damages in Circuit Court all you're sorry I have one more I'm having computer keeps reading so I'm sorry I have one more thing to read um prior to the conclusion of the hearing any participant May request an opportunity to present additional evidence or testimony Planning Commission will then either continue the public hearing or leave the rec for these seven days and now liia you're on good evening my name is Olivia Adas I'm with the planning division the case before you is comprehensive plan map Amendment and zone change application for 400 acre piece of property located at the for mil Creek Correction Facility we would like to enter the STA report dated November 2023 supplemental reports January 9 2024 February 25th 2024 and this presentation the the Planning Commission has previously opened the planning the public hearing on November 21st while taking no testimony and then continued the hearing from December 19th and January 9th to tonight's hearing the applicant's proposal is currently to change the comprehensive plan to mixed use single family industrial and Industrial commercial with corresponding zone changes outlined in your sa the subject property is approximately 400 Acres located south of Kuba Boulevard and on the east and west sides of TR Road Show in Korean scen the southern part of the property is boarded by D road on the eastern boundary Corbin University and mil Creek Corporate Center are located to the Northeast and then the southern part of the boundary is boed by the city limits and urban grow the proposed designations for the northern portion shown in Gray is General industrial which is entirely north of L the Western portion of the property west of Creek is shown in purple is proposed for IC industrial commercial the Eastern portion is proposed for mixed use shown in blue and on the southern Southeast portion of the property single hairan residential shown yellow the zoning map paints a similar picture with the implementing zones IG industrial General industrial and gray industrial IC commercial industrial and purple mixed use three in blue and rs single family residential the STA report and additional supplemental reports have addressed the appropriate decision criteria are for the proposed zones the supplementary reports address comments from the applicant regarding implementation of 120t area around mil Creek and after discussions between staff and the application a reduction of that 120 foot on the Eastern side of the property is part of the recommended conditions of approval which I'll address later in this presentation I have some aerial photos and photographs of the property that'll breakdown in smaller areas um so just that area showed in the red so there's an aerial photo um showing the IG north of mil Creek and then then excuse south of mil Creek the blue stars U will represent photos on the next line and their approximate locations so at the top um of your screen we're looking North to mil Creek of the distance so this would be the mixed use and then on the bottom is the IG which is just North the milre and then we have um from onsite you have um the IG proposal to on the top of your screen the existing burn which is referenced in your report go to the center of the property same thing so you have the IC um which is west of the creek mixed ju the E Creek Stars again are General locations for the next pictures so the top of the screen you can see the correctional facility old correction facility and then the bottom looking towards mil Creek at the top of the screen the top of the picture lastly you have the south portion of the property this uh photo has rotated a bit from the previous map so North is on the right side of the screen you can see the IC on the west side of M Creek at the top of your screen and then the mix stes and then between the Streets between G turning the RS the primary focus of this case lies on mil Creek depicted in Blue on your map which divides the property 400 acre property predominantly north to south Direction in the North and South Direction staff has expressed significant concerns regarding the preservation of this area surrounding the creek particularly for wildlife habitat repair and ecosystems and FL management initially staff proposed a condition of for approval including 120t raran area on both sides of mil however the applicant pointed out legal constraints preventing the implementation of this position consequently staff issued a supplemental report restricting uses in the I and IC portions of the property subsequently the applicant has engaged with in conversations regarding these conditions leading to the issuance of the final supp medal report the report recommends 50 ft repairing area on the Eastern Bank and 120 foot area on the Western Bank of the creek along with additional conditions which I elaborate later so condition four in your s in your report is where we start this discussion of the varing area the to address the concerns that the Industrial Development allow within the zones on this screen you'll see the area shown in Blue on the west side of in condition to establish foot repairing area for the property and then shown on on your screen in green the Eastern side of mil Creek the condition to establish 50 foot reparan area on the property factors that were taken into consideration for the reduction of the repairing area on the mu3 portion of the property was the existing top Topography of the area the existing development such as bro roads and a large utility lines that run the entire rain that EX the conditions five is clarifying is a clarifying condition which is supported by code for the development of public paths meaning the park system master plan Mission seven implements the current code um for the identified area for the tree and vegetation rable under condition six development is permitted is not permitted within the conditioned area adjacent to Milk Creek however the condition allows for flexibility within the designated repair any exception listed must adere to design and construction methods which minimize adverse impacts to the repairing the repairing it's important to note that divisions while considered a form of development in the Salem Revis code will so fully established property lines and will not be detrimental to the repair additionally certain activities highlighted in yellow which are outlined in the Salem revised code 808 on tree preservation chapter are exam from permits within the current current repairing for these for each of these Exempted areas a review of development plans before the city environmental planners the opportunity is recogize a proposal to for development to ensure a minimal impact furthermore clarification of a variance that may be sought by the applicant for construction within the 120 ft which is currently allowed in the code however this provision does not Grant any additional entitlements any such request would undergo public notice public hearing must meet specific decision criteria lastly regarding the driveway located on the Northern section of the property the 20 foot repairing area was not intended to prevent the northern portion of the property from access to Turner Road or future development allowing a driveway outside of this is existing burm which was shown earlier and in an area already used for Access for farming on the property would allow access with a minimum impact to the area condition one is a Federal Regulation for any ground disturbing and is listed to ensure the applicant has Direction and as early in the process as possible to start moving forward addition two is a standard language for development and the flood plane similarly addition three allows the applicant plenty of Le time to obtain State permitting lastly trip cap is essentially just to ensure that the trips did not exceed what the current zoning allows for you did not receive any um comments from the neighborhood of Association or public there are attached your sta report comments from agencies and if they're addressed in the staff report staff recommends um approval as identified in the supplemental report dated February 27 I am available for any questions if you have any I also have a team of subject Manor experts that can answer questions thank you very much let me turn to the Commissioners and if you have any questions vice president erard could you explain to me about the road how wide it is it's a class two or something the driveway that comes in I'm just curious about that the um the applicant will have to apply for a class two driveway approach permit at the time of development okay um so they would have to you know again they would",

        "text": " councelor Gonzalez did you have a comment you came mute no I didn't no okay thank you wanted check but if you have other ideas the coen's a great thought um electric vehicles or the low emissions vehicles um having those added into our dashboard would be fantastic um so I'll be working with Brian Z on getting a lot of that data and seeing what we can use for that um and that would be something that could be available on an annual basis pretty easily you might be able to get some of that data a little bit more frequently some of it just won't be available in that level of uh specificity um then en1 climate Champion project so that is where um we are looking at kind of a green business program um and I am working with Maring County um they have Earthwise and they've invested a lot in um having that um be using the uh green Biz tracker so that's a very expensive program it gets very into the weeds with these businesses and organizations on what they're doing so it's asking them for square footage of the buildings um it's asking them for energy consumption it's a indepth program and that has a lot of benefits it allows people to really see how they're doing and because it's a sophisticated um software it actually allows them to track how they're doing so they can see it themselves um and I don't want to compete with this program not only do they have the fancy expensive program but they also have grant funding for these businesses as well and I don't think that I could scrape together a program that would be cost efficient and should compete with that and so to really support what they're doing um they have some Geographic constrictions um half of or not half but part of our city is in pulk county and so um being able to expand that uh through all of Salem to West Salem um would be something that I could bring to that conversation and um help with expanding the program to West Salem businesses and it would be the businesses in Salem would be eligible for a special badge that very City of Salem and we can have that be cute and show that they care about being um Salem green businesses and they've also asked for it to be a chance where I would be able to network with those businesses and discuss more of the climate action plan goals and so having that collaboration and getting some of the buy in for a lot of these um big picture projects that we don't have control over but having voluntary Buy in would be extremely beneficial and then uh energy 29 uh that's working to create a network of renewable micr grids um one of the grants that Heather's worked on and that is going to be finishing up in end of 204 so I'm just working on that and seeing how that goes and seeing if there are opportunities to expand that program and how it's how it's working out for this is a micro grid program yes it's in southeast connected to the new operation right so we have well do we have a vision for multiple not yet micro grids in the cap that we on that's PG go that's pge's a little bit of it covers um Community benefit agreements so PGE has to get so much of their energy to be um no missions and so what it could look like in the future could be onling more of these types of projects and having them go towards um pge's um renewable energy Supply right you know we talked a little bit about this when PGE did their presentation um I think there's a lot of opportunities in the city to benefit from pge's new requirements to purchase locally local green energy um and it fits in with the resiliency angle with the micro grid as well and the airport I think there's just a number of pieces that if we had a a lar a longer strategic plan around this um could shift the conversation a little bit and free up resources I think they have a mandate to 20% of their electricity from Community sources non utility scale sources uh which creates a market for locally electric it's all connected with the micro significantly increases resiliency in Adverse Events it just seems that you know if we think about this as a longer term 5 10e plan could in a in a good position I don't know how to get there but I will just that up I'll absolutely keep an eye on how that's developing and if there's opportunities to be agile and to seek future developments in this I will certainly let you know when those become available so one thing to to think about is this year we're going to be doing the design work for the Civic Center City Hall Renovations perhaps Juliana can participate in that process and talk about steing that work also so just being plugged into that because it's going to be 40 million doll renovation to this building we're planning Ro HC system not sure yeah okay so there's there's a huge opportunity there to affect the energy just those three things change the whole D your involvement in that project I would love to be involved and that would fit really well with the work that Heather and Robert are also comping on with the national renewable energies laboratory and the energy straty so that an invite that would there we go we have the perfect excellent um and uh then energy 32 to promote um incentives offered by Energy Trust of Oregon um so in this I'll talk a little bit more in the community um section but I want to be more involved with the community and uh making sure that I'm getting this information out so I'd like to create a public bacing newsletter and um combine that with uh more of the progressive uh comments on what we could possibly do um giving people resources to what they can do um absolutely highlight some of the great work that's being done at the City of Salem and um provide just those those more in-depth resources and giving people that um interaction um and then the things that are um more Community applicable um I've already talked to Cathy and Communications and she'd be happy to pull whatever I have that's that's applicable Citywide and not just for people who are interested in climate action um that they can get that into their regular newsletter as well so you have a little bit of crossover but it would be a bit more targeted to people who are more prone to Pro environmental deceivers oh and um other cool note on that is um the Oregon Department of energy has um earmarked about 3.3 million for funds deployment of energy or of heat pumps in this region so I'm talking to a couple Community Based organizations and think how they might be able to work with helping deploy that in Salem and how we could get that um going um for Community uh cm01 create an environmental screening tools so we have a lot of data and Tools around this um I'm going to meet more with it in GIS and see um if there is something missing and what that is and where we can pull data from to complete that project or if it is completed see what can be um done and how we can incorporate that and use that on a regular basis um Community 37 and this is the create the public engagement campaign around reducing emissions so it's a little bit of what Heather was presenting on earlier from um the uo students and so I'd like to um use as much of their Free Labor as they would like to provide us with and make sure to um present those messages and um doing so strategically presenting the right messages to the right audiences I don't want to come up against backlash and I would much rather have it be more positive friendly aable to the consumers of that content um then uh Community 30 9 pulling into this is um having the framing be more over resiliency so then people who are less likely to engage with content that's about Pro environmental Behavior might be more likely to engage with content that's about resiliency so um pivoting that conversation to get a bigger pool to draw from for materials and waste um so more about my background is that um I would love to be involved in the um reducing of food waste so um I've created some tools and I think that I could um make them more adapted to the Salem Community um and just I'm so excited that you have the solid waste committee and supporting what you all and Ryan are doing and um the recent rate restructuring that was done is phenomenal so making sure that we can get how that's a good thing out to people and show people how to reduce their waste as a climate um strategy we would love to have you at our committee meeting kind of give us your knowledge to the committee I think too um so any questions or comments and this isn't a whole list of every single thing this is kind of to get a taste of what I'd like to focus on but um like I said earlier if there are opportunities to be agile and especially since there are so many grants coming out if there's an opportunity to take advantage of one of those um certainly there there's going to be some legal room to make sure that we aren't missing out on dollars to do some great projects I I one conc is our ability to run effective Public Communication they take a lot of work they're hard to measure the results um and it seems a number of these strategies are public Outreach strategies I'm just a cautious about about that uh in one of the tasks that I was asked to do um I was uh having to go through about two years of social media post so I understand your concerns and I absolutely will try and um create as amenable content as possible that's why I'm thinking that the um newsletters would be a good start because it would give people the opt in opt out ability and so people engaging in that comment in that content would be more likely to want to engage in that content and then from there developing out to what would be more amendable in the community but I'm certainly open to what good could possibly come from going through two years of the social media I was trying to find when the first time we used the climate action plan logo was for a trademark oh it was peripheral but it was gota why would you do that I get your concern but at the same time we can't not do it you know like we're never going to reach our goal without Community buying we canot do this single-handedly like everybody has got to be on board for this and therefore you have to doity outreach but I totally get",

        "text": " um for the incredible support that our Coalition has for those programs and that we will be advocating with the Govern and the legislature to get as much funding in those as possible especially as we deal with the hottest year in human history and the incredible need that Odo itself uncovered um for cooling across Oregon so I just wanted to say on the I guess my question is we won't be see any pops coming forward for those programs it's something that um legislators will have to put forward themselves thank you uh thanks yes the those Pops to extend those programs would not be included you won't see those in our agency request budget again the budget process is iterative so that's not to say that it you know uh given changes in uh revenue for forecast or other things that it won't appear in the governor's recommended budget or in the legislature that is um at this point we've will put forward our agency request budget and provide uh information on the great work that it's been doing uh but it's going to be in um you know if if it shows up now we'll have to show up either in the governor's budget or be put in by the legislature thanks Michael um we have a couple of other hands up I figured it'd be a good time to go ahead and get to those as well Claire prehoda is first up and GL you be next thanks Christie um plus one to everything that Brad mentioned the odo's done such amazing work first with the cooling need study um and with these incredible heat pump incentives we've you've seen exactly how uh needed they are with how fast the funds are going out the door so just um expressing strong support that if the opportunity is arises for Odo to um reinsert them later on as more uh general fund looks to be available um would love to have you join us in what we be building resilience's advocacy to fund um those incentives again so thanks so much for the information thanks Claire and then also Greer klaki next you should be off mute now G can you hear me okay yeah okay wonderful sorry thank you I'm in headphones so I want to check um yeah plus one to what God was saying we're part of the building resilience Coalition here at Community energy project um and I just wanted to State again the importance of heat pumps as Brad said we can see with the fact that the funding was allocated in a day um which is amazing it just goes to show you know we know that 58% of you know Oregon's residents don't have proper cooling systems um and we know that we really are you know hitting a record year for heat um at Community energy project we do you know home repairs and do weatherization um to help folks get that cooling um and heat pumps to make sure that it you know guarantees cooling for all ultimately lows utility bills fin potion so we're very supportive of additional funding for the uh thank you thanks G all right uh now we also have Dave Cobar with his hand up um Dave you should be able to talk now all I just want to start off by saying thank you to the panelist and Nota for this presentation today um I just want to Second also what's been said uh and especially with the what's been going on with the early uh Fire season that you know the heat pump is a close system that protects against Wildfire smoke as well I think that's sort of a timely thing to acknowledge within this thank you great thanks Dave and then we also have a question from Jennifer and she's asking what's the proposal here um she's hearing a lot of support for um keeping the heat pump programs in particular going um and then she's asking can you put a pop forward without an identified fund Source uh can try take guess the first part of the answer is well you go ahead yeah uh so I think it's the The Proposal here is for some positions that would be uh available for funding uh or permanent positions with the funding source being uh any programs that are would have like uh so what we do is positive time keep to the the position so you're looking at our federal programs that come are coming in and any remaining funding that uh would exist with our existing programs that haven't been spent by the by enum that we would be able to allocate some of that money uh or some of those funding to these positions that continue to both uh administer the sunset of the program uh as well as um when our new federal position or as we anticipate Federal funding coming in having some positions to use that funding support the onboarding of new staff or as those programs get ramped up and we also have the Community Renewal uh grant program which uh you know we we do have some funding that we anticipate remaining at the end of this bium that could also be used to partially support those positions so uh that one's going to have to be an amalgamation of uh different different funding streams that we'll have to work with the governor's office and CFO uh and the legislature to um get on board and we would only be able to hire those positions when we have the funding um identified Michael is it fair to say we will not be proposing to fund these positions with the energy supplier assessment uh it is more more than fair to say we are not proposing to um to use Esa to fund any of these positions uh oo would not recommend that um or offer that and um do we have a dollar estimate for the C uh oh off the top I and let me go back to my notes you know what um why don't you keep going on the presentation Michael and we'll get back to Jennifer Jolly with the dollar estimate and then I'll just say there was one last question here that I think I can go ahead and answer quickly um should folks be advocating for more funding for the heat pump program with the governor our legislators or with the Department of energy um I suppose the answer is all of the above are an appropriate venue for advocating um for uh for anything that you'd like to related to this budget um you know we're happy to pass on what we're hearing um as the governor's recommended budget is considered um make sure Folks at the governor's office know what we're hearing from our external Partners um but the at this point the decisions are will be made not not by us right by the governor for her recommended budget and then later for the legislature for their um adopted right I will uh continue next slide and maybe speed it up some here because try to keep us on On Target thanks everyone for being with us so far uh next we have the nuclear safety uh and uh energy uh uh sorry uh the nuclear safety and energy preparedness division is being renamed the nuclear safety and energy security plan uh energy security Division and this reflects the increased focus on developing the energy uh security plan and working with counties on their resilience planning uh in addition to that new work this division continues its role in representing Oregon's interest in the Hanford nuclear facility Cleanup in managing radioactive waste disposal uh regulations which does have some general fund support in uh preparing for nuclear related emergencies and leading the state's petroleum emergency preparedness work this division recently launched the county resilience program which will support each of Oregon's 36 counties in their own uh energy resilience plan the division is also hard at work developing the state's energy security plan uh leading the effort in coordinating with other state agencies us doe counties and local governments tribal governments citizen groups uh utilities nonprofit organizations businesses industry uh just about everyone uh and the public the plan will assess risks and threats to Oregon's Energy Systems and will identify and prioritize mitigation options for Oregon as a whole as well as specific regions throughout the state that can be implemented in the future uh to improve Oregon's energy security a draft of the plan was released last uh last uh year and is available on our website and the final plan will be released this September we're looking forward to seeing that this division has seven staff and 6.25 FTE uh the county resilience coordinator that you see in the bottom right there uh position only extends to December when Odo anticipates the current work around County resilience planning to be wrapped up which is why it shows as25 FTE and chy if there's uh questions along the way just let me know otherwise I'll just keep on going so uh new nuclear safety and energy security is primarily supported you're so so fast Michael um I just really quickly want to answer uh one question that I haven't even read one that just came in um let's see um Linda Craig asked a followup on advocating she said can we submit written comments to you with a copy to the governor's office that's fine it might be more direct to go to the governor's office in CCS either way the right people will get them um uh let me just have a point here from Eric that it seems the mitigation of nuclear risks should not compete with nor suppress the development of new clean energy sources um I think that's just a comment there and then Jennifer is wondering how many counties have applied for the new County resilience planning grant that just opened and I think we got our first application last week um which is really exciting because the program just opened recently yeah can I think Bax is on if he has more that you want to say there okay I am here thanks Michael uh it was Harney County that supplied thank you thanks Max uh so yes this division is primarily supported with grants uh funding Federal funding from us doe for its work on handford uh for the Hanford cleanup and emergency planning uh we also receive fees from Radio R active waste H haulers uh and general fund to support the uh radioactive waste disposal uh and Esa resources are used to support odo's emergency preparedness work including the fuel action planning uh here's a breakdown of nuclear safety and energy budget and I'll just give you a second uh look at that hopefully all feeling pretty familiar by now and here I'll note that the uh special payments are often special payments to counties that help with our counties and other agencies that help with our emergency preparedness and work uh next I'll go to our programmatic division of the energy facility sighting um Division and it's one of odo's primary statutory responsibilities it ensures that proposed energy facilities meet specific Statewide and local standards and are considered with public input and participation uh we've seen a uptick in proposed projects and amendments over the last few years leading to an increased work for the team and",

        "text": " applied for the permit and they said, hey, what's your address? And, oh, it's this well, you have public water there. We can't issue a permit because you have to be on that well, I don't know that, you know, and then all of a sudden now you have a well, well, that you did it wrong. I didn't know how to do it right, you know, and I don't know if anybody really does, so I don't know what to tell you. I got some quotes, then again now to put, to do it the way they say they want me to do it, and it's like, here we go again, like, you know, now reach a little deeper into the pocket and do that. So that's why I did the waiver with hopes that somebody could say, hey, yeah, look at, look at what has gone or happened. And I don't know, have to tell you, other than the truth, that's kind of all I have. Had I known differently, it would have gone differently. Had somebody just said when I called, no, mister Smith, you need to have town water. I wouldn't even be here right now. I wouldn't even be talking to you, to you guys right now. I had to fly down from Pennsylvania to see you people, and it's time I'm never going to get back. So, mister, mister Smith, what's your quote? What's that? What are your quotes? How much? I have one here for 7200, and I have another one on my phone that's 75 something. Okay, and who's your builder? F e heari homes? I mean, your builder should have certainly given you better guidance than that, quite frankly. In what aspect? They should know what they have to do. They build here in Marion county on a regular basis. Believe, I mean, I'm not, I don't own that business. All right, okay, hold on. We got somebody coming up. I'm the superintendent for Fr homes on the day I is your name and address? Klaus inholt. My address is 230 Fisher run. I spoke to a Clair, Clairl Martinez. I made a call and I think believe April 17. I spoke to her, I said, hey, this is a situation. I need the deposit refunded. I already have a well on the property. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You didn't speak to somebody ahead of time. You spoke to somebody after the fact? No, no, no. So I put it in. We got an email saying all inspections were halted. I was supposed to originally when I spoke to Claire bar Martinez, get a deposit back, she told me everything was good, I would just receive a deposit. Never received an email. And then a week later, I received an email saying, everything's on hold by that clear boat. My question to you is, did you, on behalf of your customer, reach out to Marion county utilities to find out if they had to hook up to Marion county utilities or if they could put in a well, we had to hook up two utilities. Yes. We reached out and we had to hook up utilities until he talked to the county and then got approval from or whoever he spoke to. And then I spoke to Claire Bartinez that said basically everything was okay. And then when I got my email a week later, everything was not okay. And that's when everything kind of just went. So that's where I was lost. But I d to make contact. And she, she told me, oh, I should receive a deposit within a week or an email noting that. And then when I got my email, it was an email saying, everything is on hold. And now I'm going toa go back to Jodie. Jody, we're not communicating with Doh about this stuff. Doh is in the review process. I can't say in the past they were communicating. Looking at these items, they would have seen just a quick review on the building permit side of things that this was actually they had already paid or got invoiced to connect to our system. I mean, somedy, something's missing here. There'some communication that is missing here, and we need to figure out what that is. I agree with that. I do want to say I heard a date in there of April 17. Something was going on. We received payment on April 28, so that didn't line up. So I just want to make sure we invoiced, we got payment for the service and everything moving forward on April 28. Okay, so do you have your email or that you received? Do you have the date on that? And then do we have a map that shows the surrounding properties, who's hooked up to what utilities and who has wells? I do not have a map that shows who's hooked up and who has wells. All I have is basically the footprint that's in your package showing the flagline. So, I mean, I've pulled this up. It looks like there are larger. I mean, this is a three acre parcel, number one. And then it looks like, there are larger parcels around it. This again goes back to the flag lots. And how we deal with flag lots. I know. Yes, ma'am, mister chair. I'm good. Any other information you want to tell us? I just wanted to follow up on your daughter. I guess it was the chlorine issue. How severe that. What's going on there? No, she has a sensitivity to chlorine. And like I said when I called, that was my sole intention to, you know, there has to be some kind of filtration for that, I would believe. And who would know it better than the people supplying our water? Right? So that's when. When I talked to them, they said, well, you could put a well in. I'm like, well, then that eliminates all. I don't. It's a non issue. So it was very easy decision for me in hindsight. And then, you know, having a permit from the state, like, mean, what else am I supposed to believe? Like, you know, and then you hear that the county supersedes the state, like, who do you believe? Okay, I got you. Thank you. Any other questions of the applicant? What's the name of your building? F. Homes. Fr homes. Thank you. Anything else? All right, gentlemen, thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. You need time because I'm gonna make a motion otherwise. No, I mean, it's not ideal, but I am gonna make a motion. It's in a secondary spring protection. I'm not going toa say that he did not make a call to our department and get that information. There is some gap communication issues. So I will make a motion to approve it. Approve the waiver. Approve the waiver. Second, a motion to approve the waiver by Commissioner Stone. Seconded by Commissioner Bryant. Any comment on favor, say aye. Aye. Those like, sign that motion passes. Youanimously. And mister chair, I just want to say to the gentleman representing the builder, let this be a lesson because there are lots of lots out there now that this becomes an issue and you now are educated on the process. So I will expect not to see you back here. You guys have wonderful day and welcome to Mary again. I mean, you can come back and ask for a waiver, but I mean, with this type of disc problems. Yes. Notation for action. Is that all? Yes, sir. Thank you. Sorry. Notation for action. I'll make a motion to approve it. Motion to approve by Commissioner Stone. Secondary by commissioner. Goal. Comments on favor, say aye. Pos like so. That motion passes unanimously. Okay, general comments? I've got two people signed up. Joseph Walker, come on down. You're gonna wear that bag out, I got you need your name and address. Joseph Walker, 18820 southeast 54th place, Okawa, Florida. 32179. Okay, we got a problem with a building that keeps moving for some reason. I haven't figured out how it moves, but it does. Give me a minute I to get my paperwork out. Gu get all your copies here. And can I put up a picture of this screen? Can you for me? And here's the ten copies. I made a complaint in February here, about building a house, thats an r four area here, and it's got all these tires in. He has to run a tire shop down about 2 miles away. It brings his tires home. This is exmple of what it looked like when I called on it. So, you know, and that's by the time they got out here, it was down. The problem was, you go to h three, you see what it looked like on the one. I took your picture of here, on its here, black and white, you know, one there what I'll. And then I had Tom Sapp out there, he took another picture of it here on the 21st on it. And see there's less tires in there on it. But he, then he closed it out. That was fine. So then I made it, I went, looked and found out there was no permit for the building, you know, for that shed on there. So I made a complaint for that. And they come out and they says, did not see shed with screen room, which, what I call it garage in rear right corner, that has been there since 2005. It onlyructucture on the building. Well, you look at that picture,",

        "text": " Tom um this is Sarah esterson with the Department of energy um I just wanted to tee off of your idea Jim about staff kind of evaluating comments received on the DPO um I mean I view that as a a fairly formal uh process to take forward but what about opportunities where you know like people feel comfortable of calling the department and talking to staff about concerns they have and help you know like that's what the analysts that's what our team is there to do to help the public navigate information know where to go to look to find certain technical details or better understand conditions or like is is um efforts by Department staff to make it clear that we are there during that DPO comment period or at a completeness information meeting to answer questions about how to comment effectively I mean does that those exist now so I guess the question would be what are the barriers from your perspective of achieving your idea through those that existing um well a a lot of it is I think the initial lack of understanding of the process fear of um asking a stupid question to staff because you're so new or they're so new to the process um so I I think you know maybe um a session for people that are interested on how to prepare common with sufficient positivity with um examples maybe a workshop like that I know the opu annually does a thing about their contested cases and you know they go through all the steps and the rules and try to you know um take the magic wand and make something that's confusion a bit more clear to a late person ready for connection and I would just I would just say that I think you know for an application where we as the department and our existing rules have to do uh um a notice of the complete application and a public information meeting on that complete application that we can continue to I mean obviously we'll think and talk about the idea you just offered but also additional opportunities at those complete completeness meetings for offering better information um I mean we do try to do just what you're saying and so we're just not hitting the mark because it's still you know still unclear I think right and I think that's where folks like us and some of the other um communitybased organizations can help get the word out that there is this um assistance and ability to unconfuse a confusing process but but I'd also like to point out again is that the analysts and the applicant probably have worked for a couple of years to get to the point that they're at where they're introducing the draft proposed order the public has not had that time to research or the resources a lot of the times it's coming at them on short notice and you know because the The public's not sitting on top of their the DEQ list serve and the notification is so minimal it's only 500 feet I believe in um the county and like what's it 250 in an urban growth boundary and 100 in a city that doesn't notify a lot of people that will be impacted by some of these facilities so that the notice is weak and therefore people come in late and are unprepared for the contest they're about to enter so I think we need to look at leveling that playing field and the utilities can hire all their attorneys and pass those costs onto rate payers the public has to take it out of their pocket and that is a an existing Injustice and unfairness in the entire process those that have money can you know do what they want can run over those that don't so that's what I'm looking to do or try to represent that we we equalize the playing field and the time that the public has to so I have a couple of thoughts and i' be curious to hear um if you know what the rack how the rack feels about this um perhaps Patrick could speak up to this as well uh maybe even an could share her perspective but I mean fundamentally the the the playing field will never be level this is not you you are this is not a um sort of like public private uh sort of partner approach towards deciding what projects should be built and what shouldn't be built this you know the citizens elected members and the uh who became legislators legis those legislators passed laws those laws set the criteria for what you know what matters to the state of Oregon in terms of like the criteria for how we determine whether or not these projects should go forward uh you know the the uh the state hired staff to make those determinations and the you know enormous amount of time and resources are spent to then make those uh determinations go forward my my take on this and I again I really this is a sort of a sticking point it's a key point and I so I'd be really interested to hear other perspectives because I am relatively new to this I've only been working for FC for a year now is that the DP phase the contested case process is really about engaging in the public to ensure that fsec has done a a good job I mean it's not always it's not always about mistakes sometimes there's information that maybe even a an applicant you know gets a study that's two years old and it's the latest study they that that is available and we all there's no reason to doubt its efficacy regarding the existence of like an endangered species for example in an area but somebody who lives in that area is aware that there you know has information that neither staff nor the applicant had we want the process to be clear and easy enough that someone with that information can come forward and say Hey you know I think you missed something I have this information I have this data that you need to take into account and then the applicant can say oh gosh we weren't aware of that they have an opportunity to respond to look into it uh and to deal with that new information it's not a sort of like David versus Goliath type of situation where uh we're trying to figure out how we can empower the little guy to stop these projects the projects either meet the standards or they don't and if they meet the standards they're going to go forward that's just how the system is set up so I I completely am sympathetic to the idea that uh this is super confusing I mean I I've been here for a year and I'm still figuring things out so to to ask members of the public okay you have 30 60 90 days whatever the DPO phase is um but we're not asking them to become experts you know if people are concerned about a given standard whether it's no or um you know protected areas uh I do think that Sarah is may be on to something here that you know we we should be focusing on you know we want these site certificates to reflect the best information and so if we don't have it and if members of the public do we want that information we want to make it as easy as possible as clear as possible but it's never going to be it's never going to be well one site has a lot of power so what can we do to make the other site have the same amount of power that's just not how that in my at least that's my perspective that's just not how this system is designed I'd be curious to hear if anybody else has any thoughts I've got a quick thought uh Jim I appreciate and the concern you have and one idea that that I have uh suggested to staff that they might consider is to create a a template for making comments on a DPO we have a template that staff created I think within the last 12 to 18 months that is a template for uh a petition for a contested case but really as as Tom said we'd like to get these issues vetted earlier in the process at the DPO phase uh with the hope that we don't have to go to a contested case that if someone has a concern uh we uh along with the the applicant are able to get that concern addressed if it needs to be addressed to comply with the standards we'd like to get that done at the DPO phase so one idea I have is uh take that template that we have uh for petitions for contested case and uh use that as kind of a basis for creating a similar template so the public understands this what with this is the type of information that would be useful to the department to Council and to the applicant to have at that DPO phase uh so that that's one I one idea that I've had and it's something that that we might uh that staff might be working on uh Max you you have your hand yeah thank you Tom um I just wanted to agree with um your framing of this whole issue and also so um with some of the suggestions that have come up I think Jim initially suggested and Elaine supported in the chat the concept of a regular recurring Workshop to talk about how to effectively engage in the process how to demonstrate um you know sufficient specificity um I think the concept of a a form um that that was just discussed um is is also you know consistent with that line of thinking sort of making the process more accessible uh also agree with what El and said in the chat that that's not necessarily something that's going to be or or would appropriately be enshrined in rules um they're great policy ideas um it's great that we have a venue to discuss them here now um and maybe this is a great group to continue figuring out how to sort of set up that scaffolding um but not necessarily um things that need to be baked into rules um but just I I guess all of that summed up at a high level is really appreciate the the discussion here the way the agency is thinking about these rules and this Ru making um and also um everybody's Collective efforts to come up with ideas for making the process more yeah so just as I'm thinking about what I said and what what you guys uh appreciate all the comments um really do uh I just want to reiterate you know our goal our commitment is to fulfilling our kind of directive to the best of our ability and so to the extent that members of the public are able to help us do that and the process is confusing or is unclear uh or is structured in a way that makes that less likely to happen that's bad so if if somebody if a member of the public has information that would be helpful in making it a more you know better conditions or or to improve our process in some in any way um then we should figure out how to make",

        "text": " be but it would never be so thank you for that yeah that's a great clarifying question and we've actually talked about how it's hard to some of these models and studies are specific to just the region and pacific northwest and then a lot of the power novels including this one is for the entire western interconnect which stretches from british to colombia down to california up to the texas border to the mississippi river so thank you for clarifying that um you know it's important as to what our perspective is and what's going to but getting back to the california current there's three animals that i know other than go inshore and offshore sardines to spawn belongs to about 60 to 100 miles there's not many sardines in the water now but they will be back there so they travel annually at least sometimes more than anybody our fuel is spawned and they're very skittish animals so what are they going to do when they encounter wind farms out there will they get out and respond i think a bigger question may be of some transport systems that the currents provide on the ocean wind move those larvae back towards and there's a delicate balance there and when that currents change detail oscillation or something that may be when makes the sardines start to disappear drawn down we don't know the nco they smooth offshore also i'm not sure to spawn but there's feed they go some distance offshore and anchovies are a huge component of our orange fish but there's also krill there's other items that are you know i don't think they're being looked at at and so as the california current it is it's really what provides the whole ocean framework as as we know if we're going to put 23 to 25 000 turbines up down there eventually on the west coast quit in um what is that going to do do we have any solid answers or we didn't do any this this is being answered more and more by not only the fishing condensate really did an excellent job last night stating the facts of this because he knows that sparked more than detail one night this this thing keeps expanding with what we're looking at i think it's due consideration and i don't think the way we're rushing to get this job what would happen if we destroyed the california car what would happen but there were many major changes it would make the columbia river look small in comparison to damage thank you matt are you um matt wilbanks um i'm here representing with industries where i controlling uh systems and service here at juice bay um my comment is probably gonna be a little bit different than most people i'm gonna drill down on some real specific data i mean the the data and these kind of reading this type of research can be very much overwhelming especially people who aren't as well versed in these areas like you guys are um my main focus here is the fact that our our business is almost totally dependent on the the people here in the room meaning the conversion figure but i'm fairly new to the business but they know our business we work with them on a daily basis we work in a symbiotic relationship and someone else had mentioned earlier i believe that there are hundreds and hundreds of other businesses that have a similar symbiotic relationship to the turning fishing industry um and you're talking thousands and thousands of jobs um obviously with new uh new industry if you're talking wind farms that's going to create new jobs in the area but there's there's an issue of education people have broken up their entire lives in a certain industry and asked somebody to change from one industry to another midlife that's fairly tough uh there was some conversation a few years ago i believe it was in regards to the oil industry or one administration the response when the question came up jobs disappeared in one area when we buried another area came up and the response basically wants to learn the code which is frankly insulting um so it's like telling these fishermen or boss hydraulic guys you know learn to build wind turbines okay if you're 18 19 20 years old maybe that's possible so i would just say that in regards to the study the study is obviously valuable we need to get this research um david's absolutely right for doing this my main concern is that for one it has no barrier on bone it has no authority over bone by my understanding has complete regulatory authority for this issue on the federal level they can completely ignore anything and everything in this study and every single public comment here if they want to not saying they're going to but another person brought up the fact all these negatives were brought up in other areas but we went ahead and like i don't know if it was studies but that's concerning to me so my main thing to drill down on is a lot of times in these bureaucratic the little man on the ground gets and sometimes people forget where their steak came from or where their seafood came from um so i won't be able to forget that thank you um i think that we have a question online and then i want to queue up in the room of bill bradbury and katie um christy was there someone on the line that had a question yes kurt cochran we're gonna unmute you and i'll let you know when you're unmuted okay you should not be able to give your comment kurt so you guys can hear me okay thank you this is kind of new so um i'm a commercial fisherman and i'm a little uh nervous i guess to say the least about what what is going on i'm not trying to track it it's a little over my but when i look at your call areas and look at your maps you don't reference anything to do with fishing or the federal rules that we have you don't show closed areas to us you don't talk about rules or look at rules like if i'm got a mothership and i'm whiting fishing i can't go into california that's closed off to me you don't really have a good representation of what i would call the impacts if you overlay you're not really shown efh areas on your maps and if you overlay that with your call areas there's really no place for us to fish and so i i guess i would like to see that information and really see well i already know in my mind but for the the public to see what the real impact to the fishing in this street is um i guess is one of my another thing in the federal fishery where we were fishing off the coast here we have to have 100 observers which i don't think is a bad thing um and basically they are to um monitor interaction with marine mammals whether it be seals or oils or or or whatever and to interact interact with birds that are out there also you know there's a bird strike or something like that and so my question how i mean how many of these wind generators could observer monitor so how observers would you need out there and are you planning on doing that kind of modernity to ensure us that uh you're not having an impact on you know marine animals or fish even or crabs or birds and things like that so that's the two and then i'm kind of going on here i understand about this as being renewable energy but when you use the word green energy i have a little problem with that um when you think about that in an overall context when you start just displacing fission industry when you start displacing support groups we start placing communities we start displacing jobs i don't really understand how you can use the word green so i guess i think a more appropriate word would be and then um the final you know comment just because i heard the lady in the beginning talk about the comment period to let us know um i'm dead get set against this this this has no no no business being in the marine environment it's a harsh environment it's one that's going to cost a lot to do it and and what you're going to get back for um the is not a cost effective you got land you got mountaintops you got all sorts of things to look at it um you know from my in my humble opinion a nuclear power plant is greener than where you guys are going so i i really you know i guess that's about as blunt as i can get but uh i really i really don't believe it belongs here and we'll watch and see how these go um you know in our federal fishers we definitely do have to have environmental steady we have to have the the is and things and all the other stuff that are done open and public input and comment i'll look at that and i know that these things you're talking about as public input but i don't see that same process i'd like to actually have a the pacific fishery management council take a look at this and uh put out their uh um study on what they think the impacts would be and uh and see how that compares that would feel a little bit more comfortable so thank you for the time and let me speak and uh for everybody's attending and putting effort into this i appreciate it thank you um i'm gonna go to a couple of the comments and remembering um bill or katie are you ready we don't have anyone else on linings okay thanks christie and then after bill and katie i have jan coder and thank you very much for the record uh bill granberry uh lindsay handled served as the legislator for 15 years but then i served as secretary of state for 11 uh nine years and then i served on the northwest power and conservation council so uh my life has really been very full of and energy and i hear and understand the concerns of the fishing industry i am a very very strong supporter of the development offshore wind and the reason i say that is because about 16 years ago i was trained to make presentations about global warming and since that time i've done presentations in oregon over 400 presentations to community groups about the impacts of climate change and that obviously ocean acidification and the fact that our oyster growers couldn't grow their oysters anymore where they used to because the ocean was changing because of the climate and so i when i look at this issue and i look at the concerns about the environment i some of those concerns but i have to tell you there's overwhelmed by the need to develop power and stop burning cold it's so clear what's happening if we just carry on to where we are and this offers us a real opportunity to develop",

        "text": " multiple buildings so some awareness around that was for okay thanks okay moving down the line the definition of energy use intensity is um straight from House Bill 349 and the uh eui Target um so we did add the word net in there so the eui target is the net energy use intensity of a building that's been established so the net energy use intensity is actually I believe a definition from House Bill 349 and the way that house bill the 349 is kind of structured and directs us to establish the eui target in the energy use is to look at it from a net perspective so you take like the total energy that a building uses um you know or that enters the building like grid supplied or um you know or other other means bul fuel or natural gas through a pipeline that enters the building minus the sum of the energy that leaves the building so you can net out if there any energy exported to the grid um so that's where we wanted to clarify that the eui targets are based on net energy use not gross energy use so to to take a to be able to remove any exported energy from a target from a building's energy use totals when calculating performance relative to the Target does that clarify the the question Clark for you okay thanks that's a good um it's a good question because ashray 100 actually I think approaches like total euis a little bit differently than house bu 349 does in terms of actually I think it looks at gross energy usage um including so the that organ's BPS will be so if there's on-site electricity like say through solar panels that causes a building to import less to use less grid supplied electricity the organ buildings Target and performance will be based on only what's imported into the building you know what comes through the meter irrespective of how much that on-site energy use actually generates and how much the building use uses but ashr 100 would actually add together the imported grid Supply to electricity plus any energy the building uses from on-site solar when calculating a building's total energy use and use that to calculate its total eui whereas the Oregon Factor would only look at the imported energy use when calculating energy emissions so this is one thing that we'll need to make sure um to align and to coordinate as we go through ashray 100 and the development process yeah there'll be a bunch of people in the industry are used to calculating UI per ashray or all the other things that they're working on and I think I think ashr actually updated it with this round if I if I remember right with this 2024 version it was different in the last in the last version yeah yeah thank you yeah uh Alex yes I'm I'm wondering Does it include U the reduction of EV charging so that as considered as exported energy so um this will be one thing yeah it it it does so when calculating a Target um when calculating performance relative to a target a building owner would be able to remove from their energy use total any energy that supplies EV charging um so that would we'll have to kind of work through what that what that means but the way that I would imagine that would work is that it would most in most cases probably have to be some kind of a manual calculation to you know look at total grid suppli to electricity and then subtract out energy use related to EV charg ing when reporting energy usage so so that wouldn't require like a separate meter to to to confirm to like I think it would have to be separately metered um in order to make that yeah okay yeah thank you because the the statute is um is clear and I think I I pulled that in um maybe somewhere um but it is in I know it's in the statute around um the like the total energy use does not include energy used transportation oh here it is uh oh no wait no that's not good sorry um I know it's in there sounds good yeah thank you yeah thinking that that a little bit kind of in practice here so a lot of uh EV Chargers that are out there right now won't be separately muted so let's say I'm a property owner and I have already have EV Chargers and then now I have to comply with the standard is this essentially requiring me to get a separately me separate meter or are the rules basically going to say like if you want to not have this EV consumption going towards your net side eui then you you would have the choice to separately meter because there there will be some challenges rep feel like that's not that's not that cheap separately neither usage yeah um I I've kind of thought about that too and definitely want to want to hear feedback but I I think my initial thought would be that it would be kind of building owner discretion where if they they're eligible to remove that that energy but it's got to be metered and if they want to remove it they would have to you know spend whatever cost be required to get there so you know that would have to be a decision that a building owner would make if if they are you know potenti close to achieving the compliance with the eui performance requirement whether they want to you know separately meter to remove that that energy I could see a building owner if they're already well under the eui Target and there's no need to separately meter it and spend that cost then um I don't I don't think we would we would force them to so the the only if I can comment on that the only thing is if that sounds like a disincentivizing EV charging right if you add additional cost especially if it's existing so if a building owner goes to the expense to um provide a v charging and then it gets kind of penalized by having to add additional infrastructure to make it count it's maybe this is part of the incentive discussion or so how do we how do we don't disincentivize other greenhouse gas reduction efforts like EV charging by by adding additional hurdles yeah I mean I guess I'll throw out there too um you know there's always the potential for like an estimation like a a certified estimation of EV charging that maybe the like the a building auditor or the the qualified energy manager provides I don't know if that's pathway and I'm honest not familiar how other states maybe have treated this either but that's something we can look into uh Clark yeah I was just going to I don't know if it makes sense it's a question for the whole group of does it make sense to Grand Cloud there certain things like that in because if people made early adopter investments in things like EV charging plus battery storage plus solar or any any combination thereof um it would be a shame to have these rules Force an early adopter to go back and make additional Investments when they were doing things that were probably now encouraging with the building performance standard it's a tricky business but it seems like we should be thinking about it yeah good good comments yeah I'm kind of thinking through so I don't it sounds like we you know it sounds like there's interest in not requiring a building owner to spend the money to like to meter EB charging um just to remove it from the building total the bill certainly does allow a building owner to remove it um when documenting and demonstrating compliance with the target but you know how how building owner does that is I think the challenge you know how they come up with that quantification without metering um so yeah something we can kind of look look into and see how maybe other other jurisdictions have approached that and if there's a creative way to to meet a building owners need to remove it from their total without maybe requiring costly metering to do that for bench Frank in Portland it's the EV uh they haven't separately muted which I haven't seen that condition yet um that gets reported as part of the eui so it is a disincentive for electric charging because it's inflating incorrectly the eui um so I think you're on the right path and we would want to correct to that too like we we would rather see that submetering to more accurately reflect the building eui um I'm just thinking through the net solar too um that it's we do gross e I and it it is more challenging because we're trying to like monitor energy Energy Efficiency but it's challenging on the user end I think the net metering if I'm understanding correctly what you're referring to would actually simplify it and that it's just here's what's incoming and then um which was that's preferable from that kind of property manager standpoint I think but also is is that essentially kind of allowing solar uh to be a strategy to improve eui versus Energy Efficiency not that there's anything wrong with that but it seems like that would be now a strategy to add on to maybe a future investment am I that correctly yes yeah um yeah so that's um if I'm understanding the way you're saying yeah so it would it wouldn't penalize a building owner if you're looking at net energy it wouldn't penalize a building owner for putting on more solar um you know if you're looking at at gross energy a building owner could offset all of their grid purchase energy with solar but still have to deal with counting that solar provided energy toward their building zui but if you're looking at net energy a building owner could could feasibly meet a eui performance Target by yeah a combination of Energy Efficiency measures or on-site Renewables that reduce their grid purchase energy so it would I think open up more Pathways more strategies for compliance um and also I think you're right to simplify reporting too where you're just looking at incoming energy minus any exported energy and you're not really concerned with how much on-site energy you're generating Renewables um okay I don't see any other questions or raised hands so I think we can move down the line um remembering where I was was before uh let's think was that net oh shoot where was I oh no I was further down that's right there it is okay eui Target um okay greenhouse gas emissions this one is straight out of the statute so that has the meaning given in ORS 468a 2.1 um so I just removed the ashray standard 100 definition and replaced it with the definition from 349 I removed the target for greenhouse gas intensity I remove the definition for greenhouse gas intensity targets because Oregon will not have specific greenhouse gas intensity targets for buildings the definition for uh gross floor area was straight",

        "text": " bit in a bind if not all the land owners have signed on to the application they're trying to resolve that catch 22 is can that project move forward you those signatures from a local uh you know on the local land use application and then are they going to be in a position to make a determination of compliance with lane use goals versus say a county or city who in their language decision effectively has you know made that determination of compliance because you know assuming that they approve a transmission line you know their lane use ordinances you know if not you know specifically then indirectly um are already in compliance with the goals so but we can address that a little more clearly and specifically when we come back in may and do that presentation all right and lastly is the may council meeting so i'd already brought this up a couple of times but the next council meeting is may 26th and this will be a hybrid meeting meeting it will be both in person and webex so as i mentioned that we'll be conducting the draft proposed order for the nolan hills project by statute there is a requirement that that hearing must be in person and in proximity to the project so that's the main driver for the location and why we're going to be in again it will be at the red lion inn in the public hearing will begin at 5 30 p.m on thursday may 26th and then the regular council meeting will begin at uh on friday may 27 at 8 30 a.m i know nancy has been in contact with um so i think we have an understanding but i just wanted to make sure that everybody who indicated that they would be available are still available and that we have a good understanding of whether you're going to be participating in person or remotely we haven't done an in-person meeting for some time so we just have to make sure that we have that all figured out so we can get the right number of rooms and and do all the logistical um requirements that that have to be done for an in-person meeting so um we don't have to do that now but but certainly please communicate with nancy and let her know and then i would also indicate that if anybody wants to carpool you know we'll be leaving out of salem and so we can you know get a van and anybody wants to go with we can certainly make sure we you know you can meet us in salem to go or we can pick you up on the way in portland uh if you would like so certainly not any requirement but if anybody's interested in not driving we'd be happy to take you this is kent and i'll plan on catching a ride with you guys thank you this is marcie and just a reminder i will probably be sitting on the side of the road thursday and i can dial in i will be flying back from florida for work that day but i will drive straight to pendleton to be there for that actual meeting in person for great so you won't you'll be in person but you won't need a room for thursday night i i do need a room yes for thursday i just won't get over there in time i don't think for the got it thank you um and since we will be in person um i just want to throw this out as an option sarah came up with this as an idea and i think it's a good idea if anybody is available there's a lot going on right now in until county in terms of applications amendments and and projects that are undergoing construction so if any council member has a little extra time wouldn't mind going either earlier either on wednesday or earlier on thursday and would like to do a site visit to one or more projects please let us know and we can start working with the applicants and site certificate holders to try to figure out a good location that works in relative proximity to pendleton this is cindy um and i would be interested in that and i can be there either wednesday or um thursday i won't be able to write in the van because i'm coming from another meeting but i i would make tiny for that this is hanley marcy and i'd be happy to do a tour on the afternoon of thursday thanks hanley okay well i think that's uh that's good right there and so we'll we'll try to set something up all right well that concludes my secretary report unless any council member has a question excellent thank you does anyone have any questions for secretary cornett all right well hearing none thank you very much for that report i think that helpful and we all seemingly have a good handle of where we are um and i too want to tell christopher thank you for his efforts um he tends to keep us all find out while i feel pretty good about where we are so thank you and i'm glad you're not leaving just doing something different uh so the next agenda item is um public comments web portal update this is agenda item b this is an information item and we have wally adams operations and policy analysts to present to us wally the floor is yours thank you chair grail good morning members of the council just bear with me while i get my screens arranged here so i can share all right hopefully everybody can see um i'm going to be talking to you today about our new system for capturing and displaying comments on citing projects uh i have just a couple slides to go over the background and the purpose of the project uh the scope of what we're covering and then i'm gonna show you a couple demos i'll do a demo of the comment portal and then also a demo of what we're calling our docket for displaying comments that we get on citing projects when we went into this had a couple of things that we wanted to address first of all we although we have many ways to get comments on projects we don't have an online system currently or we didn't have one i should say um i think the biggest issue that we had was a second bullet point that the comments that we received were not readily available to view by the public in fact we got a comment on this during the public comment period in our december meeting somebody came on and you know was saying that they really wanted to be able to see comments that other people submitted on citing projects and um so what i'll show you today we are able to address that now and then lastly it's kind of a workflow issue where internally when we process comments most of our projects we don't get a large number so it's it's not all that difficult but from time to time we do get bigger numbers and you know they have to be cataloged they've got to be put into a single pdf file and so in addition to writing a way for people to enter comments online and to view comments online we also have a way to produce a report at the end so that the citing analyst doesn't have to do that that extra step so a little bit of a time saver for them as well so objectives i i bolded the ones that i thought were the most important primary objective of course was create an online portal to that were submitted by the public we also wanted if we could to use software platforms that the state already has licenses for so there are software programs that are out there to do these kind of things frankly they're they're geared more cases where you would get hundreds or thousands even of comments and they're more geared for just kind of sorting those large numbers of comments which wasn't really what we needed and uh the systems can be a little expensive as well so we wanted to do something in-house if we could with our own it resources and keep the costs low we wanted to provide an email acknowledgement to people once they submitted comments i already mentioned generating an index and a list of comments and then lastly like i say i think the most important thing was providing this docket so people could comments that were received so just wrapping up here through the web-based form we wanted commenters to also be able to associate their comments with specific citations to council standards so we we didn't want to just give a form for people to enter a comment and submit it our our process can be complicated as i think we all recognize and so you know i know todd felt strongly about this that in addition to providing the way to input a comment give people a little bit of guidance kind of guide them through associating comments with council standards or sections from a dpo without crossing that line of providing legal advice so then lastly as far as the scope we wanted to cover noi dpo including for both types of amendments and also formal and informal rulemaking projects so this is my last slide and then i'm going to flip over and do the demo but i just wanted to show that the links to access both of these portals are included in this presentation and i'm going to show you how to get there from our website so with that i'll switch over we'll start from here so when you go to main webpage if you go to the get involved it says customer service and comment and then once we're here submit a comment and you'll see actually when you click on this there are a lot of different programs where you can enter comments so all of these are using the same type of platform that i'm going to show you here which is also an advantage that rit group has been able to leverage this we watched a few things can i jump in real quick so yeah so you know you're showing where you can kind of navigate through this but just so council knows and anybody else on the line anytime we issue a notice there will be a direct link to that specific um comment portal so you know somebody doesn't have to kind of go through this and kind of navigate and figure it out there'll be a direct link that they can just click on and it'll access that relatively easy for them that's the spot on time thanks for pointing that out and the link would take them then to this page and um so this is kind of the first page you click here to select the project and only projects where we're actively taking comments will display here um you can see nolan hill's wind as an example is in here which just went to the to the dpo phase i'm going to click on the citing test so that we can just enter you know a dummy comment i'll say so once you've picked your",

        "text": "under the City attorney Petey Taylor Giles city council Keith Campbell city manager yeah thanks Scott yes Kim Marshall with the project tunnels connect or mayor and uh um so we're talking about time place and Manor and uh Kim uh for a good while talking about some of the challenges represent that would be great to make sure your experiences areas of Washington County so thank you thank you all right now that's out of the way I just want to restate for the public this is a conversation regarding House Bill 3115 it came about in the 2021 legislative session this is a conversation that the legislature has required all cities to have to update their code and so we are in the process of getting that done in Sherwood the last meeting I talked a little bit about the case law history of that I'm not going to go through that again but I do have three one one five on the screen and I will read back Republicans that cities can they may regulate the acts of sitting line sleeping or keeping warm and dry outside on public property so long as the regulations are objectively reasonable based on the totality of the circumstance is applied to all stakeholders including persons experiencing homelessness and so what that basically means in layman's terms is that a city has a camping ordinance that just outright bans camping in the city the legislature has said that that's no longer allowed so we need to update our code because um you know from the the history of that we do need to update it because ours does not have a 3-1-1 but so the conversation tonight I've sent you yes sir sorry that's gross this was a little lost on me at least until the very end of our last work session I want to get cluttered here reading what you have on the slide this house bill 3115 applies only to public property that's correct so any of our camping ordinances around private publicly accessible private property would still be fine the way they are written those yes sir that's correct just want to make sure yep that's that's a good question so um with that being said uh Council directed me last time we talked a little bit in the abstract on this and counseled the record for you to go back and say hey find out what other cities around us are doing and so I've done that North Plains leads the way they're the only ones with an ordinance docket right now I've sent that out to you all um I'm not going to go into significant detail on whatever City's doing because that is subject to change and I'm happy to talk about that a little bit but all of these cities are either just getting started or in the early stages of adopting these disturbances so we are all in the same boat we're all having challenging conversations about what it looks like tonight what I would like to do is talk a little bit about the detail of time place and manner restrictions so where when and how so the time for instance beaverton's uh sort of uh where they're leading right now is an eight to eight uh camping allowing camping so from 8 pm to 8 A.M you would be allowed to camp in certain areas as you saw in North plains is seven or nine PM to 7 A.M so you know we can we can take this however you all want to talk about it I want it to be your discussion and not mine this is a robust policy question that is left to elected officials happy to weigh on the legality of stuff but I would like to start it out saying you know is there a consensus or is there maybe a discussion that you would like to have on on a time uh restriction for camping I like 7am better than 8 am we'll start doing this stuff like that I mean my only thought of that is is that creative burden on the police system like I I don't know what the Practical effect is of that right if if you say okay you got to be out of here by 7am or do we have you know what I mean like that that's I also am in agreement with with earlier but I is it just a time thing or are there other I mean we talked about potentially there being like a designated area we talked about which I don't think we're totally in favor of in fact we saw some other problems with that and so is it is is the time thing the main thing that we're discussing no sir so we're going to talk about time plates and manners so the time is just what I brought up first to the extent what you wanted to Hash that out that seems like a fairly innocuous uh if there's an easy decision to make here that may be leaning towards the easier of it right the place for me is going to determine to help me determine the time yeah but I mean so could I say hey you can legally Camp from uh again just being absurd here but from Midnight to 1205 right I mean like is no it does not it has to be objectively reasonable and so and I'll talk about this again because normally objectively reasonable is a legal term applied to use a force um in that question what is objectively reasonable is generally left to judges and juries the legislature has set cities you figure out what it means to be objectively reasonable and if somebody has a problem with it then the judges and juries can figure it out so they've left it to the elected officials to take a shot at it okay so economic suggestion yes or yes so time place and the last time we kind of centered we talked about times yeah another time that's kind of what you're getting to we also talked about uh having areas in the city where you can can experience you'd had a conversation like School set up bubbles of area or you know those types of things the manner you know I think that gets into more of how many square feet what you can have in those types of issues but I think kind of within that context I mean I would I would like instead of kind of diving right into this we have some folks visiting I would love the chance for them just kind of give their perspective it's a really interesting insights about how our house is going to be expecting things that might be useful for us but that's the reason why I reached out to Kim knowing that she was a project online also sure would relevant so she knows what our Sherwood folks right go ahead okay so if this is um please recognize that I my work is advocating for homeless friends um but I fully recognize that the impacts of this on other people and uh as I talk you're going to hear a lot around my concern for businesses um because many cities are saying on not on city property which then means public property which could land in front of businesses um our three big cities Tigard Beaverton and Hillsborough all look a little different right now which is frustrating as well when this came about when we all heard about it and realized we had a July 1 deadline um the goal The Hope was that we were going to come up with one ordinance that fit 14 different areas one County and 13 cities it turns out that's not going to happen we're going to have 14 different ordinances which in itself is its own challenges particularly for a place like Beaverton where you could be standing on a street corner of Beaverton and take two steps to the right and now you're a non-incorporated Washington County and so the impacts just kind of um are really really fast and then law enforcement comes into play and for us law enforcement is not the first point of contact when it comes to our homeless friends we want our Outreach teams to be that first point of contact now Sherman doesn't have a designated Outreach team but that's a whole other conversation so right now what we know is the county is looking at what we would consider we being the advocates for the homeless the most compassionate plan they're looking at five days you may camp in this spot for five days um and then they have their Manor piece of it so you can have a tent you can have this big of a footprint type piece most of the cities are doing some overnight type camping so Beaverton is 8pm to 8 A.M Hillsborough is sun down to Sun up type stuff one of our biggest concerns is the the pieces on either side of those so if like in Beaverton they would say 8 pm to 8 A.M and their their shelter their um yeah sheltered Library doesn't open until 10 A.M what are what's expected in those two hours the other piece that we have to consider and I know that this is where we have to stretch ourselves is the population that we're talking about if we're going to be empathetic and client-centered and trauma-informed we have to consider Beyond some of what might be reasonable to us um I remember homeless friends aren't going to get up at seven o'clock so are we just saying we know you're not going to follow this now we have to engage law enforcement which to me becomes unreasonable and that's a piece that has to be considered so my ask is just leaning with a little compassion and recognize who this ultimately in fact it affects because the who is really important that's going to be our homeless friends secondary is going to be law enforcement or this is so this is what happens with an ordinance is we're saying we're going to mandate something so now there's going to be guidelines if we don't follow them something has to happen and what is that going to look like Chief what kind of enforcement will be in play and then gosh we would just love any two cities could come together and have similar ordinances just any two cities to show us collaboration um that would be amazing uh because that's just a that's a big picture concern for all of us when we're making decisions and in one County Washington County we can't we can't collaborate in that way that's a whole other world um and so that's what I'm asking I know that there's concern about you know picking one spot I don't have as much of a concern that doesn't you know raise much for me here because and sure you know when we look at point in time count numbers you don't have to take out your shoes to get to the high number um very few friends are here in Sherwood camping they don't have a lot of resources we don't have shelter anymore and so uh so having one spot where people might",

        "text": " uh how can we help them utilize the energy efficiency of just to get to our current code and how can we incentivize some people to build a little bit beyond that so we are focused on that economic recovery how can we help people offset those costs of building decoder building above code and taking advantage of the budget we have to allocate to where the needs are of survivors so we're trying to focus the budget on on where the greatest needs are and we've heard from a lot of communities certainly single-family residential there's a lot of need there and manufactured homes that were destroyed and so we want to make sure we're focused on those different building types and recognizing that we need to treat them a little the owners are different and they're in a variety of different situations so we treat residential structures commercial structures manufactured homes differently and make sure we're coming up with custom solutions that can work for everybody as much as we can and how can we use existing systems at the county level with local jurisdictions or utilities or within our other state state agencies like housing community to use those existing channels that are working with all these communities we don't want to necessarily create something new and then disappear we want to try to utilize what's already out there and try to enhance it as best we can and making sure we are incorporating equity and our kind of decision making what we build and how we implement it uh so for example making sure that we provide materials in english as well as in spanish or if we have trainings that we offer in both english and spanish uh making sure that our materials are clear enough in the language what they use how do we use existing systems and and uh and make sure they are equitable uh the incentives we provide are flat incentives no matter the house size that you have or the location you get the same and utilize the public profit process these meetings that we're having today and that we've had previously are important to make sure that we're listening to what people need and the challenges that they're facing so what have we heard so we've heard all kinds of great feedback and we really appreciate it i hope that you'll see that what we've heard we're trying to incorporate in our program design so retroactive payments are critical so we recognize that many people have fortunately have already been able to rebuild or at least pull their permits or start putting their plans together and the reality is you know they didn't realize that this program existed when they did that and so no fault of their own we want to make sure they could still qualify if people have already rebuilt and they built rebuilt to the current code in effect at that time let's still make sure they they qualify for incentive and see if we can help them that's part of the economic recovery piece of what we're doing here and make sure we're using as i said the existing systems there's excellent long-term recovery groups in many regions around the state and they're talking to those survivors and they can be a great outreach arm for us and in providing information about that program how it works and maybe helping guide people through that that process and make sure that we're focusing on those single-family residential and manufactured homes i won't read all the feedback here today actually we've got a whole nother cheat of a variety of feedback uh making sure we're focusing on rural communities make sure we're distributing the program information as early as we can and use partners that are already working in these communities and make sure you know the materials are available in a variety of languages and that you know it's it's going directly to the people who need it the and so if we have questions about that or you have additional feedback please take the time to give it to us today i'm sure you know this isn't encompassing all the challenges that exist in the market but we certainly want to recognize uh the big ones and the ones we're taking into account all right andy you want to talk about the program design elements sure thanks michael so these are the draft program design elements and draft is the key word here as michael mentioned we're still wanting public input and helping us shape the path that we're on but in summary we're really trying to aim to deliver incentives for a variety of structures to to support energy efficient rebuilding and in doing so uh we really want to support rebuilding to code we want to offer targeted support of manufactured homes uh support new energy efficient home uh perhaps a heat pump replacement we want to offer incentives to to rebuild above current code and work with to really maximize energy efficiency we also want to target commercial and multi-family incentives based on the structure size of those those buildings that were lost next slide please so oregon department of energy staff have done quite a bit of research the structures that were lost and what the rebuilding scene is is expected to look like you know at its core this is a program built to support uh over 4 500 structures that are being rebuilt you know the total number of structures is as was mentioned over over 5000 but we're really trying to target the the residential and commercial buildings and not necessarily the out buildings bridges transmission towers and all the other structures that were lost in these this program is currently funded through the end of the biennium which is june and to date we've seen about 25 percent of these structures either rebuilt or in the the process of local jurisdiction we've looked at comparable studies coming out of california and the wildfire rebuilding down there and we estimate around 40 percent of the that were lost will be rebuilt or in the construction process by the time that the program currently is expected to sunset so this slide depicts uh again the draft program summary and across the columns we've got uh the program type of which there are a few what we're calling buckets the number of structures in those buckets that were destroyed in the fires and then an estimated number of participating structures in the incentive program we have a column depicting incentives as well as a total budget allocation for those buckets within the the single-family residential the the site built uh stick built homes the draft incentive for building to code is a little over three thousand dollars with a low income bonus of five thousand going above code partnering with energy trust or utilities yields an incentive of around thirty seven hundred dollars with an additional low income uh bonus you know as michael mentioned manufactured homes and single-family residential homes are different in the manufactured home space we're looking to incentivize uh survivors to purchase a neem home or an energy efficient model and that'll yield around six thousand dollars uh in the draft model of incentives adding a heat pump to the home uh yields an incentive of around twenty five hundred dollars the commercial and multi-family space is again broken out by size of the building with uh two code being two thousand and four thousand respectively for small and large buildings with above code at four thousand and five thousand for those respective efforts so we've got a few examples here of what these various incentive buckets can total out to be so in jackson county if a single-family residential home is is rebuilt to the current residential by a low to moderate income qualifying owner they can expect uh around three thousand one hundred and twenty five dollars in incentive just to build to the the current code construction adding in the five thousand dollar low income bonus we're looking at around 8 in total estimated incentives for that construction project so in jackson county if a single-family homeowner elects to go above code and also participate in energy trust's new homes program the incentives really add up we see the 3125 and meeting code going above with department of energy's incentive yields another thirty seven hundred dollars uh energy trust uh is likely to incentivize around fifty two hundred dollars and that really uh magnifies up to a total incentive base of of twelve thousand one hundred and twenty one dollars and if a homeowner is uh in the low to moderate income bracket they're eligible for for much more with around 6 800 in low income bonus bringing a total of almost 19 000 dollars in incentives for that rebuilding project hi andy it's christy hi hi we had a question um on the last slide that i just caught while you were on this one would you mind going back for me sure and i will ask the question uh so i believe it came from jenna thanks jenna uh the question was um for or maybe one more back for multi-family was that incentive a per unit incentive or the total for a property i believe it's total for a property and michael correct me if i'm i'm wrong there and that is something we've considered and can continue to look at you know some of these are multi-unit and they've got unique considerations unto themselves but as it stands now that is per thank you christy all right thank you michael this example participation slide has to do with manufactured homes so if again in jackson county where the majority of the damage occurred homeowners purchasing a new manufactured odo will encourage the owner to get a new neem 1.1 or energy star manufactured with a heat pump in doing so the neem incentive again is around six thousand dollars the energy trust is also in the manufactured home space and their current incentive is around twelve thousand five hundred dollars uh adding a heat pump uh will generate an incentive from oregon department of energy for around twenty five hundred dollars up to total cost of install with energy trust uh providing an additional three thousand dollars towards the heat pump incentive this brings our total in the scenario to around twenty four thousand dollars in estimated incentives and i'll kick it back to michael thank thank you andy all right so now we want to talk a little bit about eligibility and so eligibility is kind of dictated to us in many ways in house bill 2289 it really sets the the groundwork up when people are rebuilding uh do they have to rebuild within the existing footprint or how much bigger can they get and a variety of those kind of uh we we are going to as i said earlier we are going to make sure we can incentivize people who have already rebuilt so looking backwards as well as forward-facing uh people have already rebuilt are already permits and we're gonna see what we can do and andy was talking about kind of manufactured homes and seeing what we can do within that community we've certainly heard that uh some some people within the manufacturing community are buying previously owned manufactured homes and so andy was talking about whether we can do a heat pump install it and the opportunity there uh",

        "text": " three tries to summarize uh multiple sections of code basically says that uh the new rules would require uh that we include uh on bundled parking in transit corridors and provide for other opportunities to reduce or limit the amount of minimum parking that could be required um and then the second box below that the says adopt on street parking pricing for 10 of all on-street parking spaces throughout Urban unincorporated Washington County um that is going to be a large number of parking spaces and then in addition to those combined sections pathway 2 does more with parking pricing it's called the fair uh parking approach and includes a broader application of uh on bundled parking if you have questions about what unbundled parking is I can come back to it but we go forward now um well I'll just mention that unbundled parking means that the rent if someone pays for or the mortgage that someone purchases for a property would have um uh the parking space be a separate component of the charge of the lease uh that's a quick summary uh so and then pathway three um has uh barking regulations that would minimize the amount of parking required or provide for other opportunities to reduce the amount of uh parking required uh and also would require a designation a district where on Street uh parking is managed through uh timing permits or next slide please that was a lot okay uh the parking area regulations there's a number of parking lot attributes we'll be needing to pay attention to uh for those areas that provide parking particularly there is the um lots that are greater than a quarter acre in size will be required to have a tree canopies and a street like street street like uh design along the driveways um and then uh there will be an option of solar panels green energy or enhanced tree canopy for those those larger well quarter acre lot uh parking areas and next slide please and in addition there are um new uh required parking maximums um the residential development maximums are not too dissimilar from what we would expect in our current maximums uh the commercial and Retail maximums uh are not too dissimilar from what we currently have for for parking space maximums um there is a few categories that will need to be adjusted and then the new one is that one at the top uh bill means more than 6 500 square feet floor area may not have more surface parking than the poor area of the building um that's a new one for us I'm not sure exactly how that's going to be implemented uh but um that also I want to point out includes residential there's no type of development that that is excluded there next slide please uh we've been reviewing uh what other jurisdictions are are doing and saying about these these rules again they're um where valus and Tigard have already adopted amendments that remove minimum parking requirements and conversations with staff elsewhere in the Portland metro area everybody I've talked to has said their Community is looking at uh remove minimum parking requirements um there are some clearly that are in the we don't know yet category and are exploring and keeping all options open at this time um we do know that we haven't heard anybody that's actually pursuing pathway two and we've heard that Medford is looking at pathway three or one that's um the extent of uh variance we've seen across jurisdictions other jurisdictions responding thus far uh next slide please we didn't know where to include this one in the presentation but they're also this spring goes into effect uh requirements for the building uh to um provide enough electrical capacity and conduit to provide new buildings to serve uh 40 percent of parking spaces with charging levels and these are not in our uh the Community Development code at this point we anticipate we will need to put them there but going into a a fact um with the building code at this time is the uh electric vehicle charging uh and next slide please so um there are staff recommendation is uh to proceed with exploring pathway one which would remove all uh parking minimum parking requirements county-wide throughout the urban unincorporated area and the rationale for that is that Pathways two and three um require Urban unincorporated Washington County to establish an on-street parking pricing program we do not have a program or really a mechanism to develop or administer it at this time the we could reconsider that option at any any time going forward if we did have such a program in place or had another form of parking benefit District in the future and then there's some chance these rules when we last talked last fall were under appeal and there are some chances that these rules will be amended over the next year or more as um things things proceed especially through the judicial system there's a lot to these rules this is only the first section that goes into effect and so there's opportunities here that things may change and we're well aware of that but we do need to continue to proceed with the rules that we've been given uh so next slide please and finally my last slide here um although I said that we need to proceed with the rules we've been given I think there's considerable opportunity for the board and Planning Commission to weigh in on um how we go about doing so and uh next steps there was um discussion just before my presentation here about the April 5th work session so I'm hoping maybe we can find time for a continued discussion then as well as perhaps one later this spring and then as staff we're expecting to uh have an ordinance for filed for uh deliberations by the Planning Commission and board over uh the summer and so that's my last slide I'll I'll leave it open for questions or discussion uh thank you for your attention thank you very much Mr Kelly Commissioners have questions or comments um commissioner Havener yeah Steve can we back up to the slide about uh the parking area not exceeding the square footage of the building I think we can thank you yeah one back one forward yeah or go ahead with the question I I know swise says maybe was it 6 500 or 65 000 Square 55 000 did I say 6 500 yeah but um and is that only applicable then in the urban unincorporated area that's right okay so a car dealership probably is an inverse of that or is that an exclusion yeah we're looking for slide um 15 I think it is um a car dealership um would definitely be uh applicable but I I think it would be the parking area not the vehicle display area so if they had a large field with vehicles displayed I don't know if that I'd have to confirm I don't know if that would would so then my other concern is like with government Fleet operations uh for as an example tvfnr uh has a five acre parcel it's in an incorporated area but could have been an unincorporated um that has an acre under roof and four acres of Fleet operations parking um does that do they have to apply for an exemption if they were to go that I I don't know if there is an exemption process here it's a state rule um I I think there would have to be uh but I I don't know what that that looks like at this time if I could weigh in if I could weigh in a little bit on that at two points of clarification that I want to make first of all these rules do apply to the Incorporated areas but we don't have jurisdiction over the Incorporated areas for land use rules so we're only talking about the rules we'll apply in unincorporated the city staff are all having this exact same conversation about how they'll implement the rules what these rules are talking about is what we can require a developer can choose to do other things and so while we for example won't be able to require parking maximums in some circumstances it's possible for private development or other government entities to still deliver areas for vehicular storage but I think these are really great questions because there's a lot of technicalities in these rules that we haven't fully digested and I think that this is something we need to think about a little bit more okay thank you commissioner Kaiser um Steve quick question I had two questions for you the first one I have is I I think I saw on their five units or more has to have a 40 percent uh has to to provide 40 the equivalency of 40 Electrical uh hookups for electric that's not just departments that's Condominiums as well then right because that's that's right so just from my perspective folks I have several clients that that build small projects that utilize the condominium uh regime rather than just single family that are basically um I have one in Sherwood right now that's five units and that means they've got to install two well it would sound like they need to install two electrical vehicle uh Outlets there on site that's that's a burden that's pretty big for such a small community or for such a small development yeah it's a um the these are impactful rules um the I I think it's not the actual charging station I'm not a building permit expert but I don't I think it's just the electrical capacity so just the capacity built into the house or into the unit possibly that's my under my limited understanding and I I might not I'm not the expert on that at all make more sense frankly um my second question was uh on the slides back to the um uncoupling of of uh uh parking spots from rentals can you can you talk a little bit more about that you you said to ask you about that come back to it if possible yeah I can try I tried a real brief summary uh one of the the concepts that's out there for parking and we allow this now is that the rent of a unit or the sale of a unit um includes typically includes the the lease and the monthly payment includes the parking space or maybe two depending upon what you're you know actually um doing there and then in the the in the transit corridors and or throughout the urban area the requirement would be that the lease and the parking space be separate charges what is their hope there that I'm not totally understanding I mean obviously it would be so just as an example I'll just use an example let's say I owned an apartment complex and I've got a renderer who's going to come rent and now his unit is a thousand dollars and I've got a parking spot that I have to lease him as well is there hope that people will have less cars if they have to pay rent for them and I think it's twofold I the what",

        "text": " for people interested in adding stories to existing we had heard that there were delays associated with the the shipping and installation of storage and want to hear whether they are still occurring and which of the options would be most effective at reducing the impact of those delays the options being considered include permitting the solar incentive portion of the rebate to be claimed separately from the storage portion following installation of the solar system and proof of its completion this would include passing inspections from The Authority having jurisdiction this should also mean tweaks to how the rebates are processed in power collect the software contractors used to place reservation requests the reservation would continue to count as one of the contractors reserved projects and put until completion of the storage portion of the the reservation another option would be to extend the time that the reservation for paired solar and storage is valid for uh this would allow time for the storage to be a third option could be to increase the number of reservations a contractor can have at a time for systems for residential customers who are not low on moderate income this could allow a contractor to have reservations waiting on installation of storage and have greater capacity to reserve rebates further systems are there any uh questions on this potential rule change looks like Angela has a handout and she is now off comment um really appreciate other thinking through these three possibilities um and in thinking about it since the last webinar I the first one um seems like the best idea to me followed by I guess a seems like that's the idea followed by V I think could make things pretty confusing for contractors because there are already caps and um and there's concerns about funds running out in that non-income restricted bucket so I just wanted to let let you all know about how she is feeling about those options thanks thank you so much for letting us know Angela and one thing I just wanted to also flag we had a comment here regarding printing a coherent about getting a coherently principal list of the contractors we have that list in Excel and so if you don't have excel in your computer I can see how that could be an issue so I did put the link that's in Excel but um it's from C Daryl in if you don't have Excel maybe we could explore getting into a PDF or something so feel free to send a direct message to me in the chat with your email address and I can get a two PDF or something Audrey hi Audrey from PGE is saying that she'd love to see the ability to allow rebates for adding energy storage to existing solar that would require a statutory change so just a flag on the limitation there unless I'm I'm like 100 sure I'm right so not something we can take care of during the rule making process um and then and then yeah I see your notes Airline on the PDF so um we'll see how if we can find you and then I don't see any other hands up or any other comments in the chat right now related to this page okay thank you so other proposals um that we're putting forward uh include the increasing the number of low or moderate income residential customer or low income service provider reservations a contractor can have at a time from 20 to 25. we're also proposing to increase the amount of time a reservation for a low-income service provider can be extended currently it's one year with a possible extension of 180 days and we're proposing doing um change that to one year reservation with a possible extension an additional this was due to feedback that low-income service provider projects have been delayed due to supply chain and Workforce constraints an additional rule change being proposed is to reduce the residential rebate rate for customers who are not eligible for utility incentive and are not low on moderate income currently it's 50 cents per watt and we're proposing to reduce that down to 30 cents per watt we would maintain the current rate of 20 cent per watt for those eligible for utility since homes established the average utility incentive received by a residential customer has reduced by more than one thousand dollars so resulting in the need to kind of adjust those rates offered to customers who are eligible for utility incentive in comparison to those that are not eligible for a utility incentive Odo is also proposing to remove language in rules that was written when the program was first established and related to the original budget timeline and replace it with more General budget language that removes dates but maintains the same allocations any questions on this rule change and um ways to implement it while people are thinking about that and um we did get a chat on the last slide a little bit after I told you to move on um and the question that I'm getting is what's the purpose of having solar and storage purchased at the same time versus just having storage paired with solar and I think it kind of gets at Audrey's question from PGE as well so I think that is the the program was kind of set up as either kind of the energy solar electric system or pad system we've heard that the the delays are in terms of kind of that supply chain issues and so kind of maintaining the the initial program form while accounting for those delays to the supply chain yeah I think underlying premise of the program that you have to have solar and storage installed together you can't just add storage to an existing solar um and we do have some of the build proponents are on the line and might go ahead and raise their hand if they'd prefer to answer this question after they hear my attempt but I think that oh she's just raising her hand now so maybe I just won't even um but the solar contractors um who are led by the Oregon solar and storage Industries Association they're the ones who are working with legislators uh proposed this legislation and they can maybe share why it's drafted that way thanks Angela yeah this is Angela probably cook from Lucia the reason why we proposed having the incentive only go to those who are purchasing solar and storage is to really incentivize those folks who hadn't been able to kind of get into the solar and storage um area at all without these incentives and people that already have solar are most likely more financially available to get Solar without this added incentive and I know that kge and hopefully soon Pacific Corps will be working on storage incentives so and I think those are available to anybody so I think that's a good good pairing um Audrey from PGE asks of Energy Trust counts as a utility incentive it does um we are sort of imminently expecting the Energy Trust of Oregon to announce that their non-income restricted solar incentives will be sunsetting in the near future or in the future so that utility incentive may not be on offer for Energy Trust consumers that aren't low to moderate income that makes sense and I think this time we do have Energy Trust of Oregon on the line which I should have I wish I would have known in advance I forgot that we just didn't have you all last time so if you wanted to speak to that feel free to raise your hand at weekend talk about that but just wanted to share that that's why they're reducing the um the making some of the changes is what makes sense to some folks so uh we got a question about where does one go to read the new rules my understanding is that they're not posted yet they're not final we're just giving a preview today so that we can put together those rules having heard from our contractors and other members of the like an outline of a quote the proposals not the actual draft rule language uh but the proposals uh on the um Odo rulemaking web page um and I can find a link to that and pop it in the chat and then James if you I don't see any other hands raised um or yeah somebody already took care of the finding the rule making docs for you thanks Angela and we don't have any at this point oh wait when the rules are ready to be read what is their address the the link Daryl and I think has had Daryl in the link that you are asking about is the one that Angela posted that's where they'll be all right but I think with that you can go ahead and at this point you don't have to ask make ask questions or make comments related to kind of exactly what we were just talking about on the slide in front of you you're free to share um comments on anything related to the program ask questions um whatever uh whatever you would like to bring up here during this kind of open comment period let's see so we got asked what's the purpose of the reservation cap and why are we increasing it do you want to share that again James or maybe go into some more detail um so yeah the reservation cap is just like uh a cut on contractors to that you know you have 20 reservations for one contractor at a time within non-income restricted um residential customers and then 20 more for low moderate income residentially customers and low-income service providers um and it was um maybe the initial intent behind those caps was to ensure that not no one contractor was kind of monopolizing the the the program um and that we were able to kind of dispute funds across the state so that's kind of where it is and we're looking at trying to increasing that cap in the low moderate income side of um the the program just to kind of increase access if there was a limitation based upon the to those contractors we don't typically see a lot of contractors capping out on the low moderate income side of the the reservation and we want to just kind of ensure that that isn't kind of a limiting factor for um low moderate income customers and low-income service providers accessing the program Thanks James hopefully that helps with the answer to that question um so we uh you're off mute I know you also went ahead in the chat but go ahead you're off me awesome thank you so much I think this is a really great program in terms of solar and storage and I was really excited about when it was first released a couple years ago um the unfortunate thing is you know I I took a deep dive into trainings I'm just a resident in southwest Portland I try to get solar and storage installed at my house in southwest Portland and um at that time Tesla had been a contractor in one of the approved contractors but since quit at the time that I was exploring solar in storage and what I found was that all the local Portland area contractors were anywhere from 25 to 30 percent higher than the most price competitive bid which was Tesla and when I",

        "text": " out to our team for their flexibility and listen again good good luck sure terrific Kevin can you update the agenda for us that's awesome great I actually comments on yes real quickly and get your microphone closer this is how we help one another thank you yeah that was just kind of order upside of the table down here with the um my two comments and these one needs to be answered but but I like like projects I understand segment funding that makes sense so your scenario one makes sense to me um I don't know and you don't need to answer this at this point but the the funding where that's coming from I saw that you know trimets and others are doing some value engineering and you can peel some things off but frankly if it's a big ask on the county unless you all know about some money I don't know about I don't see where that's coming so it's going to have to be State Federal Regional money I just don't see as confusing a big lot of money and it seems to imply that they're going to ask us for that and so yeah it's a great project we've only been working on for 20 plus years but uh you might think about that part or is that funding ask going to come from yeah and I think they've been hearing the teams have been hearing have you done a feasibility analysis of where the match is going to come from and I think they're starting a conversation with local jurisdictions to have that but it's interesting you said that you would keep one uh because I was having a conversation yesterday there's a consensus building conversation going on led by I think a counselor um Rick Ben beverins um and I think he was suggesting we eliminate one so um the only reason I say that is you you'll see on your jpac and I know Jay back and I was it we like complete programs and so you don't have to fund them all at once but you at least plan for plan them out right yeah yeah and I think the staff I put it in my note in the email not that big of a yeah that's why I don't like just the Hillsborough enforcement yeah too narrow yeah okay we'll have more discussion uh so this afternoon thank you and I think that's all okay I wish you three of my minutes oh thank you very much I know she'll go no I don't go over I work hard you're gonna make a bet on that oh no chair and I had a bet last night on one of my uh announcements this morning or updates we had a cp07 meeting last night we also drove to Salem together yesterday so I bet that there would be fewer than seven actually that even more than that people in attendance and the chair that the upside and we had 18. so it was I lost badly so I'm not counting yeah I was so uh you can tell of the pair who's the super competitive one yeah I'm always admit that I always so the The Joint CPO can be in the meeting uh last night with uh chair Harrington and myself and it was a it was a really positive interaction I thought and I appreciate the staff itself for being there last night the um currently cp07 is without leadership so they don't have a chair in place and it's and they're looking to kind of regain that regular status so it was you know it was a little bit of an advertisement as well but we had um we we had really an interesting interaction with the group that was there we discussed the budget we discussed uh arpa tranche 2 and CPO re-envisioning so um and you know it's unfortunate that we're having to reschedule the this afternoon but I'm hopeful that everybody's seeing it now and understands that you know we're doing the right thing by rescheduling this due to illness so um like I said it was good meeting there were some interesting comments that came up around the revisioning piece there were comments that came up around the budgeting piece there were but it was um it was a really positive uh last week I went to the senator Wyden event it was a round table uh there was this was on the chips program but it was really focused on the Workforce Development side of what needs to be done to have a successful semiconductor industry as a whole it was held out at Willow Creek the Secretary of Commerce raimondo was there and it was it was a lot of media attention it was a good uh it was well staged to put it mildly it was very it was a very directed but the university presidents from around the Oregon area all spoke about what they were doing in relationship to preparing for Workforce Development in this industry um I sat with Steve mayor Callaway and it was it was a it was a great presentation they also recognized the elected officials in the room and I know it wasn't a time that was available for everybody else so I'm glad that we had a representation there I met with Priscilla Fuentes the American Red Cross Cascades region head along with uh with Jerry and it was a good meeting it was mostly informational just kind of telling us what Red Cross is doing locally the uh I attended the AOC legislative and board of directors meeting yesterday uh I'll I'll defer to Catherine to talk about what happened there but uh just I do want to point out the bill that you talked about in in the transportation committee voting you took an opposition position and but the rest of them took a supportive position it was really helpful to have that vote as we took the same position and changed the tide on that one so I just want you to know I I osmosis we were thinking yeah I think so it was all we're all coming together this week I have the mpac Coordinating Committee meeting I have a meeting with next up and uh the volunteer appreciation celebration I'm planning to attend I also have a meeting that night so there's there's just like you guys there's conflict mine is on the back side so that's probably a good so that's it great minute left wow I always get under Fire not too much you've seen my uh my meetings this week or if I have a lot I want to say thank you to the Clean Water folks for their presentations on Thursday that was always good to hear a bit of what they're doing I had a great conversation with Stephen and our soon to be departed Chris steffenbach I didn't realize she was leaving so quickly and um that there's a real law she's a regional leader she's just not Washington County so she is a huge huge loss I know where she lives that's good that you do you're going to pass the motion that revokes her retirement yeah it's going to be pretty simple no surprise to all of us but that would be wrong they retired the potential retiree says the lawyer speaking the lawyer about that's okay who at this table is blunt retirement a couple of times according to himself I've never flunked it because I've never even thought about it uh just two other quick things one is with a nice conversation with the sheriff in the D.A and um they understand obviously our budget fight and our understanding that they need to make some Cuts but I offered and I think they probably approach others to do a little deeper dive well you know I'm a numbers guy I like to see what they're doing they're contending uh you know they have some real challenges and next year and a year after that which I probably agree that they probably do been meeting with Greg mom gonna do that again today and that's my interest there is to see what what's really happening I also very interested in the CIP program I should bring it back because and and honey you can disagree in all the board can but I why it's coming back yeah no not coming back what I was what I'm about oh okay what I'm about to say um I think all of you will be faced with a rather interesting about about they're not valid but a challenge budget and not only this year next year but on the out years once you see what that ceip is it's it's a lot bigger from what I'm looking at it's a lot bigger than we've really acknowledged and I know you and I've talked about that and agree that we've got to pay some attention to it and we've got to look at that number and I still haven't heard exactly what that is so maybe you have but I haven't I don't know what that nut has to crack totally but you know annually what's that look like my prediction it could be at least 10 to 20 million a year easily so uh would be interesting challenge but at least better that we know absolutely permanently suspend disbelief and yeah go about as if there are no there are no problems at all yeah there's no yeah that's that's a reminder the CIP will be coming back in front of the board one of the inputs that is necessary to get to that number commissioner Rogers is our facility condition index similar to a pavement condition index so our facilities team currently is under contract with a firm to look at all of our facility assets to determine what is our facility condition index that that condition index helps identify what our hvacs roofs Etc that need to be replaced this is just our existing footprint though this doesn't take into account um the growth of a growing County a new um a potential in the future to accommodate a growth in the courthouse there's also needs in the jail and so how not only maintenance of our existing footprint but in but expansion to meet our growing community that all needs to be taken into account for a CIP so you are absolutely right that that number is not um fully realized or known yet until we get further data and information I will say one thing I'm surprised most time but I'll say one thing uh it's really a and it's for the public not for the sport it's really heartening to see that this board is taking that topic on this isn't a pleasant topic I mean nobody would like to have to deal with this big nut but we have to and I've not seen any wavering and any flinching at all like the full disclosure full valuation so I I think the public should understand that we're we're doing the job that needs to be done I mean this isn't we could do like everybody else and say well I thought it failed and we'll go off for a bond but we're trying to plan and it's a lot different so I don't know that's I'm sorry no no need to apologize we're all in this together and trying to sort our way",

        "text": "good afternoon we'll be starting in just a couple of minutes thank you for your patience we're just going to wait for a couple more people to join us good afternoon and thank you for coming uh we'll be starting our meeting now and i would like to hand it over to janine benner our director of our agency great thank you so much michael um as michael said my name is janine benner and i'm the director of the oregon department of energy and i want to kick this meeting off this afternoon by saying thank you we really appreciate you spending time with us to talk about how the department of energy can help wildfire survivors with energy efficiency investments and we really hope you'll be willing to share your thoughts with us on how we can design a program that will work well for survivors on the line with us today are a number of my colleagues from the department of energy so you just heard from michael freels he's leaning our efforts to design and launch the program christy split leads our government relations work and she'll be monitoring the q a on this call andy cameron heads up our energy efficiency and conservation team and we've also got a number of other folks on the line to take notes and answer questions and we're also pleased to be joined by andy bolton he's an analyst at the building codes division who will share a bit about what his agency's doing on wildfire recovery and finally i'd like to recognize that i think we're going to have representative pam marsh on the line and we'll look forward to hearing comments from her in a few minutes and i also see that we have jackson county commissioner dave on the line so commissioner thanks for joining us we are hoping to have a really interactive meeting with a lot of questions and feedback from the attendees and that michael will walk you through how to participate in this meeting shortly and i also just want to make sure that people are aware this meeting is being recorded so thanks for advancing to the next slide before we jump into the meeting i do want to take a minute and let you know a little bit about the oregon department of energy especially for those that we haven't had the opportunity to work with before so what you see on the screen is our vision our mission and how we achieve that mission so at the oregon department of energy we help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable energy system we advance solutions to shape an equitable clean energy transition protect the environment and public health and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for current and future providing support for wildfire survivors to rebuild in a way that saves energy and money will contribute towards a safe equitable clean and sustainable future and it's our hope that this program can help make life at least a little bit easier for survivors in terms of energy efficiency and i'm personally personally glad that the department of energy can play a small role in recovery so now i'm going to turn it back to michael to give you a sense of the agenda for today's meeting and how you can engage in the conversation michael you're on mute i think i apologies okay so first we'll go through our meeting agenda and talk about webex logistics and the meeting format of the outreach meetings that we've been doing in future meetings we'll talk about the legislation that kind of brought us here and we'll talk about our initial plans for what our program could look like and some of our ideas of how to do it and we'll hear from annie bolton of dcbs's wildfire hardening program which is great but we should have quite a bit of time at the end for questions in an open forum and we've got questions for you and we'll ask you questions uh throughout the presentation but we're hoping that can be an open forum at the end and we do want people not to feel limited by the questions we ask so we want to hear feedback a variety of aspects on rebuilding and what uh challenges people are facing and how we might be able to help uh and so we've got questions but we want to hear from you and basically want to spend a lot of time listening today as well as uh informing you and as jane said this this meeting is recorded and will be available after online using the webex platform so hopefully what you see here it looks similar to the the general webex platform that you're using and you can see the panelists uh so in this webex platform we've actually got everybody on mute so if you have a statement you want to make or you have a question or anything like that you can raise your hand and you if you see it in the upper right you can click on that and raise your hand i believe if you are on the phone you can push star three which raises your hand and then we can unmute you and you can speak and we'd love to hear your question or comment or feedback you'd like to and please notice i know janie mentioned there's a q a format so you can also if you don't feel like voicing your question or response you can write a a question in that q a box and please have it send out to everybody so we can all see your question uh and we will you can certainly attend or ask questions that way or provide feedback whichever way you would prefer so this is one of a series of outreach meetings we're doing so we started with oregon coast and we did the mckenzie river area and the marion county santiam area and now we're talking to the southern oregon and we're trying to capture large areas of where the wildfires of 2020 really hit because we want to hear feedback and and hear how the recovery efforts are going we do have a kind of a wrap-up final meeting next week where we want to talk about this program what we want to do but also what kind of feedback what we've heard in these community meetings and what our plans are going forward with with rulemaking and how to design a program and some kind of an initial framework of what we think our rules for that program will look like so if you know somebody who's very interested in this process and wasn't able to attend today that might be a great opportunity for them to be involved and all these meetings are also recorded and on our website so people are certainly welcome to to take a look at those and and listen in another opportunity which i'll mention a couple times today is we've got a public comment portal available and we will send it follow up with the link to this so you don't have to write it down now but on that public comment portal we've got questions on there for people to answer we've also got a space you could if you have a document that you'd like to upload or just a general field if you want to enter in a bunch of feedback on it we'd appreciate any any opportunity to hear from you and receive that feedback so please take the time to do that the one of the reasons why we're here today is in 2020 we had severe wildfires across the state over a million acres burned over for 21 fires there were high winds there was drought quite a combination of factors that led to a lot of destruction over 5 000 structures were destroyed so we have representative marsh here and mr representative marsh may i ask you to speak a little bit about southern oregon and the recovery efforts there and your thoughts to the agency on what we should work on thank you thank you michael thanks for the chance to be here and thank you for setting this up so that members of our community can provide some direct input as you are putting the incentives i would say in southern oregon um jackson county where we had a loss of probably 2600 housing units 2500 in the almeda fire and another 100 in the open chain fire we are a toe into recovery but we've we have a fair number of permits for this point in the recovery polled um the last time i saw it was around 25 although i don't have the most recent number but but those are largely in our single family home area so you're starting to see some people even back in their in new homes and some neighborhoods starting to take shape where we have not yet seen recovery move forward is in the manufactured home rv sector that where we experienced a lot of our dramatic loss of those 2600 units 15 to 1700 were manufactured homes or and rvs in about 18 manufactured home parks which were largely or fully destroyed so that's really where we see the work ahead in large part certainly no question that that there are single-family homes where owners are still struggling to pull permits and to figure out what their path forward is going to be um but the big and obvious gap is in manufactured housing thank you representative marsh for for those thoughts and and certainly we'll we'll highlight some of the work we want to do in that manufacturing home space and and that's what we've heard from communities that there is a great to help people and and help with them that need and we should i ca i should also add since um since i have a microphone here that that's really where our most vulnerable families probably live the families that are going to need the best hand up in order to rebuild in a way that's energy efficient or that's up to current codes those were the place and certainly people in single-family homes will sometimes will struggle as well but our manufactured homes are really where our working people our people of color our elders were largely living and so the availability of this incentive could really be critical for their ability to purchase the best unit or should they decide to do to return to the community in some other way to purchase a different kind of unit thank you representative marsh uh christy would you kind of talk through the legislation of what's brought us here today sure thank you so much uh representative marsh i also just want to say thanks also to commissioner daughter for joining us and for senator jeff golden for joining us as well and i'm sure all three of them were involved in passing legislation during the 2021 legislative session to help aid recovery and rebuilding for their from those conversations to crucial bills passed one of them house bill 2289 was a bill designed to streamline the rebuilding process and so that bill and the conversations around it gave rise to the incentive program we're here to discuss today house bill 2289 had",

        "text": "Waters city engineer of the city of Sherwood I brought Dougie the project engineer for clean water services um I described that as kind of the equivalent of the city of Humira up there also it's great that there's someone assigned to the project within web services yeah so we have bodies here um why are we here um the purpose of the presentation well this project can have been on hold since early 2020 uh we did the feasibility and Alignment study that was completed and wrapped up for the end of 2019 into 2020 and then as we know the world changed then and resources and things and whatnot and here we are today we'd also like to host an open house in April for this project so we'd like to kind of give you guys an update on everything and let you know where we're at before we go to the open house um April 13th at Middleton Elementary is where we're planning to do it um or we could do it here but uh right after now we're just going to match the same location as the open house in 2019 to this project um also we're going to present the remaining work in the schedule and let you know when we will be back here um it's not going to include much uh financial information because we don't have detailed cost estimates and uh we'll be back Craig Sheldon and I for the CIP plan presenting the high level numbers for this project but the numbers from my perspective the numbers will sort out we want the project done yes so that's what we're here to let you know about the best way to do that looking at this case pick it up where we left at February 19th of 2019 and you can just start the and this was uh presented to I think most of you guys that are on the council a couple counselors by Bob Galati and here we are these are the things he went over in response to active development in school development follows uh to your critical Goose Creek so where we're at now is we're at the 30 to 60 percent design and we're going to show you the current proposed alignment tonight but ATS is actively working on the design and so there's some slight changes that are being made to that that we're going to present at the open house um the two are actually served a dry line at the high school if you didn't know that that's on a temporary pump station right now the pumps to the Northeast up to the nation adjacent subdivision so this project will um end at that dry line and hook that up so this is critical to getting a high school off of a pump system right now and the modeling has been done for this project that's not critical to get it off the vote system because it's just cheaper level CWS doesn't further standards doesn't allow private pump stations and that was an agreement it was a temporary temporary fix yeah okay lower cost lower maintenance long term okay great modeling is done and the exact pipe size I don't know if you guys block betting yet I think we're pretty pretty close on that and that will be used to determine kind of the financing and costs so why would it be anything other than 15. isn't it 15 well we already built to the edge yeah but you have to sometimes the slow uh demand that you make the pipe bigger so the so you get things correctly so uh example the Third Street leading the sewer project here and that had to be 24 inches just because it was so flat just to get a lot okay is there any risks that the existing that existing 15 inch will be too small if it will in the long term it does not have the capacity for the full growth of the area so it will be a future project to upsize the existing senior trunk line because that's a 15 inch stretch it continues to be that size right yeah I had a question I would follow it was going to follow up about just letting everybody know when that threshold would be and if that's just the high school coming online I think that would yeah that's a long term upgrade so full build out is why we need to pull both out I'm just guessing that when the high school comes online project increase capacity yeah we're I'm just all right so this is the map that was presented this is the approximate alignment from 2019 red line here 's the project start here Distributing here and this is the dry line that was installed over here at the high school which is just sitting there right now and they're pumping up this subdivision up here this is a change to that route they looked at for 30 design so this is the pulmonary route that's presented during the feasibility study and this is actually being proposed because it's uh follows a vegetative Corridor and stream is that right that's one reason and then there was some uh conflicts with septic systems as well as things along the way that we're and this is the overall probably 29 alignments that data submitted 30 plans is where the project begins this actually is the don't confuse this is broken in here or not this is developed this is broken in this is County so portions of this project actually go into the county that's why the CWS is handling the product because it's quite complex but the beginning the beginning of the beginning point of the project is actually for some of it's already been built by the developer so that's why so it's picking up at the end of the subdivision section here's the schedule I'm not putting this on here so you have to read it this is just to show you the design work that's been completed on this project because I think this works session should have occurred last summer last fall was to let you guys know the project was kicking back off since we hadn't been here since 2019 so this is all the design work that's been completed since then and this is all the remaining work that's ahead of us here over the next six to eight months or so so this is the last time we were here in these are all the things that we said we'd get done the feasibility studies done there's still some easements that need to be negotiated so there's a little bit of right-of-way acquisition work that this is the current phase that we're in development of construction did set um and Doug can you maybe go over kind of a time frame for when this works I think it completed sure so right now we've just completed the 30 plan set which is nailed down more or less the alignment of the sewer detail over the next few um starting this month we'll be going to Washington County to begin the land use process the parts that are outside of city of Sherwood in Washington County land use process and working on Wetland fermenting and we're doing part of that we have to do the archaeological and all the Environmental Studies so all those are going underway right now so we'll be submitting for land use permits submitting for wetland uh impact permits will be completing the archaeological start the process going through the accused of Washington County and anticipating this summer we will be at 60 which is when we'll start finalizing the legal descriptions and acquisitions and hopefully if all goes well we will be completing the plans early this fall with the winter bid or construction spring of 2024. assuming we figure the fun again which is what we'll be back to discuss with you guys about this project and how we're going to fund it in about six six months once we get between 60 to 90 percent is that yeah so we'll present the project financials in another work session because what does CIP stand for the capital Improvement okay plan or Capital Improvement program okay or Capital thank you we usually just see CIP plans I've heard a bunch and I can't remember jumping ahead and what do you can do string Corridor in water work and what you can deal with removing trees so um because of like a Draper or stuff like that so are you appropriately uh that's a whatever to optimize those windows to not cause the further delays because it's not your fault not your fault but we are only two years behind or three years behind yes we are we are working through this issues as we speak um there are a lot of sections of the project that don't have um so yeah we'll be we'll be looking at that ideally you want to remove treats outside of the microtuburn window those times there's no extra steps to do they're not nesting at that time adult birds are not protected any answer baby birds in there so if you do end up you can remove them at other times of the year it's a lot more complicated process you have a in the tree ideally you won't avoid that and most of our our Wetland impacts our or industry isolated levels on your side so we should have some flexibility with but we are it's definitely on the looking towards results yeah I don't know if you guys do early tree removal contracts but it's one of the things we're considering and looking at and then um the exact length of duration of construction I know in the first phase of Truck Lines built with the Middlebrook subdivision it was you know slow going construction difficult conditions a lot of groundwater a lot of pressure stability issues so we're not exactly sure um how long it's going to take to see what happened so all the conditions we hit once again so and then uh you mentioned that this would be good for a little while so if Sherwood West comes in though are we going to do all this up and put in this section of the new construction Brooklyn trunk line is size for the ultimate build out okay but the existing Cedar Creek trunk was not built with anticipation of it connecting all the way around that connects in at the or the one that connects or go back where can I go through stones for yeah well it's not just a blue line this is what Doug's talking about here and this this needs me too I'm interested okay so this was not just that one potentially because that connects over up there right but I'm I guess what I'm saying so when when Sherwood West gets built in we're not going to have to re-dig up this red line no no that's been accounted for in the study from Sherwood West so we may have to dig up the blue line and and uh yeah okay perfect all right I think you guys did uh sizing projects yeah I just I just didn't want because I feel like if that was my land and you were",

haven't announced it so we have a I'm sorry okay so there's uh we have someone dialed in at 503 I won't say the whole number out last four digits are six one three are you here for Citizens comments tonight if you are just unmute and looks like a no do we have any uh anyone in the audience that wants to give consider some comments tonight oh great come on up did you fill out one of the forms yeah just go ahead and hand it to Colleen all right yeah go ahead and have a seat um yeah so just quick comments for anyone who's new to this uh send us some comments or a chance for you guys to to uh give comments to council it's a mainly a listening session for us we're not going to necessarily take comments or questions during comments I mean you have four minutes and there's a convenient little clock over there if you run a little bit over that's okay anyway so go ahead and state your name and address and uh go ahead welcome my name is Nathan Claus I'm actually my address is in Las Vegas I'm my parents live here in town and so what I came to talk about tonight is they've been doing um their property is 22211 Southwest Pacific Highway do you want my Las Vegas address or that's fine oh okay yeah um and they've been working on on their property getting a like functional and developed for a while I know my dad and mom come and talk to you at citizen comments often you probably don't see me I haven't lived here in like three or four years um but I want to talk about um something as um it was a little frustrating to me is my my folks are working with this this individual named Carlos I forget his last name but he's this small businessman and he's running this this really cool business where they are um where they drill under and they put lines below like um like phone lines and things like that are really cool like public service that they help provide and so my folks a couple weeks ago got a letter from the city saying that there was a violation with like the zoning ordinance that didn't allow um Carlos and his business to use the property at 22211 Southwest Pacific Highway being used this particular way the thing that was really frustrating to me is this letter just said we don't think this use is permitted there was no like explanation for why they didn't think the use was permitted other than it was attacked on and so here's like the definitions but there was no explanation further on and I know Carlos has been trying to work with the cities called a couple times make it because we want to make sure that like everything's all for lack of their word kosher but it's been frustrating on my end because I've been trying you know I like I help out as much as I can but it really seems like there's this disconnect that's happening of like communication between like the staff members and I know that um it seems like the staff members have been like there's communication like it doesn't seem like it's broken down at all but it just seems like people are talking but they're not really connecting if that makes sense and so I really wanted to tell or give the advice of like in the future if when there's these situations if the city can try to contact the people beforehand before they just send this like blanket violation letter because the letter stated that um the city came on to like city property and viewed into um into my folks place to like view the violation and they took pictures but there was no like there was no communication to my parents or to Carlos that like this use was not permitted and even now in my like simple reading of the the code and trying to understand I don't really understand what the like what is the complaint that's going on because I've heard well you can't have truck storage but like but you can and then there's this like well we can't let these coils that they use to put the the wires and like sit there in storage even though it's part of like the trucks and the trucks aren't really being stored there because you know every single day the trucks go out and it's just there overnight because it's part of like the business and it's something that I would think that the city would be excited about to have this the small business guy who's got this great service he's got like over 10 employees that he has come in and like work and it's this cool operation and it's just frustrating on my end and like times where people are talking about that there's not enough oh I'm sorry don't go ahead and finish up yeah um and so to summate like everything I'm saying is like I I really appreciate that instead just try having a more Cooperative environment for this like kind of situation because I think this is a great benefit to the city and I don't like I don't understand the like what the specific issue with this is going on and I love if they could have like a specific here's where we're objecting kind of thing thank you for your time letting me go a little longer all right thank you Nathan she wants to make or she wants to give testimony as well I don't know Susan are you on there okay we'll try again after we'll try again after this um so the next one for the in-person uh we have uh RJ Claus Jim Jim Claus hi Jim I'm doing good how are you thanks yeah okay now Carlos doesn't even want his birthday brought up I begged him to come here and he said do it but he said they don't want us here I said when you're Hispanic I've warned you now I'm just venting that she was an issue because we've had issues with Hispanics before here Dan Lumen wasn't it Keith that was doing that on the switchboard that got everybody upset or was it somebody else now my boy to you is really very simple I first put in Automotive and other parking of all kinds Ken Shannon came over and asked me and I said well it's non-conforming use and they're allowing it then he asked me about what he should do with his building and I foolishly told him because we had the original Fred Meyer store in Vancouver and we found a way to use it and that's what he did I don't think Ken had the original idea of his life but that's all right now all of the sudden he's got a hundred Vehicles over there and all kinds of other stuff no problemo but this guy comes on and he wants to bring the pipe and materials he runs daily it's not inventory it's a commercial operation it's just simply that you can't label anything else and he needs up to a thousand feet a day which is four rolls now you know if you spot by from a wholesaler you're going to go broke I'll leave that right where it is because that's what the intent was in my opinion and belief now as to Solutions Ron croup who was the director for district manager number one came out one day and we had long talk and he said are you amenable since you own the only three easements between Meineke Road and sunset to some kind of solution I said yes now you want to hear this very carefully because group is really shocked about he was told you we're going to run that road through being you didn't care if there was a constitutional amendment or if there was case law saying you couldn't do it you were conspiring to break the law now I don't think that's what you were doing I think what you were doing was trying to keep that property from coming into competition with less favorable property at the same price I think it was a conspiracy restrained trade and then the demands had something to do with that but that's my opinion to believe and we will find out deposition no let's just votes for miniature attorney finds out that is your country swim in which you can't take easements well John McCulloch who said good friend of mine lost that case and he said you got to be stupid if you can't read Hanson video dot and that amendment to know you pay and even if you give a better reason but you have to pay for the ones you take now think about that Trinity know you're conspiring to steal real estate now Tim I don't think you're involved but I think maze is I'm curious if you've ever stayed in Hawaii at anybody that's attended or anything of langers we find that out in deposition depositions are wonderful things you're between the devil and DBC you lie you go to",

        "text": " but um but yeah it is Du within one year after yeah I think our overall goal is to get the program started as soon as possible because we've heard that loud and clear that people want to see that happen um and that might mean that and that might also help us with the like spreading out of the funds question that came before um so anyway uh any lessons learned from our friends who have already filled out their they've already filled sent in applications um it says filed their programs I think they've just turned their in their applications so far so they're not those programs are not up and running so we don't have lessons learned yet from them on that um I believe we have been able to sometimes like kind of see some of the things that they did in their application right to help inform the application another thing that I'll just jump in and say is that those states only submitted their applications for here so we may be one of the first states to submit both homes and here yeah because we are planning to submit both at the same time um Federal hear money is a limited sum it will the only way it would expand if oversubscribed is if there was another piece of legislation adding funds to the program um do you plan to include working with retailers for point of sale rebates for here yes yes um somebody was asking about like how do we help make sure they get a retroactive rebate um in the chat above if you look for it there's a checklist that um we that us doe put together to help people understand how retroactivity works the way that it has to work is all of our criteria have to be met we don't yet know all the criteria that we're going to have so it's we think just pretty risky to guarantee retroactivity to anyone um but generally speaking it's possible if in the end we put our program together and you have clients or whoever that did did do everything did meet those criteria then they could be eligible for retroactivity hopefully that's a fair answer and I'm just trying to be fast so people please like weigh in grab me and and then um answer if you don't like what I'm saying uh uh do we know any do we have any details about how contractors will be placed on the qualified contractor list I think we're hoping to take advantage of some existing qualified contractor lists that uh are operated by both uh um Odo and etto um we're still determining whether or not all the um requirements match and and how we can make that as streamlined as possible but it will require an application by a contractor um uh if if a co- qualification isn't available yeah and I was just going to note that um that's one of the things that we will roll out before we are issuing rebates so we want to give the contractors some lead time to get up to speed to make sure that they have all the information they need to help um their customers participate in the okay so um let's see um what will the heat pump efficiencies be that we're requiring do we know that yet um so we have been talking with other implementers across the state trying to figure out what the right place to land is and it sounds like from those conversations that we will be um adhering to the energy star certification minimum standard um for heat pump in the programs although especially in the homes program where we're looking for High Energy savings um a higher efficiency will likely make it more likely that your project would be eligible okay um Tim has maybe more of a comment on most just asking about I think we already said we don't yet have the policy designed for um limiting displacement so I'm going to take this as a comment that he's wondering about limit like limits to raising rent for two years retrofit for example consumer protection um piece of the implementation blueprint that we will be um finalizing before we submit that so we have more to report on that before the implementation blueprint is submitted uh I can drop in in the chat a little screenshot that I took of the um application how it sort of describes this since I didn't do a great job of it before you can see sort of what we're going to be using to design this aspect of the program um Cal uh Doug Piper is sharing that California is planning to restrict homes to low income in the initial years um Lisa McGarity maybe she's saying that Ekko is rate payer dollars from her question a while ago about braiding those incentives I think I'll just quickly say like we're planning on figuring out how to braid all the various different programs together the best that we can and we might not have specific answers right now about how exactly that's going to work but just know we've been meeting with lots of folks that run Energy Efficiency programs around the states and make that to figure out how to make that all work um oh goodness Jessica's got a complicated one with a lot of acronyms um does any do people know what means is that weatherization maybe okay so if a household is at or below 200% of the federal poverty limit it would be in their best interest to work with their local lie WAP program and low inome weatherization assistance program is that right and which would provide whole home weatherization I think and likely a heat pump as well getting a heat pump installed would possibly preclude them from a whole home weatherization which I think this has already been fixed right or no um but is there any mechanism to rout low income folks to their local liap program first yeah so we are um definitely planning on working in coordination with the the local low-income weather i ization programs um It's Not Our intention to um set a project up to um to make them eligible for additional uh assistance uh the goal would be to have the programs um either go in the order that makes the most sense or to be um processed together so that they could take advantage of the the rated funding and help us extend both programs further okay and then we're still working on the details I guess is the will order of operations be required in other words will you require that envelopes be updated to some minimum level before other improvements to benefit um we've been talking about requiring like for the homes program specifically um that uh weatherization um and similar upgrade be considered um in the energy model that's done to determine whether or not they're needed to support the the remaining Energy Efficiency upgrades um it's and we're still figuring out how that works with the point of sale rebate intention in here program um but it is definitely Our intention that we are not just installing heat pumps in homes that um don't have envelopes that would support Energy savings um that can definitely drive out costs if you wind up um relying on lack of heat um electric resistance in the heat pump uh in that situation so um working on the consumer protection requirements around that um and the quality assurance requirements to make sure that projects are successful uh okay um Leisa mity do people know where Lisa works or maybe we have her email address we can follow up with her she wants to talk about brating where wherever she works their lowincome Energy Efficiency oh I guess maybe Natural Gas provider um for their rate payer funds that are separate from etto so just a we we'll get in touch Lisa um and then I think that's the end of the questions um charity I see you're still on and I think we're GNA separately reach out to you but if somebody wants to weigh in they're welcome to but I think we we just want to you can either come off mute if you want and we can talk or not but we just wanted to if we need to clarify further sort of what we're thinking about how to deal with the justice 40 stuff in Portland yeah I don't think we're setting requirements for um who has to be what to participate in the program in the Portland metro area right now we're really trying to figure out that funding calculation of what funds go in which direction and we're weighing factors like the population of the of the service areas um the other factors like remoteness and cost of doing projects as well as um Heating and Cooling um needs in those spaces so it's a little bit of a complex calculation and then that justice 40 um and lwi income prioritization in the Portland area is um kind of one of the ways we can consider um focusing on high needs in that space um kind of with while still considering all those other factors across the whole state um so I don't think we're intending to specifically exclude um portions of the Portland metro but we're trying to figure figure out how to allocate dollars in a way that makes sense um we're still working on what that calculation is going to be um exactly but those are the factors that we're considering um great thank you so much um Ben Gorman saying nice things thank you Lisa put her email address in the chat I'm cutting and pasting it out and then um one last thing is it looks like Mara and we can also get your email address from the signin um she um is also having an issue that's personal to her house so either she can reach out to us or we can find her and I will leave next follow-up webinar Bill we um we're planning on holding a webinar we're going to turn our application in in a couple of weeks which is sort of a barebones application and then you put together this much medier implementation blueprint and we will be working to put that together as quickly as we can and get it submitted as quickly as we can after we get the application in um and so our plan is to have another webinar similar to this one around the same time the blueprint goes in just like we did with this one around the same time as our application will go in hopefully that sounds reasonable but it's a little nebulous right summer is that fair great that's a good ballpark cool all right well um hey Bill likes it okay well thanks everyone who stayed late over about like half our attendees stayed and listened in which is really lovely and um uh and Marsha we're gonna follow up with you because your situation is like specific to your project and with that I'm super late to a meeting so I'm and U we really appreciate everyone's comments and thoughts and care and really looking forward to working together in making all of this stuff hopefully come together and work out um as well as possible for",

give us the ability to kind of get going on some of that work so um and if anyone's curious our um our legislative coordinator government relations coordinator Christy split did a fantastic job putting together a legislative session report that outlines all of the bills that kind of impact our agency over the um that that occurred over the session so um it provides a really good snapshot of all the all the different legislation that that came through that we were tracking um and there's a link to that on this and that covers um that that section for me um I don't know if there's any questions or anything that anyway I just wanted to chat about yeah thanks Blake thanks Mark anybody have any questions for Mark or you guys must have done a dazzling job because there's no questions coming in not usually that usually gets people to start asking questions all right so I guess we can move along next slide is uh Kelly Thomas who will be discussing the residential code Kelly you ready to go uh so just uh last month that the rule there was was passed and so the 2023 um is going to be effective October 1st uh of this year we attached a six-month phase-in period for it so um April 1st which is which is a Monday it'll be um it you know it'll be permanent so you know you can get permits in up until the Friday before that and the chat chapter one is is automatically effective but you know the chapter 11 and and the ones that you're uh uh probably Keen in on um do have the facing period so the face and period means that that both the 20 either the 2021 or 2023 orc are acceptable for the energy and mechanical uh we've got a couple technical bulletins uh just started working on one um yesterday to go with everything it's for for air sealing uh recognize the importance of that and and you know um and furthering that so we're putting out a big technical bulletin with some uh drawings and and things like that that should help people um Implement some good air sealing um air barrier um construction methods also be updating the bulletin for the uh air ducts inside we've got a couple different Provisions that were um done in the 2023 so we're going to do that and then you know if there really what we do a lot is um just kind of feel the questions between the you know over the course of the code and see what what comes up so you know if there's anything you guys feel uh technical bulletin might be helped you know helpful um let us know and and we'll take that into consideration uh we've got uh the University of Oregon as many of you know they're kind of our third party that does the analysis of the of the code um they've done zerh 2005 2021 2017 and now 2023 um and uh that report is going to be produced finalized this month and they're showing that we are you know equal to or better at the zerh so we have achieved uh the goal of uh executive order 1720. the nice thing about that is it gives us a uh you know a really nice slope what some people call the Glide pass to um to meeting the other executive order that we talked about 2004 and 60 reduction so um and that puts us on a great slope I mean there's still uh plenty of work to do and we'll be talking to a lot of you over the course of the next couple years for the 2026 and 2029 codes and then the rmsb uh the next one is October 4th of this year and there is uh you know obviously we don't have an agenda set but uh um Mark's going to talk about a a little bit there there might be some reach code action a couple other things but uh right now um just keep an eye out for that next uh next agenda on that the rmsb um is there any questions on the residential code at this point we have one in the chat Kelly it's uh from Alex yeah well the U of O report be made it'll be a public document when it's uh when it's produced so you can ask I don't think we've ever really posted them online but you can certainly inquire and they will make it available and Daryl I tried on the previous slide tapping on the legislative report and it didn't pick anything up it might be just because I'm on my iPhone and I can get it off the recording but it would it be possible to put that link in the chat sure we can do that sure thing yeah I'll add it right now thank you I appreciate it thanks Blake all right I don't see any other questions for residential let's move along to commercial hey Roger uh once again Mark Heiser with um I want to talk about uh the next version of the of the Oregon Energy Efficiency specialty code which will be based on Nashua standard 90.1 2022. um the process was kicked off the last construction industry energy board meeting on June 13th um one thing that we do of course is look at it's maintaining the timeline that we had said to get once 90.1 a new addition is published have the new one ready to go um ready within one year of the publication date have the process you deep into it within the by the construction industry energy board for their review we expect to have a draft of the oeesc document which is really the integration of what is chapter 13 of the building code with 90.1 to make sure the administrative Provisions are fixed uh bringing in previous modifications just making sure that it works here in Oregon within our building code AS we've noted in the past um really if you are interested should have should be reading 90.1 2022 if there's specific areas of interest to um something that might be beneficial or important uh for state of Oregon that can bring to the attention of the division and the C board um we expect a anticipated public hearing date of November 14th and then we're hoping for an adoption date of January 1st 2024 if all goes well so 90.1 2022 has been available for for a while now for reading we want to make sure that we've got this thing actually since really the first of the they did a lot in it there are a few new things which is a whole chapter on um what we call additional measures here in Oregon or a point system that's seen the iecc and in Washington so with different requirements for different building types it's a really big jump forward so we look forward to input from everyone and that is it for the commercial code side darn Mark I was hoping to offer input without reading ashrae 90.1 but and I guess I gotta follow the rules here anybody have any questions for uh mark on the commercial side you're probably reading the asteroid 90.1 I'm sure all right Jim how about you hey Mark how are you all right Jim how can I uh so how about any of the um appendices um you know there's going to be a zero based appendix that's on a rush schedule is the state of Oregon they do and this is tied to the to the IRA funding um is is the state of Oregon planning to do anything with compliance along those lines as opposed to the the zero framework you currently have in the code we would be and oh gosh I'm trying to remember the number of the appendix that we're talking about here it's l or it's either IRL like here it's it's being yeah oh it's the new one yeah yeah so yeah so we base our adoption strictly on what's adopted at the time of publication not a not continuing so it's 90.1 2022 as published not additional addenda which will be a 90.1 2025. so we correct we wouldn't be considering something that's not published as part of the book yeah for 90.1 2022 so that would be in 2025. and when we look at adopting that after that's published that would be probably the 26 27 Oregon code okay so it won't be an alternative for it would possibly be something we'd look you know the people are looking at for a reach code proposal but but not as within mandatory code and we have to base it on what's published at time of the original document all right thanks okay hey Gary how about asking a oh I was just going to make a comment related to uh Jim's I I think the way it's uh headed that it was zero emissions addendum um is that it'll be informational and um meant to be a potential jurisdictional option I think kind of that's the way they're headed it's not meant I don't think to be a normative thing to get more of an informative thing that was just on a meeting on that today so just just to come thanks thank you all right we're oh Kevin go ahead hi yeah this is Kevin rose with Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance uh similar question uh somewhat um but this is about amendments that have been approved or I should say approved addenda to use the correct terminology um to the 2022 standard that have already been approved uh the most notable of that is one that I know of at least is one on fan power um so these are things that were intended to go into 2022 but didn't get there until the last moment but have already been approved uh and are already out the door and and through public comment and all that as I understand it um is there uh interest um on on the uh behalf of anybody on the call here to fold in those things that are you know right off the shelf and ready to go uh and and pick them up while while they're available given our timing in this process Uh Kevin without a question to the division or to others on the call I guess um I'm certainly interested in the divisions uh uh thoughts on it but uh given where a panelist stakeholders here I guess uh since uh the fan power limitation one might not be the only addenda I'm also I guess curious about folks's conceptual uh interest in in this approach so from the division standpoint if it's something that",

        "text": " of wildfire risk in the noi and then requiring that risk analysis uh which is described in the standard uh as part of the application as well as oh sorry and i guess i will need to go and edit this um as well as the draft wildfire mitigation plan um and i want to point out that sometimes when we have these draft mitigation plans their submittal is deferred uh later in the process and and i would actually recommend for this issue that the rules specifically require the draft to be submitted as part of the application unless you want to delegate that review to to staff in some way so um okay before we make our final decision then i will uh i need to make a change to the red line about the draft plan because it has that conditional language in it too so i'll just uh go back and do that um while maybe you're discussing how you want to proceed on the other issues um but similar to how we discussed the timeline for the protected areas rule making i just want to point out that we have a a draft timeline that we've put together we're recommending that the rulemaking hearing for this project be kind of held concurrently or you know at the same time as the uh other two rule making hearings that we currently have scheduled at the june meeting and then uh we would have the council be looking at the adoption of permanent rules in july um you i do want to just point out that since this is a new standard and it's substantial rule change when you do adopt permanent rules you always have the ability to postpone their effective date if you want so you can either have those rules effective immediately upon your decision like upon by filing to the secretary of state or if you want to specify a later effective date when you make that final decision you can do that i just wanted to put that in your heads now uh um but that's not something you need to decide on today sorry um i was just gonna ask since you're making some changes would you like us to take a few minute break and give you a moment so you don't feel under the gun are you okay if you have anything to discuss for like one minute i think that's all i need but uh otherwise if you do want to take a quick break that's okay too anybody need a break i'm just trying to be mindful of him because we took a break he did not give you five minutes all right haley's proposing we're giving you five minutes wonderful taking a break thank you thank you chair grill uh so i just on the screen now you'll see uh uh just changes to the information implementing the uh chris can you make that a little larger please absolutely cheer girl i think and i will say one that is for the record this is chris clark council's wolves coordinator um not necessarily now that we're on video but probably still helps so um just what's on the screen now is is just another uh conforming change to make the information requirement for the application uh similar to the revised rule that would just always require a wildfire mitigation plan the revised language would state that uh requiring information about wildfire risk would need to include but now it would not be limited to a draft wildfire mitigation plan um and this would be so that's a relatively straightforward change um i think that the two issues that there weren't or i so i think there wasn't consensus on whether or not there should be a goal post in the new standard and uh there are uh i didn't get a clear resolution on the exception although it sounded like most people were comfortable including it um so i guess i'll start with that second one were you was everyone comfortable including the exception for facilities that would be subject to a puc or cou approved plan or would you like to see that language i think this is handily uncomfortable with it okay i'm comfortable with it that's it i guess the last issue oh that's right sorry yeah we're all good here excellent thank you thank you sure um so i guess the the remaining issue then that needs to be resolved is is how you want to proceed with the goal post and whether or not this standard should be applicable to um all future council decisions on requests for amendment or just future applications and requests that have not yet been determined to be any thoughts and i do have uh example language if you'd like to see what a goal post would look like back to the original language that you i'm sorry councilmember jenkins could you repeat that can you go back to the original language you proposed all right for this for the goal post all right so this is what this is this is what would be the example you can decide right now we've recommended that this not be included and not including this language would mean that basically any application or request that is currently before so she's asking if i'm still on hey jordan you need to mute your phone there we go sorry about that it's all right um hold on one second chris i was just making sure he was still on since cindy recused herself so okay keep going all right okay yeah so i guess the question before you is whether or not you want to include the section three which would establish a goal post and say that the standard doesn't apply to request or application that was determined to be complete uh on or before the effective date of the rule and again staff's recommendation is to not include this language um but the council obviously uh is it's up to you if we eliminate it we have a bad fire season it's going to kind of point to us we should have required the fire the wildfire protection come in if if we don't or if we here this would make it so that we for those that were complete before the effective date of the rule you see what i'm saying for the record todd cornett um what i'd say is with this one um there's a shelf life with this that's true language you know so anybody that's in application now um if you eliminate that would have to meet the fire safety even if they're after preliminary application right now or after completeness right now as long as they're in the process they will ultimately have to meet this but all those projects that are past that phase once they kind of get past it won't matter anymore because everybody will pro prospectively have to meet the fire safety plan it's just those that are currently in application and whether you want to kind of give them kind of that goal post where you know say somebody's already at then you would say if we kept the language they would not have to meet this fire safety plan uh requirement um but if you remove this language you know and it takes three months you know and they're three months further down after completeness they would still have to meet it so it's again it's it really is it's the goal post it's short kind of shelf life you know for applicability but it is an important question to kind of think still wrestle with i want to say that i am not getting uh or council member jenkins audio so um if there's a question for me he's not getting your um just a second chris go ahead i would support reading the language in churchill yes cindy cindy condon um generally i um agree on changing changing the game just to me this is such a wildfire is devastating we've seen it and it's i just think it's more critical issue and when you say short-lived todd are they they're exempt from having a mitigation they're not included here they're then they don't they don't submit a mitigation plan ever the record todd cornett um council member content that's correct so let me play at the scenario just to make sure that the way i described it before was a little more clear so say today you know say we use sort of completeness you know as the goal posts say as of today an application is complete and then two months from now council adopts these new rules if you put the goal post in they would then not have to have a wildfire mitigation plan they would not be reviewed unless they did not construct their projects within the original time frames and came back for an amendment right then that new rules would trigger for them and they would have to meet all of those mitigation plan and evaluation kind of requirements so but if and again kind of playing out the scenario if you eliminated this language and somebody was complete as of today then i mean they would go on notice that they need to start working on their kind wildfire mitigation plan right now prior to assuming council approves their facility prior to approving that facility that would have to be a component of that used to this is that almost all of these projects have been getting amendments and every time you do an amendment you've got to do a wildfire mitigation plan associated with that amendment true but it depends on the amendment so um if somebody adds two acres to their site boundary maybe it applies maybe it doesn't but it doesn't retroactively apply to everything else so the amendment you know the like any rules on an amendment it's the applicable rules that would apply not everything applies to every amendment it depends now if it's a time extension to begin construction everything new would apply certainly yeah but say if you you know there was a wind farm that was approved and they were adding a solar facility we would only apply this to the solar facility not the prior approved wind farm so what about um like increasing the production of a turbine i mean again we would have to look to see you know what the triggers were you know i don't know that we could go back at the if if they were just expand expanding the blade lengths you know that's the trigger for the amendment is those blade lengths and so we would have to see how much could but i don't know that we could go back and retroactively i don't probably should be careful using that word apply the new rules to the entire so that would um i would say unlikely but i don't want to be definitive as well until we've evaluated it here crayon yes cindy um just another question i realize we're dealing with a new standard and for on application but is there any way to incorporate existing facilities not on application that within x amount of a midi wildfire mitigation plan would have to be submitted so facilities that are already approved that are already approved and operating so chris talked about this it was a little uh implicit in in one of the slides um that chris brought up um in terms of the the applicability slide so i think there's two clear",

        "text": " questions um but if there are things that we have to figure out how to way for organizations and people who represent communities that we want to be accountable to it's really helpful to know okay this is a question that i should go talk to members about and get answers around and and just be able to to know okay i'm going to give this particular feedback and i want to make sure it's representative that's really helpful really good point i guess as we go through this process and as we develop materials if we're not doing a good job of clear accessible materials in a timely let us know because we want to be responsible partners in all of this and we want to make sure that what we're doing is accessible to everybody throughout the state and all communities and so that's a really great point and definitely um we're not doing a good job let us know and help us to determine what a what a j what a good job looks as we're developing these materials i also wanted to um i saw quinn's comment in the chat about talking about the kinds of briefing materials that might be helpful is that something that would be helpful to sort of um discuss a little bit more too or get some input in this is quinn here um i you know that might be something we could we could perhaps discuss during the next portion of the meeting because i i suspect there will be some ideas for things that would be helpful um as we enter into that that great point thank you all right have i missed any comments or hands here all right um i forget where we were targeting our break in the agenda but i thought it was 2 30 and it's 2 33 so we're just almost right on um schedule here so i think we will take a few minutes to get up and stretch take a break from the screens and so if you will all be back with us at 2 45 that gives us 11 minutes to take a break and i will meet you all back here at 2 45. all right i think we will move on to the next part of our discussion here if you're if you're back from the break maybe put your camera on or let us know in the chat cool i see brandy's back great scenes and cameras turn on all right i think we've got our group back together here thank you i'd like to jump into our kind of the meat of the meeting now with our the questions that we sent out but before i do that you know in returning from the break if there were any thoughts that people want to share before we jump into the next section now is a fine time to to do that if you have anything you want to share all right so we will jump into our kind of guiding questions now these were all shared last friday via email and so um if you had a chance to review those great if not we're going to go into some detail now in looking at those questions and um we had the the questions divided up into a few different groups and the first was equity metrics and the second was kind of metrics or qualifications and then the final one were some of the elements in the bill around how projects have priority scoring and i think that there's a chance that as we go through each group of questions and especially with the equity and resilience questions that we may find that our discussion is several of the questions at once but we'll still go through each of the questions and if we feel like we've tackled it we can move on but the idea of the questions were was that we wanted to come at some of these issues from kind of a lot of different angles and make sure that we were a lot of the kind of potential issues that we may have in rule making and around how projects are passing through the if you think we we missed a key question by all means share it that's part of what we're after today um so moving on to these equity metrics as they're referred to in the i'm just going to read this slide house bill 2021 is crafted to ensure equitable distribution of funds and the program will only succeed if it reaches oregonians of diverse racial social and economic backgrounds the bill requires that 50 or more of the grants are to be awarded to projects that primarily serve environmental justice communities and then in addition to that budget carve out projects located in environmental justice communities are to receive priority scoring in the competitive review process and this appears in another part of the odo will need to evaluate projects to determine if the benefits accrue to an environmental justice community so the program guidelines will need to provide clear guidance to applicants about how to demonstrate that the project will benefit environmental justice communities and so this tease us up for again thinking about what we're doing here which is to build grant application and review process question one what measurable criteria can be established to enable odo to ensure a project is serving an ej community down below here i have the specific section defining environmental justice communities from section one of the bill includes communities of colors of colored communities experiencing lower incomes tribal communities rural communities coastal communities communities with limited infrastructure and other communities traditionally underrepresented in public processes and adversely harmed by environmental and health hazards including including seniors youth and persons with disabilities so what we're really looking for here is what can we set up in rule that is um enables a community to demonstrate that the project is serving an ej community and that odo is able to go a competitive process to ensure that we're selecting projects that are serving an ej community one thing that oh wait i see a hand up from mark go ahead mark i don't mean to uh punt the question to someone else but it just seems to me that the environmental justice task force probably i would think had to uh struggle or you know deal with some of the some aspects of this question so i'm curious if there's anything from uh that task force that we can bring to this effort yeah good okay if i jump in rob definitely yeah um yes so i i think there's definitely expertise on that body that could be very helpful it's kind of interesting when i was reviewing these questions on one of our big legislative efforts that was not successful last year um was sb 286 which would have created um effectively a state version of ej screen which rob you you referenced in the the questions that you presented for this group so you know for this question i think ej screen is absolutely an important tool but it's that has some limitations when it comes to regional data just because it has to be standardized across the entire country um so that might be a good starting place you know for us to familiarize ourselves with what's there um what we could glean from that how applicants might be able to use it as easily as possible um but and there were actually a couple of efforts in oregon to try to create some mapping tools um to identify you know communities facing disparities but it's also something that's needed in oregon so we might be having to cobble together some information from various data sets that's a really good point and it gets it touches at a a couple of questions that are coming up and related around and um whether or not it's possible to develop clear path like a map that shows which communities clearly qualify without having to go any sort of rigorous proof process so yeah certainly the tools are a key part of this and i mean even within ej screen and i've tinkered with it a little bit and if you are using ej screen and you're looking for maybe communities with lower incomes ej screen has these blocks of you know 80 to 90 percent 70 to 80 you know is there some cutoff could be a criteria referenced in rule that we can get at for describing some of these um kind of qualifications for ej communities and i know there's some some of these are quite open like rural and coastal those are well coastal presumably you would have to define some term for a coastal community that would qualify some and eliminate others but you know from the ej side are there are there some measurable criteria i see that les has less and mark both have your hands raised so maybe um quinn we will follow up with this and then move on to less yeah um i was just curious how you're defining community um you know when you're talking about rural communities and urban communities and ej uh communities um what's the scale of a community how do you define it uh because you know i'm thinking about just where i live we have a complete mix on the spectrum of um economic income economic disparities um we've got you know a pretty diverse community um i don't know how when we're looking at projects here when you're thinking about screening them like how do you break that down because you know a community can be as small as a block or a neighborhood or as large as a city or a county that's a really good question and i think it's one that warrants um warrants some discussion because you're absolutely right i mean within the type of entity that may be applying like a municipality there are many within a city or town some of those communities maybe ej communities and others are not so that's that's a good question and um even if we don't come up with a hard definition for a community we're going to have that question come up when projects are demonstrating where the kind of the benefits accrue so we have to be ready for handling that that question about what a community and what what scale are we working at i just wanted to share for the group that there's a couple things in the chat in case you weren't watching um there was a comment about using cdc social vulnerability index i provided a link to the ej screen in case you weren't familiar with it um brandi provided a link to the low-income energy affordability data tool so just wanted to make sure folks were seeing that and i know you have a question later rob about tools and this is about criteria but of course those sort of match up a little bit so it's more to fly back yeah and even within tools we have to how the tool is wielded and where the tool is identifying these criteria and that's where we get into these really quantifiable identifiable criteria that demonstrate that the money is going to the right community and that's where we have the opportunity to draw some lines and rule to make sure that we were serving the right communities and so yeah i think that gets right to the um i see phil you have your hand raised",

        "text": " know you know are you able to get your farm equipment in there is that going to create you know you can't get through the donut hole are you do you have certain agricultural practices that are going to be impacted as a result of this um we absolutely want to hear that in our process in our application right now how are you talking to to find out what those answers are you we're talking to you so we're seeking that in just one guy but that's but that's exactly what we're here for is we're seeking that information from you because you're the one who's going to be impacted you're the one who knows your farming practice we want to hear from you about that the truth of the matter is each person that owns a property should have rights as long as they don't infringe on other people if they want to if my neighbors want to participate in this project so be it it's not my place I don't feel it's my place to step in the middle of it but by the same token what you're proposing is definitely going to step in the middle of my what I'm doing you know I I keep hearing this cheap sheep sheep okay I I understand that but I I get the feeling you guys have never even seen a sheet and certainly not one in my you know I I've got a very dear friend over here that the right sheep his entire life he could tell more about she he's forgot more than I'll ever know but sheep are not going to just sit out there and graze out here if you guys actually had went to that piece of property out there maybe you have every day every day what they don't eat me and what doesn't quite up we get fans that come through and pick our windows up a mile what's the migrating ground gonna screw with solar panels I mean so I can answer a little bit of it's like any non-farm use if you're aware of that says anybody who poses hunting or agricultural pit or non they have to sign a you know essentially a right to farm um sort of requirement within the deed records of that property so they can't complain you know if you're engaging in your regular agricultural project or uh you know practices and those impact um you know their use you have that right that is you know if that's not already on the deed records of the property that they're leasing it will be um so so that's one thing but again I'll go back to it that's exactly why we're here we want to hear what those potential impacts could be on you because that's what we're going to evaluate that's we're going to tell them to look at and provide in their application and that's part of what we're going to evaluate when we're looking at that land use standard on what are the impacts to agriculture when we're doing that review you know I wasn't going to say anything I'm just going to sit back and be neutral because quite honestly I'm a very opinionated individual that could launch into who knows what at this moment but truth to matter is I don't disagree with what you're doing I'm worried about the consequences like I said for me I'm going to speak strictly for me and the people that aren't participating in the program how are you going to take care of us when there is complications or problems I I I know that that sounds a little harsh but the truth is we make our living off the land you don't we understand how this works you know and I'll move on because I'm how are we dealing with Wetlands because that area is full of wetlands out there I mean I don't I mean it's flooded half the is there is there administrative rules that allow you to build on Wetlands when the rest of us camped well that I can answer that as well there are requirements for Wetlands we have standard related to Wetlands we work with the Department of State lands to do well under delineation and if they're going to impact Wetlands they have to propose what that impact is going to be and if there are you know requirements for you know compensatory mitigation they'll have to deal with that but that's again you know the big question or the or the big point is we're so early in the process like we at least at the Oregon Department of energy don't know a lot of the answers to your questions we think your questions are good they're going to help us evaluate this you know the applicant may have looked at it a lot more than we have at this point but this is the kind of information that's helpful for us I don't know I don't know what they're going to impact in terms of wetlands but that's a requirement that we have and we're going to look at it you know what one final comment and I'll go back to the you know 1200 or 1400 Acres of weeds is what we're going to have because the Sheep are going to be gone you're going to be out there spraying like crazy or we're going to be a fires I mean has anybody even thought of that so when it comes to the Sheep I've said it before I'm not an expert um but the idea isn't that I would you know buy a bunch of sheep and just have it crazed my idea is to actually have a partnership with a local sheep Grazer and defend that but with no no irrigation and no water there's no feed for sheep after I don't know what maybe the first of June 15th of May out there I mean young man you you can't explain this away you're talking to a guy that's probably forgot more about farming than you'll ever know I mean I I'm not trying to be arrogant here I'm just saying this process is flawed because you've got administrative rules cramming things down people throw it in the neighborhood that does not want it you know the part that got me up here to be real honest with you sir is the comment was made about this meeting during Harvest you know I'm a farmer I should be home comma and wheat I've got somebody else doing it and so does a lot of the other Farmers here the problem here is I understand for a lack of Carpetbaggers coming into our neighborhood and taking control you work for us I mean you should know this you're it's our neighborhood you know we're relying on you to make the best judgment I don't you're probably not elected official but some elected official probably hired you somebody should know our neighborhood you know if this works out best for the community you know I'm the first one to say okay whatever it takes if it doesn't somebody needs to stand up and say it doesn't and I'm just not convinced who that is yet hey next is Ryan Glacier and then Bob hello my name is Ryan Glasser a little bit echoing on what he was bringing up those are definitely concerns about the um cheap grazing and uh I guess it's a little more emphasis on it it's not so much that the Sheep will not eat eat is everything on the weeds still grow during the rest of the year and she have newbies uh my main question actually was yeah the bun the better the life cycle I'll go back to the beginning explanation if that doesn't answer your question okay I mean so an application they're gonna have to submit um in detail what it's going to take to fully decommission the project okay um so they're going to break it down into what equipment they're gonna have to hire you know pulling out the piles that they're talking about um decompacting the soil that they need to restore topsoil removing roads a little land facility all that is all detailed in what they intimate us we avoid them in addition to you know so basically what we call those as unit costs in addition to those unit costs they put dollar amounts to that so we all evaluate that based on beards to say that based on today's dollars or not and if we agree with that then we also Aces we will right foreign Council would really be how do we take this thing off the landscape so if if they do that we will hold that Bond until that facility is entirely restored consistent with that plan if they don't if they go bankrupt or you know something bad happens we have that money in place and it could be in the form of a security Bond or a letter of credit that's what I was curious yeah what form will be held in so and is it a self-funded one it's a third-party one it's they we have on an annual basis the council energy facility citing Council evaluates um the financial institutions that are credit worthy enough to be able to supply these bonds or letters of credit to these Facility Owners so we do that research on an annual basis so you know there's been some volatility in the banking Market recently and we had a request just the two Council meetings ago to add two institutions we did the evaluation and we recommended that the council had one institution but not the other because we didn't feel that they had the the near-term financial viability that was consistent with what we were interested in so we look at that to make sure that the financial institutions not self um bonded it's a sort of it's a financial institution that we evaluate annually to make sure that they actually legitimately will pay out the bond or letter of credit and so I guess yeah that was the extent of the the I guess I wanted to make sure that the security set aside was not backed by the corporation installing the panels as an example say we're going to give you eight percent of the uh business stock as security correct that's not acceptable for us and so it has to be backed by a out of security of some kind correct okay thank okay Bob Bronson all this body here that bring a little background I wasn't going to say anything because I might be one of the people on this I'm currently screwing on as chairman of the playmation I've been chairman for probably four years I serve at the pleasure that people County Accident Commissioners I also serve on the Harrisburg rural fire and rescue District as of our board meeting Thursday night of this week the only reason we knew about this is because I've been collecting notes on it nobody's going to hurt my interest that fast I would certainly know about can you lean into the mic a little bit okay is that better okay that's that uh because we have to be prepared for it and you know for what type of uh materials on hand and emergency response coordinating with that and so I'm certain that's and the purpose of this whole hearing is addressing subjects like that oh some Podium that notify them you know I",

        "text": " to correct me if i misstate something but um the puc rules require uh electric owned investor owned utilities to operate in compliance with wildfire protection plans and the requirements for those plans are outlined in the newly established ors 757 963 which was implemented through senate bill 762 the standard embedded in both the puc rules and that statute is that the wildfire protection plans must reflect a reasonable balancing of mitigation costs with resulting reduction in wildfire risk um and i kind of wanted to point this out uh because while we are mindful that the the council rule is not intended to uh cause unnecessary cost of compliance or administrator burdens on certificate holders um the council uh really doesn't have the same mandate to uh consider cost containment um or rate recovery as as the duc does so we are working under slightly different and may need to use a slightly different standard to evaluate compliance with a council rule or standard seeing some things moving around um so as we go into this the approach we've kind of recommended is or our initial approach that we're thinking of pursuing right now is to establish a new standard that requires facilities to develop a wildfire risk mitigation plan for the we would kind of like to hear from you all whether you all think that's an appropriate approach whether there are other approaches we should consider and whether or not you think that approach would be an effective way of mitigating wildfire risk um we also want to know if we do go forward with the planner approach what sort of these the appropriate standards or criteria would be to evaluate those plans and to evaluate compliance with the wildfire standard so um with that i will kind of open this up to discussion and look for any hands hands raised or if anybody has any questions or clarification okay well i am not uh any hands raised on this so hopefully we will get some more thoughts going as i go through a little bit more um okay and maybe we can move on to the discussion of applicability as folks are chewing on this a little bit um which is uh our second question is really related to the types of facilities so if we do go forward with this idea to require energy facilities to submit a wildfire risk plan as part of their application for site certificate we want to know whether or not that rule should apply to all energy facilities or or a subset of them the puc rules do apply just to electric utilities and there is specific rules as i mentioned for investor owned utilities and then a more general mandate for consumer-owned electric utilities and the puc does have other specific safety rules for other types of regulated utilities but those planning rules only apply to electric lines and also generating assets owned by those investor-owned utilities the council has has a little bit broader jurisdiction as i mentioned earlier and i just wanted to throw some examples out there of the things that the council does have jurisdiction over that includes high voltage transmission lines um most of those high voltage transmission lines would be operated owned and operated by the electric utilities um and then we would also be reviewing wind and solar power generation um natural gas power plants pipelines and storage facilities and then uh certain fuel pipelines and facilities and the council's jurisdiction is generally determined by uh the size of facilities so we would only be reviewing very large uh facilities that kind of reach a level of statewide concern but but it does cover a broad area and i just saw a question from lori um about whether or not oregon department of forestry is participating in this rule making unfortunately um nobody from odf was available to join the workshop today but we have been in contact with them and plan on working with them a little bit more closely on some of the risk analysis questions that we have as well so okay and so um does anybody have any uh thoughts or comments or perspectives on on whether or not the council should be looking just at um electric power generation facilities um or whether or not we should be looking more broadly at any energy facilities under the council's okay and lori i'm looking at your comment now saying that um the oregon environment forestry sometimes depends on high voltage transmission line corridors as fire breaks and i think that would be something that would be really good for us to be aware of and in consideration and consider during the citing process although i'm not sure if to this point that that's been something specifically that we've considered uh jim i see your hand is up so please please go ahead yes if if i may i just want to go back to the regulatory approach i'm a slide behind in my thinking but in looking at the question of is a facility specific wildfire protection an appropriate and effective way to wildfire risk i think about fire departments and how would they handle a chemical a production facility or a data center to my knowledge of some of the that i know they have plans pre-ordained for certain facilities knowing where the pipe stands knowing the evacuation routes electrical supply centers um so i would think looking at best practices at the state fire marshal's office might inform that question as to how to look at your different facilities and anticipate the types of incidents that may occur and thus work with the local departments for responses thanks jim and um look to sarah if she has anything to add i know some of our facilities do have emergency response plans and some of the more traditional energy facilities i think have you know they do have some requirements to maintain um a in an action plan if there is an incident at the facility that uh explains whether or not there's hazardous materials on site i know we've worked with some of the facilities that have a battery energy storage system to you know give some training to first responders on on what they would need to do if there was a fire at the energy system um at the battery system you know whether or not it's safe to be open what what sort of um fire suppression uh might it might be equipped with and what the best way to put out a fire would be um but that's not certainly something i think that's been very consistent across all types of so i think that's a good good comment thank you i don't have anything to add i just want to say that what you said was consistent what i was thinking thanks well um i i think i often tell this at google making workshops maybe too often but one of my professors taught me that the best way get people to talk or the best tool to get people to talk was awkward silences but that does not seem to be working for me too well today so we can go ahead and move on and see if there's more discussion as we go through some of these other topics oh well so one other question that we had on our applicability questions and um maybe i actually need to go through this i think i missed the slide uh would be whether there are specific factors like geography zoning or design that should be considered um and then um i think one thing we would like to hear feedback from and we can get this later if needed to is if we should be giving special consideration to facilities that are already subject to a uh wildfire protection plan um and so this would be you know whether or not we would be accepting those plans or giving some sort of exemption to um the the investor owned utility owned and operated transmission lines particularly that are already subject to the puc's and uh if anybody does have any thoughts on that now we certainly like to discuss it but as i'll mention at the end we're also happy to accept written comments if people have ideas uh david uh yeah i you know i think you hit the nail on the head i think it doesn't make sense to require mitigation planning if utilities already required to provide a comprehensive wildfire mitigation plan through the puc so i think we would advocate that there be deference or incorporation of those pre-existing plans and david i don't know if you can uh speak to this and it's okay if you can't but i am curious if the current wildfire protection plans really get down to a facility specific or if it's just more general practices that apply to the whole system uh yeah i mean i can only speak to the mitigation plans that are applicable to you know transmission and distribution um i imagine the um something beyond that isn't currently covered through the puc no i think they're designed to be a comprehensive plan that applies to a overall system you know you're not managing individual lines but you know hundreds or even thousands of miles of line so that that type of coverage you know requires a comprehensive planning and not something specific okay thank you oh well let me let me add that's not to say we don't do you know mitigation planning taking into account um you know risk at certain areas so i don't want to leave it at that that doesn't entirely ignore site-specific impacts thanks and you know i'll get into this in in a second but i do know you know the one of the criteria is that there's at least identifications of areas within the utility service area that are height subject to heightened levels of risk um so i do i think we know there is you know some geographic specificity there um but i think that's helpful clarification that you know these are really general practices that are subject to the whole whole system and helps us you know kind of refine our thinking about it as well um jim i see you have your hand up uh yeah thanks um on the first one um about newly proposed facilities in oregon or just electric power generation i think you know all facilities should be looked at but also i think the older facilities should also be looked at and included because as we look at the power fires in california they tended to be older lines not well maintained so i think to just do it for new stuff really misses the point of the risk that we are exposed to and our need to mitigate for that so really the old stuff should almost be first because the new stuff will probably be built to the best standards thanks jim yeah and i will say that we definitely um you know want to be careful about proposing anything that's retroactively applicable um but we will definitely take that into consideration and and look at it pretty carefully okay any any other comments on this set of questions before we move on to kind of getting into some of the more specific criteria okay um so this slide sort of outlines the criteria uh was in senate bill 762 for those uh system-wide electric utility plans um i don't think everything is on here and i do do want to note that um the puc rules implementing the",

use a chat feature and publicly send a chat message to everyone we are recording this session to later post on the oda website for your review we also want to encourage import input from all audience members during this meeting and seek a diverse stakeholder to hear various positions building codes divisions mark heiser and kelly thomas will lead off the discussion about rulemaking the rebuilding task force and efficiency standards will be discussed by blake shalide if blake is with us at that point in time so with that mark are you ready to discuss rulemaking the update yes thank you everyone ma mark heiser with building code's division state of oregon uh kelly thomas is also with here us today but i'm going to go over a quick update on some of the rule making that has been happening at the division and wanted to uh do a quick update on the residential energy code adoption rules and with that we're going to get some audience participation how many people the notification about the rule making um for the residential code there were they're going to be five different rules that are coming up let's see here june 22nd at 3 p.m for the energy rules um could people like raise your hand in in their little chat boxes see if people are aware of this see a couple here so if you had signed up on our website for being getting notices they are available if you would like to receive um have me email you a link or just uh forward the notice to you i'd be happy to do that um i can i believe at the end i think we can have some i think we have some of the email addresses at the end so if not we can in right you can either send to myself or roger and i can see about getting that forwarded to you so yes on let's see here june 22nd at 3 p.m we will be going over the rules what happens on that date is that additional comments will be taken by bcd staff about the code adoption that have been and gone through the the boards written comments will be received be allowed allowed to be received through june 25th so letting people know that they can you know even after the hearing there's additional time to put in comments those will be reviewed by the division and see whether we are going to move forward with um adoption of the rules so that's an update from building codes division so if you and we'll ask everybody your lower hands now unless you want to have a question because i don't don't have the ability to do the the so um so that's it for the rules from the building codes division side i think we can turn it over to blake and if you'd like to discuss about any of the rule making happening on the oto side of thanks thank you yeah blake is here so are you ready i am roger thanks you betcha yeah and i'll just give a quick update um we don't have a lot of efficiency standards uh rulemaking going on but the one that is in process now actually just finalized is our rulemaking for demand response capable water heaters and that rule making the standard was already set um through previous rulemaking and legislation but our current effort was to essentially delay and postpone the standard by one year from it would have gone into effect on july 1st of this year and we've postponed that to july 1st of 2023 to respond to supply chain and market constraint issues that that are still ongoing and this represents the second of the of the postponements that we're able to do as an agency administratively and we push it out for one year and that kind of maximizes our our ability to to postpone so i think our rulemaking coordinator actually filed those rules last night so those will go into effect here um by the first of next month and it will push like i said that effective date out one year so if there's any questions on that happy to answer it but that was a relatively straightforward rule making that we that we just completed the only other one that we oh what's that roger well i was just wanting to see if anybody had any questions about piece that you just discussed oh yeah thanks doesn't look like it um and then the only other standard efficiency standards activity that i'll mention that we haven't started yet but we will start maybe by the next time this group meets um will be to implement the standards for spray sprinkler bodies and the legislation that came out of the previous one this past legislative session um and that's just something that we'll have to do to to do our part of the administrative rule making to implement that standard and we'll probably start that sometime in the late looking forward to completion by the end of the year um oh and roger's got the slide up so we held the public hearing on our our water heater push back um last week on the 8th and received a few a few comments so thanks to those that participated and thanks to those that commented always helpful did you want to give the group a little update too on the rebuilding task force can you speak to that at all sure i can yeah it won't be much you know other than just encouraging folks to uh to tune in if you're if you're interested there's actually a meeting of that task force later today at three o'clock that's all up and available on the oregon legislative information system olis website where you can view that and view the tasks force activity view the past meetings monitor live the the current meetings and look at all the other associated work that's that's going on with that task force so um our agency is not on the task force none of the none of the agencies are but we are uh tasked with supporting and assisting the task force as as requested so we've made a presentation to them about efficiency standards i know the building codes division gave a presentation on kind of the code status and history in oregon um other agencies deq and i believe oha have also presented so our agencies are supporting that task force as as i know we have some members of that task force on the on the call today too so yeah thanks blake there may be some people uh on online right now that don't have any idea what the rebuilding task force is and um can you speak to that blake a little bit as far as whether it's about new construction or existing buildings that sort of thing what senate bill it came from that kind of thing uh sure yeah i'd be happy to so the this this rebuild it's it's called the the rebuild task force but it stands for resilient efficient building task force and it came out of a bill senate bill during the previous legislative session that originally started out as kind of a reach code bill but it ended up being modified and kind of changing into this this broader look at decarbonization and energy efficiency in the building sector and not just new um but for existing buildings too and the the task force is generally tasked with looking at opportunities and policy strategies for decarbonization in the building sector toward potential proposition of new new policies and new legislation for a future session and how the state can help use the building sector to meet its overall greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals any questions for blake about uh rebuilding task force that was a good description blake sorry to put you on the spot but that was yeah look at that matt tidwell says well thanks everybody i think we'll move along to the next update that's the oregon residential energy back to mark kaiser sorry i had to unmute to make sure we had this correct so on the oregon residential energy code we are beginning the adoption process shortly for the 2023 oregon residential specialty code so that's the whole book um sort of a um update using the latest international residential code for most of the building provisions and of course previous oregon um amendments that's going to be the starting point for most of the residential code looking at the timeline um we're looking somewhere around july 1st july 4th look for the expected announcement for the 45-day proposal period um that will be for you know the entire code book as part of that the division for chapter 11 the energy code that's why we're all here talking about this today we're going to have a baseline proposal the 2023 residential code of course we're under the division was under directive to meet uh zero energy ready home equivalency that's the 2017 version 0.6 we had done previous work with the does zerh program folks getting feedback from sam rashkin and others as to what really what that equivalency could look like we've got we will have a baseline here the proposed revisions to 2021 residential code and that will be the starting point for proposals to be put in during the 45 day proposal period again at least the zerh equivalency um is what we're looking to get to we will have inputs posted on the website that can be used with proposals of course we're going to look at what the energy savings are and also you know costs looking at that as well we're going to try and use the new rules as close or come as close as possible to using them uh although it will be 90 days before they're actually officially enforced but that's going to be at the baseline for proposals for this year we will then be sending of course uh we have university of oregon doing some site some additional analysis to make where the old code was what the target is for the new code so that everyone who is doing a proposal can sort of do an apples to apples sort of look at what proposals do come in so everyone can analyze and repeat other people's so the next steps of course would be to look are to look for the upcoming announcement uh that begins the proposal period again either friday the 1st or i believe it's the 5th i think it's tuesday would be the date to look for that starting baseline point we will try and have all of the um when that when the probe the announcement goes out we will have the information available such as the baseline written document as well as some of the baseline inputs that you would be using",

the training uh webinar today we're going to have a few other people uh giving you uh some tidbits along the way uh there are technical team and I'll let them introduce themselves as they come up throughout this program I do want to mention a couple of things before we get started uh one we are recording this uh and we will be recording all of the questions and then putting the questions and answers up online as well as the presentation later I also wanted to let you know that we have muted everybody but we will be accepting your written questions um throughout the presentation and I will try to take a oops there we go I will take a look at these periodically uh we all will and we will have some spaces where we will be answering questions um after parts of the presentation so please feel free to type those questions in and we'll take a look and answer them when we can and with that said let's move that over um let's begin our program so again thank you very much for coming uh today we have a number of uh important goals that we're going to try to meet the first thing is at least for our genius I'm going to go over the presentation goals we have another items we want to make sure that you get we're going to give a little bit of a background on how we got to this point we're going to discuss very briefly um the stakeholder process in regards to how we got to where we are and why we are where we are uh then we're going to go through some energy audit requirements we're going to walk through the templates and the processes we're also going to take a look at some of the requirements that are new we are going to look at the technical review process what we actually do when we get those draft documents from you all we're going to wrap it up with a few tidbits that we wanted to convey to you and we'll discuss future revisions how we intend to approach that and some questions along the way the main there we go the main goal of the presentation however is uh twofold for your from your perspective as the program auditor our goal is to provide you all with the information necessary to achieve success this by no means guarantees success that is of course on you but uh one of the things that was asked of us from you all uh several times was to provide you uh all the information you needed to do your job and that's one of the things we focused very uh intently on uh in this round the other item is for the school districts the goal of this presentation is to not only have you be successful but have you be successful in regards to what you provide to the school districts which of course is good information to allow them to make better more informed decisions about some of their Energy Efficiency and conservation opportunities um additionally we did want to make sure that you understood um the specifics in terms of what we changed and what the requirements are and our expectations are we also wanted to make sure we cleared up any questions or mixed conceptions uh the big goal of this training and of the new program is to allow you all to move as efficiently and effectively through this process as you can and we think we've set up a pretty good system to allow that so very quickly this process really began back last year in 2014 we held seven in-person meetings around the state and two additional online meetings we had uh almost 120 stakeholder comments that we addressed including 70 or and additionally 75 questions that we answered um in regard to the process the main goals and the feedback we received are the ones you see in front of you right now which is to say the the first and foremost was everyone wanted the program to be easier to use there were definitely some clunky aspects that we worked through but we definitely have achieved that uh there was a request to maintain or improve information accuracy and reliability again you all as Auditors and commissioning agents for that matter have done a fantastic job over the last couple years really gaining the trust of the schools in terms of the information they receive and the choices they have made and the effects of those choices the school districts made it very clear they do not want to jeopardize that data Integrity there was a request from all parties again to improve processes and increase efficiency our goal is the same as yours to get these documents in and out of our hands as quickly as possible um but not jeopardizing the quality of the data that we're conveying uh next item was the districts wanted more Pathways to graduate from the program and for those of you that don't know what that means what that means effectively is that these school districts have spent or obligated their entire 23-year estimated uh public purpose charge funding Supply they would then get reimbursements through the remainder of the program once school districts do this they are able to more freely work with entities such as the Energy Trust of Oregon uh in getting additional funds and resources lastly we wanted to make sure we incorporated all stakeholder input and I put that down there even though it's obvious to make sure you understand that this includes school districts and this includes contractors Auditors it is absolutely important to us that you working in the program have everything you need to do a good job and that you convey to us the parts that are working and the parts that could be improved and we'll move on actually I'll take a quick all right no questions excellent come on there we go all right so what has actually changed in the program well very very quickly um the big items that have changed were the guidelines we updated the guidelines we corrected errors and inconsistencies we tried to improve uh uh Clarity and ease of use we incorporated all program changes and we have uh additionally posted the guideline uh the guidelines online this is important because as we move forward one of the changes we've made to the program is to be a little more Nimble in how we address errors or Corrections in the guidelines of their documents all of the documents that are the most current up-to-date ones will always be available on odo's website and so you will always have access to the most current version uh I can appreciate saving older versions because you've populated certain Fields but it's always worth your time to check to make sure items uh haven't changed online and we will be announcing when we do make these changes the next big change that has really substantially changed the program is the tier system or more specifically the elimination of the tier system for measures uh at this point going forward all eligible measures in the program uh all approved eligible measures in the program will be reimbursed up to measure life and they may be implemented at any time there are a few districts that have made some commitments to cleaning up some old measures from years past and they will be expected to continue to move forward with those uh but in terms of what districts may or may not do going forward it is completely up to them we of course hope they pick the most energy or the cost effective measures that are there but we know that Energy Efficiency saving energy and even saving money are not the only reason schools and other entities take on these uh lastly there are no longer any required eems I know that's something we've had in the past all tier one measures needed to be implemented before you could move forward with tier two or tier three uh but again with the elimination of the tier system there is no more requirement uh the only requirement is if you will is that you implement approved projects all right well not many questions so this is pretty easy all right so energy Audits and the reports these are the issues that we uh were presented with from school districts and from Auditors and I'll go over them very briefly just to make sure you can understand again where we're coming from with the changes we made uh first one again Clarity on expectations we will you will see be very clear in terms of what we expect to see and what we don't expect to see again our goal is to make this as um achievable and successfully achievable as possible for you all and we understand we need to be clear to make that happen uh energy audit approval process time this is a huge part of this change in the program changes we have set up a number of changes when all implemented and all followed we are very confident we'll not only improve the approval process time but it will greatly improve the approval process time this is a benefit to everyone uh doing what is expected up front and getting Corrections done as quickly as possible saves you all time and money gets the answers back to the district sooner and to be honest allows us to do other things as well so that's a big focus of these of these changes uh next as I mentioned before energy audit accuracy accuracy we want to remain exactly the same there'll be a little discussion later on about the difference between accuracy and precision but in terms of the information in the audits we want it to remain as accurate and in some cases even more accurate in than in the past thank you um energy audit costs uh this is something we'll address a little later but we are trying to bring into line the cost of the audits with other generally accepted Norms in the US right now Clarity on how long Auto reports are valid another big issue um the answer here quite frankly is that are going to be valid as long as they are valid and for a school district that is not very helpful but for a qualified auditor that is all the information you need that is to say you will have backup documentation and reports you will take a look at existing conditions and if you feel that a measure needs to be updated or audit report needs to be updated that's a good reason if you don't that's another good reason we'll we'll ask for justification but generally speaking that's what we're going to be looking uh Clarity on how often a building needs to be your audited again that's something we've addressed and we'll talk about a little more with targeted audits but effectively it is that all buildings need to be audited at the whole building level at least once after that there are a number of options which we'll discuss later uh targeted audits which were a huge success in the cool schools pilot program have been incorporated",

        "text": "uh hi and welcome to this video series uh with the community renewable energy grant program uh my name is Jason canaus I'm a program analyst in what we call the c-rep program and hello my name is Clay Deckard I'm also a program analyst with the crap thank you uh clay and I put together this series uh this is to uh cover the uh key application sections and questions we're not going to be going through every single one just the uh kind of the key questions on the application for both planning and Construction Grants in in the video series for each and this is uh more focused on what you'll find under the competitive review scoring criteria in your particular opportunity announcement but first what we want to do is just kind of do a brief overview of the C rep program and we'll go ahead and just jump right in uh house bill 2021 established the sea rep program and its intent was to offset costs of planning a developing Community renewable energy projects to support projects and traditionally underserved communities throughout the state as well as to promote small-scale Community renewable energy projects and provide direct benefits to communities across Oregon by improving energy resilience creating local jobs promoting Economic Development and reducing local energy costs and next I'm going to let clay talk about the program's budget okay the legislature gave us two main budget priorities in the crap program at least half of the funding must go to projects that have a Reliance aspect under the program definition and rules and we'll cover this in details later in the presentation and the second priority is that at least half the funding must go to projects that primarily serve members of environmental justice communities and we'll get into those details as well as we go through the presentation all right thank you clay and uh you'll see this particular graphic published on our website uh this is a breakdown of our particular programs uh and the maximum Grant award for those programs as well as the maximum uh eligible cost percentage for the reimbursement of a particular program I just wanted to pay one particular note uh to a construction project that is a renewable energy only that is still the maximum Grant award could be up to a million dollars for that project but only 50 percent of those eligible costs up to the one million dollars and additionally a couple of really important program notes and that's that grants will be awarded on a competitive basis and will include performance agreements and time limits for both starting a project and completing a project and that that's within both the planning grants and within the Construction Grants uh and then that competitive review basis we will get into more details uh in this in the next video about the importance of that competitive review process as it relates to you and your application uh another item that we really want to point out at the front end here is that grant funding if awarded grant funding is paid to the grantee or the applicant and may include up to 30 percent Advance with the rest reimbursed to grantee after the project is complete and the final report has been approved on construction projects that would also include a site inspection the grant May cover eligible costs incurred by the applicant as shown via paid invoices as part of the final report and Department of Energy payments are made to grantees only so grantees should follow their own procurement and finance policies when working with any partners and next up I'm going to go back over to Clay he's going to talk about some of our program definitions that are that are very important to pay attention to okay I've got a sample uh definition up our main definition of a community renewable energy project and this is right out of the house bill 2021. I put this one up I'm not going to read it I'm just going to point it out as all of our projects need to fit into this definition and this also includes those projects that have a resilience component and then we have more detailed definitions for the resilience components which we'll get into next a little bit um so here we have what community energy resilience is in general and then what a community energy resilience project is the summary of that is the systems must provide Power and a grid outage and the system must support critical public services to the community it must support facilities essential to the public welfare and so as you can see crap has very specific definitions and I want to take this as a reminder that you go through and you read the Oregon administrative rules for this project the links are on our website you can go back even and read the whole um section there's only like three sections in the bill that covers the crap program read those and you'll see how all of them are related and condensed into the opportunity announcements and so knowing the definitions is key to having an eligible and competitive application so that you aren't speaking to some generic industry um definition but you've actually dialed in to these program definitions excellent thank you clay and and you'll find during the course of these video presentations on either either planning or construction projects that clay and I will continually remind people to go back and read the bill go back and read the rules read your opportunity announcements that's going to along with and maybe even before finishing up this video series it's going to create a more successful application um I just want to jump in and this is also in the bill as is that the eligible renewable energy projects for crap are solar geothermal hydroelectric wind biomass landfill gas biogas wave and tidal energy systems as well as ocean thermal energy technology systems as well as electric vehicle charging or EV charging as long as that is paired with a new renewable energy system or an existing Renewable Energy System and as we move into our eligible resilience component in tandem with a renewable energy system those would be energy storage such as most predominantly batteries or battery backup storage and uh micro good micro grid Technologies and I'm going to go ahead and bounce back to Clay and he's going to talk about one of our Key Program priorities and benefits okay so we covered the resilience which is that 50 budget priority to those projects that have the resilience component the other 50 budget priority relates to qualifying communities which is one of our definitions but all that definition does is point to the definition for environmental justice communities in House Bill 2021 and that's it in its entirety it basically just lists these types of environmental justice communities the c-rep rules do not have specific definitions for these individual types of environmental justice communities including you know rural communities communities experiencing lower incomes for example Odo understands the definitions vary across government entities and so applicants might decide which debt our applicants may decide sorry which definitions to use and you must detail and demonstrate how your projects are in an environmental justice community and separately how and to what extent your project serves the members of environmental justice communities and we'll be looking for you to explain which definition you used and any other details about the quantities of you know the size of the community that you're helping or the dollar amount of your program that is dedicated to those communities the more detail the better the application we also have all of this stuff is competitively reviewed and and on a scale so you can get partial points you can get full points you can get no points for these different criteria and so a great place again to start is the review criteria that are in the opportunity announcements um we also have additional resources on our website that gets to more around the different government um websites that Define these environmental communities in different ways depending on the agency that's defining them all right now we're going to get into who is an eligible applicant right so very specific for this program it's it's it's organ federally recognized Oregon tribes there are nine of them in Oregon consumer owned utilities and then a whole list of public bodies as defined by Oregon revised Statute 174.109 but this includes cities counties local service districts sometimes called Special Districts public school districts community colleges public utilities and others there's something like 43 listed in in that organ revised Statute so take a look the links are in our documentation all right great thank you clay um and as we're getting close to wrapping up this first video uh just going to do a real quick rundown of our application process and and that that begins after you go through that and fill your application out of submitting that application uh and then um that your application will go through what's called a completion and eligibility review from internal Department of energy staff uh people like clay and myself will be looking these over uh determining the eligibility those projects those applications that are determined eligible move into what we are alluding to the competitive review process uh and uh and as you would see in your opportunity announcement scoring criteria that review process will go directly through that criteria those criteria over project strength and feasibility program priorities and project benefits or Community benefits uh and as well as the equity considerations that we're talking about as well as just the general project diversity both the type of project the location of the project in the state and so that's kind of a brief rundown I'm not sure clay do you have anything you want to add to that yeah just one thing to wrap it up um first of all that first part application submission this current um the deadline is February 15th at 5 pm um and each round stands on its own so um we we compete and because the the rules allow the program to make adjustments and changes between each round and so always read the opportunity announcements read the rules in the application read our user guide um because there are differences from round two than there were in round one pretend like it's a brand new application in effect if you're coming from round one um we also recommend that before you start an online application and even before you watch the rest of these videos it gets into more details on the application questions and scoring criteria is that you first thoroughly review the opportunity announcements that fit your project and the application user guide that's posted on our website and that you take that information in you spend some time um you know either creating your project or if your project is already set writing your application a little bit and Gathering your information before you even bother starting the online application then watch these videos because we give some really good clarifying information where you see overlap between sections and the application and the question are are our follow-on videos will help you decipher some of that then when you're done with all that and you you feel like you've got all your information gathered maybe you've even started writing some answers based on the user",

        "text": " hear the noise that it makes so um council member chuck dude i think that that question would probably be best asked of mr destner since he was the one who submitted the photo you're welcome to have him come back up and answer the question if you'd like okay to have the meeting move along which is in between file post 197.9 and 199.1 is that the visual impact is that why that distance was selected in the condition for the record kellen tardy weather um yes let me let me find this condition can you point me to line 13 of condition number four am i in the wrong place i don't i think it's condition two one minute yes um in short that would have been in the areas where there are a limitation on the mile posts for certain height restrictions or tower types it's because that's what is estimated to be the visual right and you said it's three scenic resources three oh wait yeah scenic 3. i don't really reference scenic resources condition 4 that applies to a different resource scenic resources condition three is that that applies to nahotic the same question applies it references and that's my error i referenced in when i was discussing it both three and four so thanks for that clarification sarah distances are different in three than they are in four yeah okay it's the same principle i'm sorry to enter interject um counsel um what just indicated uh that he actually would like his recording to play he was providing the um the visual the picture was a supplement to go with his recording that he submitted so i'm thank you for for saying that and i apologize that wasn't clear i haven't made any decisions right the computer i am petitioner whit dechner dear council members thank you for the three minute boundary to boil down why the alj has aired in ignoring this issue allowing idaho power to proceed in ruining no text view shed any power lines seen from the interpretive center will have a significant impact on the visitor and get gathering from a buffet of impact studies idaho power concludes that their project's scenic impact will be less insignificant ips themselves conducted this study no independent entity or no organs or visitors opinions were sought ip's own attorney conducted the visual impact assessment and made the conclusion of less than significant ip further backs their argument by proposing that they have special finishes that virtually hide the pylons and conductors and we need not to worry alj aired in taking this at face value knowing the metal finish of conductors and towers does not make the towers less especially when one of the towers is only 125 feet from panorama point the best vista at the interpretive center mrs cling ip's expert witness makes of the accusation that photos i submitted were not representative of their project and yet the photos submitted by ip were impossible to locate exactly where the towers would go no tech was a community project built for the people and by the people who appreciate the pioneer history of our historic oregon trail and region and by people proud of the new tourism economy that has developed since the decline of our natural resources economy they deserve better than to be steamrolled by a private for-profit corporation who does not even reside the people also deserve to be protected by a regulating government body one that is looking out for the people not sympathetic to outside interests these towers will be seen from and about the interpretive center no matter what this is more than a significant visual i urge the council to urge the council to consider these significant significant human impacts and to deny the site certificate or remand the issue thank you afternoon members there were just a few points there that i wanted to respond to um regarding mr dechner's point that idaho power did not ask for any um subjective input i would note that there's no requirement in the council standards that idaho power asked for that input and in making certain assumptions regarding the potential impact associated with the project idaho power had conservatively assumed that um folks would value the resource and um had thus assumed that there there would be that if asked that that folks would have would indicate that they have concern for the resource um mr deshner also commented that idaho power's attorney conducted the analysis while there were attorneys that were involved through the application process idaho power used an expert witness uh louise kling who is um has many years of visual impact analysis and is an expert in her field to perform the analysis and did so with um consultation with the oregon department of energy um as well and finally to the comment that the the photo that mr dustner had shared is not i believe the point that idaho power's witness was making was that in performing a visual impact there are certain parameters that are used to be able to to apply that analysis which involves an observation point um determining the the perspective of the viewer i i think the critique was that the um the image that mr deshner had shared didn't have those same features there there wasn't any perspective as to where the photo is or what's being represented or where it would be within the nahotic um and so that is my brief response thank you any questions from council cindy for the record i'm not sure who to address this to but i i think it might be the department so um the applicant has certainly made it clear that um they will minimize impacts and mitigate um impacts once built um if the if the impact is more significant i mean is found to be more then it's a hundred years of or in perpetuity um uh that the impact exists is there any look back you know if the result is something more than what was promised expected what's the consequence of that or is there a consequence does that just become the definition of yeah um that question is a little difficult to answer obviously but there were multiple visual simulations provided for what the proposed facility would look like at different viewpoints at nahotec and so that should be the impact assessment and so i if if you're asking if it is more impactful from the perspective of the viewer is their reach back in mitigation i mean i guess then where we pivot over if you recall on the hca issues that the um the enhanced what was it called the the formal the second phase of the analysis that includes the visual is continuing um and we'll go through pre-construction where then all these entities are going to be assessing the significance of the the you know the impact and then what the mitigation would be so and again visual impacts under the definition of significance for cultural it's not a direct one-to-one so you have to account for the benefits of the mitigation that would come out of it whether it's recordation of fully evaluating the resource an interpretive sign of interpretive display at a cultural center there's a myriad of things that they would do but that would be then what is so the question is whether that mitigation is adequate but that's coming out of the hpmp and so no we don't currently have anything that says well what is the long you have to do a long term evaluation almost like a thank you it just seems to me like we're relying on certainly hope for results and once it's built it's built and so then does the mitigation become you know interpretive materials brochures i mean that certainly don't the properties that are seen on the they may do something else but they don't mitigate that and hence my question some things question again not sure who to direct this to about the finish on the structures in some cases i've had developers say the typical silver gray is less visible in certain skies than i guess it's the weathered steel and how that issue was weighed in terms of visibility because in this part of the world where we have very big skies how those towers project against a gray today's sky would it will they'll be different seasonal visual impacts and making sure that the finished deals with that and then if there's somewhere in the materials that gives me a nice analysis of the different kinds of because i think i know what an h frame looks like but i'm not sure versus a lattice or what all the options are for towers knowing that there are electrical standards for what kind of towers are needed to support the voltage coming in very late to this process getting a sense of the visual impacts and we can do this offline but i think it's just important to think thank you so on that note i can give you we touched on it in july a little bit but an exhibit b a description of the different types of and it would have a description of the i have some and that's kind of in that picture i pulled up in my presentation it was just to to demonstrate with different type of topography or or view depending on what the color and the skyline looks like in your background towers can be very visible or very and the applicant does represent different types of towers and different to minimize or to reduce visual impacts in different now the question specifically is that you know were those proposed because they are very specific to the topography the skyline etc to minimize at those specific areas i don't i don't know if that information was in there um and and i think that that would be a really good yeah the question to ask the people that really know about transmission towers and finishes um i have that you could ask um now uh but then i also have some of these visual simulations here of these up up here so these are some h frames this is the existing landscape um and these are these are in uh exhibit r for scenic resources so this is out in front of nahotek and as sarah mentioned i we also have chris um on the line and he's been helping um through the contested case and he's been working on the the scenic resources and protected area sections um and that i do believe that there are were additional vis visual simulations submitted or evaluations or impact assessments um submitted through the contested case in the nahotic area so um and the question comes up only because we're so specific in these conditions correct that i want to make sure that they're the proper conditions and that the design really does fully take into effect visual impacts not that there are no visual impacts the visual impacts aren't significant and here's what's been done to mitigate is it the right condition for mitigation thank you we've had the presentation um from staff and then as well they heard contested case positions and responses scenic resource 3. are we ready to have a straw poll or",

professional regulators to ensure compliance with their existing laws however we should never put up roadblocks to other hundreds of middle class jobs and financial support that this kind of energy will bring to this project will provide important short and long term boost to our regional economic economy the proposals will create jobs in transportation and trades in both the blue collar and the white collar workers just as important the projects like this strengthen our tax bases for our local economies and that have been hit so hard by this recent pandemic and thank everybody for coming through this we are seeing signs of life in our urban areas but our rural areas the impact clearly still lingers the projects and jobs create new revenues for our schools and other vital there was a time quite a long time ago years ago that we lacked our knowledge the technology the tough environmental laws and procedures to achieve both a strong economy and a clean safe environment i'd like to think that those days are behind us thanks to technology the tough environmental laws are best practices from business and workers including the public oversight that we see here today we can achieve both a clean environment and a growing economy i know our organization is committed to both these principles in the end we do have a choice we can scrutinize and support this project or we can put up low roadblocks and watch the jobs and the community benefits walk i urge you to apply due diligence to the us oversight and to see the compliance of the principles offered then embrace the opportunities that they create for our fellow or oregonians stutter stop stutter uh please move the nolan hills wind power project forward i want to again thank you for your con for listening to my testimony your considerations to this project and of course your service to the state of oregon thank you so much free time i would entertain one question as many as you have actually see none i'll just walk away quietly thank you all do we need um any spellings or addresses or i think it's on the forum okay perfect thank you all right so then i think we're ready for our next um participant so our next speaker is jonte clardy hello my name is uh jonte clardy uh spelled j-o-n-t-a-e uh c-l-a-r-d-y i am a labor uh from 737 um i worked um half my career in the union i'm proud to say that i've uh built uh many progressive uh energy efficient projects and i'm here today to voice my support for the nolan hill uh wind project all the renewable projects that uh can build these uh great states and service the oregonians through family wage jobs health benefits and which uh also helps the local economy supports infrastructure educational needs in our training program and other further uh humanity humanitarian uh work uh so please affirm this project and again thank you for your time and uh again my name is jonte clardy uh local 737 great thank you mr clardy all right who do we have next mr scott west and we do have his address thank you evening presiding officer and council members my name is scott west and i am here uh representing quell run ramus ranches and echo owners sam ramos who was in the room and my uncle and my margaret jean west and so we want to make some uh comments uh we um i've provided the comments to you already uh this is a follow-up to a letter that we submitted on i think april 22nd which was a few days after the original letter came out and generally our response that we were not opposed but we had some questions about communication and we also had some questions that we believed as the site map showed of that bpa corridor that comes across our property that um there were some sighting questions around uh just on the easement and also some exciting questions perhaps around the potential substation so we wanted to make sure that those um questions were addressed i'm happy to report since the period of time and why i'm here this is that since that period of time we had the opportunity to meet with kimberly from capital power and also mat and i think that uh getting on site and going across those across the ground and looking at that really i think was very very helpful for and also i think very helpful for i will say that on our behalf matt can speak for himself um but i just wanted to let you know that that we uh we thought the meetings were beneficial were very we've been on that ground since 1906 so long time residents in the community and equally interested in not only what happens you know certainly with our property but but the broader economic and social and all the rest of it with regard to not just on our property but within the whole within the region but also in the state of oregon so um with that i will conclude my comments um my address and and the contact information is on this letter and i know my uncle's uh information is on the letter that was provided before so uh once again thanks for the opportunity to uh to be before you this evening and uh happy to answer any questions if anybody has any thank you mr west i don't have any questions any questions from council that is sweet thank you all right thank you the last comment card i have is mr art i do have your street address but you didn't mention which town you're from hi um my name is art pryor i'm from echo oregon from eagle ranch my last name is spelled prior i am here in support of the project but i do have a mild concern that the um the description of the path to get hooked up to the grid needs to be defined and cemented or monumented that that we don't deviate from that very much simply because our farm is in that corridor and if a simpler or a cheaper way to get to the grid would facilitate going through our farm it would probably cause me some economic if power lines would go through our to our irrigated farm and that that's the only concern that i have uh generally we're very supportive of the project and um would like to see it go through and um any questions no questions from me anything from i'm not able to hear okay kate we're trying there we go now we're cooking perfect thank you okay better turn it off there we go we won't get a repeat mr pryor irrigated cropland on your property is it all irrigated or just give me an idea if the transmission line conform to the existing proposed route all the information that i have and that we have indicates that it's going to go down to the existing right-of-ways that umatill electric has and i and i guess that's what i would like to see and not deviate from that plan because it would be very advantageous to cut through irrigated yes and answer your question yes it would be very advantageous to cut through irrigated real estate to shorten the route which would cause me economic loss okay thank you that's what i needed to understand yeah i'm sorry thanks okay any other questions all right thank you mr pryor so i just wanted to check to make sure there were no additional commenters in the room and then if none does not appear that there are i'm gonna turn it over to you i think we need to figure out who on we have something else going on okay we need to figure out who on webex is going to testify or provide comments um miss kathleen how do you recommend they do that that they raise their hand on webex if they want to comment yes there's a webex feature that is the raise your hand if you want to comment and the way you get to it is open that participant box and then you'll see how you can raise your hand do you have one person with their hand you do okay i can't see them i can't okay so i'm going to turn it over to nancy because nancy can see who's raising their hand i can't thank you kate i do have dick dixie eclaivera with her hand up so i'm going to go ahead and open your mic if you wanted to go ahead and make a comment or have a question are you able to hear me yes we can hear you so my name is dixie chavarria i'm with and the last name is spelt just as it's stated on the screen e is in edward c is in cat h is in henry e is in edward v is in victor e is an edward r-r-i-a i'm an owner in elh llc a property that it looks like the transmission line is wanting to go across we are a small irrigated agricultural farm but we also overlay with a dense agricultural commercially permitted permit through oregon department of ag and we would just ask that if they could utilize the transmission or utilize the public right-of-way for the transmission line there's already one from another wind that utilizes highway 207 if they aren't able to use that then we would just ask um due to the other uh utilization on our farm that they go to um adjoining properties either to so one would be to the south of ours which would be sim plot farms which i think cunningham i'm not sure about one of the shareholders of um the owners of cunningham sheep has a relationship with and then i think the farm to the let's see to the east of us is they also have a renewable wind energy already permitted on that farm as well it would just uh a transmission line of um you know once one goes through if there was more needed it would really um the current and long-term use that is currently permitted um on our farm and then also one other thing i was going to ask was that if um it is cited that i think that they had mentioned that they were going to use the current polls that were there there are single polls but we would just ask if they continue to maintain a monopole structure for a 230 kb line transmission and then i have real reservations about the the use of the uec easements ubc is a very old in our area and oftentimes those easements are blanket easements they're often very wide and broad sweeping um easements and this would be i",

        "text": " building associated with that project so helping actually asking community to say does this feel authentic to your experience of this this opportunity and what has this relationship looked like historically is a really good gut check that can get through fancy application language and also force entities that apply to just evaluate and understand their i think that's a powerful thing not just for this grant program but in general within kind of a broader umbrella of community as a town or a county or tribal land really understanding what the relationship is between that body that has decision making power and the people that it supposedly represents really well put yeah that that idea of accountability ensuring that these groups are really involved in these early stages of planning and development and not just the subjects of a project but the actual drivers of a project i think it's really what's what this is getting at you know i think that um when you think about the type of material that you would include in an application that would demonstrate that you know it may be that reaching out to communities to verify um and kind of that interview level is something that we find would be necessary um so yeah those are all really nice ideas and see a fair number of hands coming up i believe that mark was the first one um to have his hand up and maybe we i don't know if anyone else has seen when these hands came up in order but i believe mark was next okay um try to be quick and i'm coming back to your question more about how do you accomplish the the determining how do you evaluate the actual participation by different groups within a project that are actually deploying the project so you know i i mean this may be over simplifying it but i would just think part of the proposal be they have to you know write something about this group is doing 10 of the work either by the hours or the money uh or both and they will be doing these specific things this group is going to do 50 of the work and they'll do these things and then um it just becomes part of the evaluation process for the reviewers to decide well you know this one's got just too little participation versus another one yeah i think yeah i mean we're in a challenging one here and you know this is another one where getting through a few rounds of of opportunity announcements and will will give us a learning opportunity but hopefully we can put something together in the in the early rounds to get us you know get us through that um the first opening of the program so that it's functional and gives our reviewers the tools they need to to really kind of determine which project should be moving forward so i think that brandy maybe was next in line and then fill i was going to suggest that maybe part of the rollout had some educational seminars or workshops because even though most of us think about energy every day a lot of community leaders won't so they might have a good handle on what their community needs and if we can align you know if you're if you're trying to achieve these goals maybe there's certain goals we're able to review um here's some energy projects and here's existing tools that might help you to achieve those goals um so again energy can be a little bit scary but if give them the tools or point them to existing tools where they can put together some projects on their own and they really lead that engagement right they already have community support they know what maybe where the need is they're just missing that energy and the technical some educational webinars or outreach might be beneficial even before the application process gets announced or rolled out that's a really good point and and really in the in the phase of the program when we've got our rules put together and you know this is going to be in january through march of next making sure that we're doing really good education and outreach to communities trying to reach as many as we possibly not only to let them know that the program exists but also to help them the types of projects and partnerships and you know metrics that make projects successful in the program that's a really good point so thanks for that we will certainly be looking to this committee to help us with that outreach both for ideas and actually for just getting the word out so i'm just thinking about that practicalities of who the eligible applicants are for uh for this pro these programs and you know how those eligible applicants interact with um the the communities that we're we we care about or that we're concerned about i mean um writing grant applications is a is a um a long arduous process sometimes and and it requires a certain amount of capacity i do feel like you know you having worked with a number of um you know local uh you know community level public agencies that you know oftentimes there are times oftentimes it's a struggle for those entities to to pull something together in the first place um but b also that there are you know some of the communities where we care about they may want the project to happen but they may not necessarily want to be involved in developing the grant application i mean because it's it's a you know the fun part or the exciting part is you know putting out a vision and understanding that it's possible and the the unfun part is uh writing the grant application and then administering the implementation of it um so you know i guess this is circling me back to the idea that um you know a couple of people put out about you know going to the you know going to the places going to these communities and doing interviews or you know having an interview component of these application processes you know if you have an interview component of an application process and an applicant shows up and they don't have uh the people who represent environmental justice communities is part of their team um it becomes it's very obvious that they're you know that they're um you know they're astroturfing or something like that just in terms of the practicalities of like who the applicants are and you know how they interact with the communities that we care about i i i wouldn't want us to try to application questions that make compliance or you know meeting this uh more cumbersome and and you know difficult to do than they need to be um and i think the interview is really a way to kind of you know like i know when i see it and that idea of that kind of addressing that limited capacity and the um the the burden that is grant applications i mean we can address that a little bit by our process as light and administrative burden as we can but it's still an administrative burden for someone to go through and do this so that capacity within communities is something that we have in mind so yeah and i hear that another vote for um having a sort of verification or interview built into the rules around some of these criteria or some of these could be helpful so i think that's presumably something that we could include in rules that says that we have the ability to reach out to communities for interviews and so shannon i believe was next in line i think this is uh i'm thinking about this from timeline that's associated with this as i recall we have four years to stand up the program and um and it so i'll pause there is that correct do we still have a four-year correct timeline for spending events through 2025. so i'm um i and i also had um before i go into my comment a question i i thought i heard earlier that you mentioned some additional odo staff will be coming on have funds been secured that will dedicate staffs specifically to support this program and if so how early would they be coming on the answer to the first is yes we do have positions that are approved and we are in the process of recruiting many of those positions as we speak some of the positions are more important to get in earlier than others some of them will be involved in the processing of applications and we will need them later on from those who are say building um you know the it platforms and the web platforms for processing and management positions that sort of thing we actually have a position posted right now to manage this program so if anyone wants an easy way out of this advisory committee and wants to apply for that position please do although you'll still be part of the advisory committee just on the other end but yeah so we do have positions um i think we have seven or eight of them and i where that was leading is i was thinking um and i think it's a great idea that a webinar is an outreach prior to the opening of the program but i'm wondering if we can help we the royal we odo staff with with our advisement potentially in developing a that could be you know could be dispersed through all kinds of partner organizations and agencies but that makes it really easy for folks in situ sitting at home you know multitasking trying to keep bread on the table those very folks that we're hoping to get the benefits too that don't necessarily think about energy or want to make time to go to a special interview that um you know just some kind of a hierarchy survey whether do you have problems meeting your energy needs are you concerned about power outages what do you consider to be your critical facilities you know maybe there are some just some that we could get out and and that would the smaller communities that don't have the staff or don't have that grassroots organization already thinking about that to start to draw some of that interest out that might help down the road to frame up what a project looks like and also to potentially identify some some future leaders from those that aren't right now engaged in this conversation if odo staff might be in a position to to help deliver something like that it's a really great idea and it could really potentially make our outreach efforts a lot more successful and targeted if we have kind of that survey um the benefit of of hearing these voices coming directly from the communities so i think it's a great idea and we ought to think about that as we the sort of outreach and community support aspects of the program um that's all thank you thank you shannon um i see several hands up here and we've also had a member of the public raise their hand i don't know if we have any hands that have been up for a while if there's any committee members that have had their hand up for a while and want to just jump in now i don't want to neglect you and i think we will bring in a a public question now because we've got one from one of",

our next meeting after the the legislature um ends for the session the session um but today I wanted to just highlight and provide some information on context for how we see the rest of the some of the legislation that we're paying close attention to but we'll do a deeper dive at our next meeting on what the overall results were and then we'll talk hear a presentation from Colin McConaughey and Janine director Benner on the climate pollution reduction that the state developed to submit to EPA to secure funding which is also going to be very helpful in taking next steps on kind of deepening and advancing a lot of the elements in the roadmap we have done brief presentations on the natural and working lands work that's been happening kind of a little bit separately but under the auspices of the commission and we'll be hearing from uh Lisa Deborah care Lisa Gaines who's the director of INR uh will is also with us uh or will be with us for the topic what I wanted to have them do is kind of give a quick reminder of the process but Identify some of the issues that are coming up uh as uh INR is has been working on this and as the advisory committee has engaged in the topic then uh the final I'm going to uh agenda item for the commission is really the major agenda item for the commission is the um starting to think about our work plan for the next biennium you know some some length of time that we end up being able to scope out but hopefully for a good block of our work over the next 12 months to uh to 18 months perhaps um and uh what we want to do today is just kind of tee up and get feedback from the commission um on uh how we should be the key elements of how to how to frame uh our work plan going forward and hopefully be able to take that longer term view uh and schedule things out for ourselves so we kind of know what's coming and can start to work with other agencies to line up presentations that we might want to have as part of that and then we'll close with public comments and as I said earlier that'll happen around 12 30 and we'll um we'll keep track of how we're doing against that timeline and make sure to let folks know that when they need to let us know that they want to provide so with that I'll go ahead and turn it over to Christy split with the Oregon Department of energy to give us the legislative update great thank you um it's really nice to be here today and I'm always grateful to have a chance to present to the commission it's not every time that I'm coming in where I have a lot of information that's kind of um it's kind of unknown there's a lot happening sort of behind the scenes right now and I can tell you sort of what I know about where we are um and go over a couple of bills that we at this point anticipate likely passing and moving depending on what happens with the various other Dynamics bigger picture of the session so I kind of want to start off by giving this disclaimer that because it is a public meeting and it is kind of strange to be like here's some things I think are gonna happen um but I also feel like that's just sort of where we are right now so I'm gonna just give like just the facts here where we here's where we are with session and tell a little bit about what I expect to happen next and we'll dive into those so um the first thing that most likely most civically engaged folks like the folks on this call are aware of is that we're about like two weeks in to what's called a walkout which has become a fairly common occurrence the Oregon um 2019 2020 2020 at 2021 2023 now um so these are not quite every time but but most times now it seems like this is something that comes up during the session in this case in the Senate it's a walkout of uh 10 um Senate Republicans who have prevented there from being Quorum which is the requirement of a certain number of folks at a meeting in order to for the meeting to hold a whole place so um so uh so just know that that walkout is happening and there was a ballot measure that passed that folks thought might stop the walkouts from happening that makes it so you can't run for office again after you have 10 unexcused absences and the 10 have all decided to cross that line um and will not be able to run for office again borrowing the results of a lawsuit that most conventional wisdom seems to think is likely to fall in favor of the ballot measure that passed because the battle majority had to be legally tested to appear on the ballot um so we'll see what happens with that but what it means right now is that this session has kind of developed the moniker of a zombie session so as of last Thursday there's really no expectation that the Senate will be able to function and have a quorum in order to hold floor sessions and move bills through the Senate kind of final approval process that means Senate bills get stuck in the Senate can't go to the house for approval and house bills can make it pretty far through the legislative process and then just kind of get stuck on the Senate door and so the decision has been made to continue to hold committees as usual many of the 10 Republicans that haven't been coming to floor session have been coming to committee meetings um and so the committee process has been pretty unfazed and bills are continuing to just sort of move through the zombie session thing here kind of move through even though nobody has an expectation at this point that any bills that haven't already passed through the Senate have a chance of passing so there's there's some Senate bills that have already had senate floor votes those can make it through committee on the house side or joint committee and proceed to the house floor and pass so I haven't done that analysis of what bills have already kind of gone that route and can pass into law but there's definitely you know it won't be the three bills of the 2020 session there will be quite a few bills that will will pass completely through the process regardless of the Senate situation so that's kind of the context on how the walkout is affecting the flow and what the session sort of feels like as far as things Crossing say the Finish Line what it doesn't really talk about is that zombie process that's ongoing the Committees that are still alive and um and what's happening with those and so the other big piece of news that's also very new and again just like the walkout like kind of hard to talk about we don't know exactly what's going to happen it's a lot of conjecture um the ways and means process that's where our budgets get set in the state of Oregon and also where sort of bills with a budget impact pass through the process there's a committee that checks price tags and then passes things through and um on Wednesday was the May revenue forecast and every year there's periodic Revenue forecasts to inform legislators of how the economy is faring generally and what impact that will have on the state budget the May revenue forecast is special because it's actually the combination of a forecast but also it's based on some very real very up-to-date information which is the information from people's state tax returns in April and so using that information they're able to say okay well here's how much money we think you'll have to spend in the next biennium based on tax tax revenue but because of the use of that April 15th I guess it was April 17th this year maybe information from tax uh from people's tax filings it's like a pretty certain number and so that's the number that the legislature uses to set the budget for the next two years and for those who probably many of you probably already saw the news or know the news but essentially the um there was a very unexpected increase in the revenue coming into State coffers this tax year which that informs that number of how much money legislators sort of have to spend on state agency budgets and bills that will have a price impact and it was actually in the magnitude of billions it's an additional 1.8 billion dollars above what the expectation was for the co-chairs budget which is sort of the legislature's first drafted a state budget and um and the governor's recommended budget was a little higher than the co-chair's budget but in the end there's quite a bit of extra Revenue to spend so everyone was expecting perhaps a Cuts budget environment or a very austere set of new programs and so that got just turned on its head with this kind of pretty earth-shattering news for the legislature on Wednesday no matter if the Senate never comes back and the session ends with nothing else happening that isn't already happening as I've described that many will still be there and there will still be almost certainly some sort of special session in order to set State budgets A continuing resolution passes each legislative session as just like a way that General things happen in the Oregon legislature they happen to already pass that continuing resolution so State and state agency budgets will continue at current service level through mid-september but you can expect if the session does indeed close down with nothing else happening in the Senate no other bills crossing the senate floor there will almost certainly be a short or a special session over the summer to pass State budgets and deal with any other bells that the legislators and the governor together decide to take on in a special session the governor calls the special session and I there's that sort of a co-convening role for the three the two presiding officers and the governor so that's sort of a note on sort of the money situation that things that we kind of know or kind of big picture what it means for the global warming commission is actually pretty exciting and I don't have all the details those details would be forthcoming as things move through the process but I can say that a lot was happening late last week after that forecast came through Janine sent a great article that Monica samoya who does great work at OPB wrote up about sort of the climate budget and some Dynamics some",

world thank you again my apologies for walking right past that Council Stapleton any additions or deletions tonight all right so we are here tonight to talk about Revenue options just the same sustained city services I'm going to turn it over to city manager Stanley thank you mayor just a couple of Reef observations or a few brief observations before we get started this evening uh this is another critical point in our budget development process obviously it's still very early but Josh and I have already started discussions with the leadership team about budget development so we are into that work right now and I just wanted to give you some thoughts and perspectives on where we are and the feedback that I need from you both this evening and going forward and some understandings from my perspective in having to develop the budget so first off none of this is easy with the limits that have been posed by the various initiatives over time our options are very limited expenses must be balanced by revenues we all understand that just like our own personal checkbooks we can't spend more than we bring in uh we are fortunate right now to have operating reserves that will not be the case if we stay on our current trajectory uh there will be hard choices and there are no Perfect Solutions unfortunately the options available to us are not Equitable or easy city services are driven by people and the people that we employ how many of them we have and how much we pay them directly impacts the quality and the level of service that we're able to we've come to understand that well providing Staffing to where police and fire are critical to delivering basic services so are people in HR I.T legal finance and other Enterprise services to support them uh one of the difficulties that we're having in filling our police vacancies is simply the HR System being there to accommodate that process those processes cutting services will mean cutting people uh that also means continuing erosion of basic Services the Baseline budget concept that Josh is going to be talking about this evening that we have will be considering this evening will help prevent that continuing erosion I consider parks recreation safe Street to thriving downtown effective code enforcement other services to be part of our core the budget that I will present to you in April will take all of this into consideration I look forward to your input and your feedback this evening and hearing where you want us to go thank you thank you Mr Staley Mr Eggleston thank you Mr Mayor make sure to myself and if counselors who are online wish to be recognized please just probably you'll need to speak up it'll be very difficult to see you otherwise and just to start out we'll be doing a combination of uh we presenting and then also Tommy Hoffman and Tony with moss Adams we've got to go back into it a little bit can you hear me a little closer to the microphone please I can try that's better thank you okay so uh three main things we're looking for direction from City Council on one is a service level Target uh as the city manager just said uh we're gonna be talking about a baseline Target as well as some other options um and that's just basically the level of service right now we're in a deficit a little bit more so we need to fill that Gap plus if you'd like to do anything Additionally the second thing I have actual Revenue options the finance finding that somebody had a robust discussions a couple weeks ago we've been ordering those options and we'd like to bring those to you also and then through the process what the city council was buying for including engagement as we have this conversation the service level Target so the current Staffing address the deal for deficit uh continuing Sheltering program Baseline Staffing increases I'll be covering those a little bit more in that service uh this first one you're familiar with our five-year forecast that we just presented back in January our expenses continue to outpace revenue uh we're anticipating a structural imbalance of more than 15 million about this year 2020 so that's our our expenses to keep the current sapping that we have directly be 15 million more than the revenues we're bringing in that's property taxes military schools City operations more just to maintain the current uh just to put a point too it's not optional the city is required to adopt the balanced budget without correction we wouldn't be able to adopt the budget from this year 1206. so either we have Consolidated with increased revenues or at least increased six millimeters uh and some good conversation we'd like to talk about continuing the Sheltering programs the one-time funding for current shelter sites the SRS team and building our debate after this year 2024 and then the one-time funding for navigation centers depending objectives as an annual cost of the program is what important that money is 9.6 million there may be other one-time funding available but we don't currently have those in the bank accounts we're not counting on them before we actually have them so that we could alter the perspective going forward but right now we're anticipating in the funding in the last 24 or anybody done uh you heard uh city manager talk about a baseline increase this is a concept that we would increase general fund stacking at the same rate as population growth uh early the PSU projection is 1.05 for Salem each year I think that's a fairly conservative estimate you might see more than that of what that equates who is about eight positions each year in the general fund so I've modeled uh adding eight eight positions of your clean fear and what that does uh in the general fund but then maintaining our current ratio about three to one for Community new things and services versus internal sadly we had that conversation with the funding committee uh things like to keep it up in the same here and just to point to a visual report sorry the covering up so on the right accent in black as any police for a thousands of population and orange is the employee County as you can see with the Baseline would increase what you do is you stabilize the plateau at this about 4.2 employees and general fund per thousand of population will disabled as opposed to the kind of pretty volatile pictures and the downward for service enhancements um we presented a couple times and the bird needs analysis or is happening with is not a very cool name but regardless of the analysis by Department of the unions that have improvement over the last couple decades back in the late 90s it went through five and completed a cap on the revenue increases and in order to meet that declining Revenue the city has not added exactly like it did prior to those measured employment in place with this phase and approach we do is over the 10 years get to get to meet that the bird needs analysis so you've heard the police chief talked about 60 officer into further the fire she talked about five repent of fire stations and so on for each department what this would do is get us there by the year of Down based in overtime Sorry by the year what uh by year 10 2033 okay thank you uh and just that same vision room um so the owners buying the employee account you can see the increasing over that 10-year period and your corresponding increase to the employees per thousand I will point out this green line uh just a trend line if you were to grow the employees like we did in the late 90s early 2000s this is about where we would be without this Gap in the middle and also if you see a high point that the employees per thousand uh we're just about even at the end of that 10 years if you were to say service level equates to employees per thousand we'd get back to where we were in 2001 by 2033. question yeah uh thank you councilor nerdick here uh uh when I first joined councils 2019 it was pre-pandemic and it was before the 2020 census as well and at the time staff were projecting a population growth of about 60 000 people by the year 2035. now that we're after the year 2020 our staff still predicting that roughly 60 000 additional Folks by 2035. a really good question one person growth included here is very conservative it could definitely be work on that but again we want to have some reasonable level of increase we could see an increase in that more than one percent there's different data sources that one in particular I'm trying to think Kristen are you aware of that projection where that one came from I'm not okay we can get back to you if it were to increase by just one over one percent per year how many additional folks would we be looking at under that estimate by 2035 sure so so one percent is about eight uh per year so if you were to see a two percent growth population she's asking you about yeah how many more yeah I'm just wondering how many more people would that be approximately by the year 2035 gotcha I don't have that math I'm sure someone could do it over at that table no problem sounds great thank you and with that I'm going to turn over the Los Angeles area Clark analysis uh you might have seen a message of that but we want to make sure thanks Josh hey everybody my name is Tommy conkling I'm Hamas Adam I'm going to be presenting with my colleague Colleen a couple times this evening um first I'm going to briefly touch upon our internal Services benchmarking work and we discussed this part of this last month at the",

We are receiving more funds. state with these programs and eh we have that money And then eh that was absorbed by the general fund eh And if you allow me we had and We are losing other income along the way since I have been here it has been almost 3 years we have funding to pay for it and the money that was not s 1,000 a year and this is disappearing too and we had an agreement that we provided services for them and we had uh we lost some money and now We are losing the County money for the response teams and those are going to be two officers for it other things are happening Not only do we have a lack of balance for the assets that exist but also We are losing other forms of income that rapidly in recent years and some other question in flat member nordik yes I want to follow up something else that new eh And as president it's a new date 983 we have a hotline for calls in case of suicides and as I understood many of these calls also result in some type of response from the law but I don't think so either and maybe you have more calls but I think they don't have any more money from 978 I'm endo many assumptions Please tell me if I'm wrong with these assumptions I can't talk about it but I know that those services uh take these calls and see them I think the main objective is to handle them in the phone and I think they are handling it over the phone and there are very few transfers for the police most people still call 9111 we have to see how to coordinate better to come and go And there is also a lot of change that happens even with the new teams uh To respond to calls to find out How we coordinate and how we separate and so we coordinate responses on certain things some other questions uh vice president Thank you president uh recently we had the council had to cut vac positions in the police department and We are also hearing that you are hiring more people So I am somehow trying to understand the point where if we are going to be able to hire the officers that we want then we would have some bank available to hire more uh And that should be something that you can do and I think it's uh we're going to see how 200 police officers are always going to drop out the process itself requires 6 months to hire them in the academy so there are delays how long uh it takes to hire them it's not a perfect science we can identify how many are in the retirement stage but when they retire who knows or someone who eh separates or there will always be abandonment and there will be vacancy rates and I have talked about it because there is a 5% vacancy rate instead of 10% we are getting closer and closer. of a vacancy rate if we are so close we start making decisions we don't take more applications because we simply have zero vacancies we are stopping to hire so uh And we want to see the recruitment and we have to fill them and and we don't have we don't remember vacancies and and then the wrong answer for saving is seeing the positions and then there is another position because they are vacant does not mean that there is a need for calls and there are personnel who are working and have to fill those eh And a Sergeant and two police officers and eh in those in These and uh the shootings last week there is pain there is loss of life and hypothetically speaking and if they weren't sros uh And they think this prevented we don't know we can't know uh those services were at the school until there was one more person involved in the dynamic with people and there was an information and understanding uh And we really don't know Uh and and we eliminated the hypothetical part and the superintendent said that recently they are talking about having some type of weapons detection system are parts of that conversation I have been a part from the initial conversation even and She indicated that there is going to be a new announcement faster because of what happened so the conversations are moving faster than she wanted to have and from now on when there is a system that system would be something that the school was part and it does not come out in pd or is it going to be a partnership we always have good partnerships even after the separation of the program is there is a person in the department who has a contact with Salem Kaiser schools it always happens the relationship never disappeared These are the types of conversations we have constantly and there is no one in the police department who is the link in particular. Is there any other question for the chief RX member nord thank you Mr. President and maybe that is a task or not For later but They talked about uh that 9111 calls are provoked, what about the places managed in the shelters, I would like to know how many police calls come from the uh, uh, from the shelters. I know that many people who go to shelters, uh, they also have to be protected, uh. I think it was a year ago, I don't remember. Exactly, but the calls increased. What we saw is that there is no impact on the calls, not increasing the calls or demand for service through these shelters. They demand less resources in a situation that can have a negative effect on the streets in our neighborhoods any other questions eh counselor Philips Thank you very much Mr. President Thank you eh director of the police I believe that this year I believe that there will not be any change to any of the ranks we are talking about a status quo but the year after and from then on we will be in an impossible position that if we do not have more income that we are going to cut then it will be a number there Eh I already asked that rhetorical question before we are in a triad And and it goes there are going to be real consequences When we have one person per 1000 and I haven't seen anything else and and that exchange instead of closing the fire station there is communication between the departments and uh And we believe that we can't have police firefighters and uh How are they going to help? to guide us through this deal process uh And then yes there are going to be cuts and of course uh I think as I said when we started this conversation tonight We take a first team approach to see how we develop the budget proposal And how we use The criteria and principles And we begin to see, for example, what we can preserve in police and firefighters and what is the approach we take because we have significantly delayed the cuts of the reduction of 12 people until we give ourselves enough time to have this discussion and look through the revenue task force process to see if we can have additional funds additional revenue And if that's not the case Then we're going to have very difficult decisions to make because we're going to be in a situation where where we are going to have to balance between police officers fire stations parks recreation libraries provision of general services in the city and those are just the brutal facts that we are going to have to face as we move through this process Thank you very much No I know if there are any more questions for the police chief chim members of the we are at 848 and how do you feel 2048 848 are Yes I say that we We have reached the middle of the presentations on the presentation agenda we have four more to go and I I know that there is a request for additional meetings and I believe that the conversation we are having is very important and has a great impact on the decisions and we should think about adding more meetings and not continue with this today more meetings stapleton member I think we should to close and we have to have one more meeting to comply with the other presentations second the motion there are two people who seconded the motion there is a motion to Close the session And if I can clarify we have to add an additional meeting there is one for next week and four Already scheduled, then they have an agenda for next week, it is not for the second part ah fantastic. So my emotion is corrected that we will close the session tonight and next week another meeting will be held supported by Philips and Nordik. Hey, we are closing the session. Many",

        "text": " city and county comprehensive growth plans that the state has adopted as a part of its land use planning program have become a part of oregon's federally proved coastal zone program specifically the state has coastal management goals goal 19 being the foundational goal for ocean resources but other coastal goals having a role as well so that networked nature of our program state and local policies to be applied and to influence potential federal actions next slide so federal consistency applies throughout the oregon coastal zone and that goes from the crest of the coast range out three nautical miles into the territorial sea and it's based upon any projects within that area that have reasonably foreseeable impacts to coastal resources the state has also asked for an applied to noaa for the ability to review projects that fall outside of our coastal zone where they have specific foreseeable effects to resources within the state that the state cares about and has enforceable policies and the state does have an approved it's actually the only one on the west coast geographic location description out into the outer continental shelf specifically for marine renewable energy development and this was put in place after the state looked at marine renewable energy specifically wave energy devices within state waters next slide please so um to think about it more broadly federal consistency is a coordination tool that allows the state to communicate its priorities and its approved plans relative to a potential action and in doing so we have statutory timelines for that review licenses and permits we have up to six months whereas direct federal actions we have two months to review the activities we have a prescribed set of outcomes whether it's a concurrence a concurrence with conditions an objection which means that the state does not view the project as consistent with the enforceable policies or presumed concurrence which is a procedural concurrence if we don't respond in the timeline that's been but the the real nugget of information here is that the activity is reviewed relative to the enforceable policies of the state and those are the policies that have been approved by noaa next slide please to think conceptually about an offshore wind energy facility and development and and jurisdictionally uh boehm process is really focused on the leasing of lands in the outer continental shelf and there will be activities you know with associated footprints out in that geographic region as soon as elements of that project cross into state jurisdiction crossing the the territory boundary and coming onto land that means the state really does have a larger role in permitting and citing of the elements of the project specifically the tate the state's territory sea plan will apply within the three nautical mile area from shore um as well as along the ocean shore in intertidal rocky areas uh and then additionally on land where elements of the project will need to be consistent with elements of local city comprehensive plans which may include estuary management plan shoreline management as well as consistency with our other fish and wildlife management move forward please one of the things i wanted to do today is just touch on an existing array of of citing and authorizations is already in place for the permitting of subsea cables so as i mentioned there will be a federal component of leasing of the seafloor in federal waters and other activities associated therein uh impacts to the seafloor and then moving into uh state jurisdiction we will have a consistency review associated with a review of the path of the cable and the complete set of authorizations that's required our network of state agencies that would review specific elements of that cable as well as then uh determining whether the project is consistent with the local plans and policies that and those may include things like conditional use permits or floodplain development next slide so to bring this all back to kind of bohm's authorization process and really just to remind folks that right now you know a lot of attention is on the siding of you know potential errors out on the outer continental shelf with the call we are very early on in the process jason go ahead and move forward i think maybe four or five little clicks to add the boxes i think better consistency review will during the leasing and site assessment phase so there's an initial review associated with the actual conduct of the lease and plans for doing a site assessment and those would be things like geophysical surveys and surveys required to characterize the and then a more detailed review federal would occur when there's actually a plan for the proposed activities and actions associated with the development that would be provided within the construction operations plan go ahead one more there will be some army corps permits that are associated with uh construction operations plans that our department would also coordinate a review on so those are the elements of the citing process where the state actually has a role in determining consistency with the federal uh next slide highlight those uh those points of intersection specifically and to get down into the the nitty-gritty of kind of public review associated with those federal consistency reviews there would be the first with the boem lease sale that is a direct federal action so it has a shorter comment period followed by the site assessment plan and then the construction operations plans each of which would have longer timelines of review and during those windows of review we will be reviewing all of the different authorizations or permits that are required to look at the totality of the so federal consistency really is the holistic picture of the entire activity even though the different elements and authorizations are broken down into constituent parts next slide please so um in looking at the key review considerations for where we are today and and what's to you know we've identified through our territory plan some of the key uh standards for fish and wildlife impacts for views at impacts there will be city and county policies and plans that potentially come into play we will look at elements of the proposed actions relative to consistency with part four of the territories plan covering the cables as well as for part five and then lastly we do have a responsibility to conduct tribal consultations in concert with our to get their their feedback and comments on the process so those that's kind of the universe of key i think there's a lot embedded within and the devils in the details but that's a holistic picture of what we as an agency are going to be looking at uh next slide lastly i wanted to just mention and discuss the aurawind map tool this is a data catalog and visualization tool that's been built to help stakeholders our citizens and and industry to understand the information that's been gathered to inform the planning and the citing process as well as the information which may be used at a later point in time uh reviews are conducted the system allows a user to access over 340 different individual data layers of information you know broadly divided into the major categories of the natural resources the human uses and the physical setting the tool allows you to create an account to bookmark specific views that you've created to create drawings that you could use to submit comments it has a wealth of information the boom oregon activities page provides several videos on on how to use and how to access the information there so if you have further questions i would direct you to that site but we encourage you to the information that's been gathered together in the tool as the first and most comprehensive picture of kind of the considerations that we need to have as a state as we think about this new industry moving forward thank you i'll turn it back over to you great thanks andy not seeing any questions or comments in the chat yet um but we'll take up another pause um after the next presentation to see if there's any questions or comments related to um citing and permitting yet thanks thank you that's great thanks andy appreciate that i know we had some feedback about um you know all the different permitting processes and how they overlap and stuff so i think you provided some clarity there that we can build from appreciate that okay and then our next presenter is um is mark so if mark's ready let me find his slides here so yeah maybe i'll turn it over to everyone thank you jason and everyone from your team i'm going to keep my presentation real short and give you a quick overview about the seer project this project is led by the pacific northwest national lab where i'm a research engineer and we're in partnership with the national renewable energy lab um where rebecca green is leading a lot of their efforts but we have a good team that kind of combines both of the expertise at our labs and i'll start getting into what the project is on on the next slide you can go to the next slide yep um great so the seer project is sponsored by the u.s department of energy wind energy technology office and the purpose is to synthesize the current understanding of environmental effects related to offshore wind and wildlife interactions so the majority of this project is based around a literature review and a summary of that information in an educational format that can be accessible to a broad audience and we're doing a few separate activities that help communicate this information out of what is the current understanding and then also trying to what future research needs need to be accomplished to best understand how processes and marine wildlife interact with offshore wind farms so let's go to the next slide and i'll describe a few of the products we're working on so the first product we're working on is the is the set of research briefs so these cover a variety of topics um which i'll describe in a moment that uh describe environmental effects of offshore wind we have four of the seven briefs published on our website right now which you can access either through that qr code or through the simple url below where you'll be able to access these educational research briefs they're about six to ten pages long that describe the topic of concern this might be burden bad interactions with offshore wind turbines um describes the topic what are some of the main risks and effects how can you monitor or mitigate this type of effect and then what are some of the research needs so we have these this written documentation that we're about halfway through publishing the rest will be published and available on the website by the end of this month um the second product we worked on was a webinar series that covered the whole series of topics webinar series concluded at the end of all of the recordings and slide decks are also available on this website if you scroll down to the bottom and lastly we want to make sure that this project not only summarizes what we know right now based on the current research but what else do we need to know uh moving forward to help make the",

        "text": " that all the council members have returned let me uh yes chair Grail I believe everybody's back okay thank you I'm sorry everyone I dove right in without thinking first um so uh again the time is 10 a.m and we are now gonna discuss the goal three exceptions overview this is an information item we have Patrick Rowe Oregon Department of Justice senior Assistant Attorney General and Council to fsec ready to present good morning I'm sorry that we skipped over that first slide yeah I love that slide because apparently I've been promoted to the military and I've immediately become a general that's that's my that's my smile for the morning I'm a general and the council I am contact Council two f-sec as well uh we can go to the next slide this is not what I have is the next it should look it should uh say Oregon Statewide planning polls and that have uh you want me to send it to you again Nancy or I don't know why he's with us yes Patrick uh chair can we take a quick break again and let me fix this issue yes we are going to take a pause and handle a technical issue if everyone will please be patient thank you thank how is your land use standard to issue a site certificate Council must find that a proposed facility complies with the Statewide planning goals adopted by lcdc so that's the basic framework next slide please so how can you go about finding compliance with the Statewide goals applicants at the beginning of the process choose whether to demonstrate compliance with the goals by obtaining local government land use approval that's what you see uh in the green box under sub a or they can come to council and they can say Council we want you to find compliance with the Statewide goals we have in most instances since I've been involved they ask you the council to find compliance with the goals the blue boxes a lot of verbiage there those are the three different ways that you can find compliance with the goals the top box says the proposed facility if you find it complies with the applicable substantive criteria from the affected local governments comprehensive plan we go back then thank you so you can find that the the facility complies with applicable criteria from the acknowledge comp plan and land use that are required by Statewide goals and with any lcdc rules and land use statutes that apply directly to the you could also find that the facility does not comply with one or more applicable substantive criteria from the jurisdiction but otherwise comprised with the goals or an exception is and last you can find that the facility complies with the goals for an exception is Justified that seems redundant with what I just said there are nuances in those last two parts that we don't have time to get into today because really we want I want to focus this presentation on what you do when you are asked to Grant an exception to a goal we go to the next line please goal three this is probably the goal you deal with most often because a lot of the facilities are being proposed to be cited on agricultural land the purpose of goal three is to preserve and maintain agricultural lands for Farm the goal requires counties to identify Farmland designate it as such on their comprehensive plan map and Zone its exclusive Farm use and efu Zone places restrictions on developments that are unrelated to agriculture in order to minimize uses that would conflict with farming so lcdc has detailed rules addressing how agricultural lands may be used including non-farm uses and they'll allow non-farm uses on the vague land if they won't have significant adverse effect on accepted Farm practices for example next slide please lcdc has a rule that prohibits a solar PV facility from using occupying or covering more than 12 acres of high value Farmland unless certain criteria are satisfied which I'm not going to go into now or the county or fsec grants an exception to the goal next slide please exception so we see on the left that is the statute that governs how local governments provide an exception the statute on the right is the statute that governs how effect May provide an exception uh that's the statutory link on the right is also premiered in your land use standard you might recall last month that our meeting uh when Hillary foot provided the farm and Forest report she mentioned that F sex process for granting an exception is somewhat less stringent than the dlcd process that the counties followed again that's the on the left she was referring to the language that I've highlighted in yellow in the and I'll summarize that for you under the dlcd process again which local governments follow it must be demonstrated that areas that don't require an exception for example lands other than efu lands that those lands cannot accommodate the proposed facility and it must be demonstrated that quote environmental economic social and energy consequences of using the proposed site are not significantly more adverse than those that would result from using an alternative site in other areas requiring a goal exception put simply it means to get an exception under the dlcd process or counties you must demonstrate that there aren't other locations you could cite the facility that would have less of an impact on agricultural lands that's known as an Alternatives analysis fsec does not need to do an alternative doesn't address that in the statute doesn't so what you see in B and C the language I piloted that's not in the statute that governs your granting of that's apparent not just from the statutory language but it has been litigated in a Supreme Court case which we'll turn to now next slide please this is a case that was brought against fsac 2005 as you can see it was a proposed rather large proposed natural gas facility in Klamath County the Klamath County Land Development code implementing goal three proposed that a commercial energy facility could use a maximum of 12 acres of high value land or 20 acres of non-high valley for the exception is required in this instance the proposed facility would have used 50.6 acres of land zoned efu so an exception was needed fsec granted the site certificate they determined that an exception to goal 3 was warranted these are the reasons in that instance that Council found an exception was warranted they said the proposed facility uh found that the proposed facilities have the Confluence of three unique and essential resources there was a stable groundwater well in existing natural gas pipeline and an existing electric transmission line and Council found that the facility would support existing the existing transmission system which was critical need of more capacity that it would benefit the local economy through employment opportunities and contributions to the local tax base and that it would conserve Farmland over the long run by concentrating electrical generation facilities into one larger compact facility rather than several smaller petitioners challenge the council's petitioners asserted among other arguments they council's order quote ignores the Myriad of possibility of alternative locations consistent with the Statewide planning goals Council and the developer argued that petitioners were seeking an alternative analysis which the statutes don't Council to do when Council rather than the local government takes an exception to a land use planning goal the Supreme Court agreed with Council based on a comparison of the two statutes that we just reviewed next slide please this is a quote from the Court's decision a comparison of the two statutes makes clear that the legislature used the dlcd statute as the basis for the later enacted f-sec statute but omitted the requirement of an Alternatives analysis we therefore conclude that the legislature did not intend to require counsel to perform an Alternatives analysis in making a determination under your statute that an exception could be taken to a land use planning in this case our petitioners also argued that there was not substantial evidence to support council's reasons for granting an exception those reasons that I just recited to you as we've discussed in Prior meetings there must be substantial evidence in the record to support the findings that you make when the Supreme Court or an appellate court uh for other agencies is presented with an argument that there isn't substantial evidence the court doesn't decide if they believe there was enough evidence it asked could a reasonable person have concluded that the evidence supported the finding in this case the court also rejected the argument that there wasn't substantial evidence to support the exceptions next slide please this is a quote from the decision uh in response to the substantial evidence argument the court said the evidence also showed that the proximity of the site to an existing natural gas pipeline into the major north-south transmission line on the west coast as well as a substation made the site particularly suited for a gas-powered electricity generation facility other evidence showed that the facility needed a site of 50.6 Acres each of the council's findings regarding the goal three exceptions is supported by substantial evidence in the record I'll take a moment here to remind you of examples of reasons that Council has in recent site certificates for granting an exception to goal three locational dependency you're familiar with that that was one that was essentially argued in this case for example proximity to existing transmission or to other energy infrastructure or to major transportation corridors another reason that you have found for granting an exception is minimal direct impact to agriculture within the proposed subject tracks mental indirect impacts to agriculture in the surrounding area minimal impact to other resources protected by Council standards and economic benefit with regard to economic benefit I'll note that in recent years Council has moved more toward requiring a demonstration that there will be not just a general economic benefits but an economic benefit to the agricultural community in particular so what are the lessons that we take from to save our rural organ case First Council does not have to do an alternative analysis when considering whether to Grant an exception and second as always make sure that your findings are supported by substantial next slide please that brings us to the second case that we'll discuss 1 000 friends of Oregon the Jackson this is a more recent case 2018 it addressed the lcdc rule that I mentioned earlier prohibiting a solar PV facility from using more than 12 acres of high value Farmland unless certain criteria are satisfied or an exception with Grant in that instance the developer proposed a PV facility that would require an exception the Jackson County Board of Commissioners approved the application based on a reason's exception to go free including uh finding that there was a demonstrated need for the facility and local necessity I will note that the County Board also granted an exception based on a rural Industrial Development reason I'm not going to go into that in any detail today but I mention it uh because it was brought up in litigation",

but um you know that manner of act the actual like process of submitting that audit um you know won't be determined um that'll be part of our program implementation um so you know how we submit that would be would come later um so then you know again we've kind of kept a lot of the language for you know energy audit with the carbonization assessments um so energy audit with the carbonization assessment kind of determines the achievable levels of greenhouse gas emissions reductions in a building through efficiency electrification fugitive greenhouse gas emissions reduction and on-site renewable energy um there's this sentence in here that I you know kind of went back and forth about whether or not to keep um because it talks about Beyond identification of EMS as in a typical energy audit the decarbonization assessment considers erms including electrification measures um even partial electrification Solutions fugitive erms and further renewable energy measures um you whether or not that's needed um curious if there's any any feedback there too um input you know particularly around because you know it talks about this electrification measures where electrification isn't necessarily A you know our our PPS is based on site eui um not you type so I was gonna pipe in and just say that we had mentioned a couple times about um demand response or resiliency grid flexibility there's some aspects there that getting rid of the erms I feel maybe precludes that from being in an audit and so that could be one area where we bring that back in um so I see yeah okay so maybe just like listing response grid um grid interaction in that maybe in this first sentence like in the list of uh of things that are that are included like that that could be included within an audit you know don't right not NE neily but just to provide a little bit of guidance okay okay thanks um so then you know moving further down in the sections there's not weren a whole lot of uh you know amendments or edits made to the audit sections other than time that ERM was mentioned just removing that uh that reference or that requirement um but I did want because I did want to kind of spend a little bit of time to hopefully get some feedback on the levels of audits that are required is part of the part of the program so um for folks that are familiar ashray has a um another standard standard 211 that defines levels of energy audits so there's a level one audit which is you know less intensive level two and the level three which is the most most intensive um in terms of the work and is that goes into it and in standard 100 it references that audit shall be a level two audit um so you know generally the difference between a level one and a level two audit a level one is more of a walkthrough audit where you take like a high level look at what are some of the Energy savings measures that are typical for that sort of a building um maybe rank them as in terms of like high medium low investment high medium low payback um and with some rough ballpark estimates on the cost and the savings but um you know wouldn't really be considered an investment grade audit where a building owner might be able to like take it and really determine what the payback is what the life cycle cost assessments are based on a level one audit um you know it's more of a walk through um you know you might look at full building historical energy use but not a lot of like um data Gathering or like uh like any sort of like end use specific measurements or end use um analysis or deter determinations that are made as part of that audit um for level ones but level two kind of brings it up a step where you're maybe doing more like measurement um data logging on site to determine Trends looking at actual getting quotes on actual costs and um determining within a higher degree of confidence what the savings and what the costs are so um these do require uh the the standard sray 100 requires these level two audits to be determined so or to be uh to be performed of takes a little bit you know adds a little bit more of you know a level of robustness to the to the audit requirements so maybe I'll pause there to see if there's any any comments um on the appropriateness of that of that level remaining um there are some let's see oh now I'm actually see in the chats again so it's back um oh so there just going back through some of the questions will a person with a cem qualify as an auditor um no it would only be the ca the certified energy auditor it's a different certification from um AE so not not just the cem but a CA would would have that um the defin are you defining level one and level two audits this be just through reference so there is a reference to um standard 211 and they would be defined through that reference um and then we'll we level one audits need to be recorded So any and there will be a yes audit that are performed for um BPS compliance would will need to be reported um whether or not it's a level one or a level two audit however we however we land with that language it would need to be need to be reported so oh what's the projector ratio of audits versus Auditors yes so um this is a separate issue but I'll I'll address it kind of kind of quickly too um we do see the need for more Auditors in Oregon you know particularly if there's thousands of buildings um that are coming in for uh you know compliance and they'll need to be audited if they're not meeting an energy Target um or if they're going through the investment criteria pathway um so we are attempting to there's some federal funds that are available to help incentivize and get more um qualified energy Auditors in the workplace um and just you know nothing's nothing's guaranteed yet obviously with the whole Federal application process but we are attempting to get some additional funding to help support more folks becoming qualified energy Auditors in Oregon so you know I know there's a there's a good poll out there that do a lot of work for our utility programs and for our agency like we have a schools program with qualified energy Auditors but um we want to make sure that there's potentially more in there too so so I do see so Washington expanded the auditor qualifications to include the CM um so that was I I looked at the Washington regs and I as of what I saw it only included the CA and not the cem but that's something I can go back and and double check um we did our best to to match Washington's there and from what I saw Washington's only included the ca so but I'll I'll double check that too so Blake my my hands up is it okay to just interrupt you oh yeah sorry I'm I'm only viewing okay yeah go ahead yeah so Cara here from gii um wondered and maybe this is something you're planning to do since you just mentioned Washington but I wondered if if Washington's yet in a place where they can give some recommendations about a level one versus level two um yeah might it might be that you know we start with level one and then maybe move into level two if a building here to need it I'm just on talking fly here but yeah just thinking about trying to make this process as easy as possible yeah thanks good good comment and something we can look at okay um so I guess uh you know kind of continuing to move down through the language to get through um some of this so uh there is this exception for you know you don't need to do an audit if you've had an audit recently covered or recently done for your building um the standard 100 includes this three-year window um is this is this an appropriate window Washington's window is is a fiveyear window um so we do we want to expand it a little bit to include you know five years I'm um you know inclined to to say that it's probably okay just because there's other there's these other criteria in there too that you know provided that the scope of the audit is still you know applicable there haven't been changes to the systems um so it seems to me like a fiveyear Windows is is allowable as well so I just wanted to kind of bring that to see if there was any any general objections to expanding that window not hearing any and maybe kind of to to car's Point too about kind of making it maybe as easy as possible somebody's had an audit done they don't necessarily need to go do another one they can just use the results of a one yeah I like that thinking but but I will also note that there's a lot of support in the chat for level two and and I don't have any particular um preference one way or the other just just curious what Washington's experience has been thanks yeah hey Blake can you hear me this click I can yeah here even though they're if we go three years or five years will they still have to report annually their energy is um they would still I mean we so they would still need to probably report annual usage but the compliance period is only every five years so we I don't think we expect getting like an an audit year I get that but to me it seems that if the Odo is still getting annual usage data you'd be able to at least identify people who had done an audit but then are starting to uh Veer off course let me say yeah yeah right and then you'd be able to potentially do some preemptive Outreach to them it says I know it's not five years but you guys areed offed off course yeah yeah I think that's a that's a good potentially being about the maybe it's five years between audits but annual reporting is still period yeah good good comment okay so I guess moving down um the the language so uh this so the first part just kind of talked about like energy audits with um decarbonization decarbonization assessment requirements for buildings without performance targets um and then 8.3.1 is for buildings with performance targets um so most of the changes to this section to again just are to remove the references to erms and greenhouse gas emissions reductions um just to remove that from the language there and then it um talks about",

        "text": " the people that are on the webinar maybe they could uh show their hand or something okay so it sounds like a couple okay Ms Gilbert is filling out the registration card available and um so we're ready for you and Baker I took the time to take one issue and talk about it quite a bit tonight I will say that I have not prepared anything formal but I wanted to make some general comments about some general issues that um that hopefully stop b2h will have submitted before this hearing is over I know somebody's working on them right now but um anyway I I would like to oh I'm Irene Gilbert g-i-l-b-e-r-t so thank you for hearing from me um I must say address oh 2310 Adams Avenue La Grande Oregon and I'm speaking on behalf of the stop bqh Coalition uh the public interests which is who I represented during the uh initial uh flight certificate process and also myself as an individual so I've kind of a three-pronged representation here and I wanted to start out by saying um I am a bit concerned regarding the focus um during this introductory phase of the uh I've heard about three times that the council has the opportunity to determine that the content tested case would not affect any of their decisions about a site certificate and I guess the the request that I would make is when these uh contested case rules are being reviewed I would really like to see that um sort of honed out so that the council has some idea of what they're basing a decision on uh sort of justifying tossing out of the contested case um based on an assumption that it wouldn't affect their um their decision and I don't know I hope that makes sense to you but just that statement it wouldn't affect their decision I'm not sure what that means it seems real subjective to me so just a comment um and also I'd like to make a preemptive statement and request and this is due to um the fact that stop b2h was quite surprised during the previous contested case hearings when we found that we were going to only be considered limited parties and would not be allowed to speak on all of the topics that were being presented I was also surprised that I was not allowed to uh comment on anything that I hadn't submitted since I was there representing public interest um just to uh as a result of that there were some really interesting things that happened during that contested case process one being that Idaho Power was able to um remove the sir pre-construction survey requirements for bats so when the final uh flight certificate came out there are a lot of us who feel that surveys for maths are really important and uh there none of that is now in the site certificate and so unless Idaho Power chooses to disclose in the course of of construction that they've run into a bat hibernation area um and even if they do they're just supposed to send in something that says we found it and this is what we did so I I'm concerned that that kind of thing happens and also there were changes that they were made regarding the surveys and using rather than than a species specific surveys using this um I forget what they call it but basically a walk through where you just see what what species you see in your walk through rather than having surveys that were specific to animals that are are at risk so again those were two issues that were serious concern to me that I was denied any opportunity as was everyone else to comment or object to so trying to be preemptive about that not happening again I don't know who all has submitted comments but I would like to incorporate into my uh presentation any and all comments that come before Council so that stop b2h doesn't face that same kind of limitation if we are again told that we can only be limited parties I want to establish that that we may very well be interested in making comments on other comments so I hope that's okay the other I'm just going to quickly go through really broadly some concerns that I have and like I say some of these are honed out a little more hopefully in what you'll get before 6 30 or whatever it is 5 30. um the fire plan site certificate change I am concerned about this buyer plan and part of the reason is because it references the opuc Oregon Public Utilities Commission fire management and during the the opuc hearings uh they stated that they don't develop fire management plans for the construction period their plans are all focused on after a development is actually in place and operational so starting out and this was one of those site certificate conditions that I understand I can talk broadly about in terms of the impact to the entire um I hope that Council will not accept that as sort of the basis of a fire management plan since they say that they're not addressing construction um the other thing let me I actually sat there and wrote this down just now so excuse me if I'm kind of um hesitant here the other thing that I'd like to say about the fire management plan is and again a lot of this is information that came from uh disclosure during the Oregon Public Utilities evaluation of the certificate of public convenience and necessity and even though they weren't evaluating the fire plan I found it interesting and concerning that their arguments around things like whether or not lightning would be a an increased risk in eastern Oregon they based their comments saying that it was not going to be any create an increased risk and their data was a paper that was developed that compared Eastern United States lightning with Western United States uh lightning and given the fact that there are all kinds of local plans and local data about fires that have been started by lightning what their what they're started by um who they're started by are really would like to see any fire management plan be required to focus on local data I'm guessing that that's part of the reason why Idaho Power is claiming is there are no high risk no red zones along the entire route of the b2h line which I find I find that I would be happy to challenge that okay the other thing about fire management is they don't consider things like the injury to people injury or death to citizens in in evaluating the fire management plan I think that that should be a part of any evaluation um for instance there are some areas like it um the Morgan Lake area where they're going to run right through there there's one Road in one road out and um people are not going to be able to get out if there's a fire and they have a bunch of fire trucks and things blocking those roads or emergency vehicles won't be able to get in so so I'm hoping that Council will make sure that any changes to the plan address the safety of citizens the other thing I didn't realize till the night before last that I could make these comments on Broad facilities so I apologize for stumbling here but the bond amount as you know has been a source of concern for a lot of us and um I uh I guess what I'd like to do is when you're considering approving this uh proposed site certificate please read the actual language of the rule when it comes to the bond because you were advised to look at only the part of that rule that says the council will determine the amount that's a complete there's a complete sentence there that says the council will determine an amount adequate to restore the facility so in my way of thinking if it's adequate to restore the facility then the 140 million dollars of dollars whatever the figure that you came up with you have determined an amount that's adequate to restore the facility so a one dollar bond amount is not going to address that issue um the other thing is because of the the reason for that Bond it's to address unpredictable unforeseen kinds of events like um fires or you know tornadoes or or one of these companies uh declares bankruptcy so the idea of being able to change the bond amount to deal with future changes um five years down the road you're not going to know if she's you know 10 years 50 years down um because they're they're all future events that's what we're addressing here and trying to protect the public from anyway I I remember hearing arguments about this bond amount and I remember fsac or not exact uh Oregon Department of energy one of the representatives came before the council and said maybe some of you will remember that that they were looking for a way that was fair to the developer and fair to the public and as I read um the bond amount information I have difficulty figuring out how this criteria is really really and is fair to the public or fair to the state of Oregon because those are the people that this bond is supposed to be protecting from the risk of having to pay for all of these um you know any kind of consequence as far as restoration of the site um the other thing that I haven't met the network once there but but the other thing with the bond since you're you know obviously considering there was a lot of talk about the risk y but we don't see um and whether or not there was a significant risk posed by Idaho Power and the decision was gosh they're really uh strong player and and we think that the likelihood is not high that they're going to avoid this or walk away from this project um but now we have we have Pacific Corps involved in this and you can't help but know that pacific Corps does not have a good track record and I mean I'm just getting here um Statesman Journal article dated March 1st the Labor Day fires explode Pacific Power employees worried the power lines were at fault things like all the all these headlines that that happen OPB Pacific core liability for Labor Day fires electric utility Pacific course um and it you know there are articles saying they have been found liable not only for the whatever you know million dollar settlement that that recently occurred in the Portland case but that decision said they were liable for all of these additional um by your consequences so so even in in the article and I think I included the article that said this but the Pacific Corps representative said that this didn't amount to billions of dollars and it could affect their financial stability as a as a company so so to say that there isn't a risk um even more than normal of this company having um you know growing belly up or declaring bankruptcy doesn't seem to be supported by the uh by the facts now Idaho Power has also been hit with I think three or 1.2 million dollar",

        "text": " you have some thoughts well i was actually thinking maybe it's something to prompt for the next conversation because i think we could just go through a list and list off some of the issues but maybe people want to have a chance for a little bit of thought around that because it sounds like at least uh maybe one or two of the members on the stakeholder advisory committee aren't sure about the problems that we're trying to solve and i'm wondering if some of that came up in this conversation today i don't know yeah that's so um yeah that was my inclination was to uh just for everyone to know you know i want to get some feedback from the advisory committee on if this is the best way to structure our next meeting if there are some things we could do differently um and what you know are there other questions like that that we should get out there um so um if that works for everyone i was thinking we'd frame that question for the for the next meeting adam i i liked what nicole just suggested i i also think that we spent a lot of time looking at the financial piece today and really didn't spend a whole lot of time looking at either the sort of reliability or the environmental or the equity pieces and and i think maybe we should spend some time on that part and this was mostly just driven by the way i had the uh the questions organized and so there's more of that on the remaining questions certainly but um that is good feedback any other thoughts or comments they can be about this topic or or generally about how we're proceeding here and other other potential items for our next meeting in a couple weeks and i'm just on the transmission rates you know um i i think spencer said it well relative you know that i think one of and i think you said this as well that you got a pretty wide range of response to this particular question in in many ways probably because you a lot of different positions within the and i just think that's probably goes along with some of the recommendations that spencer just as far as the sort of the root cause of why you're getting such a white response in this particular type of area i agree okay so um just as a heads up if we have anyone i will ask uh linda who works with odo if um i think we're going to try to do this we're going to try to do this through raising hands for members of the public if anyone wants to be unmuted i think we can do that now and get public comment is that right richie i'll i saw you pop up there yeah i just put something in the check to that effect as well um so you're welcome to put questions in the chat and we can read them or we can watch for your raised hand and linda can unmute and you can come on camera and provide public comment and give people a few minutes too if they're kind of figuring that out adam i currently don't have anyone well we can hang out here for a minute procedural question for you we we sort of took this first blush at this survey without a lot of context to it as we circle back through the process will there be an opportunity to provide edits either in the final report or as we go through the process sure i mean there is something that you know i thought maybe it'd be uh interesting to see if people's responses uh change if i ask the same questions at the end uh so if there's interest i could certainly do that uh it's also you know the the survey itself is doesn't necessarily need to be in the report to the legislature it was more just a uh interactive tool to solicit some feedback and see what comes up i'm much more interested in the conversation and substantive discussion of the issues yeah i agree i'd so many of those questions interrelate that how you framed up a particular part was related to another part so i was wondering about the procedure for that but thank you i think that explained it adam we do have one question in the chat from michael jung from pngc he was thanking um everyone for a great discussion today and he was hoping that it might be possible to add a question about the time urgency for getting an rto up and running um also michael you're welcome to um we're happy to take you off meet if you want to ask your question directly as well or have follow-up yeah and i can um i don't know if he's been unmuted but i can add there that um that's really something i i wanted to i was going to follow with our advisory committee here before the second meeting to think about other questions we might want to put on the table like i said i want to make sure we're putting the right the right issues on the table uh so we can uh get uh the breadth of perspectives that are out there on the on the relevant issues for the legislature so um hi this is michael can you hear me oh yes there you go all right thanks for the opportunity to put a question in first thanks everyone this has been a fantastic discussion a lot of work on everyone's part and a lot of thinking that's gone into this my question is about time urgency um as i see it and my perspective is relatively limited as i'm new to the organization um but it seems to me that there are kind of two factors creating some time urgency for getting an rto up and running one is that there are a number of um efforts to set up parts of what would constitute an rto and uh and they're not necessarily being done in a way that um are you know designed or intended uh to result in an rto uh and so you end up risking you know having some of the benefits of an rto being taken off of the table uh by uh by some you know one-off efforts to establish parts of an rto and second is um there's an expiration of the the post 2028 um bpa where um you know folks out there are being put in a situation you know trying to figure out you know what are we going to do um especially if uh the the resources of the bpa uh end up not being able to satisfy the needs of the preference customers in the region and beyond so kind of two burning platforms i'd love to hear some perspectives if i'm right wrong or if another aspect of this that i'm missing for the question um any any responses there thoughts feedback to michael's question i would say adam to to michael's question that the uh the 2028 deadline is really not 2028 it's probably 2025 so that creates even more of a sense of i also know that there's a number of states throughout the the wech that are are mandating rto formation for utilities in their their particular states and i believe some of those deadlines are around 2030 so there's a couple of different deadlines more more urgent than others and so yeah i think there's urgency to this um you know based on both of those things and and the fact that there's really you know there's some groundwork and relationships being done but an rto is far from being actually pursued with that kind of urgency i don't think and frank maybe for the benefit of those on the committee who might not be familiar can you explain briefly the date that you threw out there and the well the the significance is that all of bonneville's customers all have the same expiration date on their contracts and so um there there will be opportunities and and we haven't seen the the full sort of compliment of what's going to be offered uh beyond 2028 from bonneville and depending uh a lot on your situation you need to be able to explore options uh going into a contract otherwise there is no decision you've made a decision by by not making a decision and exploring options it's my understanding that in the 2025 time frame is when bonneville will present products and contract options to its preference customers so between now and 2025 there has to be some understanding of the impacts on transmission on contracts for um or power etc so that's thus the urgency for it so i'm don't want to speak on behalf of bonneville but i do want to just clarify that the 2028 is commercial contracts bonneville's obligation is a piece of federal legislation that does not expire in 2028 so i don't think bonneville customers have to worry about not being served or provided power after 2028 they have to make some evaluations of the cost they will have for procuring power so just for point of clarification there thanks ben do we have any other um feedback to michael's question it's also going to get a table and discuss at the next uh meeting people want to think about it um adam this is remy from bonneville um i think i think ben answered the question on on the 2020 power so i won't get into that but i just want to raise a question for not just for the committee but also for everyone else or all the public that are present here you know we talked the bill talks about whether oregon should form an rto and my advice for this committee to look at it is can oregon really form an arc here by remember power flows not with the state you know generators outside the states serve oregon oregon generations serves outside oregon footprint transmissions are all interconnected they're not intertwined within the state and so the limit is not so i whereas i appreciate the comments from michael from pngc about the the urgency i think this committee should also what should what does a more realistic rto footprint look like that the oregon utilities might want to consider joining and the second question would be should an incremental approach be used i i know the past efforts i was part of some of them um in my early years at bonneville one one of the things that really uh stood out for me was the trust uh building of trust across the different stakeholders and memberships of the of the rta efforts so i think a trust and an incremental approach probably leads to a better positioning for for the uh for the folks to consider what an overall eventually an rta could look like but trying to go at a very accelerated realizing that there's a lot of uh uncertainties and frustration perhaps on the renewable community that they're having challenges with access to or or being able to interconnect and be able to meet their help states meet their objectives but right",

        "text": " you know for notice requirements for a regular application are pretty extensive whether or not we think they make sense they're in the statute so we follow them um they're less onerous or and specific for an amendment process and so where you know where it makes sense we've sort of streamlined it and potentially as part of this process we might want to streamline it even more uh the third difference is that there's a higher bar for someone to be a party to a contestant case essentially the difference is that you can't just have for regular application you have to have raised an issue uh with sort of suff sufficient specificity as we say in the rules and that really just means that you've basically identified an issue and you've you know raised some uh that would support that issue that's really all it means for but for an amendment you have to have raised an issue and and basically provide enough facts and it has to be the uh significant enough that that Council that it would have that the hearing officer or the council determines that it would would potentially change their uh view on an issue um so it's just a it's a higher bar and frankly uh it is it isn't met very often so if you're in on the amendment track there's much you're much less likely to uh see a contested case um and that is very attractive for developers so uh they're very interested in in you know the amendment process I think for that reason uh and fourth uh after 2017 revamp of the amendment rules a type A type B track was created uh as I talked about previously so you could potentially be on uh your Amendment could be deemed tight B which shrinks things down even more and it's really just quicker timelines reflective of the fact that you have qual you have basically your project or amendment has been designated as a as a simpler easy to review um Amendment so therefore we can have quicker time ons um any questions about these items or what it means to file an amendment versus just a regular application as you can see there's not like 50 differences I mean and if you if you go back and look at the slide of the of the amendment process it sort of tracks the application process with a draft proposed order the public comment um the final order possible contested case that's all the same as a as an actual Amendment so these these four items here um can be significant but it's not like there's a thousand um we do have a whole yeah go ahead oh what St I I have a question so I'm sure trying to follow it because I'm on the phone and I'm not online to see it sorry about that um looking at the whole Amendment versus an noi so when you're looking at that there was no public comment and there's actually there's nothing that's given to the public right now we have notices which are newspaper which are actually so inefficient because no one really reads the newspaper but um you know and to get that information out to the public which would stop the problems maybe going forward to have the contested cases or send something to you know the state of Oregon through the sunshine act or something like that um that would help also the developers not spend all that money in an area maybe they shouldn't be at so I'm just wondering is that what you're saying this amendment is there is no public um information or notice given out when their amendments are given so there is a notice it's just that there's no public comment period so there is there is a required public notice that's that goes out to the people that sign up to receive notices um uh and but unlike with the noi where you would have a public comment period there is no public comment period for amendments after the notice is issued something we can talk about for the public can they go back later then that would be something they would just do fastic Cas and if the amendment was changed or what they have to go through the state of Oregon through like sunshine or something like that sorry I didn't I didn't follow your your question what was your question so if there wasn't um for a public comment on that and an amendment was just made okay and then moving forward yep then what is the public to be able to come back for that Amendment do they just go after that later for a change going through so there's still a there's still a a public comment period with an amendment it's just not it's not at the begin so with a regular application you have public comment period after the initial notice and then there's the public comment period after the um draft proposed order is issued so for an amendment it's just after the draft proposal order so you still have an opportunity to comment um and raise issues um and potentially be involved in a contested case just um not at the beginning of the project I got it now thank you so much yeah no worries um okay so uh I just have a little information slide here that I thought might be uh interesting and it's something we're still looking at but this is just so you have an idea since 2017 when the type A tracks were created we've had uh 27 Amendments 16 of those were deemed type A 11 of those were deemed type B there's also a type c which nobody has ever asked to be on and uh we will uh as such I consider it on the topping block but we'll we'll get to that here in a little bit but you can see the type B's are shorter six months on average and type A is 10 months on average but one of the Thick questions I have is are they shorter because type B is like more efficient or are they shorter because type B was those projects or those amendments were already simpler and if we hadn't bothered with a type A type B those amendments would have been seven months like how much time are we really saving by having the a type B track given it takes a lot of time and energy to make this determin so is the time and energy spent determining whether an amendment is type A or type B if we just went straight into uh doing the amendment would would that actually be more efficient so I hope I'm that question makes sense but uh yeah it's it's something that we're definitely thinking about and and want to look at so what is the scope of this uh Ru making so to be clear it's it's primarily the language in uh in the O 345 division 27 however it also could potentially include other sort of like tertiary language that maybe directly references the amendment uh process there's like a rule in uh division 15 that uh in the contested case section that specifically talks about the contested case board Amendment uh I think that's up for up for grabs so it's primarily going to be the stuff in division 27 uh which I emailed to everybody uh last last week but if there is some other sort of like oh hey there's this rule over here that's directly connected to the amendment process but not in division 27 that's within the scope as well so anything related directly related to the the council's amendment process is uh up for grabs here in terms of what you know what we're looking at and the objectives are pretty straightforward that the solutions are going to be more complicated but we want to make the rules more clear that's always my goal uh you know we've had a couple of years it's been five years since the 2017 uh rulle making went out and that was a pretty complex gnarly rule making uh you know where there's some unintended consequences of that rule making where there some things we didn't foresee uh some ambiguities you know now that we've had experience implementing those rules for the last five years uh how can we make the rules more clear number two serve related but not uh is how do we can we improve the process are there certain parts of the amendment process where where we have more flexibility because it's not as prescripted by Statute um to make the process more efficient while still protecting the the public uh and number three this is sort of required but uh you know ensuring that we comply do the current roles uh comply with any new statutes or or revised rules or other recent direction from the courts so and then outside the scope is just stuff that's not related to the amendment process uh does does anybody have any questions about the scope of this R all right as you can see it's pretty broad okay so I'm now going to go through some slides here which is basically you know staff has spent some some time some meaningful chunks of time here going through the amendment rules and sort of identifying like well there's this confusing this this could be tweaked we should probably make this better but again like no no actual drafting of languages occurred uh and so it's just sort of like a a an issue Spotter and I'm going to go through I want to say the the main ones not everything that we've looked at um just to kind of give you an idea of like what what we want to look at what we want you to look at um but I'm I'm if there are any things that we missed or any other additional issues that you are concerned about then absolutely this is the this is the time and place to raise those all right so as we said I'm not going to spend a whole a lot more time on this um one of the things the r needs to do is determine whether type A type B type c determination process is worth the effort so takes a lot of time takes a lot of resources to go through that process we got to you know do some analysis present in front of council during that time we could just be processing the amendment so is the is the effort extended resulting in an overall efficiency gain we could just provide more flexibility in the rules so that if if an amendment really isn't that complicated we just have one track but the track sort of provides the flexibility to move things quicker if an amendment is more straightforward rather than having tracks um so uh you know we need rules guiding the return of sites to useful nonhazardous condition there isn't really anything in the amendment process uh that directly addresses this issue um um staff has identified a need for some additional rules to cover partial retirement of of a facility there not really anything in there right now so if you if you have an amendment and you basically you know you have let's say I'm just going to make these numbers up you know 500 megawatts of wind turbines and you want to you know decommission 200 of them and",

        "text": " a council standard so I'm gonna hit a couple of um but then um you guys can feel free after that and if we haven't answered all your questions please ask again sure um so one of them was on decommissioning so and I think that's a good opportunity to bring this up um we had it on the slide that chase brought up with our standards uh one of our standards is decommissioning meaning that the applicant in terms of their application has to submit to us how they're going to decommission the facility so they have to show all the details of what they're going to do um and then how much it's going to cost and then we review that and if we agree with that then there's two things one is they will have a condition that says at the end of the useful life the facility they will return the site to a useful non-hazardous State meaning they will have to come back to the energy facility citing Council assuming it gets approved assuming it gets built and then ultimately you know gets retired they would have to come back and say okay we're done we had a good run now we're going to take it out then they will to show oh us and the council prior to them beginning construction they submit to us a bond in the full amount so you know some of these uh solar Farms you know could be eight ten million dollars so we hold those in perpetuity and those are updated annually for inflation so if for whatever reason they're unable to decommission the facility we have it uh the bond and the amount of money in order to make sure that that happens so that's a big deal with our process we spend a lot of time and a lot of effort and you know council member Condon you raise your hand again she makes a big big deal out of this and we've been looking at this very significantly in the last couple of years to make sure that we get this right so again you brought it up and I thought this was a good opportunity to kind of raise that we have a new Wildfire mitigation uh standard so we will look at that we also have uh one of the points you brought up I think was important is whether it's State doing it or the County's doing it the use a solar use is allowed in the inclusive Farm use so the department of land conservation development commission has rules in statute it is an allowed use subject to a conditional use so even if it wasn't the state doing it the county would have to review that they would have an opportunity to request that county level so that doesn't mean that they're going to submit a good application that doesn't mean that we're going to approve it I just want to be clear this is an allowed use and not just in eastern Oregon it's in in the Willamette Valley as well so I don't know if you had any other feel free if I miss anything so if if I miss anything feel free to ask it again and I'll happily answer it but one of the things I hear a lot is that we're uh Farmland away it feels like a lot of people think that we're purchasing this land but we're not we're leasing 100 of the site so the original owners who we signed this deal with uh they still retain their land but your use is taking that away the the use might change and that's why we want to propose an alternative uh because again unfortunately we can't grow ryegrass under solar panels but that being said we don't want to take the land completely out of production I understand that brazing isn't the same and I understand that grazing can be done elsewhere but I think it might be a good compromise that's something that the project can support in the sense that cheap and solar panels can coexist there are some studies on this and the most important thing is that we're not changing the uses so this is going to be efu no matter what even after the 40 years and the project is decommissioned it's returned to how it originally was it's going back to the original owners and it still can be used for farmland for farming so we're not changing any of 40 years that's a long time how old are you just I'm 29. okay that answers my question that's it uh Todd I just wanted to clarify solar solar facilities are not an allowed use in the exclusive Farm you Zone there are use that may be allowed subject to criteria so it allowed users or uses that are permitted outright like Farm use this is a use that may be allowed subject to review criteria yeah thanks Jim I appreciate the clarification so um yeah so there are there are uses that are permitted outright and sort of in the language of uh you know exclusive Army those are uses permitted outright this is not that then there are what are called type 2 uses subject to conditional use review so that would be the County's conditional use requirements additional requirements through the department of land conservation development in this case you know we talked about the goal exception there's all going to be additional sort of criteria so it is a allowable use subject to you know many many requirements and standards so it doesn't mean that it's going to get approved so thanks for the clarification so Troy that's right thank you and then next will be Stephanie Glazer Hagerty so I just wanted to touch base uh I thought Jim and Tony couldn't really hit very accurately and and I don't want to reiterate that but what I did I didn't hear is how we're going to address the devaluation of the properties that's a real concern in Oregon can somebody tell me Howard he was going to address that uh so if they were permitted evaluation of our properties are right on those on those locations so across the street yeah what I can say is that uh you know again tying into our Council standards we do not have a council standard related to uh property values okay so there should be and we'll need to address that um so I had a couple questions but first I think we uh we ought to read where it started it's interesting enough in May this this year we celebrated 50 years of the uh 100 and amended bill Senate Bill 101 and I want to just read this uh section one the Legislative Assembly finds and declares that open land use for agricultural use is an efficient means of conserving natural resources that constitute an important physical social aesthetic and economic asset to all people of the state that's whether you're living in rural urban or metropolitan areas of the state the preservation of a maximum amount of The Limited supply of agricultural land is necessary to the conservation of the state's economic resources and the preservation of such and in large blocks is necessary maintaining the agricultural economy of the state for the Insurance of adequate adequate helpful and nutritious food for the people of the state and Nation and I think we need not to forget that I think the state of Oregon didn't remember that because it does feel like we're doing a in runner on the county Brian I had a question for you so you on on this uh indicated that you have a study uh that's going to end the the summer of 2003 on Wildlife is that right was that accurate on the slide did I read it properly all of our field studies when it comes to environmental cultural Wetlands Etc would be done by the end of the summer how will you know how the water fell have you already did in-field studies waterfowl and the elk that are out there the deer we so yeah the applicant we began studies in uh May of April of this year and have evaluated the site and are continuing to have conversations with ODFW to that regard um and I don't know I'm sorry I don't know how you can possibly possibly understand without being out there I mean we're not sure if we're east side or west side of the interstate so I uh with all due respect yeah I think that we need to have boots on the ground before we start making these types of statements understood yeah and your comments taken into consideration and it will be continuing to evaluate for um throughout the life of for the record permitting process for the record there's tens of thousands of geese ducks and hundreds about that that work in that area deer elk turkey Eagles bald eagles golden eagles and you guys know where they're at yeah we've already talked about that in the past yeah and and we do have uh the information that's publicly available from ODFW we've also studied the site um and we'll continue to evaluate we haven't determined what you know we're still working through the permitting process but impacts potentially are and and you know addressing those um but that's something that all those application materials all the surveys everything will be available to uh publicly as as part of the application for everyone to review as well and then the last question I have is in regards to remediation so did I hear you correctly they're required to to put in place a security Bond yeah and that security bond is evaluated each year for inflation yes and then they have to keep ratcheting up on that security Bond increasing the amount to ensure that 30 years from now they don't just well yeah just basically say here's the there here's the bond we had initially and yeah it's the way I like to describe it is that's the backup plan the plan is that they will terminate the facility they will decommission the site and you know do everything without according to without the bond but we hold that Bond until all that happens throughout the life throughout construction throughout operation and even through decommissioning we hold that bond to make sure that if something goes wrong we have the money to restore the site okay so you know 35 years let's say let's say the grazing doesn't work very well this is my last question say the grazing doesn't go well and you guys can't control the weeds without the grazing or the grasses you're going to have to go ahead and nuke that 35 years from now with that ground already nude how long do you think how nutritious do you think that ground is going to be and how long do you think it's going to recover that ground well and I'll just I'll just say on that one that's the kind of comment that we're looking for you know we have you know we always have weed mitigation plans associated with the you know the land use standard um these are the kind of information that we want to make sure it gets into the record so you know one they're hearing it from you but we hear it from you",

        "text": " manpower plus at that time too we had the oregon business energy tax credits although i look back on this right now i thought you know they were important but they weren't the defining critical piece of going forward here um the oregon puc early on recognized i think in 2005 2007 that small qfs and avoided cost rulings were important to the area sherman county did some of the original work on on on making sure those avoided cost terror afraid scott got set and really when it comes down to it you know my cost of generation are really immaterial to the purple avoided cost rates when my my rates were set they were based on basically what it would cost a investor owned utility go out and buy power on the market from an existing thermal fire gas facility that's what my rates were you know in in a very simplistic form that's what they were set at so it's up to me to make a profit with those rates um it's not up for the ratepayer to if i can't if i can't maintain my costs i don't i can't go back to the ratepayer ratepayers just say you know i need more money for my rates or anything else you know i am locked into to that i have to make do with it another very critical piece or whether is the federal investment tax credits the ptc for smaller for these smaller facilities really is difficult to utilize because you can't it's difficult to aggregate and monetize the production tax credits with the federal tax credit especially the um you know what was established in the in 2009 that was a critical piece next slide please but with my you know servants nine megawatts uh six ge one 1.5 units i generated power for about 3 000 homes in the portland area total investment about 22 million and more than 7 million that was within the was it within the region during during construction you know i i am the fifth largest in sherman county in the last 10 years i paid over a million dollars in in taxes i can assure you you know sherman county judge the bulk as well well we'll say that this is this is an important piece to the the counties the county's financing and i have annual regional payrolls in the neighborhood of around 300 000 000 a year next slide please you know when the you know the oregon puc recognized the importance to small renewable energy projects below 10 megawatts by establishing uh firm ppas for a 20-year period you know that really allowed me to go to the bank and this and put together a package that could be financed without this without this firm gpa for a 20-year period you just i just couldn't have done it this was this was a vital vital factor it's changed since then um over the years but and i i hope that this group can sort of get this back on track within the the puc because it is it is critical of these firms these projects are going to go forward next slide please in the past as i mentioned the small energy loan program which was critical mike mcarthur is on the panel right now was a part of that um you know having the small energy program was critical because i was able to take you know after construction financing through cobank i go into a long-term small energy program uh loan facility that the state of oregon had and the dimension before the investment tax credits next slide but now as we look at this um you know we really need to have this mandate for from the oregon puc in force for we wanted to have six to eight percent of the you know energy generation through the state renewable energy generation from the state come from the small investor community projects we've had this we've tried to get this passed at korea for a number of years it's on the books it's just not being it's not being enforced we need to have you know a ppa tariff not just for wind and solar but we need hybrid tariffs and allow us to go into you know dispatchable delivery up to 10 megawatts continuous you know we want you know that's going to be critical as we go forward to provide this resiliency to the grid and to our our local area and this all has to be locked into a firm 20-year ppa next slide please why should oregon department of energy and be involved because it's community the community renewable energy is important to our region's future we got to have a mix we can't just have all large-scale ious on a large scale um you know utilities scale projects you know the smaller distributed as oregon trust of has brought up the distributed energy sources the behind the meter sources the local facilities like like mine we've got to have a mix to be resilient here as we move next slide there are some other examples that that have that have occurred in the last 10 years now i want to say up front this might be a little bit old because i didn't have a chance to update this uh yesterday but you know lime wind in baker county was another example they have a three megawatt project six uh 500 kilowatt uh rebuilt units um and they sell power to the uh idaho power company they are another example of a local project next slide i think really important to to me and it should be to to the group as a whole um the community action program in aberdeen washington built uh coastal wind which was for ge 1.5 megawatt turbines to get this chance take a look at this the the video of the project it's really impressive it's right there on the coast it's done for you know an area that was that was that was struggling i think and you know i've talked to craig de blanco the the manager of the uh coastal community action program uh many times you know they take the money that they receive from this project and plow it right back into the community into food assistance into housing assistance you know this is this is this has been a critical part of that at that area i think it's still still in existence still on there still on the website at least um and i encourage the group to get to get to know it better next slide you know minnesota i think still leads in community uh programs you know they've had a lot of um you know community developments going forward and they're just just some of the others in the area next slide i think one of one of the exciting ones too i saw was up in kodiak alaska where a community project built from three 1.5 ge units was really built to take the diesel power generation out of the equation um you know these may not be a direct payment back to the community but it was a definite plus win for the community itself next and we go up to you know towns in the northeastern part of the u.s in new york and places um you know they've there have been a wide region of wide areas of successes for these types of projects next slide in south dakota we're in one town where 606 residents formed a cooperative and built their own project so you know there's there are other examples just in just beside the weapons that we have and then the final slide i think some of the critical success facts would really really these projects you gotta have a vision of the plan you have to get project leadership in place you gotta involve the community up front you have to be able to provide financing and you have to have a strong pricing regime and then the deciding permitting and interconnection all these are critical for going forward whether it's solar wind biomass anything right now i think that's it stephanie yeah just some of the great partners and friends that i have had oregon department of energy cobank which provided the construction for financing eva droll of course edf investors which provide my maintenance contracts ge um seattle city light which buys the the rex moscow electric and sherman county of course thank you so much appreciate it uh any questions from members of the work group and anyone's welcome to ask a question in the chat friend piece yeah well thanks thank you for the presentation ormond uh you mentioned something uh earlier about seems like a synergistic relationship with some of the larger development and and a smaller scale project as it relates to uh recruiting uh workforce can you say more about about that sort of the the needs of being able to attain a workforce for some of these smaller projects and in addition to that just kind of curious also if these are you know local jobs or are these a workforce from all over the state or other parts of the yeah uh that's that's an extremely important question that's one of the one of the issues that i had a high degree of concern about in the very beginning who was going to maintain these units you know i'm i'm way too old to start climbing these towers uh myself and that was you know i and we struggled with that uh when we first started to get into the project we we thought that ge ge wind energy could supply the service they unfortunately could not so i had a you know i was i was i was extremely lucky that um uh edf which had a maintenance contract with um leading juniper in arlington i think lydia jupiter that's a pacific uh facility uh was able i was able to piggyback underneath some of their resources that they had already in the in the area to to provide maintenance to my facility i made this as not just not um you know defining you know fixing a fault on the universe that's tripped it's it's doing the periodic maintenance it's providing basically upgrades to blades and generators as required and then the other factor which is absolutely critical too is the is the 24-hour seven seven days a week monitoring other of the facility edf was because they're already in the area were able to to do that but etf left the area vestis was able to pick up that contract best has had uh similar contracts with montag and khan in uh condon in uh bigelow canyon with uh portland general electric um you know i would not be able to do this without those assets being in in place case in point you know i lost a um i lost a 1.5 hitachi generator um about a month ago um i was able to",

know i care a lot about this stuff too so and i know it's uh let's see so um we have questions from jimmy and then after jimmy if it's okay we'll go to um kathy moyd who's joined us as an attendee today so starting with jimmy thanks christy this my question sort of relates to the workshops and and some of the study aims now just sort of curious um if you foresaw this study speaking to you know which type of small scale renewable projects sort of best deliver on the aims of the legislation as it relates to sort of local economic development and resiliency i was kind of wondering where you sort of foresaw those potential topics mapping out into the workshops you laid it's a a great question i i so um i'll just go back to this slide um on the the topic areas for for the workshops um and uh the the uh which is you were raising around uh the the work group would be investigating um sort of the the various benefits or opportunities for projects and and um uh identifying those opportunities that would take place across some of the you know that you could see them each of these having some some discussion of those topics but in particular looking at these sort of barriers and workshop line the barriers and opportunities for small scale renewable projects and workshop three the benefits and impacts of great impacts of small scale renewable projects but again the the one of the goals of our sequencing here is that each of these workshops can actually inform the following workshops as well the topics discussed will will will build uh on uh on on each other as we go through through this process did that answer your question yeah thank you john great and then i'll go ahead and take kathy off from you kathy you should now be able to of your question yeah um okay uh my name is kathy moyet i'm a i've been following a lot of climate legislation and agency activities for league of women voters of oregon and occasionally if it's appropriate we like to be able to provide uh testimony you know in some of the activities but just also keep up on what's going on and so i'm interested in what access the general public will have to some of the things will the website that you're talking about be available to the public will the workshop materials be available you know in the month ahead of time so we can have a chance to look at them and see if want to provide comments that's a that's a that's a a great question thanks for bringing that up so yes the the the small-scale renewable energy study website is a public facing website uh the materials for the workshops will be available on the website um we will endeavor to have them up as uh expediently as possible at least within two weeks of the workshop itself so um and and then messages will go out through our uh through our listserv to to the public um and the workshops themselves will be uh public meetings and there will be an opportunity for public comment at each of those right and and the available of your written comments also and the availability for written comments as well yes and and the listener will be uh available for public to subscribe to yes it will okay thank you i appreciate that yeah there's a i think we can we can maybe chat the the web page and then sent a note of it we can send a notification to folks on this on this meeting of you know push push is better than pull thank you so much for your service kathy and yeah it's just um an imperative that everything we do as a state agency be open and accessible to the public so thanks for the reminder we'll keep on it all right does anyone else have any questions yeah i'll go ahead and comment diane hinkles here i just wanted to appreciate so i appreciated the um comment about uh putting materials on the site and such uh and like when we do that because there's there's a lot to consider in this work group and also even in filling out the the survey and the questionnaire that will be something where i appreciate the time that we'll have to do that but also it's all self you know it's all cross informative shall we say so i thank um trey for bringing that up but i i appreciate um and i wanted to ask so if you could um tell us if you is it's the sort of thing where we would send you or maybe you just instruct us later when you know but soon i guess where we would send you you know or we would ask you if these materials were going to be there and then you're the one who would be the conduit to the poster or you know what mechanism you're going to use to use that it would be good to know that you know at the earliest possible time i think the that's a great point to answer so the the um the work group charter that will be sent we'll be sending out on december 13th we'll have more information about the the process and and and methods by which you can communicate with our team um uh i'll say now certainly i'm the project lead so so i'll be you know available to members of the work group as you see and uh the one of the elements of the the questionnaire um that will include uh your question forward remembers about potential materials that we could reference uh as we as we do we're doing our research so um and that so so you'll have a uh an immediate uh avenue there to include uh materials which will come directly to us does that answer your question thank you all right anything else work plan process all right got nothing in the chat nobody else speaking up thanks john okay um so now i'm just going to take uh um a few uh uh minutes here to give it a a quick or brief uh sort of level set on on where we are uh or what the status of small scale and community-based energy projects isn't in oregon at the moment and then to do a little bit of a deeper dive into each of the of research point out some examples of potential research areas research or potential research methods um i'll just point out that that what i'm uh when i get to those uh the discussion of the of the research topics um so we're not being prescriptive about does the work group need to consider we want those topics to be generated really you know generated uh by the work group but just uh the goal here is to just give a um sort of a flavor of what the group uh might be studying and a primer of um what we'll be asking in the questionnaire that we'll be sending out to the group um so again uh just just uh quickly going back to our definition uh so the small-scale community-based review website projects that we're talking about our uh projects with a generating capacity of 20 megawatts or less uh using uh resources that are uh rps oregon rps eligible and located in america um so um at the moment and so so in oregon uh between 1990 and 2019 uh approximately uh 7.6 gigawatts of nameplate capacity has been added to the grid and of uh of that uh capacity um approximately 10 uh were projects that were under that 20 megawatt threshold um and if we look at that over time between 1990 and 2019 we can see that uh you know between 1990 and 2005 uh this is the the bulk of that those capacity editions were projects live projects over 20 20 megawatts exercise and uh but but from 2006 onwards it was about to see an increase in oregon in projects under the 20 megawatt threshold and i'll just point out that this capacity here does include but the in this under 20 megawatt category are almost exclusively renewable-based resources um and we can see that over the last uh 15 years um the proportion of uh new additions that were made up of uh in this under 20 megawatt threshold has increased uh and over the last five years approximately 37 of the capacity increases away from projects under 20 megawatts in size um and so uh now if we look at that segment uh in a little bit more detail and see what uh we can we can look at that in uh break down those size categories a little bit more and look at the different resources and so this chart uh takes this the the slice of under 20 megawatt breaks it further out into one megawatt or less one to five megawatts five to ten megawatts and saves it 20 megawatts and then breaks it out by resource so biogas and the dark green the microgreen is biomass it's orange natural gas here as well just just uh to show that it's a relatively small slice of the these projects um solar and yellow and then wind in the grave and we can see that the you know there's uh projects across across these categories um with this the five to ten megawatt category having the largest uh resource uh capacity editions and with uh with solar being uh the largest in that category uh followed by wind um and so diane i think i just saw your your question of uh what the small natural gas projects may be and those are um those are typically um small uh co-generation um and so if we look at the distribution geographically of small scale renewable energy projects in we can see that they are widely across across the state light blue dots here are representing projects of one megawatt or less uh the darker blue are representing uh produces between one and five megawatts the orange is between five and ten megawatts and the purple between and twenty megawatts um so if we if we look at the count there are there are a number of uh projects in each of these categories and they're again widely around the state uh around communities uh but also clearly uh you know um following uh a sense transmission now one thing that's uh important to note uh these are this map uh are in front of the media utility um if we put to book uh the commerce behind the meter commercial and residential uh projects here it would uh crowd the map out of the too much um but",

        "text": " way and to support our community that's already flourishing around us the investment in this County by the people who live here is incredible and what's so wonderful is that as we don't have to convince our constituents to invest in the community the constituents are leading us we just have to roll up our sleeves and to get to work next to you all and we are as commissioner Cameron and commissioner Bethel said in the next few years you're going to see a whole bunch of projects come to fruition that have have been dreams the Donald Aurora interchange will be completely rebuilt that funding is now secure Brooks is going to get entirely new water system so that Community can continue to grow we're finally implementing the schedule as commissioner Cameron said for the sewer system that's going to be done within four years in Gates and Mill City not only is that going to allow the community to rebuild but there's going to be new residential and Commercial spaces that weren't possible before the fire as a result of that we're going to rebuild the radio system for our First Responders and we're in the middle of constructing a new health building that will open this fall that will make our public and Behavioral Health Services more accessible than ever before we're bringing 50 new jail beds online this summer to address Rising crime in our community and as commissioner Bethel just said we also just welcomed the first residents into our herb place are his place home uh substance abuse recovery house for dads with kids and we're partnering with the United Way thank you Rhonda to expand their safe sleep facility so that women in our community living on our streets don't have to be afraid of being assaulted when they go to bed at over the last few years we've focused on crisis recovery and response and it was good work and we were proud to do it but I'm excited that looking at the next few years we're going to be working on building spaces in places that have never before existed in our community and they're going to have a transformative impact and this is a community that's worth investing in Marion County is a young Community our average age is younger than the state as a whole and we're a growing community over the past few years every metro area the Portland metro area has lost taxpayers but we haven't people have been moving into Marion our median income has been growing and our poverty has been declining the number of people living in poverty has gone down five percent during the last census window and we have the third most diverse economy in the state of any County but as you heard we do have some serious and commissioner Cameron touched on this I'm going to go a little bit more in the dysfunction at the state hospital is a serious threat to this community you've already probably read all about but the short summary is there are individuals in our community who are incredibly accused of crimes who also have a mental illness currently they're treated for their illness at the State Hospital but in the course of a recent lawsuit the Oregon Health Authority decided not to defend the current law and agreed to release these individuals from state hospital within one year whether or not they're stable and whether or not they're able to stand not only that but OHA is seeking to codify this decision with legislation that's currently pending at the State as a result these individuals are being released into our community as we speak and Marion County is doing the best we to keep our community safe but it's a serious challenge just a few months ago one of these individuals who had come to the state hospital from Lane County had his charges dropped and walked out the state hospital doors onto the streets of Salem and while OHA may not like that the number of mentally ill people in our community who are dangerous has it controls the only Hospital level of care of any significant capacity for these individuals in the state caring for these people is oha's there are almost no secure residential facilities that will take patients accused of violent Measure 11 crimes in our state and I always say knew this when they agreed to this disastrous policy there's quite simply nowhere for these people to and what's so infuriating about the situation is that our income tax dollars are still paying oha's 30 billion biennial budget but overnight OHA just decided not to provide adequately for those mentally ill individuals in their and while the need for the state hospital Services has increased while oha's budget has ballooned the state hospital has actually decreased the number of beds available over the last 20 years the other day I was driving my five-year-old and unfortunately do the nature of my job she overhears more than she should and we're driving by this great big building and she says hey Daddy is that the hospital where they kick the patients out before they're even my daughter my five-year-old knows that this is wrong if OHA doesn't resolve the situation soon people in our community will be harmed it's not a matter of if but when so although I don't normally do this I'm asking you to call mail email talk in person to your state legislator the governor OHA and beg them to do the right thing and ensure that the individual is accused of crimes who are the most dangerous have a secure Health Care Facility to go to before they're released from the state hospital if they're not well enough to stand trial in the meantime our sheriff's deputies our local police our district attorney our deputies attorneys our judges our crisis center our health department will continue to do everything in their power to keep all of us safe it may not be their fault but unlike OHA they take responsibility because they're from Marion County the other day I was at a Rotary meeting and I saw Rich Davis is here I'm going to embarrass you and I apologize I didn't even tell you well I told you as you were walking in it just struck me we're in this meeting I enriched the other meeting kind of like off the cuff it says hey um I noticed that the parking bumpers the Heritage Center the paint's peeling they're looking kind of shabby so I'm going to go out and power wash them then I'm going to paint them and uh somebody else to me is like how many are there oh eight and somebody else is like well you can't use a roller you know you got to use a brush and rich is like yeah yeah okay I'll use a brush I think it's going to take about four hours I think I'm gonna go out this weekend if anybody wants to join me and I was I was leaving the meeting and I was thinking you know what's so remarkable about that conversation is how unremarkable the people who were having it thought it was it was like totally normal for them we have people in this community who who it's totally normal for them to think I'm gonna go fix the peeling bumper uh parking bumpers at a facility I don't even own because it's important to our community it's important to the people who live here there's this sort of unstated theme of the conversation which is it's our community and it's our job to protect it and conversations like this happen every day all across Marion County in schools churches small businesses Civic and although you know I've unfortunately now that I'm a grown-up I have to I have to realize this there's no superheroes in real life this community's had a pretty awesome 180 years just with ordinary people like you and me coming together and trying to do what's best for the place we call home and I'm convinced that our country's in a rut right now not because our system of self-government doesn't work but because we've had some loud voices telling everybody not to take not to trust self-government they've told everybody to stop participating and unfortunately too many people have listened to that but as I look around this room I see that and I know that you haven't and I'm grateful to you for that there's something special about the families and individuals who have protected and preserved this community over the years and I've learned about public service by watching you all do it the big difference today is between communities where people take responsibility in communities where they we've all seen places where when things are going wrong the leaders and the citizens all start blaming each other they all start denying their own responsibility for the problem as a result nothing improves Marion County is not one of these places Marion County is a place where people take responsibility for things that are broken even if they're not our own and as I mentioned earlier that's why people are moving here so for those of you who may be new here I also want to say welcome to you we're happier here this is a wonderful place to live and work and raise your family and now that you're part of our community you also have a responsibility we need you to invest in Marion County it doesn't matter whether it's your local church or small business or non-profit volunteer board you need to give back to this community and I want to be clear I don't mean a political campaign or advocating for somebody else to do something for our you have to give of yourself we all do this community relies on all of us every single one of us is necessary and nobody is irrelevant and that's what makes the state of our County Strong do you want us to do question and it's 106. I don't know what time this shindig's over great Eric says yes so stand up and yell the question if you have a question for Oh I thought Tom was going to be the first or John's going to run he's young and fit a microphone nobody really oh perfect Timbers the state legislature I think they both said it from my perspective I mean ultimately I know that's kind of a flipping answer for me personally the question is what's our biggest challenge our biggest challenge is a lack of resources and funding on the topics that I spoke to behavioral health is what the significant challenge that I see facing Oregon Society but specifically Marion County today and the Oregon Health Authority and the legislature just underfunds every aspect of that as fast as they possibly can and then expect people to change I believe that people want to invest in themselves and sometimes they need a opportunity to access a service to be successful in that and the state legislature needs to agree to that and fund it do you have a different well I'm looking at mayor Hoy sitting right in front of us and I I think uh we didn't talk about homelessness up here but a lot of the reasons we have the problem are deep rooted and to solve this problem you know you and I we drive by",

        "text": "It. It. It. It. It. It. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Marion County Board of County Commissioners meeting on December 5, 2023. If you will all please stand with me, and I will lead us in the invocation as well as our pledge. Dear heavenly father, we come before you as a unified commission, giving you thanks for all that you have done for our beloved county, for your prosperity and for your provision and your constant protection. We know without you, the work that's done here is in vain. Therefore, we invite you into this meeting and into our hearts in our minds that we would make good decisions and take actions that would be pleasing to you, as all we do would be unto you all for your glory.

So we have a lot going on in the month of December, and we welcome all of you to come back and be a part of this that's going to take us into our proclamations and presentations. Got a motion by Commissioner Bryant, second by Commissioner Curry. All in favor with an aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. And now I'd like to invite Kara lynch, our animal services director, to come forward, forward for a wonderful presentation. And we'll be acknowledging some people in our community that do Yeoman's work and we're very happy to have you here this morning. Good morning, Kiera. Good morning, Commissioner. How are you? Kiara lynch, director of animal services. We're here to present the certificate of recognition this morning to all of our partners with the Cat alliance from tip to Patel's. I'm actually going to invite my team up here as well. I am very thrilled and proud to recognize this initiative, but this was long before I even came, so I want to make sure that they're getting the recognition for this amazing partnership that we have and we could not do it without them. Thank you, Kara. And I'm going to ask our commissioners to come up front with me and I will briefly just share that. You'll see these wonderful organizations on the screen. And for contact information on these partners, please grab one of the flyers located on the table in the lobby and we'll come around front. I will say this is going to be just the beginning of highlighting them as well. So if I could please have all of the representatives from Vogl, which is voices for Change Animal League. Of course, we have our Marion County Animal services director. We're looking for Qol rehab and Foster Humane Society of Marion county and sheltering hands and all of these wonderful organization's makeup. Cat alliance from tips to tails. We got somebody who pictures. Don't worry, give them your phone. All right. Well, I hope I am not standing in front of anyone. If so, please move around me. But I do want to offer this certificate of recognition from the board of county Commissioners, commissioners of Marion County, Florida, presented to Cat alliance from Tips to Tails. Whereas Cat alliance from Tips to Tails, Catt Marion is a local resource comprised of rescue groups, low cost bay neuter clinics, trappers, transporters, fosters and volunteers that participate in the Trap neuter return program and work Unyna to save more lives and improve the overall welfare of cats in our community. And whereas, the Trap neuter return program provides a humane solution to reduce the number of spay and feral cats free roaming our communities, it improves their quality of life, reduces the strain to our municipal shelters, and creates a more compassionate and harmonious community for us all. And whereas Kat Marion participating advocates donate their time, supplies and services at no cost to community caregivers to help control the population of feral and free roaming cats in Marion county. And whereas cat Marion efforts encompass much more than just Spain and neutering, the Cat Marion Coalition empowers residents with knowledge about responsible cat care, TNR practices and the importance of humane and effective methods to address cat overpopulation. And now, therefore, be it proclaimed by the Board of county Commissioners of Marion County, Florida that one cat alliance from tips to tails participants are hereby recognized for their hard work, unwavering dedication and tireless efforts in addressing the pressing issue of cat overpopulation in Marion county. Those are Humane Society of Marion County, Florida Marion County Animal Services Quality of Life Rehab and Foster, Inc. Sheltering Hands, Inc. Vocal Voices of Change Animal League Ocala two this proclamation shall be furnished to the Cat alliance from Tips to Tails Cat Marion and shall be made part of the public records of Marion County, Florida in the minutes of the meeting of the board of County Commissioners in and for Marion County, Florida. Duly recognized this fifth day of December, 2023, signed by all five county commissioners and attested to by our clerk, Gregory C. Harrell. And I just want to first tell the public that these are amazing organizations. I'm going to pass the mic around for them to also share some additional details about themselves. Additionally, we are going to be highlighting these organizations in the coming weeks and throughout the year ahead. And yes, that means our PR group is actually going to visit their organization. They are going to give you a little inside peek as to exactly what all that was listed here looks like and we just can't thank them enough for the good work that they do. So I'll start here. April Lesage I'm with sheltering hands. Mainly. I help with the trapping for Kat Marian and we greatly appreciate the community and the involvement they are doing with",

        "text": " you're right and I'm in support of these messages that you have highlighted I think um they look really good and they tell the story of Washington County and yeah okay moving on next no comments M okay okay I just have a quick question uh well and a couple of comments so um commissioner fi already let Metro know that the timing of this trip is really bad being right smack in budget season so it's important for Metro to know that uh of course there's never a good time with this Congress um uh so I understand Ain that you're making this trip so we'll have to figure out given how H hot and heavy the politics will continue to be through May and June with Metro on the stakeholder advisory table uh how to cover that while you're on this trip then the other thing um relates to the first key message if we could go back to slide five and I don't have any problem with these key messages at all and thumbs up on them uh uh but related to revitalizing local community so I know that we are not unique as a state in terms of having many or what we have labeled orphan highways and so to that uh I know we're doing a lot cities counties Metro trying to work with ODOT to get these facilities uh improved so that they're at least at an acceptable level for us to take them over locally um they've just been so ignored that it's not reasonable for us to just take them as is um uh so I'm wondering if it might be useful to inform our federal delegation that this condition is a hindrance for us and is requiring our work and our energy here um you know it's a little hard for me to recall since the EPA has dismantled their smart growth uh efforts and they are great Community efforts um it's you know it there's maybe they've they have been starting to reinvent that under some other name that I'm just not in the lingo with but so that's the only thing I thought I would mention and then um when I look at uh just the key messages but you asked about top priorities um uh I looked at the pages that that you included in the packet and I for one do not forget the big bridge projects that we have here in Washington County AKA Basalt Creek Parkway bridge uh we our staff did follow through with our support on a grant we didn't get it we still have a need uh and that bridge is needed for connectivity uh particularly for not only residents but also industry and um I don't know that our current delegation is is tracking that that's another impediment that we need so it isn't just supporting those firms that have received funding for the chips act because that's the the big Nationwide thrust uh we have these other community expansion needs as well so those are the only things that have been on my mind uh whether or not they're important for this specific trip and the call out messages I just totally leave to you thank you I I will say to your points about the jurisdictional transfer and bringing roads up to standards I do think that there's um a piece of that that we can work into the local conversation using TV highway or Farmington roads as examples um is um those impact the geography of Washington County as it connects from the eastern most border into um the Western most urbanized areas not the most western areas of the county um so we we can work that into some of that prioritization and then looking at um projects like the balt Creek um and maybe even Southwest Corridor comes to mind times to time making sure that people can connect from where they live to where they work and goods can get to Market more simply and easily um as key components to how we frame up Washington County St so I I appreciate that feedback and that's how I would use it and definitely appropriate for DC trip thank you alrighty let's keep going great now I turn it over to other people um soon as I find our slides um so just wanted to transition over to the 2 State Transportation package so we'll walk through why it's important in Washington County what the state does with its Revenue um and then um H the tables at which your participation are going to be key for setting messages that aren't just Washington County but our association so with that I'll turn it over first to Des right thanks Ain so as we start looking ahead to the 2025 discussions we wanted to First frame it as the impact on our transportation funding and then our transportation system so that's but my two slides are going to go over so this graph is probably familiar to you it's in the CIP and we've used it in various presentations but it has a different color scheme now we wanted to split out to show State revenues County revenues and then we have a grant little tiny slice of Grant pie that that could be anywhere from federal state or Regional funding all in one bucket so the important thing here of course is that we rely on State gas state gas tax in a 503020 split that is a statutory requirement currently um that goes that that's a big part of our funding and so that's a really important piece for us to keep in mind as the state is looking to these discussions we also get funding for Transit this is a really important thing for us it allows us to engage with ride connection to provide shuttle services throughout the county as well as providing some first Last Mile to triat the make sure I'm not missing my points here but one important thing and I know we've talked about this a little bit the state has talked a lot about needing to diversify their revenue sources right away from gas tax as gas tax is declining so in our County slice there we have County gas tax we have County vehicle registration fee so those are local options that we're allowed to do our local version of the state tax and fee so as the state looks at new Revenue sources such as Road user charge based on vehicle miles traveled we want to make sure that we can be part of the conversation to get a share of that as well and also potentially that we're able to do something on the local level and so those things will all be part of the discussions going forward over the next year and into 2025 but we wanted to frame that as part of our transportation funding and next to frame it as part of the transportation system so this the map is showing uh the more urbanized part of the county and how our priority arterials and priority collector system interconnect and run through the cities and throughout the urban areas making a lot of paths for our people to travel to jobs schools other amenities it also is showing on the pie chart that we maintain more than half of the Centerline miles in the C County and this goes back to how important the funding is for us to be able to keep up with operations and maintenance of all of these roadways that are important to us the map also shows how there's a mix of state county and City roads that all intertwine there and where we get and some of those are the orphan highways that Aaron was just talking about TV Highway Farmington and others so as we think about our needs with the transportation package going into 2025 we want to tell story about connectivity Mobility resiliency safety and partnership and connect that back to why the state shares its Revenue directly with counties with cities and how important that funding is to all of us can I ask um a couple of clarifying questions uh for the pie chart when you say over there the cities 965 those are the city uh funding or it's the road miles in Washington County for arterial and collector roadways that are within the cities those are city city owned and maintained road miles yes so not the city owned and maintained neighborhood streets because this slide is only on arterials and collectors we realized morning go get a chair well I hope to just be a second um so I'm Stephen Roberts Landes and transportation director for the record um so the total mileages that you see there those are all inclusive so that's all City materials collectors local streets and the same for the state miles and then the county that's our entire County managed roadway Network so okay so I what's happened I think in part is that our map and our pie charts use similar coloring and we on the framework where we originally had them they're on separate pages so we didn't realize that they looked like they correlated to one another so I want to be clear that the arterial and collector colors on the map are not related to the um pie chart okay so then as followup to today's work session I'm not going to speak to what messages we need to get at the state conversation or anything I would like a pie chart that does have total road miles in Washington County but has a slice out of that County I want it I want to clearly understand for the county what ones are within the ugb versus road miles in the rural and also the percentage we have urmd to take care of the road miles for the neighborhood streets in the urban unincorporated areas so it can still be orange but I need to see what those slies are within orange okay bring that back yeah I I have no problem with the fact that you're trying to inform us all uh but this goes back to you look at one County you look at one County and so we have to um be clearer about that be and the the UA road miles needs to be positioned near the cities right because that's really a city role versus the other thing that's unique to us next is the arterials and collectors that we take responsibility for when we need the slice just for Rural and then there's the slice within the ugb because that's unique to US versus say in Moma County um so it's it's all there the total's right I get that um but we have to be clear about how many roles we have chosen to take on sure thank you so much than you just note to that could you also indicate the number of bridges in and outside oh yeah because the bridges are very expensive yeah we also have a lot of CTS too because Washington County has not pyed and paved over a lot of stream so thank you good good clarifications on that on that question the the vehicle fee uh when we raised those rates in like 2018 I think 178 um those were originally designed to address Bridges and culs correctly am I correct for culs primarily but there were also some bicycle",

        "text": " see. Well, I think. who mentioned a regarding the three options in the short term and perhaps they are not very fruitful But that could be a licensing commission and the original wording so why say that those requirements were met by the businesses and I also understand that There are some passion in this room as far as it is concerned but I would guess that paying someone to meet those requirements where we think there are some Concerns in that if we don't propose one I think we are not proposing some type of Limit eh a my eyes I'm worried that we're going to open our checkbooks and we're going to have to pay uh a blank check and as a business it's worrying and I also want to tell you that from the limited knowledge that I have When this comes to the city council they the council members talk about This and this is something that one of them wants, I believe the fact that the survey questions led us to this is also very important to note that this is a favorable option to put into the businesses of this city. I don't know if we are going to net many things but I would also like to mention that uh it was the business community that was in favor of the efforts to bring payroll into the voting sphere once we took the uh they mentioned a lot They were very vocal in getting me to vote I don't know that the city wants to talk to the business community again for something that is not going to be worth it, so what I propose is to remove it and to your point, maybe all the short-term options are not worth the effort and time. of the city and we propose that the medium-term options be the ones that are most worthwhile kit o Bill Well, I am going to vote against this motion because we already have that tax and that tax could be developed by the council in different ways and it could be developed so that the substantial sums uh And I'm not in favor of removing these uh tax improvements that are in the package because these are really important to keep the city running next year we have to not only have to look at the long-term proposal term in which we work but also bridging mechanisms and that is why we use them and that is why other things they do not go away and it could be structured in such a way that we have not massive sums but more or less decent sums and I am going to vote against the motion Steven jenkins my concern with Raquel's comment about adding all these bullets the concern I have is that many of these bullets if I understand properly could be from a single individual in the task force in a response to the survey So my concern is that uh we could Raise the voice of a single person with a single concern we can Raise the level of the voice of this task force so that we mention it to the city council So for that reason I oppose idea Well my comment is that it is Exactly what I want to second what Steven said, I agree with the point of the package of recommendations, giving a recommendation as a consensus, not as individuals and not having individual opinions, nothing more, and in terms of being able to understand and capture those perspectives, those meetings are open. to the public we have the minutes the documentation that is available Eh This is completely available to the public this information is beneficial eh it can be seen and it can be searched and for another thing that we must consider in this motion is that there has not been another motion of this that guy is there any other discussion of the excitement that is being had uh that is now about to be approved so we want to remove the business license commission from the report and I think I want to speak to Bill's point because there is a belief Here there is a need to do immediate financing if that is true And this is implemented uh we have to put a point in the uh presentation that the long- term objectives if they are implemented this is going to and I think there is a mention in the consideration of sequences at a general level and at general level that's already Well and I think it matters how much they want to charge businesses and we don't know how much it is but for me it's hard to believe that a business truck can pay for a business license and other businesses can't if they can make a food truck and Becky to your point I think we don't know how much it is going to cost the question asked and asked by B and we are all going to vote in favor of removing the licensing commissions those who say yes those who are Opposed to say yes let them say no, it doesn't seem like he's the one who won but we're going to make a division first all those who are in favor raise your hands please to count them eh I see seven in favor and all those who oppose raise their hands 15 are people who oppose the emotion So the motion is not approved and some other discussion about the business licensing commissions before we move forward well uh I think I'm nate Ren as far as the vote I understand and I just wanted to make a motion that we add one more bullet point one more recommendation which is the following I recommend that the city look at How to make a potential licensing program how we write it well because the business community is critical for this to be successful I would prefer to have them in our favor and second Bill's motion then any discussion on no So if not all in favor say yes all against say no and the motion is approved Very good So now I am going to move on to the next point which is to increase the commission of the franchise there is no proposed language so there are two editions that were suggested one is that the idea of \u200b\u200bputting the measurements do not allow commission increases that increase the cost of living The annual federal cost of living adjustments and the other is that it is ion You should consider it as an increase in your utility bill payments. To pass on this increase to the people in their electricity, water, and telephone bills, uh, the three of us are here. I see that first bill and then you go ahead well Bill small dam I believe that we remove the increase in commissions for And then for me it would be that the taxes are equitable and would result in another flat tax that and not bringing that would not be good for the city either Katy well Katy noc I don't understand why We are having this last meeting we have these discussions and now the people who didn't like it last time and we are doing it again so I don't know how this is effective in terms of this fixed tax and that is one of the options that we kept to to have something short term not because we like it but we have to have something short term all short term options regressive Thanks eh Scott Eh I agree with what you said eh Katy I don't think we have to decide again on what was decided was the time for those discussions is in future sessions or actions to implement them or not so I think we are wasting our time let's stop wasting our time is what I feel and let's consider those issues and move on bequi well it existed and I don't I see something here that would keep the franchisee from spending what it costs him, I think we have to have it so that we because it has to have an administrative commission and before moving forward this consideration we have an emotion on the floor and this is part of the discussion I I withdraw my emotion Ah, he withdraws it very well And then he withdraws and there are no more discussions Katy yes almost in some way what Becky was saying I think we are eh We can't make those decisions we overreaching decisions maybe the council doesn't can do we can't uh decide by business what they approve and don't approve I think that in one the government can do it in a very limited way we have to focus on the fact that they have a recommendation that they explore only Eh yes Beth And then Scott then again I'm Cautious but I want to tell you that I work for those who pay commissions of fees I am going to apply for those who take away the garbage I am going to abstain at this point but I am going to give you some facts eh I work mainly in the Portland metropolitan area and we in several jurisdictions in the metropolitan area of \u200b\u200buh uh Portland have assistance programs for low- income people for the collection of organic recycled garbage that is new but it helps to regress on this Scott Well I want us to accept the proposed edits as they are. were introduced And who seconds the motion bequi forward eh Steven jenkins I vote against because I feel that we have to be consistent with bullet one regarding the annual Federal cost of living increase and I am not going to repeat my arguments but I think it should remove this point some other discussion about including the two proposed editions everyone in favor of including them say I those who are opposed say no Eh I abstain and please eh we really have to vote by raising your hands because it seems all those who are in favor raise their hands and all those who are in favor of editions raise their hands all those who are against 13 in favor all those who oppose including the editions raise their hands eight against the motion is approved and one abstention So the motion is approved Very good So let's move forward towards the frozen base of increase of the urban part first if your area is closed it cannot be reopened I think that refers to the fact that once the base was mentioned it was not It can be unfrozen. It cannot be downloaded. We clarify it in the language if that was the intention of the comment and we also note that this option can appear as transferring money from one budget item to another budget item. Note that this force, this working group does not see urban activities. eh they may be impacted by it in urban renewal Katy nock I eh propose that we accept these proposed editions second bequi discussion about it all in favor of including the proposed editions say in favor all those who oppose say The motion is not approved Okay Now we are going to move towards some of the medium-term options, the first of which is the real estate tax rate",

        "text": " get done what yeah and one of the things I I've mentioned to the rest of the Metro Staff is at least in this District in Washington County particularly most of the cities are very proactive in meeting it and like I said things don't always go according to plan but it isn't because of lack of trying and lack of effort on the part of the cities and I'm including all the cities that that I touch which is uh you know Hillsborough will be written um you know to Wallace and uh Wilsonville et cetera Etc so anyway yeah because I I could see why you know again not to pick on you uh Jamie you know King City is going through this big process of explaining the ugb expansion and it's a small city of small staff so to keep up with all the requirements is it's got to be uh very difficult for her city manager and her staff But Mighty all right any other questions about jpac for Steve or mayor Callaway I should say all right that brings us to mpac uh I think mayor Rosner attended at least one impact meeting so can you bring us up to speed on sure moving and grooving at um sure so the last meeting I don't have an agenda yet for the next meeting so I can't speak to that but in our last um a lot of the there was conversation but there was just an impact overview for new members kind of the getting everyone up to speed the main conversation was around the upcoming uh Urban growth boundary cycle and ask coming up next year and what the involvement impact is going to be in that under the charter impacts involved in reviewing that and reviewing that plan so that's basically what we went through not a lot of nothing substantive in terms of decision making or anything like that at this point but obviously as that progresses I'll be updating this group uh On a related note um Pam trees had a great idea and we're going to start having a meeting of all the impact Representatives that are in Washington County um prior to each mpac meeting so we can coordinate and our message when we get into that room as well as coordinating with this group as we as we move forward that's about it that's all I have for this one so they first are they envisioning obviously multiple meetings uh over the coming year on the UTV expansion or possibly GB expansion okay yes absolutely and there was a lot of questions yeah there's a lot of questions about understanding you know especially when they're doing their studies and looking you know at the housing needs analysis and all those types of things and really understanding what the metrics are using and and how they're getting to those numbers we ask a lot of questions along those lines so I have a feeling we'll be pushing them a little bit in that Arena as well to really understand where their data is coming from how they're coming to conclusions Etc all right correct uh that brings us to other business and agency updates now uh see the floor if you will to uh Chris for any updates from County staff yes I can give updates but I'd be happy to hear if anyone member has any name that you'd like to share account to maybe five no one jumps in I'll jump into the rest No Hands raised no new Breaking News okay so um we have a few things coming of Coming um someone just mentioned about uh impact and yes the Metro Urban growth report uh will uh take up much of impact's time next year as well as mtac that technical advisory committee that supports mpac and I've never seen an urban growth report that doesn't have a new twist a new thing to address if something is different either for the legislature or a new methodology or something and this this time it's it's there we have hot topics on Industrial lands and we have hot topics on um housing needs and methodologies so it will be a very um uh uh there will be a lot of discussion at mpac and therefore we are proposing uh if you're okay with it bringing the uh Metro's proposed work plan to you uh so that you all get an overview the WC bylaws call for weighing in and developing positions of countywide significance on Regional and State um issues so it seems like now at the ground floor it would be an opportunity but I'm going to stop talking there because I see uh councilor rosenthal's hand up no uh thank you uh thank you chair I just wanted to make a comment as we know it's a little bit more complicated and a little bit different this year one we have the we have the recent legislation that eliminates the exclusivity of single-family zoning and we don't really have a strong handle yet on how much of an impact that's having in various different districts is going to be different for each City and secondly as as all you Mayors know the density that we're getting in these newer developments whether it's River Terrace or Kingston Terrace or the the new Tualatin development or the uh um the Frog Pond area the densities are higher than historically and a lot of that has to do with Market forces and so this is these are things that are going to be incorporated into it and it's going to be a little bit uh different and let's just say it's going to be are a little bit more creative juices on the part of Metro Staff and I see uh Chris is nodding her head so it's going to be a a different animal this year to some extent plus we have plus we have state predictions of a great deal of you know uh uh of under under housing but as you know there are plans on the part on the western side particularly in Washington County for 20 over 20 000 housing units be in the process of planning and being built that's not insubstantial I mean Russian you have your hand out yeah I was just going to add you know um as we all know there's a lot of legislation in Salem right now that that could change that as we move through that process as well and uh so I agree we're all going to have to be on our toes as we work on that work through that yeah so we are proposing that that I mean this group does inform impact as well some of you are impact members and is it an opportunity I think all of you um will be affected one way or another uh through this process so we propose to bring that forward and have an opportunity and I think the impact agendas are going to cover this a lot this next year so that was one uh item um the other one is the county-wide transit study many of your staff are working with our consultants and our staff on the county-wide transit study it feels like we've got how many different Transit studies can we do at one time this one has been in the books for a long time and it's really taking um a different look at needs access needs and priorities and uh it's a little bit more local with local input and there is a public comment period now uh it but it wrapped up on March 12th and we had over 900 comments on of a much more granular what are their interests in in transit priorities and we've done some of these before with our stiff funding you may remember but a lot of that it um it's just a little bit different uh context this time in Spanish and so we um there were well we are bringing uh the results to you and I believe that's in April as well for you for an update uh so um more to come on that and uh we're really pleased that it's been so successful and we are always excited to see uh county-wise today that involves jurisdictions from around the county that we work together to um try to better understand issues facing us and opportunities whether it's first class mile uh Transit signal priority uh priorities on routes and service needs it's just really a sort of a local viewpoint on on needs and right I see a question up I think that's left over for um there's a new question no no that it was left out you're right okay all right lingeringer latent I um okay then so that is coming to you we also have oh boy you are I was surprised that jpact agenda was so light because the tea packaging has been packed the tea packaging has been packed some time focused besides her next April meeting do we need to try to get another one in this month or I don't know I'm asking the question because it seems like a lot to try to digest in one meeting well that's a that's a really good that's a really good question uh I know personally it's taken me a lot of time to read through it so yeah that's a really good question let's let's think about that let's talk about with the chair Vice chair and and and think about what we have available because I think there's going to be another round of edits that Metro is doing based on the staff comments that's that's a good idea we also still owe you we have them written up we just need to give them back to you the comments that you had on the initial policies from those workshops that's been on our to-do we have them we just need to polish them up and get them back to you and that would serve as kind of a memory trigger and and maybe we can't do it before the end of March but maybe that's a consideration of normal yeah we meet the second yeah maybe we need to meet the first and the second Monday in April to digest all that yeah let's let's let's talk about let's think about that and see how we can do that that's that's a good point um I think that was what I had the only other update the region one area Commission on Transportation is meeting April 3rd they're meeting in person in Clackamas County and I think you saw my talks Slide the um that that'll go sort of it'll follow on the same location that there's a public comment period on the step and then that'll be in person and um the the agenda is still being um they're trying to figure out how to put but the best topic is given that it's in Clackamas County um and then just one last thing and then what I would like to turn it to um see if there's any comments on the original Total advisory committee but the I-5 totaling project environmental assistance is up for public comment ODOT extended the timeline to review that for 45 days to 60 days comes to April 21st that's another question for you whether you thought you've heard enough about tolling",
