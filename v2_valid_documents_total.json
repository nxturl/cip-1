Madam chair. Thank you, mister Secretary. Tom. Thank you. Apparently we'll be seeing you a lot this year, so I will be out next, next month. So I. I believe Chris or someone else will be handling the public hearing for the contested case rulemaking, but yes, for the rest of the year, you'll be seeing a whole lot of me. Right on. Well, thank you. We appreciate your efforts. Same information. We will look forward to hearing about it. All right. Well, that concludes agenda item C. And we have already taken a break, so I think we're going to motor pass that for now. And that gets us to agenda item d, which is the public comment period. This is an information item where this time is reserved for the public to address the council regarding any item within council jurisdiction that is not otherwise closed for comment at this time. We have, we do have a member of the public here in the room. Three, four. I just saw the stack. Sorry. We have members of the public who do wish to address us, so I think we will be going through them. Y. Start with the green, Liz. And the. I'm sorry. Start with the green forms. Okay. Okay. We're, we're juggling here, Nancy. Usually it's got me lined out here. All right, so we have, our first person on our list is Terry Hamilton. And if you would like to please come address, counsel, just speak right into. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Hi. Thank you all for having us today and giving us an opportunity. My name is Terry Hamilton. I'm a resident of the Lynn county har ##Risburg area. And with all this new renewable energy stuff coming up, there's a lot of unanswered questions or unknown questions or answers to. My biggest one is with these. Not my biggest, but one of the main concerns is with these renewable energies and storage and possible contaminants from, from all these things. Is there a way to monitor contaminants in groundwater? I live in the Willamette Valley. Groundwater moves a lot. We get a lot of contaminants from a lot of nitrogens that we've taken as a family when our kids were young to mitigate any possible contaminants for them, because the young and the old are the most susceptible. So we bro, brought in bottled water. So our kids never had to drink our well water. Even though we had it tested many times. It's below contaminant levels that was still acceptable for, for consumption. Sometimes it would be higher. And so our groundwater moves a lot. So if there's any contaminants that go into the water, that water is going to travel to many, many wells. The other thing would be food source. So with these new solar and I'm assuming wind also. So sheep are going to be used a lot. At least that's the proposed. So what's the contaminant intake to these sheep? So when the lambs are born, are these contaminants passed from the mothers to the babies, and then the babies go into food source. Now, some of the adults will also go into food source. How do we rectify or quantify all of those contaminants that could be possibly passed into the food chain, not just the water chain, do. Is there any studies that anybody knows that any of this taken place? I have no idea. So I'm going to tell you. Thank you for your comments. So at the way public comments work is we get to listen to you, but we don't respond and address your concerns. As we move throughout the process, there will be opportunities for you to share those, as you heard earlier today. And my belief is that the developers and other stakeholders listen and pay attention to that. And that's something that I would expect a developer pay attention to, developers to hear and respond to. But I'm gonna look at Todd, our and council secretary, to correct anything I may have said. Yeah, no corrections, madam chair. Just clarification that, you know, we do have standards related to the issues that you have brought up. And what I would say is, you know, please know, connect with myself or other members of the sititing division team, and we can walk you through how that process works, how those issues can and are evaluated in an application. That way, if you're interested in participating and reviewing an application, we can help kind of",

        "text": "Hi, everybody. My name is Edith Bayer. Welcome to our webinar on the Oregon energy strategy, giving an overview and an update. We see a lot of people still joining, so we're just going to wait another minute and then we'll get started. Thanks. Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Janine Benner. I'm the director of the Oregon Department of Energy. For those who I haven't met, thank you so much for attending this webinar about the Oregon energy strategy. I'm gonna just say a few words to open us up and then kick it over to my colleague, Edith. But basically, the Oregon Department of Energy has been tasked by the Oregon legislature to develop a statewide energy strategy that identifies pathways to achieve Oregon's energy and climate goals and to maintain affordable, reliable energy. And this strategy is aligned with our agency's mission to advance solutions to shape an equitable, clean energy transition while protecting the environment and public health, and responsibly balancing energy needs and impacts for current and future generations. That's the mission statement that you can see here on this slide. With so many Oregonians experiencing rising energy costs, often driven by needing to make our energy infrastructure more resilient to things like increasing climate driven disasters, wildfires, ice storms, and deadly wise heat waves, the timing of this energy strategy could not be more critical. It's exciting to be here today to begin talking about some of the details of how this energy strategy work will progress, and also how all of you can help inform the strategy. So now I'd like to hand it over to our clean energy team leader and energy strategy project lead, Edith Bayer. Thanks, Janine. Hi, everybody. I'm Edith Bayer. It's really great to be here, and I just wanted to talk about a couple of housekeeping items before we start. First, I just wanted to remind everybody that this meeting will be recorded and the presentation will be available on the website for the energy strategy. Shortly after that, we'd like to ask you to enter your name and affiliation in the q and a, if you don't mind, so we can keep track of everybody who's here today. And I also want to explain that we'll be doing some live polling during this webinar. We'll be using an app called Slido, which you should see on the right side of your screen. It could be kind of on the right or at the bottom. It's a green s. And when we get to a polling question, which we'll do soon, you'll see it pop up there, and that's where you'll answer it. And if you don't see it, you may just need to refresh the app. Just so, just click on it. And don't forget to click submit so that we can see the answer to your question. So I also, I wanted to pass the mic over for a moment to my colleague Jessica Rikers, who is the manager for the policy and innovation team here at Odo, who's going to be managing the questions and answers, and we'll talk a little bit about how we're going to run that as well. Jessica Ono, you. Thanks, Edith. I appreciate it. Desakers. As Edith mentioned, I managed the policy team and I'm already seeing some people filling out the q and A with their name and affiliation. Thank you very much for doing that. I will also be monitoring that same q and A for questions throughout the webinar. If you don't know how to find your q and A, if you look at the bottom right hand side of your screen, you'll see a circle with a question mark inside of a rectangle. If you click on that, your q and a will pop up. You can even tell that pop up to split out into a completely separate window if that's helpful to you. There are going to be two types of questions I'll be monitoring for. One is clarifying questions that maybe something that Edith described was you didn't quite understand or it needs a little bit more context. Those I'll try and break in and ask those questions as they come up. The others I will be keeping an eye on. And when we get to some natural breaks in Edith's presentation, then I will be reflecting those back to her. So, and also, if you throw a question from me to me in the q and A about anything in particular, I'll be happy to answer that. Also, we may have some people responding just through the Q and A if it's a really highly specific question. But in general, we'll be throwing most of these over to Edith for her to answer. Thank youa. Thanks, Jessica. So here's the agenda for our conversation today. We're going to start with an overview of Oregon's energy landscape and a description of what the energy strategy is and why we need one in the first place. We'll then talk about how we're approaching the technical analysis. And finally, we'd like to provide some details on ways that folks can get involved in the process. And we'll leave about 30 minutes for questions and",

        "text": " kind of stuff? It's like in that vein, how it supports those services in like an event of our outage or natural disaster or something. Yeah, yeah, exactly. The bill says, community energy resilience project means a community rewable energy project that includes utilizing one or more renewable energy systems to support the energy resilience of structures or facilities that are essential to the public welfare. And so that really is about the critical infrastructure and supporting energy facilities. And, you know, the energy resilience. I would say that the economic resilience is something that you could put in kind of the community benefits section of the application. However, most applications that we get, we expect to have economic benefits rippling through the commun community. So if there's one that really distinguishes those economic benefits, to, say, a qualifying community, that would be worth putting in the application. But the resilience piece is really about backup power. I'm sort of confused by the next question. Let me see if you still on. Hey, Josh Clauson, will you raise your hand if I can take you off mute? And then if you raise your hand, I'll ask your question, but otherwise I don't. Okay, perfect. Okay, thanks. Al right. Sorry that I. Oh, no, I lost you. Ok. You are now unmuted, I hope. Yeah. Oh, no, I on mu a wrong person. Okay, now try Josh, you should be off mute now. So my question was, as we are applying for these grant applications, what are the criteria for final acceptance? Basically, you know, we don't want to get into a position where we've gone through all these steps, you know, accepted the 30% grant, and then we're into a problem where we don't qualify for the last 70% and, but we've already, already spent those, those funds to get that project underway. And so we'just, like to see if there's a way we could get that published where we'll know what the, what the final criteria for acceptance are before we, before we begin the project. I know that performance. Oh, go ahead. I mean, I know performance agreements are like kind of the avenue or the venue where this will take place. Right. Ye, but like on solar applications and whatnot, you know, there'there's, different govern, governing agencies. They're going to be involved with the final performance checks on these, on these systems, whatever, whatever, you know, they end up being as far as the scope and we just want to be sure that, you know, we can check all these, all the boxes off and say, okay, we are, we are now ready for, you know, final acceptance from Odoe and have some, have some idea that we are ready to go. Are you referring to planning or construction grants? I'd probably construction grants. So I think one of the requirements is going to be that CPA verification letter along in the final report as well. We can detail that. A lot of the other ones will be specified in the performance agreement. And I'm just going to check a few other places if, Rob, you want'to have anything to that. Yeah. So during the construction phase of projects, we will have periodic reporting requirements with OO staff so that we can keep up to date with how the project is going. And one example of something that could happen would be the need for an extension of time. And the bill gives us the ability to do that once so that we can provide an extension. But at the final stage of a construction project, we will have an ONS site inspection and we'll be looking for a fully operational project that is demonstrating that it is online exporting power to the grid or having power used on site. It's essentially a fully operational system that can pass our on site inspection. We'll be working with you throughout the project with, with periodic reporting requirements for progress checks within the, within the grant. Do you, I don't know if you can even answer this right now, but do you foresee a time when, let's say, the local authorities having jurisdiction approve a project, but Oregon state will have higher, higher acceptance application? I mean, criteria for, for this acceptance where you, I'm just saying like maybe, maybe Oregon'going, to say we need this bill to a better standard than what you've done, but your, your local inspectors have, have passed it. So the only case where our requirements exceed the local code in the local jurisdiction is for shading requirements on solar projects. You know, the local jurisdiction and the code would allow anyone to install solar in the shade or on the north side of a roof because it's still electrically safe. Our program would not approve a project that was putting a system in a low resource area. But the local jurisdiction, once they sign off on it as having met the local code requirements. We don't have any",

No, I'm not suggesting that at all. Right. I'm not suggesting that at all. I want to make that clear. But certainly I think your question is valid. Are the. Is it tight enough in there about what the money is and where it's going to be included? And again, if we will believe that that justifies as part of the reasons exception, then we want to make sure that the money goes to the projects which are essentially being designed for that reason. So we absolutely will look into that. Well, and if I could point out that since the last month's meeting in chase, I don't know if you have it your slide deck or not. The staff is recommended to revision to the conditions. I think it. Chase references it right here. Yeah, the very last bullet. Land use conditions 14 and 15. And I'm goingn. I'm gonna attempt to drag my draft of proposed order over. And let me know if you can see. See this? Let's see. Yep, we can see it chase. Okay, so here we go. So this is. This is our first go at amending, like I recommendedend amendment to these conditions, which is in response to the applicant's representation of what they would be paying. And we. These recommended changes to these conditions would. It would clarify, further clarify where the funds are to be used. You know, we're calling out what they represented and now actually just putting it into the condition. And here, same thing like we had the North Lexington grain elevator, but we want that our proposed change is for the certificate holder to demonstrate that the funds were used, not will be used, but I guess like this condition 14. This is more what we're talking about, where it's clarification to specific. Specific pieces of equipment. Chase, do you. Are you familiar with those comments from Morrow county that I've been speaking about regarding this committee that they'd like to see? I would. That's the local, you know, that's the up to the local government to do and outside of our purview. But I just want to make sure and mention it on the record here. I will certainly re review their Morrow county comments. Okay. Also, just to clarify, the agricultural impacts you guys had determined already didn't meet standard. And the analysis for the agricultural pie is. Was. The analysis was conducted by Nextera's consultant, correct? Ego or eco northwest? Yes, yes. Minimal impacts to agricultural analysis was conducted by their consultant. Yes. Okay. I find that interesting. I still kind of have an issue with that because I didn't realize that they were in the agricultural business, meaning that they were qualified to quantify a loss of, you know, exclusive farm use that's going to be taken up and the, and the, you know, all the dollar. I was just surprised to learn that. So well, their analysis was on the indirect impacts to agriculture as a result of the project, not the direct impacts. So the, you know, the physical occupation was not part of their analysis as I recall. It was what does the physical occupation of the facility have on adjacent surrounding lands? And then how can we quantify that and then put a per dollar, you know, per acreage dollar amount to that? I think that was their analysis. And there you, they'economist, they do many different things. So again, you can look at that. You can decide whether you agree with it or not. But, you know, that was their analysis. Any other comments or questions on the reasons exception discussion here? Okay, moving on to my last slide. We're moving into noise, noise requirements. So operational noise from the proposed facility was evaluated to the maximumount, maximum allowable noise limits. There were 33 noise sensitive receptors identified in the applicant'noise modeling and evaluation. And then the noise modeling, like results of the noise modeling, showed that the current facility layout would exceed the maximum allowable standard of 55 decibels at seven of the 33 nsrs during the daytime and at four of the 33 nsrs during the nighttime. And the nighttime, maximum allowable standard is 50 decibels. So in the DPO, therefore in the DPO, the department recommended that council find that the facility as currently proposed, wouldn't comply with the requirements, the noise standard requirements, without additional mitigation. And that additional mitigation could include, but wasn't limited to changes in the final facility design and also in the draft proposed order as recommended. Noise control condition one. Here I only have sub part b or sub c, but the entire condition, noise control condition one, would require additional pre construction analysis to demonstrate that the facility",

        "text": " pathways modeling? So we are running least cost energy system optimization and it's across eleven states. It's matching the Oregon's energy demand and how that demand is, is evolving over time with supplying the energy. It's looking across the whole energy sector and the economy. So all forms of energy are considered in there. It's structured to meet Oregon's energy policy objectives. All emissions are, are accounted for. So emissions from energy, emissions from other sectors. So when we're trying to meet the 2004 targets, then we are, we're doing the accounting for that. That is, is going to be compliant with the, with the policy. It's integrated and holistic. We're looking across large geographic areas. We're looking across the various sectors of the economy of fuels. It includes supply and demand of all forms of energy, not just electricity. And it's grounded, ensuring reliability and looking for least cost solutions. As a little bit of background about evolved and where these tools have been used in the past, we work with most of the national ngo's on, on doing planning for at a federal level as well as at a state level. We have worked with other state and local energy offices, including in Massachusetts, Maine, Washington, California, New Jersey, to, to do state planning processes. And we work with a lot of utilities around the country. Most of those we, it's confidential work. But in Oregon, we have worked with, with PGE for, for a number of years, and then others. We, we work with universities, with academics. We, we did the modeling work for Net Zero America and repeat with Princeton University. We work with breakthrough energy ventures to do an annual decarbonization perspective every year. That becomes the basis for a lot of national decarbonization work, as well as a number of other organizations within the US and internationally. Okay, so what is our technical approach here? I will start from the high level picture. There's kind of three components to it at this level. And the first is building a model of Oregon's economy. So this is a detailed bottom up picture of all of the energy consuming technologies in the economy. So it is all of the air conditioners, all the water heaters, all of the boilers in industry, all of the electric vehicles, ice vehicles of all various different types. So everything that's consuming energy across all of the various sectors and subs, sectorors. And we build a picture of what Oregon looks like today. So what are the energy demands for various types of fuels? And then as we move forward in time, how are the ways that we consume energy going to change in the, in the scenarios that we're running? So when somebody is going to the dealership to replace their vehicle, are they buying an electric vehicle? Are they buying another internal combustion engine? So those kind of assumptions are going into this, this demand side model to work out what are the projected energy demands between now and 2050 for, for a particular scenario. So once we've built that model, then we go to the second step there, which is the aggregation of energy demand across the subs sectorors. So what are Oregon's energy needs in total? The need for electricity and an hourly demand, the transportation fuel demand, direct use fuels. And this, this serves as the, the demand for energy that needs to be supplied by all of the energy supply chains. So electricity production, all of the various types of fuel, natural gas, liquid fuels. And the supply side model, that third bucket there, leastase cost energy supply. That is our capacity expansion and operations model, which is working out within a set of constraints about, you know, complying with our clean energy goals. What are the options for building out new resources? How fast can we build out new resources? What are the least cost investments that we can make in those supply chains such that we are meeting Oregon's energy needs between now and 2050? If we take that picture that I just described and nest it in the data needs for, for doing this modeling, that previous slide is the middle bar there, the energy modeling bar. And the demand side model we're using is the energy pathways model. And the supply side model is our regional investment operations platform. Rio, looking at the data that's going to the modeling process on starting on the bottom, we are looking for the best available data sets that underpin the whole analysis. So on the demand side, this is, this is, first of all, what are the subsectors across the economy? What are the, the, the service demands for, for different types of energy end use? So how much heat do we need in buildings, how much cooling demand? What is our lighting need, what is our vehicle miles traveled? And then how are those likely to change over time based on forecasts about how population might change, how industrial activity might change, the changes in commercial activity",

        "text": ", just for the record that the if you're looking at the version of the presentation that's posted online, this slide did have an outdated figure that contained an additional access road corridor on the eastern side of the site that's no longer proposed. So if you notice a difference, that that's why, in addition to the physical changes and changes to the site, I did want to point out the certificate holder also proposes to expl extend the construction completion deadline by three years. That would extend the deadline from May 24, 2023. The current deadline to May 24, 2026. Next slide, please. Okay, so within that a large site, the certificate holder proposes to construct up to 41 additional turbines for a total of 107 turbines with a combined generating capacity of up to 300 serve that larger facility. The certificate older also proposes to expand the 34.5 kilovolt electrical collection system with underground collector lines and the permanent access road network, and also proposes to realwind the 230 kilovolt overhead interconnection transmission line along a newly proposed corridor as shown in the figure. The new transmission line route and sorry, it's a little small on the screen in the room. Hopefully those watching along at home can see well. The proposed route follows the previously approved route for most of the corridor, with some differences to the west of Spur Loop Road on the western side of the facility. Slide, please, Nancy. So, in addition, the certificate holder proposes to construct and operate a 30 megawatt battery energy storage system, which is 10 mw larger than what was previously evaluated. That system would be constructed on a 6.5 acre substation site north of Butter Creek that's shown on the left in a dark blue square towards the top of the image. The certificate holder also requests authorization to construct a substation at a second site, a second seven acre site near Little Butter Creek as shown on the right. Hard to see in the slide as well, but it's a red square. Okay. And next slide, please. Okay. Um, also as shown on the left, the transmission line would connect the facility to the existing Blue Ridge substation, which is constructed as part of the other whe ridge facilities. The certificate holder also proposes to utilize the operation and maintenance building at Wheat Ridge two in lieu of constructing a separate on and m building for this facility, as shown on the right. The certificate holder proposes a new 60 acre temporary construction yard off of Myers Road, which is in the central portion of the site. The certificate holder has requested the flexibility to utilize the four previously approved 15 to 20 acre construction yards as well. Great. So that is generally what's in the amendment. Because the proposed amendment proposes the add area to the site boundary and would extend construction complete when deadlines, the council must determine that the preponderance of the evidence on the record supports the following conclusions. One, that the portion of the facility within the area added to the site by the amendment complies with all laws and council standards applicable to an original site certificate application and two, after considering any changes in factor law since the date the current site certificate was executed, that the entire facility complies with all laws and council standards applicable to an original site certificate application and finally, that the amount of the bond or let of credit required for the financial assurance standard is adequate. And together, I will just point out that these findings generally represent almost a new review of the facility. The other where previous findings are so valid. We've made a note of that in the thing, but we have gone through a pretty thorough evaluation with this request. To that same extent, everything in the complete amendment request and the draft prop report order is eligible for comment and subject to review in this proceeding. Slide, please. Okay. In the drafose order along those lines, the department recommends that existing conditions or existing conditions with minor amendments are adequate to ensure that the facility with the changes proposed in request for minimum one complies with the standard shown on the screen. That includes structural, land use, senior care resources, recreation, public services, waste minimization, public health and safety standards for when facilities, and the siting standards for transmission lines. Accordingly, I won't go over any of those standards anymore in this presentation. If the council does have any questions about those standards, I'd be happy to answer them. If you have comments, of course, you are welcome to provide those comments during the comment period. Okay, great. So we do have substantive findings and new recommended conditions or amended recommended conditions for the remaining standards. I'll try to go briefly over the major issues that we identified. I will try not to go into as much details on these slides, so if you do have questions, please feel free to stop me and let me know. Okay, so under the evaluation of the council's general standard of review, the department does recommend that the council find",

        "text": "er, just on the record, just that one clarifying piece of language about any of the mitigation plans, including provision for notice to adjacent property owners of an ignition, ignition, whatever the proper language is, and we'll leave it to you to craft that. But I think giving some flexibility to the applicant, local government, but still providing that notice. Okay, thank you. Any other comments? Questions? Okay, Miss Sloan, thank you very much. Thank you. Did, and I couldn't see anybody video. Okay. The next item we have, u, Miss Irene Gilbert is going to provide us with concerns about the F SeC process. And this is a 15 minutes presentation. I hope it doesn't take 15 minutes because I already have talked some about process. However, I did submit a letter to FSAC following the meeting on July 17, 18th and 19th, and following listening to the decisions that were made on the 19th. In fact, twice I listened to that. I had not planned on bringing this issue forward as a contest the case until I did listen to the meeting minutes. And also I had requested that my letter be provided at the august meeting for the council to discuss. And since it wasn't, I knew that the decisions would be made regarding that site certificate amendment before council had received the information. And I requested that the council require four things that FSAC schedule their meetings so that when there's a hearing, there's a period of time between the hearing and when decisions are made to assure that council members have the opportun to actually read the requests that are made. In this instance, it was real obvious that people didn't have time to read those comments or requests that FAC require that public notices accurately reflect the changes that are being made. If you read over the announcements for the amendment, one changes, they really understate the fact that, for instance, they say changes to make it easier to sac, to do their work. I mean, it really minimizes the changes. And some of the changes to the site certificate conditions are very, very serious, very impactful on the public and on public agencies. So I believe that they should be required to clearly state what the opportunities are for the public to ask for a contested case that's required anyway. And it was not clear. And I think if you were to read the actual language and the quotes in myest contested case, you would see that it was not communicated. So when changes are significant, they should be presented as significant. And there are a bunch of changes in amendment one that are significant. For example, the counties were removed from having an opportunity to participate in developing the mitigation plans for at least three different things. The fire one, I believe it's the blasting one, and one other one that I specifically noted. Oh, the restoration, site restoration plan. Now, nobody's telling the counties that they are not going to be participating in those changes. And it would seem to me that they should have been made aware that they could argue against it and they could ask for a contested case because, for example, during the public Utility commission decisions on the certificate of Public Convenience and necessity, one of the questions that was asked specifically to Idaho power is, are you including in your mitigation plan the requests that were made by Baker county and Union county for resources to address wildfire, your role as fighting wildfires in those areas? And I can't quote it exactly, but the response was, well, that's going to happen during the development of the mitigation plan. Well, now those counties are not going to participate in the development of the mitigation plan that they said was going to address these requests that the counties had made. And they were very specific requests for equipment and for manpower. And so I'm just really questioning that Odo and the developer will accommodate those requests. Now, this thing with the counties is, and I'm not saying that the counties would appeal because quite honestly, appeals to your decisions are very costly and most counties have a very tight budget and really don't have the funding to do that. But it kind of brings me to one of the things that causes me angst, and actually it has clouded my impression of Tod Cornet for years. So it was because there was a excuse. Mister Vice chair, I would just say, please keep this to our process and o do not get personal. Okay. You have the inclination to get personal sometimes, and I would recommend that you do not do that. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for the reminder. There was a legislative subcommittee that was hearing a change to the rules regarding Odo and FSAC, and the subcommittee met and the public made all their comments. And then after all of that happened, there was a work session and Odo came forward and asked that the section in the statute that allowed counties to have up to $50,000 to argue contested cases before the Department of",

So this is the new and improved updated plan that's going to roll into the capital improvement plan and the that s your city. But this is what helped people visualize how we were going to do this without actually going over the raising bo rate above what it is because we're going to be staging these out over the course of ten yearseah. The whole idea is that if we were to issue all 300 million yesterday we couldn't maintain that dollar 20 would work capacity wise. So we're planning hundred million just yesterday, 100 million another three years and 100,000,003 years after that to use that 300 million dollar authorization. And the chances of is actually being admin 300 millionllars with the project all at once are pretty, this is pretty much the group doing that work. So yeah, yeah, luckily we'll have a little bit of help. Some contracted services. Yeah. So different committee. Not this committee. There was a bond steering committee that was formed of city councilors. They met several times, had a lot of input from members. We also had online survey, lots of presentations and different committees. Goron can attest to that. Lots of different groups culminating a lot of different ideas that filtered through that syering committee and got us to council. And then they made a couple more changes to the final bo result. The project list that we have front of you today. This is just a little bit about scoring. We can talk about if you're interested since we already have the project selected, we're already voted on. We know what's included. These next slides walk throughh projects I don't know if you guys want to take that level of detail now or kind of want to hear some other updates. In my mind we should wait to do specific projects until we kind of do the overall process stuff. Sure. Also do you I mean are youia generate the layer or. Okay all this stuff. It's on the Cityney website. List out all the projects. There's also a really cool map out there where you can visualize the different locations. So that's it for this presentation'm. Happy to answer any questions. Yes. So the next item is the bond sale update. Talk about, talk about the premiumsh so the way it works when you go to sell a bond, tax exempt bonds a lot of times they're highly sought in the market so you'll actually get a premium for their sale because they're so competitive. So we went to bid on the 9 February we got 13 bids on the taxide and nine bitids on the taxable side real quick. The taxable side is for like an affordable housing library branch where there might be some non public use tax. Gives us a little flexibility on that use so we don't get in trouble. The bids we had modeled a little bit of cushion 4.27% interest rate. We were able to get 3.63% so quite a bit better. The interest rate savings, significant savings. Part of it'the premium so we got $7 million bond premium so we sold $100 million of bonds and we received 107 so we got 7 million extra. I have some ideasations first. Yeah, and that's one of the things we want to talk about here, not that extra 7 million dollarsra. As we looked at different projects cost escalation. You want to just quick rest the issue we had back in December just to make sure they understand where all that is. Sure. So. So in Salem, when you voted or didn't vote for the bomb, you would have seen the language. And there was one sentence missing from it. What basically said is that general obligation bonds are outside of the limits. Measures five and 50 it statutory required and just through it was really a clerical mishap. Didn'get included in the submission to the secretary of state. There's a process for when that happens. Salem went through that process for three weeks. We posted the notice in the paper, let people know and submitted the correct documentation to the Marin county court. They validated that were really authorized to issue the Bos December, January, but it's not as validated. ##s are authorized all issuesolved. So recall that no longer. I just want to make sure everybody on the committee important all know where we're imp yeah, we actually you're going to go that 300 million sold hundred million dollars of Y with authorization. So those bond dollars, we're putting them in segregated cost centers. We're required to invest them separately than the rest of our funding. So we're working with public works, looking at the cash flow. We know what dollars liquid dollars we need right away. We know it's a year out, two years out until the next issue. What we'll do is we'll invest those dollars to maximize the return. And that interest we earn on",

        "text": " versus trying to fill out all the paperwork. And you know what it'like, when it's a federal grant. So I know that would be my second major comment is just make this as easy as possible for any of us who are lucky enough to get some of these dollars. Thank you. Thanks, Janine. Appreciate that. Jennifer. Dolly, we'll work to bring you off mute. There you go. Thank you. I just want to echo the comments of Janine from EWeb in terms of making it simple for small utilities to apply for these grants. And I mentioned some of the issues that I saw with the metrics proposed. And along those lines, maybe something to consider is to allow the utilities to address your objectives in a narrative rather than having strict metrics that we're trying to address in our applications. So anything that makes it simple and that still can achieve your objectives, I think would be something we would really support. Thanks, Jennifer. And if you recall back to the principles that we talked about at the beginning, I forget exactly how we stated it. But yes, making things as simple as possible and as clear as possible is certainly one of our goals. So as you're making comments on these on the narrative, any suggestions you have like that on how to keep it simple for folks would be greatly appreciated. Other questions or comments? All right, Casey Fagan, go ahead. All right, this is Casey Fagan with Tillamc Peudd. Just echoing the emphasis on the smaller utilities. I just finished a four year capital plan and any of the projects I have that are targeting hazard mitigation strategies, you know, the 600,000 limit, it won't fund any of them. The challenge is then I have to go out and get other funding sources. This underground project I mentioned in my comment, over ten years we've been working on this. So now I got a timeline that hinders getting other funding to help a project. So it's going to be very, very difficult for us small utilities to pull everything together in time to meet even a five year timef frme and we don't know where funding'coming from. And you basically have to go out and pick a little bit of fruit here. Hopefully you can get more fruit and then in the end you don't even know if you can do the job. So changing that allocation back to where it was would help. All right, thank you so much for that, Casey. Appreciate the feedback. I see we are at time just a reminder that the portal for submitting public comments will be open through the end of the week, and we look forward to hearing more from folks on this webinar as well as other folks who weren't able to make it. So thanks in advance for your time and thoughtfulness and putting together comments for us to help make sure that the Oregon Department of Energy's program narrative is as strong as possible. And then just a reminder that we will have time, even after we submit our application, to refine our approach before the program actually gets up and running sometime after this summer. So with that, I would see if my colleagues at Odo have any final comments. And if not, really. Again, appreciate your time this morning and look forward to working with you to make our electric grid more resilient. Not seeing anything else? I'll go ahead and wrap us up. And thanks again, everyone.",

We've been working hard to get the message out that there's no horsing around with Marian. One year ago, as part of this campaign, we introduced you to a lovable mascot, rubbish the raccoon. If you remember, rubbish joined us at a board meeting just like this one today, where he came out and was dancing to a rap song, throw it away. Over the last year, rubbish has appeared at over 40 sites to include schools, daycares, businesses, etcetera. He's been the special guest at numerous events where he continues to push the message, there's no horsin around with Marion. Rubbish is just one part of our campaign designed to help change the hearts and minds of the community as it relates to litter. So today, commissioners, I want to ask you in helping me celebrate a one year anniversary of throw it away with rubbish. All right, Marion county, we going little free, hey, Marion we don't want to pay big if you trash man and throw it away. We don't want to hear hey, Marian. It's rubbish again.

        "text": " the following language cautioning the reader at the outset that this Dashro interpretation exercise involves mind numbing detail. Wegin our analysis with the text of ors 406 95045 which Miss Miles just walk you through. So if your minds are numb, there's a reason for that. And the Supreme Court said that's okay. So again, just take some solace in that. I have with me not to forget this, I have Matt Martin from Capital Power with me and he's been very involved in this case. So as you know, this project has been pending for now five years. The the exceptions process has taken about a year. The five years. I'm not blaming at all on the council because in fact we amended the project halfway through to institute a solar facility with the wind energy facility. But it is just what it is. The issues here, in my view, are fundamental state issues and there's a challenge not to the facts of compliance with the Cing standards, but it's a challenge to the fundamental statutes and provisions and binding Oregon Supreme Court authority that unquestionably grants f a comprehensive authority oversighting Oregon energy facilities. So by way of context, in 2004, some of you may know or have known at Sullivan in 2004, I stood next to him in Klamath county arguing whether or not statewide goal findings are an appropriate avenue to resolve conflicting standards. He was my law school professor and it was intimidating standing next to him for about 5 hours in Klamath county hammering out the exceptions. He argued against the meaning of RRS 469.504, specifically arguing against the council applying it through the statewide planning goal framework. There we argued over a somewhat complex statute, and in 2005 we argued the meaning of as 215 or excuse ORS 406 9504 to the Oregon Supreme Court. There, in a unanimous decision concerning how to apply the statute, we established and the Supreme Court established foundational law that now really shapes every FEC proceeding and we have to be able to rely on it. Statewide planning goals are a foundation to Oregon's land use authority. Here, the local setback coordinates cannot bind FSEAC because it is not based on or required by statewide planning goals. You've heard that many times a day in many different ways. With the state rural Oregon case. We do have law and it is unambiguous and it does provide you this authority under the statewide planning goals. In nearly all of the county's exception arguments, the flaw is the same. The county simply disagrees with the law and the county disregards as burden to prove that the setback is required under statewide planning goals. Instead, we have a pretty confusing and redundant series of arguments that are not based on plain, unambiguous statutory Supreme Court authority. Hence, this is kind of an extension of further mind numbing detail that was forecasted in the Soro case. But as Miss Mileage has indicated, I just want to reiterate this. We are lucky to have Supreme Court authority. We are lucky to have a foundation of regulatory background and statutory framework that allows you to make these decisions with some certainty that you're making the right decisions under the law. And I have only 7 seconds left. Thank you. Thank you. Wendy Kellington, representing Yttila county. So the overarching issue here, the most important issue for you to keep in mind, is that there is no way this facility can comply with the goals if it doesn't comply with goal two. And goal two expressly says that state agency actions regarding land use have to be consistent with local land use plans and implementing regulations. There is no way to get to yes, if you faithfully apply the law. The case that you just heard about with regard to Mister Sullivan and Mister McMahon arguing it s ##pre court completely supports the county's position. There is no Oregon Supreme Court on the facts here, where you have a county governing body that sits down, goes through its code, tells you what the standards are, and you're being told to ignore their standards. There is no case on that. What save our rural Oregon was, was the county governing body didn't get around to identifying standards. It's that first scenario. Let's go through very quick what this piece of paper says with regard to those 504 five and the big b standards. There are three scenarios. One starts out and says if the special advisory committee doesn't recommend blah blah blah, then the council can apply the one b or c rule that says you get to ignore the county's code if you want to.

        "text": ". Sherwood west will need to annex. So there's something around annexation that I think maybe prime. One of the things that caused me as the developer a little bit of consternation was not being I had to annex before anything else, before city of Sheorewood, say, could sign off on a traffic study or utility study or even have a pre app, things like that. So maybe there's some flexibility in sort of the sequence and we can get a unofficial quote unquote, look at some things before annexation. What would be an idea around that? I've come across that in other states where they have pre annexation approaches, and I don't know if you can do that in Oregon. I'm too young in Oregon. Well, yeah, you can do an annexation. Yeah, you can do a development agreement around annexation, agreement that sort of lays it all out and allows you to get going. And we've done that elsewhere. I have a thought about annexation too, I can mention. So whether that is certainly one factor is what it's required to be done and how much progress you can make. But also just the ease of annexation really varies really widely across the region. So some jurisdictions you have to submit a whole application with a whole narrative and have your consultant do all this stuff. It takes long time, and in others it's literally a one page form with just the property owner's information and signature is needed. And that's Happy Valley, which is really pro annexation and has been doing a lot of annexation. So you could look at the code and procedures now. I think it still takes. No, I think it's only one hearing. So it not. It's still not going to be overnight. But if the process is a lower barrier, then you might have property owners saying, oh, I could annex and get zoned industrial pretty easily and then I could sell my property for more money and get that site ready earlier. Yeah, that's a great point, Susannah. And I don't even know from a policy legal perspective, can you annex a property without the property owner's consent? No pro. Probably not. Nike. Yeah. No, true. You can try to loop them though. That's what they tried with Nike. Right. You can encircle them somehow. Yeah. That still doesn't always work. Tektronics is another one. Yeah. So what other issues are you seeing that maybe should be the focus in terms of some of the recommendations that we might want to make in this report? Just based on experience? I mean, I'm not going to call on people, but I know Colin has been very involved in economic development. Maybe I am economic development for many years and has seen some best practices and, and maybe there's some things that Colin might be able to suggest. Nick from Greater Portland, I'm just throwing out some names here. Nick from Greater Portland, what he's seeing because he's working to recruit traded sector companies to our region, to the metro area, and certainly sees what they do in other states in terms of encouraging the growth of traded sector and manufacturing and in tech companies, you don't, who do you want to do it publicly? If you don't want to, you can o no, I'm happy. I mean, do you want me to go first? Yeah, you can go first. Colin. Sorry. Yeah. I mean, as far as the framework for everything that's here, I think it looks fine. I think, you know, like everything, like hairstyles and jeans, everything's trendy. Things change over the decades. We all know. We see these trends in our regional economy. And that goes for manufacturing too. There's different types of manufacturing right now. There's a continued trend into North America for near shoring or rear ##ing reshoring, but also near shoring, moving some things to Mexico that were in China and then building more of a localizing that supply chain. So I think my perspective is having some larger parcels. And by large, I don't mean 500 acres, I mean, you know, 50 or 80 or 100, but having some larger parcels where you can have tech diverse tech parks, I think are always a great thing as our economy changes and more morphs, where there are many, where it's dense. As far as, I'm not talking about high rises or anything, but I just meannt, you know, jobs packed into sites in whatever sense that makes. But I think adaptability as the economy shifts, as we have growth around the renewable sectors, things around manufacturing for tied to EV's, lithium ion batteries and future technologies, hydrogen technologies, etcetera. I'm not talking about a science fiction novel, but just saying as long as you'as. Long as the goals and the zoning allow for flexibility to capture future growth, that's very key. And then the other, you know, I guess I'll go back to the personal",

        "text": " a longer life than it had in the past, we extended the sunset the length of the program and legislation. So they'they're, really not going anywhere. But that boom and bust thing could be problematic and has been in the past. So that's, I think, part of what people are thinking about. And then, Frankie, you can go ahead and respond to Laura and then I have a question in the chat next. Well, thank you so much, Laura. That does make sense. And in fact, I can see how that would benefit someone like me in that I might actually have a chance to use the rebate. It sounds like in the past a lot of people maybe wanted to use a rebate, but because of the cliff, ran out just to follow up on that history. Like in the past, how many non LMI signed up when just kind of. I'm trying to get gauge the rate at which the money was or the offer was taken. And now that give sor. It'kind of a complicated question. So there was a set amount of money in the past. I'm wondering how fast it ran out, given and how many residential customers served. And then now with more funding, what is the foreast of forecast, the number of residential customers who will be able to take advantage of this program? Non LMI, I'm not sure we can pull that information fast enough to answer on the webinar, but I think you have to sign up with your email address to get on. So we could follow up with you on that if you'd like. We have information where we could like show how much money total, but we'd have to like look back at like a timeline and then we. It depends on how long the money will last based on what the rebate amounts are like, which is something we're pondering with the rule change. Right, right, right, yeah. I'd totally be interested in that information. Co. But, but yeah, and I understand that that's hard to get right now. Cool, thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We have like the numbers, but we'd have to like crunch them to specifically answer that. So, um. So we'll have to follow up with you. And then the question in the chat was, is there a required amount of storage per amount of solar installed? And just to say one thing to be clear about is you are not required to have storage as part of a solar pv system under this program. But if you were to add storage, James, are there any minimum amounts that are required? Yeah. So if you choose to install storage with the solar, then the system must include a minimum of 1 kw dc of solar electric capacity for every five kilowatt hours of battery storage. Yah. The contractor will be able to kind of figure out what that means for your system. But there is like a minimum requirement in the program rules. Hopefully that answers Nancy's question. And with that, I don't see any other hands up or any other comments in the chat for us to take up today. So we could perhaps move on to that last slide. I know it's a little early, but before we move on, I'just like to mention that if people are finding have questions come up or comments on these roles after today, please drop me an email and we will be having another webinar in October, on October sevent as well. And if memory serves, I think our plan is that we'll incorporate any of the comments we've gotten so far into sort of our thinking that will present. So if you were to come to the webinar in October, you might find us having a different thing that we've now added or something we've tweaked or changed from this original one based on feedback received. Yeah, we're hearing a lot of strong information from stakeholders that this isn't a good idea, this is a good idea. Or maybe there's another thing that people are like this should be included in a rule change, then they may be kind of adding to that discussion in the next next webinar. Thanks Christy. I'll move on. And so this is really just a thank you all for attending today. And if you have any questions about the program or wish to learn more, you can visit the program's website and these slides will be up and you'll be able to click on that URL link from the slides or you can ask program staff. The team's email address is on the screen so this will take you to the teams mailbox is be the quickest way to get a response and Dale and Kayie will be looking at those responses. And so unless there's any other questions or comments coming in, I wish you all a lovely rest of your day and thank you for coming. I'll just acknowledge Angel, Angela and Frankie's comments here at the end. Got it? Noted. And we'll go ahead and stick around for a couple minutes in case anybody would like to say anything else. And then but folks",

        "text": " of my comments from the red line that was submitted to you by Tom at the last meeting and I am highlighting errors. I found and used artificial intelligence to compare the rules and presented errors in what I thought were error'in, the rulaking that never surfaced. So I don't think your rulemaking process is as public driven as you may think, because staff synthesize what people say and give it to you. I have to send what I said to you directly. Hope you see it and read it to fully understand some of the concerns in the public comments. So that's my two cent as a RAC member. I just want to jump quickly to fujiian maps, because with the maps we were having problems. Imagine a landowner trying to look at your maps and they're all one dimensional paper and look at the agricultural, the grazing, the geological, the protected areas, and what to see. How does their property comply with your oarss? They have to take pieces of paper and sort it out at different scale. The developer, the applicant and staff have a GIS program that has all these mapbook, all these layers that are transparent, that can be turned on and off. We do not have that ability. So we are at a distinct disadvantage. And we're goingn need time to work with Kellen to get this information in a form that we can all use. And to be fair, Kellen has been great. She sent the GIS file. I don't have a fancy program, but she went back to Tetra Tech and had them break it down into a KMZ program that can be loaded into Google Earth Pro, which is a free program. So I have the maps with the new boundaries and all that. I am out in the field with the landowners showing them this stuff. But I do not have the grazing layers, I do not have the Dami layers. I don't have those things. So the public does not have those things. So how can they respond responsibly to the oarss to determine is the site certificate meeting the standards or not? And they don't have that ability yet you do. Google Earth can be put on the web with all the details. Your maps that you have up on the website are good, but they're not granular. And they don't have the map sets on them. So the public doesn't really know what's being done on their land. So if you come down to negotiations for price, they don't know what they got. Do they have an artifact on the land? They haven't seen the tetrateh report or they don't have the layer. So there's lots of things that we need to sort through in order to know do we have enough information to properly respond to the DPO. So that's my two cent and I thank you for your time. Thank you for your comments. Mister Quider, do you have anyone else? Nancy, we do have a call in user with their hand up. Your number begins with 541805. I'm gonna unmute your mic and you are ready to comment. Well, I thought I was. Okay, I'm trying to unmute your mic, so don't touch any buttons. All right, you are unmuted. Could the caller please state your name and address? Maybe it looks like they've lowered their hand. Okay, so anyone else in the room wish to provide public comment? None there, no one on the phone and no one on the webinar. Okay, hold on. I think I have hands popping up now. Do a last call here. No, we have, we do have more now. It looks like that calling user has raised their hand again. All right, so you are unmuted call and user. If you want to go ahead and make your comment, could the call in person wishing to testify. Can you hear provide your name and the address. We can hear you. Irene. Okay. Irene Jilbert, 23 ten Adams Avenue, Lagrant, Oregon or. Okay. Yes. All right. I just want to do number one, support the comments about the need web. I'm getting a lot of feedback. I don't know why I'm not on speaker. But anyway, I wanted to state that the request for an extension of time. I support that. I also wanted to make a couple of different comments. One is regarding the racks and there was some discussion about trying to get new people or more people involved. My comment is that rulaking is a legal process with statutes that define limits and opportunities regarding rules. The rules are complex and without experience with applying the existing rules. It's really difficult to identify what is lacking, how rules are being interpreted, and how changes likely will be implemented. The impacts are often subtle, the time commitment is significant and it can be a frustrating process for the public due to a perceived lack of influence in the final product. So are you getting as much feedback as I am? No",

        "text": " So they basically did a test. They kind of walked away and left, literally, the key and the ignition. So the reactor did not meet the definition of reactor secured as a result of that action. So the license operator then left the control room, securing the door on their way out at 12:00 p.m. so this started at 11:43 a.m. basically 17 minutes later, a licensed senior reactor operator entered the control room, found the key in the console with the switch in the operate position. They turned the switch off, secured the key, log, the action, notified the director. So throughout the duration of the event, all the control rods were fully inserted. So we don't spend much time really talking about the Oregon State University or the Reed College research reactors. So these are small research reactors, but they are t nuclear reactors. And the read one particularly, is largely run by students. So obviously, there are, you know, senior people who have oversight over that, but there's a lot of work that's done by the actual students in that program. So the Oregon Department of Energy, on behalf of the Energy Facility siting Council, was not timely notified per OAR 304 5030-0010, sub two, which requires prompt notification by telephone of the occurrence of any incident or condition relating to the operation of the reactor that could have prevented a nuclear system from performing its safety functions as described in the technical specification. So they basically should let us know what happened. So Max woods, who most of you know pretty well, who is now the assistant director for nuclear safety and emergency preparedness, he has been in contact with the Nuclear Regulatory commission. They were timely notified of this incident. So while we were not, they were, per council's rules, if there is a follow up report to the Nuclear Regulatory commission, then FSEEC will receive a copy of that report. So very likely read, we'll create a report, send it to NRC, and then we will get a copy of that, and then we will provide that to you. So right now, well, in the near future, we've requested that Max reach out to the Reed College staff to set up a meeting to have a conversation about what those protocols should or shouldn't be to make sure that we do receive proper notification if there is a future incident question. This is vice chair k. So timely. So what did they just not national regulatory Commission in lieu of us and just, we were forgotten in the, I believe we were just forgotten it. So, you know, it's obviously the nuclear regulatory Commission. You know, if there are nuclear facilities, you know, have staff, there's a lot of, I think, connection between these facilities and the nuclear regulatory commission. You know, they have most of the oversight, but there is a site certificate. There is that requirement so mean, I can't say what, why we weren't notified. That's a requirement. They should have done it. So that's why we just want to make sure we have a meeting with them and kind of go over, remind them you have a site certificate. There are these administrative rules which require you to do certain things. And the council does have some oversight, not as much as the nuclear regulatory commission or should we? But being, you know, at the state level, I think that's, it's appropriate. It was deemed to be appropriate a long time ago and they need to be adhering to those requirements. What is the prompt? Just as soon as, yeah, you know, we have some that'say, 72 hours or other specified. The language of this one, I think is literally just prompt notification by telephone. So thank you. All right, moving on to legislative updates. So the short session finished and I've given updates on a couple or a few bills. So I'll give the final version of those bills. So House Bill 40 115 would define or did define battery energy storage systems in e sec definitional statutes. So they still didn't create a regulatory path either at the state level or the local level. I guess it did some degree created at the state level, but this is for standalone battery storage systems which are not f sector jurisdictional. They weren't before and they aren't now. What the build did is it defined it in what a battery energy storage system is and then it creates an opt in by developers. There's currently for other facilities that are less than f sector jusdictional. There is option for the developers to opt to FSEEC. There are also options for the local governments to defer to FSEEC after consultation with the developer. So that's what the bill did. I think there's a likelihood moving forward that there are going to be standalone battery energy storage systems. Council has reviewed. I just pulled the numbers recently about four gigawatts of battery energy stor active battery energy storage systems. Right now, these are",

Yes, in the notice of intent, they've already done that evaluation based on these distances in the notice of intent. Nope, you're fine. So that's already been done. But the importance of this is when they submit their application, they have to do an evaluation of these same resources. And it's called an analysis area. It's a different sort of term, but it's the same thing. And if we can either expand those or shrink those. So what we say in the project order is you, the applicant, have to go out and do these studies. But some of these are going to be on site studies. So if there is an issue of historic and cultural and archaeological resources they may have to do in ground studies, fish and wildlife, they have to do field studies. So what are the distances of those? It could by default be the same things, but they could increase or decrease. So if, say, for example, you know of a scenic resource that's really important, that's 10.5 miles away that you think is going toa be impacted by this facility, we want to hear about that because we might be able to change then the analysis area that they have to do in their application to go 10.5 miles out. Or if we look at the notice of intent and there's nothing out there, we may shrink it down. So be thinking about that in terms of your comments during the notice of intent, if you are aware of any resources that are beyond these distances that you think are important. Next slide, please. So land use is a big kind of deal. Again, our process is a consolidated review. Most state agencies, local governments, their permits, their requirements get folded into our process. Land use. The applicant has the ability to make a choice. So they can choose to go to Lynn county and have Lyn county run the conditional use permit, or they can choose the energy facility siting council. Because our process is a consolidated review, every applicant so far that in our history has chose that as a consolidated. They bring it to Fseec, but it's their choice. In their notice of intent, they have indicated that they will have the land use reviewed by the energy facility siting council. They can make that choice. They can change that choice up until the time they submit their application. So that's still their choice to make until they submit the application. If Lynn county does it, then their final decision will fold into our process a little bit later on. If they continue with their election right now, then we will review the land use requirements and we will work with Lynn county to seek their input on if they were going to conduct the review. What are the requirements? If there's anything that's unclear, how they would interpret it and if they would issue conditions. What kind of conditions? So we want to seek their input on this as well. Next slide, please. Okay, I'm going to turn it back over to chase. Nancy, could you skip ahead to the applicants slides, please? All right, I'm gonna make one more announce because I know some more people come in. So we had a lot more people show up than we thought. We recognize you're coming in probably still early than what you thought, but late from the starting. If later on, once we're done with this, you want us to restart this? We'll restart this whole presentation with fewer people in. So can either stick around, you know, kind of catch the rest of this, or come back in a little while and we will restart this thing all over again. Yes. I'm sorry. I should have made that announcement earlier. This is being recorded, so if anybody wants to watch this, we will post it onto the project website. If you know of anybody who was not able to make it tonight, you can point them to the project website. Likely it'll be tomorrow, but it could be a day or two before it gets posted. But yes, the entire thing will be posted on the website. Yes, it is Webex. It is. People can phone in, people can participate. I don't know how many people are participating remotely, but yes. Okay. And with that, we'll hand it over to the applicant for their slides. Good evening, everyone. My name is Paul Hicks. I work with Tetra Tech Engineering. While I am not the applicant, I work on behalf of. Of the applicant in a few things. One is working on developing the application for site certificate that's being discussed tonight. The other is supporting and doing the environmental survey work that's being done for the project and other aspects that might support permitting for the project. So that's my role. Our role is Tetra Tech. And appreciate your time this",

        "text": " virtually who has comments, please keep adding them. You know, we will find ways to, to get to them as we move forward. Okay. Yes, we can move this along and go to that next slide. You know, we talk a little bit about the, how the process works and the review process. And so what we have here is a kind of a schematic of the methods of award that we plan to use. And this process flow is very similar to the Community Renewable energy grant program that we already have running it. Photo and our hope was that that would make it easier for participants and for us to have a familiar process. And so essentially we have an application period in which you all submit an application and we review it both for eligibility and through a competitive review process that leads us to the performance agreement. And again, we hope to really streamline all of the federal requirements within that referral agreement so that reporting and things like that are very clear at that point. Then we move into the construction phase, and we will have reporting and invoicing week that occurs during those up to four years of construction. And then finally we will close out a project at the end of that period. So this is what we're proposing. And again, this is mirroring our community Renewable energy Plan program, which is a complementary program that can fund the solar and certainly microgrids, things like that. You don do that program as well. So this next slide is just a, you know, throw something out there version of broad categories for selection criteria. And this is pretty close to what we've set up within that community renewables program, where we have a set of criteria that would describe project readiness and technical viability. We need technically sound projects in this program worth about half the the project weight. And then community benefits can bring an additional amount of points into these applications in this example. And then finally, some percentage to health and funds get spread around the state. Some geographic diversity, maybe some technological diversity, although we'heard yesterday that that's not as critical in this program. In the other grant program, we were trying to identify projects that weren't solar projects that tend to get all of the funding. In this one, everyone went out and did polls or fuses. That would be okay. No? So maybe that's not an important criteria. We have a few slides now that look at the criteria that we set up in our other grant program, if we want to look at those as an example. Or we could just launch right into a blank page discussion about how we want to set up criteria in this program. But the end goal is for us to identify, you know, features that can be described in an application that will help the best projects rise to the top in our competitive review. So that's what we're really aiming for now, is creating these selection criteria and weightiting the points for how to score that in the process. So maybe we'll just put it into the room and online if we want to look at some of the criteria that we've got in our other program, to plant a seed or you'd rather just DMP into a discussion even what it'fine. Sure. So some of the folks participating virtually would like to see what some of the ideas are. So maybe we can walk through those slides. Okay, so we'll go through our criteria table from the CrAAP program. These are not what we're proposing for this program. Potentially there will be overlap, but again, this is I trying to identify renewable energy and microgrid projects. So they are inherently different. But this is kind of the technical vibility set of criteria that we have here in that program. Strength of the project team, strength of the project operation plan. How well is the project described getting the application so that we get a good understanding exactly what's proposed to be built. Financial plan, obviously bringing some share of the funds through these, you know, the federal funding, but there's the match requirements. So we would like to see how the project staffacks up and is something that can actually be constructed in this program. We have statutory limitations to start within twelve and complete within three years. U we may have a similar criteria that says, prove to us that you can complete this in 40 years to demonstrate that this is a viable project in the program. So moving on, here are some community attributes in that program that sum up for a total of ten points and competitive review process. We have a, a competitive review team made up of auto staff and some external partners that are able to weigh some of these things. So again, this is focused on renewable energy and energy resilience projects. So these might not perfectly trans vation in community, community serve project leadership, maybe outside of the utility. How are the utility, our community partners brought into the project to ensure that, um, know, maybe it's the county or the local town to bring them into the discussion",

        "text": " guy is a land use planning consultant. The other person is a culture and heritage department director. Another one is a owner of a real estate, among other different things, and an industrial commercial property manager. Another one is a board member I thought was really interesting with Salem Electric. And the last one is a retired community development director. I find that kind of air string. These are guys of people, along with your administrative rules that make the decisions. And I find that difficult to swallow. Based on what I've seen here tonight, I hope you have plan b. Is there anybody else in the room who would like to speak before we go to the phones? Okay. Okay. Yeah, real quick. But I want to give people on the phone so that it's a big deal. And it sounds pretty hippie, but what about the light pollution during nighttime? We already have enough with all the big towns and I don't. Is there noise with these things moving around? That's going to get all. Well, yeah, so is. Okay. Lots of questions there. I can answer a couple of them. So the noise question. There are noise producing elements. So obviously, solar panels don't create noise, but the electrical lines, the inverters, the transformers, the batteries, because they have cooling units, all create noise. We have a noise standard where we evaluate those. Not during construction constructions exempt, but those have to meet certain timeframes within the day in order to minimize impacts, you know, to adjacent uses. But in terms of the noise during operation, that absolutely will be evaluated. I forget the second question. Oh, light pollution. That's going to be also something we look at. We do not have any particular standard on that, but the county may, and I don't know if that's the case or not. So some counties do have shielding and hooding requirements so that they don't create night pollution. The solar panels obviously won't, but there could be security lights around there. So I'm not familiar yet with the Lynn county land use requirements. Obviously the applicant has heard that question already. So if they propose shielding and hooding on their own, even if there is no standard, that would be something that they could do. Okay, I think we're going to go to the phones now. I know. Okay, one more in. My name is Arnie Campor. I live directly across the road from this proposed project. And besides being completely objective to it, I was opposed to it. What kind of fence do you build around one of these areas? The standard is 6ft chain link with 1ft barb. But that's also dictated by Lynn county and whatever they require us to use. And so there would be a six foot chain link fence around the entire perimeter of this, is that what you're saying? For whatever is considered project within the fence area, it could be a six foot plus one is what we call it. Or it could be a seven foot chain link fence. And then if the locale requires us to do some type of vegetation buffer screening, then that's something we would do. How large a buffer area would you have around there for fire prevention? Typically we design these projects with a 20 foot buffer from the panel to the fence. Is that dis up annually or how do you prepare that to avoid fire in that buffer zone? That would be with the operation, maintenance to maintain the inside of the site to make sure it's clean. Okay, but how do they do that for this particular project? That's to be determined just because we are proposing sheep grazing. So that would have to be part of that agreement. And if there's anything else needed that can't be controlled by vegetation clearing from that, then that's something that would have be worked out. So it's a little bit too early to say so this has been mentioned earlier, but the enormous amount of elk in that area that migrate through there on a very, on a bases, a regular basis, maybe monthly or so. And this fence is going to deter those animals from going around that project? Is that the intent of it is to keep things fenced out of there also a little bit to the fence? So part of the fence is a requirement for national electric structural standards for. Because it's an energy facility. U there are other needs for it to, yes, keep, you know, large game out of that internal the project area. At this point it's not u it's more about the security. It's less about, you know, big game and those are things that also, there's ongoing discussions with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife that will be engaged in throughout this permitting process to determine, you know, like fence design and those kind of things. So there's. It's too soon to say, but the project will likely need to have offense for security reasons. And then it's a means of trying to accommodate that. The best possible way to make it",

        "text": " again, what their thought was at the time, in 1981. Now the legislature could come back at a future date and there could be a proliferation of hydrogen electrolyzers. And, you know, we see all kinds of issues and concerns and the legislature may say, no, that's a significant thing. We think that should be within f sector jurisdiction. That's a policy decision. This is not what you're being asked today. You're being asked to interpret language that was established in 1981 that's now applying to something that really wasn't anticipated in 1981. Next slide, please. So with that, that kind of gets to the, you know, staff's recommendation. So, know, we've evaluated this and, again, not whether it should or shouldn't be is whether we believe it is based upon the language. And our recommendation is, again, by themselves, we do not believe. Based on our research, you know, of the history, the context and then comparing the relative technologies, we do not believe. And we recommend that the hydrogen electrolyzer does not constitute a synthetic fuel plant as that is defined or is that as part of the definition of an energy facility in statute? So unless you have additional questions, we can step away and allow for public comment. Ok. Okay. Anyone in the room interested in making comment? Okay, Nancy, any webinar or phone interest and commenting? Wow. That's all right. I do not see any hands raised at this time, but let me go ahead and remind everybody online how you would make a comment if you wanted to do so. If you participating on the webinar, at the bottom of the main screen there's a set of icons. Click on the participant and at the bottom of that window is a hand icon. Click on that hand that will raise your hand and when you're finished commenting, you can click it again to lower it. If you are participating on the phone, press star three on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and star three again when you're finished with your comments. ##its there are no hands raised at this time. Okay, I think we can close the public comment. And next slide, please back to, so getting back to the, you know what your options are. Option one, as I just articulated in our recommendation, option two would be the same as option one, but with some additional thought or context or evaluation that council wanted to include on the record. And then the third option would be that you actually do believe that a hydrogen facility by itself does constitute a synthetic fuel plant as that's defined or included in the definition of energy facility. And then you would need to provide your reasoning and justification for that. Okay, any discussion. Councilloor Condon, thank you. Sunindy condon, I just want to be clear. This kind of comes from my background a little bit. This council would have no jurisdiction over a petroleum refinery, correct? Well, I don't want to say correct. I would say I would have to go look at the rule or the statute to see if a petroleum refinery would fall within, you know, the definition of an energy facility. So I'm not sure of that. O the practical kind of reality is, you know, there's no petroleum refineries in Oregon. So all of our, all of our petroleum comes in from out of state? Not your question, but yeah. Well, and the reason I ask the question is a petroleum refinery creates the product that this is doing the same, doesn't produce electricity. We don't know what the hydrogen is going to be used for or the oxygen. And so in my mind, I struggled with this, actually, but in my mind it came down to that, that we don't have jurisdiction, or I don't believe we have jurisdiction over our petroleum or would have jurisdiction over a petroleum refinery for the production of fossil fuels. So I view it similar to that. Thank you. Any other comments or questions? Do we have a motion, councilr? Great, thank you. For the record, this is Marcy Grail. Mister chair, I move that the council determine a hydrogen electrolyzer by itself does not constitute an energy facility as described in ors four six, 9311 f for the reason present it and recommended by staff. Do we have 2nd? 2nd. Thank you, counselor Devlin. So we've got a motion in a second. Secretary Estherson, could you please call the ro. Marcy Grail? Yes. Cindy Condon? Yes. Kent how. Yes. Katie is yes. Perry Choctute? Yes. Ann Byer? Yes. Richard Devlin? Yes. Motion carries, mister chair. Thank you. That was very interesting. I think it's just interesting now that you, we're seeing different technologies and the proliferation of different technologies, and the reality is the rules and statutes just havingn't contemplated like battery energy storage systems, you",

        "text": " more coordination. I'm kind of speaking to you from an old orientation from the Northwest Power and Conservation council. We shouldn't expect always that the energy that's being produced here is going to be utilized here in this state or that our utilities are not going to, in many cases, use resources from this region and even from other regions. I mean, it's the very nature of energy markets right now. They're expected to become even more fluid than they already are. They'll probably be more coordinated than they already are in the future, and that's probably to the benefit of our consumers in the state. Thank you. Bett Comments Member Golin? Well, if there are no further questions, we thank you for your time. We appreciate your efforts in keeping everything on track for the department. This is long session is rough for folks in your position, so thank you for your work. Thank you. Thank you, members. We'll see you soone, probably at least for a wrap up. I suspect u it is time for a break if everyone would like one, which I think is a splendid idea. It's u, it's 1037. So if we could take a ten minute break, that would be great. If we could regroup it. 1047, I know that's awkward, but we're going to go with it. So we'll see everyone back in. 1047, thank you. Now, 1050, we have graciously gone over by a couple of minutes, so we are ready to resume our meeting with the next agenda item, which is the Oregon Trail solar facility final order on request for amendment one of the site certificate. This is an action item and we have senior sing analyst Kathleen slow ready to present. Yes, sir. Just really quickly, before Kate begins. So normally, you know, we have an in person meeting for a big agenda item. We would be in person. Kate was intending to be here today in person. She woke up with ice o over her driveway and unable to safely leave her house. So I just wanted to clarify that's why she's participated remotely today rather than in person. Thank you. And I do know that staff has been great about that. That seems to be the directive that is possible. So thank you. We do not need anyone having an accident to, to join us. So, u Kate, I just would remind you, please, that we have several council members remotely, so if periodically, you could just identify what slide you're on to help them find it. They're not going toa be looking at the screen, they'll be looking at the slides themselves. So if you could do that, that would be awesome. Okay, well, right. Thank you, chair Grail and members of council. And I do apologize for not being there in person today. We got a bit of a what call a wint Rem mix last night, and this morning we've had like five different kinds of weather. So I appreciate being able to participate and present to you remotely. So with no further ado, I will launch into agenda item d, which again is council's review and possible decision on request for a moment, one of the Oregon Trail solar facility. And just real quickly, presentation overview. I'm going to do a little bit of a refresher on the facility itself and the site certificate history, the request for the amendment and proposed changes. Council reviewed this in January. At the meeting in comeon, we received comments on the draft proposed order of the public hearing and also from council. So we'll go through that real briefly, and then I'm going to review the proposed order and our staff recommendation to approve is the final order. Then at the end, council habits opportunity to deliberate and possibly make a decision. So, Oregon Trail Solar is an operational facility. It is approved for a combined 41 generating power combination of wind and solar that is not yet constructed, and it also has a shared battery storage with the neighboring Montage solar. So, Oregon Trail Solar facility site certificate originated out of amendment number five, the Montau Wind facility site certificate, which splits that Montag wind into three separate site certificates. And that happened in 2020. So today, RFA and our proposed order are specific to the Oregon Trail solar facility. So this map just shows the site boundary and the approved microsiding corridor for the facility. The microsite and corrid kind of has two comp. One was the approved wind component that fits inside the Oregon Trail solar boundary, and the other piece was this 1228 acres that was approved with the creation of the site certificate for Oregon Trail solar for a approved microsiding boundary, and for RFA one. It's important to note that the certificate holder committed that the footprint for the solar should not exceed 400 acres within that 1228 acres already approved for solar. And this slide is just a real quick procedural history on the RFA was filed originally in August of 2022. We",

So then for sharing, since it has to go to the county to pull the plan together, it's just putting that resource requirement that need on the county's lap. And so it puts us in a place of having to navigate that in our respective counties. So just trying to share that for awareness and the difficulty for us at a county level, for sure. Feedback. Yeah. Excellent. And then one more question about Melinda from Harney county says, how would we go about getting the energy map from our utilities? I just asked my power supplier about getting the map, and I was told they do not give out that map for security reasons. Yeah. So I would say questions like that. Melinda, I know we've been in touch over email, so I'll just follow up with you and we can try to have a conversation. And I can talk to some folks at Odo and think about how we can help facilitate those conversations, potentially talking to our colleagues at Energy Trust of Oregon. So I think that's kind of a one on one conversation to figure out what that looks like. But certainly if you run into a barrier like that, we want to be a resource and do the best we can to help navigate those conversations and find avenues for you to get the information that you need. And just in terms of feedback, I also do you know, if you, if your county doesn't end up participating in this program, I do have in mind to reach out and get some more feedback closer to when we're going to report out to the legislature. Just to make sure. I want you to know that we're hearing you and we really care about your insight and your feedback so we can, you know, help move forward on this. Great work. So I guess with that, this is our final page with our contact information for the program. You have the website. Thank you so much for your time today. Really appreciate you being here and sharing. Please follow up with me if you have further questions, there's anything I can do for assistance. Thanks to Sarah for facilitating, Max for presenting our other Odo staff for being here.

        "text": " that evidence, to demonstrate that they meet that standard. It's our job as the Cing provision to evaluate that evidence. And that's part of what we're consulting with our reviewing agencies on studies that have been conducted at the application phase. And then we make those recommendations in our gradicalosed order to our council, the energy facilities, sititing council, and they are the ones who ultimately evaluate all of the information in the record to decide whether or not to point it a site certificate. Because we're at the notice of intent phase, we're really seeking any type of comment that anyone wants to provide. But it's important to note because I said we are a standards based process. If you want to comment, particularly on the DrAF proposed order, focusing your comments to relate to our standards is very important. So if you're making a comment or you have a concern, it is most effective. It'the best way for our council to evaluate it is to link it to one of our standards. So if you're worried about fish and wildlife habitat, link it to our fish and wildlife habitat standard. And that's how our council looks at the information that's provided. And so it's just a really important part of our process. Next slide. Bad. Okay, so at the notice of 10th phase, the applicant is required to do a desktop assessment of what we call study areas. And the study areas are basically set by statute. And it's for them to go out and do like what we call a desktop, which is what is the available information out there in the universe that applies to this standard? And each of our standards has a slightly different or. But there's different reasons why we have these study areas in the notice of time. And so the notice of the times that the applicant submitted was required to do the desktop analysis for all of these. So as you can see, there's 20 miles, steady area areas. Things like the cultural tend to be limited to the actual site boundary. And I'll get to the site boundary a minute. Fish and wildlife has a half mile. An endangered species is 5 miles. And one of the things that we're looking for input on at the NOI phase, there'a reviewing agency or the public is what you pick up. What should the analysis areas be? Oftentimes they'the same as this, but they can also change. So if you think that the analysis area should be, does it t need to be that big or it should be bigger? This is a really important part of our process, particularly with our reviewing agencies, of getting that input on. You know, does this make sense? Does it need to be bigger? There something we're not seeing here? And it's just at that NOI comment phase. This is one of the things that we're really trying to dial in because in the project order that I prepare, I'm going to identify the required analysis areas for the application. And they may be the same, slightly modified, be different. So if you have thoughts or concerns about potential impacts of a project to these resources, then please be sure to put those in their comments and what you think those analysis areas should be. And then just land use is a complicated topic. But just so you know, the state citing process is what we call it consolidated with review. And it pulls in most of the perm and requirements from local governments and state agenc cities that would, that would otherwise apply through those different. It's to simplify the permitting process so the requirements are still there, but it runs through one process of review and that's why we call it consolidated review for land use. The applicant has an option to have the land use review be conducted by the local government or to have it in the consolidated state review. I believe in the notice. I mnna time to applicant has indicated that the local land use requirements for WaSO and Sherman counties they're gonna opt into utilizing the consolidated state review process. The how can choose to do the local review but at the time they submit their application, they have to lock it in. They can't change their mind later if they say they wanted to do local review or state consolidated review in the application. Right now you know they're not locke in but once they put in the application, they can't change it. So just a really quick next slide. Next. I'm sorry the proposed facility location is that black outline. And just to give you an idea of where it is, what's in proximity, and like I said, it's approximately 12.6 sq mi of private land. And from what I understand, the only portion of the facility that would actually extend into Sherman county is that transmission line. Should it move in there because it's right up against the border. That's correct. The site facility is not is purely within Wasco. One of the proposed interconnection points is that line you see extending north that goes the Sherman county. And that's an option? If they have one of two options,",

        "text": " I have a few comments, and I'd like to know, if this is built, where's the energy going? Is it going to stay in Ling county? Well, it would stay within the valley. It would stay within Willamette Valley, powering approximately 34,000 homes wherever the generation needed. Well, and I would like to see this. If you got to build it, I would like to see it built closer to Portland or Eugene. I mean, they would love y'all, I'm sure. Okay. And the impact on wildlife, that was my question. And where will the trash go? I mean, are these solar cells for the 40 years? Is that their life? So we say project life is 40 years, right? 40 years doesn't mean that one. It's 40. It's gone. So part of the decommissioning process is the assurance of proper recycling of the panels and all the infrastructure. They can be recycled. They can be recycled. Okay. Yeah. I know what minerals are going to be min for these solar cells. That's something that I personally don't know. Okay. But that's something we could definitely dig into. And that's our module manufacturer. Okay, so you don't know where the minerals are going to come from or. We mine silica for the panels in the state of Washington. Not cobalt? Not too sure. Okay. Yeah, sorry, that's not my division. Okay, well, if you do, and most electric cars use a lot of cobalt. And I guess everybody probably knows that it's mined in the Democrat Republic of Congo. And this is mined by little five year old children and slaves. So yeah, I think that's terrible. And I know Patrick said he really supports, see, electric cars, but that is where it cost more energy to make those electric cars. You know, that it does the gas and. Yeah, yeah. And I think this probably will take more energy to produce these cells than it's going to put out. And also, I'd like to know, subsidized. Is this being subsidized by the federal government or the state government? Noay, we fund this project ourselves. There are things like tax credits, but outside of that you're not receiving anything. Well, tax credits are a. Subsidies. Tax credits are all the people in this room. Yeah, that's. Taxes are from us. And also, why haven't you come? I mean, I just learned about this about a week and a half ago. Why haven't you come? Since this is so close to Brownsville, why haven't you come to the city council meeting with this and talk to us about it? I mean, we were all kind of blindsided by this just like everybody else was. So we've actually been for the last couple of months, if not since November of last year, going to various stakeholders throughout Lynn county and surrounding cities, including the city of Brownsville, to give them a one pageger about our project. Let them know that. Yeah, the one page. Yes. So we've been doing our outreach, trying to get meetings with all the local cities because on top of this process through FSEEC, we are trying to actually host our own town hall meetings in various cities to get more public opinion. So to answer your question, we have been here. You gave one page to our city administrator. Is that what you did? Or. I would have to ask my staff on that. But we did stop by to try to see whom would be the best person to talk to so we could set up a meeting in person. Okay. That is what we've been doing with some other cities around here as well. Okay. I haven't heard anything about it other than what was online. Okay. So when you talked about a bond, is that going to go specifically in a fund for this project, or is this something the st can get their hands on? Because I've known bonds before that ended up not being there when the 40 years are up because everybody forgets that they're there. No, this is a legal requirement. It is specific to the facility, so it doesn't go anywhere other than in my office, and it will stay there as it gets sort of replaced by new bonds. There is no ability by any other entity within the state to utilize this for anything else. Okay. Okay. Thank you. I think that's pretty much all. Oh, why are you not going through the county? Who is? Who is. I've seen you before. I just don't know where. Maybe. Yeah. The process, the reason why it's not going through the county is just based on the acreage of high value farmland. So it's based on a standard. So I know there's a, there is a choice as to whether or not the council can go through, you know, the county's land use review. Right. But because city, the facility",

        "text": " and over a certain acreage as a type two use. They're still working through that. I think that's the best sort of idea, you know, because there's this minimal level of review, and it probably makes sense at a really small scale battery storage project, should have minimal review. But, I mean, we're dealing with ones that are 30, 40 acres in size. You know, that's a lot of land that's consumed by battery, so that probably justifies a higher level of review. They're still working through what those acreages would be. So that's still in process, but I think that's where it's going. The original bill had it really. It was only a type one use, no matter what size. There was no discussion. And then there was an opt in to fseec. So at the end of the last meeting I had, I had requested, you know, I think a type two use justifiably can opt into FSE sec. It's just like a wind facility or solar facility, you know, and if the developer wants to do that, that's fine. But a type one use, I kind of argued, you go from this incredibly minimal review to an F SEC level review, and I said, that's too big of a swing. I don't think that's a legitimate policy. That was what my argument was. We'll see how that moves forward. But that was the last that I had provided information on. Yes. Council. Council buyer. So these statutory changes would be to the land use statute? Yes. Not, thank you. These would just be LCDC statutes, so. And there would be no outright. Something over a certain size is F Sec. We would have no standalone battery storage in Oregon. Revised statute four six 9311, which is the definition of energy facility. It would not add that to your authority, but there would be an opt, again, as I have. Have requested, just a type two. Great. Thank you. Okay. Oh, and then, as part of that working group, I just thought I would share with you, since I pulled all this data from all of our facilities, you know, to kind of show what are we seeing now. And so I'm going to run through this really quickly. You can see the type of different battery systems. There are four different types of battery systems. I think they're just still trying to perfect. What's the best one you can see? You know, our first one was with the natural gas facility, but, you know, most of them have been with either wind, solar, or a combination. They've been part of an original application. They've been split off, you know, from applications. They've been added on through amendments, so varying permutations, you can see the full megawatt. So operational, we have 136 that are currently operational, 100 under construction, 373 approved, but not yet gun construction, 3 mw, or three gigawatts, rather, that are under review as part of another one. And then the 1100 megawatt was the Bonanza facility, which let their notice of intent expire. But they had proposed a very sizable battery storage. So looking at megawatts, you can see the range, six to 1200, with the average of 285 acreage, 0.2 acres. That's the fort westward one for PGE, going up to 90 acres. Again, pretty sizable, you know, with an average of 27. Next slide, please. Sorry. Next. Next slide, please. They're largely. You know, there's two types of sort of ones. They're either done in shipping containers or shipping container type facilities, and you can see the sizes of those to buildings, so there's a lot of variation and then the decommissioning costs that you have put on these for these. These approved facilities. So, you know, 1,000,170 just for battery energy storage. So these are significant. And these aren't just some little one shipping container. These are utility scale things that we're looking at here, and there's gonna be a lot more as we move forward with this state and pretty much the United States and the world with renewable energy. Battery storage is a necessary component. So we will continue to see this. Getting there. So, again, sorry, I'm taking way too long. I'm. Skip the next one. Go to the next slide, please. So, Nancy, reached out to everybody on the 2024 council meeting. Got feedback. I don't need to linger on this just to say I wanted to make sure that everybody saw it. We can share this out with you again if you don't have the particular dates, but these are the 2024 dates. And then lastly, November 17 is our next council meeting. It'll be a one day meeting in Salem in this room. We've",

        "text": " in the regional plan or in one of the state plans. So that's an orange because that's the next milestone for the grant. And then the other next milestone for the grant that I'm discussing with you today is these longer term plans, the comprehensive climate action plans, which are the next deliverable under our grant. Those are an opportunity, finally to identify all the other projects that stand to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our area, whether they were captured already in the plans that we did, or whether they'new ideas and think about how we might line those up for implementation. It's been a quick process, and we've learned a lot. Here's some of the things I want to highlight. This process is really about looking at projects that are implementation ready and effective at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In particular. Implementation readiness has been an important frame in terms of narrowing down what we want to focus on here, because there are a lot of great ideas in the region about how to reduce emissions. Some of them are further along than others. This has been a chance to elevate those at the same time as we review all the plans that we're drawing from to create this one from the local climate action plans really vary widely. That's a barrier to taking the type of collective action that EPA is asking for. The most significant greenhouse gas reduction opportunities are in transportation, residential energy efficiency and waste management. These are areas where the region already does a lot of coordination and where existing climate action plans highlight that local governments are already doing things that can be scaled up with an implementation grant and that work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, no surprise here, but there, even though this is a really significant opportunity, with these upcoming CPRG implementation grants, there isn't enough funding in that or in other pots to support all the climate needs and opportunities we have in the region, especially because individual agencies have to apply to lead grants, and applying for a federal grant takes a lot of work and our agency partners have limited capacity to apply. So in our priority climate action plan, these are the strategies that we're focusing on. I'm not going to walk through these in a lot of detail. I'll say that they contain a lot of transportation related actions, not because transportation is necessarily more important than the other issues, but because that's an area where we already have a lot of coordination. Through tables like WCCCC or like JPAC and TPAC at Metro, we're able to identify transportation actions in a lot of detail. Rather than focusing on this list, which is what's eligible to apply for grant, I'd rather give you an update on what's actually underway and applying for these implementation grants. In February 1, notices of intent to apply were due for implementation grants for CPRG implementation grants. And here's a list of projects that submitted a notice of intent to apply. It includes a TriMet project to electrify buses, TriMet Metro project to redesign signalization on certain high capacity transit quarters and keep buses moving through traffic more quickly. Notice of intent Gresham improved to add composting capacity metro application to fund energy efficiency and affordable housing units that we build through our transit oriented development program. Though it's not shown on this slide because, because there wasn't a notice of intent to apply submitted. I do know that staff in Washington county have been leading an effort in coordination with other counties to explore an application that provides energy efficiency retrofits in publicly managed affordable housing units. So what's next for this process? We're working to finalize this priority climate action plan support and coordinate with our partners in developing these implementation grant applications that are due on April 1. Then once we get those implementation grant applications in, we're going to pivot to developing this comprehensive climate action plan, thinking about what additional climate strategies we want to focus on in that plan that weren't highlighted in this first plan that we're creating. So here the questions I'm interested in discussing with you today. Interesting. I want to make sure everybody knows about this process and absolutely want to answer any questions folks have about the approach and also really curious for your input on the comprehensive climate action plan and what things we should focus on that are going to really be important to supporting you all in Washington county and meeting your goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as we prepare to, to scope out the next round of this grant. So I'll drop us out of sharing and paste these questions as well as my email address in the chat. Right? Questions for Elliot May Calloway. You're muted. Okay. You may regret that you told me that. That's true. My question, you know, going back to and in our packet, I didn't have a copy of, you know, the financial request. I just had the priority strategies. And I guess I'm, I'm confused as to why expanding the use of parking pricing, you know, it seems to rate higher in the score than electrifying transit fleets because it seems to me that electrifying primate buses and smart down in Wilsonville and wherever else",

Mister Secretary, could you please call the roll? Kent how? Here. Marcy Grail. Marcy Grail. I'll just make note for the record that council member Grail is present virtually. Ann Byer here. Richard Devlin, can you hear me? Yes, yes, Counciler Devillin, we can hear you. Okay. I still have no video. For some reason. Katie is here. Mister chair, you have a quorum. Okay, thank you. Are there any agenda modifications, mister chair? I have a recommendation for one agenda modification. So agenda item e is the Boardman Hemingway amendment number two, council review of the draft proposed order. Agenda item f is the Sunstone solar project hearing officer appointment. Since councilmb member Grail is recused on the Boardman Hemingway project in total and she may need to leave a little bit early today, I request that we swap agenda items e and f. Since agenda item e is a hearing officer appointment and should only take about five minutes and it's an action item and it would be helpful to have council member rails participation. That shouldn't change really anything in terms of the agenda, but that would allow her to leave early if she needs to and still allow that action item to occur. That sounds great. Thank you. Okay, with that modification, we'll proceed. I have the following announcements. Please mute your phones and if you're joining us by phone and receive a phone call, please hang up from this call and dial back in after finishing your other call. For those signed down to the webinar, please do not broadcast your webcam for agenda item d. Public Comment there are three ways to let us know you are interested in providing comments to the council. For those in person, please fill out a registration card available on the table. For those using the webex, you'll need to use the raise your hand feature, and for those on the phone only, you'll need to press star three, which will alert us that you want to speak. We'll go over these options again during that agenda item. If you want to receive future email notifications of council meetings, project milestones, or rulemakings through our click dimensions program, you can do so by clicking on the link in the agenda or on the council web paage.

You're also welcomed to access the online project mapping tool and any documents by visiting our website. Please note that the audio and video of this meeting is being recorded and may be posted to the council's website following the meeting. Energy Facility council meetings shall be conducted in a respectful and courteous manner where everyone is allowed to state their positions at the appropriate times, consistent with council rules and procedures. Willful, accusatory, offensive, insulting, threatening, insulent or slanderous comments which disrupt the council meeting are not acceptable. Pursuant to oar 304 5011-0080 any person who engages in unacceptable contact conduct which disrupts the meeting may be expelled. So the next item is the consent calendar. We first have approval of the April 19, 2024 meeting minutes. They have a motion. Councillor Byer chair, how. I recommend that we approve the April 24 sec meeting minutes as present. Okay, we've got a motion. Motion in a second to approve the. Is it 24th or 19th? 19th. Yeah, I correct my EM motion. The April 29, 2024 meeting minutes. April 19. Did I say 24? I said 29th. Okay. April 19, 2024 meeting minutes for approval. Mister Secretary, could you please call the roll? Ann Byer? Yes. Kent Howe? Yes. Richard Devlin? Yes. Katie is. Yes. Mecy Grail? Marcy, I'm not showing a microphone for you, so I think you might want to sign out and come back to the meeting again. Minutes passed. We had enough even without councilmb member Raail. That was four vote, so. Yeah. Motion cars, mister. Okay, so, council secretary, report please. All right, I will first start with one project update. So Chris Chase and Nancy held the complete application public informational meeting for the Sunstone solar project at the Port of Morrow in Boardman last Wednesday. The fifth. Excuse me, prop Pro'project is twelve 200 mw solar pv project on 14.75 sq mi in Morl county, approximately 15 miles south of Boardman.

The turbines would also be redistributed throughout the site. So they're not all I guess not only 41 turbines would be siteightited in the new areas, but the facility would be kind of reconfigured with this new total amount of turbines and a total of 300 total nameplate capacity to accommodate the larger energy facility. There's also changes to the related or supporting facilities. The request for amendment eliminates previously approved overhead collector lines, the low or medium voltage 34.5 kilovolt collector lines, and expands the underd underground collection system. As I mentioned, the request proposes to realign the transmission line that would go down from a maximum of 32 miles to a new 26 miles route that's located entirely within Morrow county. And then the access road system would be expanded to include 76 miles of permanent access roads within the site and then 15 miles of temporary access roads needed for construction of the transmission line. Okay, so next slide please. Okay, this slide shows the layout that was proposed in RFA one. Generally, layouts are just proposed and they're provided for examples because micrositing borders do allow for microsightiting flexibility after construction. I do want to say, or just mention that we believe that this layout is, should be fairly close to the final design of at least portions of the facility since the certificate holder is planning on beginning construction as soon as they can after the council makes your decision. Just to point out a few features on this map. I know it's not very easy to see, but there are more than 107 yellow dots representing turbines on this map. That's because there are some alternate locations, so not all of the turbine locations would be constructed. You can see the proposed transmission line corridor reflected by a red line covered with little triangles going through the center of the site. And this is kind of helpful to see where the final alignment was proposed. On the western side, it has been rerouted, I think, to avoid both some agricultural features and then other energy facility development associated with the other wheat ridge facilities. And you can't see it. Very awful. But I do have other slides showing where the proposed substation sites are. So actually, yeah, if you can give me the next slide, Nancy. Great. Yeah, so as you can see there, the site with the proposs changed in RFA one would include two substation sites. One on the left side of the slide is north of Butterc Creek. Sorry. And that would include a the expanded battery energy storage system, storage of 30 megwatts instead of 20. And then on the right side you can see the other proposed substation site, which is adjacent to Little Butter Creek, more in the center portion of the site. Slide please. Great. Again, the site on the left here shows the terminus of the transmission line corridor at the Blue Ridge substation, which was constructed as part of Wheat Ridge two, one of the changes in RFA one would be to utilize the existing O m building at wheat RDGE two as well, instead of constructing a separate OEM building as part of Wheat RDGE east, and that location would be adjacent to the substation site. And then the certificate holder also requests authorizations to add a new temporary construction yard with up 60 acres of temporary disturbance area off of Myers Lane, close to police and Butte, which I think will come up a few times in this presentation. That temporary construction yard would be in addition to previously approved construction yards of 15 to 20 acres which were previously authorized to be constructed anywhere within the microsing corridors. So this new site certificate that we're proposing in the DPO would would allow for those to be built throughout the micros. Citing board for as well. Slide please. Okay, so that's an overview, I guess. Before I go on, are there any questions just on what the actual changes to the facility are? Sound like it? Okay, so because this request both proposes to add areas to the site boundary and proposes to extend the construction completion deadline for the facility, the council must determine that the preonderance of evidence on the record supports the following conclusions before you make your final decision. One, that the portion of the facility within the area added to the site by the amendment complies with allas and council standards applicable to an original site cert certific ##ate application that after considering any changes in facts or law since the date of the current site certificate was executed, the entire facility complies with all laws and council standards applicable to an original site certificate application and that the amount of bond or letter credit required under the financial, retirement and financial assurance standard is adequate. And that's just to say these three things combined really do accounts to almost a de novo review of this facility. So you'll see throughout the",

        "text": " like a giant battery that will provide power when you need it. But we got to save the fish, so whatever o, I already did that one. And then back, I think the soil guy left, but he brought up some real good points about, you know, the class one soil and how it's some of the best ground. Okay. Let somebody do with what they want to do with their ground. That's fine. It does affect a lot of folks. Where was the vote? You know, if something this big, it ain't just like they're going to put up a barn or, or, you know, put up a big eyesore in that sense. I mean, this affects a lot of folks. So should o have been a vote at the very least as to, you know, who's in support of this and who ain't. Not so much. Oh, by the way, they're having a hearing. There's lots of ways to get a hold of folks, not just talking to the city or talking to the council this or talking to that. I mean, shoot, we get handouts from all the sorts of different churches. Our mailbox is full of stuff. It's real easy to put postcards in people's mailbox saying, hey, we're, we got this, we're thinking about doing, we got this council meeting coming up. People still read their mail and a lot of folks don't read their email. My emails chuck, full of hundreds of junk. Email don't cut it. Folks need, you know, hard copies they can post on their fridge and, and, okay, I got off topic, but the class one soil stuff you ain't telling me. Okay, so you ain't doing concrete. You're doing piles. The piles I've been around, I've watched galvan six inch galvanized pipe be driv eight 9100ft in the ground to try and reach compactness enough that it can build on. And that's just to hold what? Concrete? So okay, you take all the concrete out, you're still driving a pile probably 20, 40ft in the ground. And you ain't be going to use wood no more. So it's going to be a galvanized or something similar pipe that's going to affect groundwater. That ain'tnn you ain't go going to just rip that out of the ground and have your class one soil again. 40 years, 60 years, 30 years, I't care how many years. The soil ain't never going to be what it was regardless of how many standards they meet, trying to get to, trying to match what, what the state requirements are, it just ain't going to happen. I mean, going right back to, you take a tree out, how long you going to battle them roots when you want to? I mean, you pl across it, pl across it, roots come up. So I mean, you can, you can rip all the pile out you want, but it's going to affect that. So it ain't never going to be the same. And so that bond that you're talking about is a third party deal. Okay, great. But is that, that's a state control deal. How much of that bond money is going to come back to landowner that can't use his ground now? Because it's like they was saying, newuke, it's, it's toast. He ain't going to grow nothing out there worth nothing. So how much is that bond is going to him? And I don't know. These are all questions I don't know we'll ever have the answers to fully. But stuff that people talked about that I thought might be worth talking about to address some of that, this project does have proposed battery storage. So the project itself, it would generate electricity that would be stored into the batteries. And so let's just say it's like nighttime, right, when there's not a lot of production, if not zero, the batteries can be discharged to allow, to allow energy back into the grid to continue to continue producing or injecting into the grid. As for the mix of electricity, that's something that's handled by the utility, and that's not necessarily something that we have control of. So I apologize for not having any information about that EDwaRDS okay. Id. I just scratched a few facts here real quick, looking at onyx to check out the land base, and I've heard a lot of talk about community and several families and some new people to the area and several people that have been here multiple generations, and their values and community aesthetics and whatnot. And so for the local folks here that aren't aware, like I said, this is just a quick little research I did. But what I found out is the proposed acreage for the project area is thousand 1588 acres. And out of that, there are 761.89 acres that have a tax address out of Nampa, Idaho, and then another 76 acres that have a tax address out of Redmond, Oregon, which is",

        "text": " presented the full greenhouse gas inventory report at the council work session last December. So this is just one slide recap of that longer presentation. So just a quick snapshot to remind you of where we are with our emissions. So on this chart you'll see the blue, yellow, green, yellow and orange bars represent our local emissions. So local emissions occur directly in the community or nearby due to activity in the community. The energy used in our buildings, primarily electricity and natural gas and transportation energy which includes gas, diesel and electricity for our EV's are the largest locally generated emissions. Industrial processes is next, and waste which is so small you can hardly even see, the bar is the sector with the lowest amount of emissions in our community. So the magenta bars, or they're kind of like dark red on the screen, are the city's imported emissions. Those are items which we use within the city, but that were grown, manufactured, or otherwise created outside of the city limits. So that includes upstream fuel production, household consumption of food, goods and services that we bring into our community or order online, and air travel. So while local emissions include specific aggregated data from our partners, imported emissions are estimated, however, they are significant. And if you stack all those magenta bars up, they are actually our largest source of emissions. So we want to keep them as part of the climate conversation. So we will be proposing some strategies in our plan to help reduce them along with measures to reduce local building and transportation, energy, or other two big sectors. Question, Rama. Thank you. So the goods and foods and beverage are they also counted for the greenhouse gases they generate in the communities where they're made. So it's almost like they're counted twice? No, they would be counted separately. So if there's emissions generated during the production of, say, our agriculture products, that would be counted in the fuel used to farm the products, and therefore you would find that in transportation or if they were warehousing and that type of thing, otherwise actually developing food, that would probably be in our building energy because that would include kitchens and restaurants that cook our food. Does that make sense? Yeah. So the idea is to minimize the double counting. Those are, you know, when you talk, when we talk about food and beverage, it's not like what's grown in your local community garden. It's like those bananas that we're bringing in from, like, South America. Got it. Any other questions on this? It's kind of a big, the big picture. So I just want to make sure we're all clear on this. Okay. So this is a chart that I haven't shown, showed you yet, but this is looking specifically at the local emissions in Hillsboro. And this is a good chart. This shows that they are expected to decrease over time thanks to strong climate action from the state of Oregon in the building, energy and transportation sectors shown here in the dark blue and green toward the bottom of the graph, for instance, electricity emissions are required to be reduced by 100% by 2040, which dramatically decreases the greenhouse gases associated with operating commercial and industrial buildings, plus our homes. So note that this projection assumes that the state's climate protection program, also known as the CPP, prevails following a court challenge and new rulemaking process that is underway right now, I think DEQ hopes to get that done this year. If that program holds, it will also reduce emissions from the natural gas and sector and other stationary fuels significantly, which is shown in the light blue bar, kind of in between the blue and the green. So while emissions are estimated to drop over 70% in 2050 compared to 2022 local emissions without any additional mitigation actions from us, that is still not enough to hit the target of 100% ghg emissions mitigation to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees celsius. That's the dashed line. That is the international target for limiting the worst impacts of climate change. So additional goals and actions beyond current projections and legislation will be modeled as part of our community climate action plan so we can try to help meet that target. So you may note that imported emissions are not included in this forecast. Primarily. This is because changes in imported emissions are very challenging to track and predict. So therefore, this snapshot just shows our local emissions. Are there any questions on this emissions outlook for Hillsboro? Yeah, so thank you so much. I think my question is about the hills, the state plan. So that's currently under rulemaking and currently challenged in the court right now, the climate protection plan. And that is specific to the natural gas and stationary fuel sector. So that doesn't have anything to do with the requirements for electric utilities to reduce their or to decarbonize their systems. It's a different sector. Okay, so then the target is what you're saying through all of our energy requirements as a state",

        "text": " if we have a hand raised or a comment come through. No questions. Well, hopefully we can at least get a thumbs up from everybody for the excitement of round three and those planning projects coming through, as well as some really, really exciting projects that are coming through for that third round. Patricia had mentioned the hydrogen one, which is a very interesting project utilizing one of our first instances of utilizing hydrant as a potential energy storage within one of our projects. So lots of very, very innovative, engaging projects that have come through without giving too much away, a couple of floating solar at wastewater treatment facilities, and then, as Patricia had mentioned, a new influx of battery storage in conjunction with the utilities for demand response during peak periods. So we do have some really, really exciting projects that are coming forward. We can't wait to announce these latest winners when we meet again. But with that, without having any questions there, I want to quickly turn it over to colleague James to walk through our proposed rule changes for the program. So take it away, James. Thanks, Jason. All right, I just want to start off with a very brief overview of the previous legislative session for this program. So Senate Bill 1525 from the last session amended the program by including partner costs into what is considered the cost to plan, construct and install a project. The bill also further defined what is considered an electric cooperative for the purposes of the program. The one of the main change was to add in the ability for ODo to release an additional 30% of a grant'funds if the grantee meets certain provisions specified in rule which'now in process of outlining. And I'll kind of outline the whole payment kind of division of payments as well as they go through that rule so you can see what how that additional 30% kind of falls in the program. So when incorporating the amendment to the from the this legislative session into initial rules, OO is proposing additional language changes to assist in implementing those changes. So with the inclusion of partner costs into the definition of planning and project costs, OTo is proposing to clarify the role of a partner as well. So currently, a partner is defined as an entity listed as a partner to an eligible applicant on an application for a grant, and a partner may be a federally recognized Oregon indian tribe, public body, nonofit entity, private business with a business site in Oregon or owner of a rental property in Oregon, Odo is proposing further defining that definition by stating that a partner may assist or take a lead role in the acquisition, installation, construction, or planning of a community renewable energy project that a partner can have financial or ownership interest in the project. The definition would also clarify that an entity whose only role is provision of goods and services through a procurement contract would not be considered a partner, also proposing that a written agreement be in place between the applicant and any partner before any release of funds under performance agreement with Odo. For those kind of performance agreements entered into in the future, the written agreement would be required to include certain key provisions from the performance agreement between Odo and the applicants, such as the ability to photo oo to inspect the project site or audit documentation. Do any advisory committee members have any questions about the potential rule changes on this slide? And we can circle back to any, if any questions do pop up. Ok, so the amendment to add an additional release of grant funds for construction projects provided the ability for ODO to establish requirements for the release of funds in the rule. Currently, the first 30% of grant funding may be released if, upon entering the performance agreement, the applicant demonstrates having taken meaningful steps to seek site control and having filed a request for interconnection with host utility or appropriate transmission provider and met any of the requirements provided in the performance agreements, such as kind of demonstrated use of funds, a need for the funds, and so that's the initial 30% and that's currently what is available for construction projects with the remain remaining funds released upon completion of the projects and any final reporting requirements. So this additional 30% is going to be 30% at the beginning once they meet those requirements, and then additional 30% once they meet these proposed requirements. And so the current proposals that we have come up with are that the applicant or partner has fulfilled all the requirements for the release of the first 30%. So that's the filed request for interconnection and taking meaningful steps to seek site control and other requirements in the performance agreement, and then that the grantee demonstrates that they or a partner has incurred a minimum of 25% of projected grant monies on eligible costs prior to requesting this additional funding. So they've already spent some funds on eligible costs. An updated project budget that details eligible andedigitable costs has been provided just to kind of so we can assess progress on the project and anticipated future costs for the project and that the construction installation of the",

My grandfather purchased the ranch that my dad and mom gave us property to live on in 1943. We would like to give it to our children and not have a large portion of our view disrupted and disturbed. And there is value in that. I don't know how much value, but our property value would go down. Not that we're planning on selling because our lifelong dream was to live there. Raise your hand if that is also your lifelong dream. Okay. It seems that people could care less about the values of others property anymore. So values are few and far between. We are going to be the ones dealing with the loss ofesthetic, loss of view and the possible devaluation property. Who is going to pay us for that? Not to mention the damaging effects to the land and the residents, the nearby residents and the wildlife. I watch for elk as I drive at night there. There are tons. I tell my children, watch out for deer, watch out for elk. I'm sure fathers in here and mot same thing there. All right, I would like to ask this audience if you are living across or in the view of this raise hand if you would like you all to participate. Like truly raise your hand if you would like, in your view. I'll wait. Anyone? The problem is we say in Oregon, it's a beautiful state. We can serve, protect land and wildlife, etcetera. But then we do the opposite. I will not stand for the opposite. We need to use common sense in this community and everywhere. In Oregon this day age, we make all the standards and the rules and we say we're going to do follow it and then other things are permitted. This is happening in our schools. Things get permitted. This is happening everywhere. Let's not permit what our rules and regulations say they are protecting. When will our countys commission, et cetera. Thank you everyone for coming. Thank you for this opportunity to speak and I appreciate all the information we're getting here tonight. Respectfully, at the beginning of this evening, you mentioned Todd, something about the room, the timing, et cetera, and not being right, that I would add nothing about this project seems right to me. Hi. So, yeah, I'm sorry, John. Yes. John Marble and then Steve Hood is. Yes. On really is technical question for Todd. When we talk about permitted uses or perhaps permitted uses on efuam, that's not quite. Did you say that there is oversight provided by Lynn county land staff? At that point? I probably said a lot of different things. That probably was confusing. So I'll try to clarify. So under the land use requirement, basically same name requirements that apply to the county apply to us. So. And those come from the Department of Land Conservation Development. So it's the same rul, the same statutes. So if you go to you, I don't know how many people know this, but orgon revised statute 215 283, basically that provides little uses. There may be some additional requirements for some things, but we'll just say, you know, largely you're allowed to do it. Then the second list are conditional uses that is subject to. Somebody could go to the county and request a conditional use review. In this case, the size of the project basically becomes our jurisdiction. Same county, same requirements, same conditional use requirements from statute and rule. And then same Lynn county requirements would apply in our process. And when you say weed, you mean land use staff at DoE? Well, we're the, we're the, I mean, you could call us the land use staff. So, but effectively we're the energy facility cing division. Okay. So there will be an additional oversight function of land use issues. It's part of our process. So the list of standards that chase had brought up, and we didn't go through all of the different standards, but one of the standards is land use. And again, Jim Johnson talked about the one difference is the goal exception where the energy facility siting council'requirements are a little less stringent than the Department of Land Conservation and Developments. That's the only area. Everything else, again, whether it would apply through the county it or applies through us, it's the same require. Thank you. Okay, Steve Hood and then Lois Hawk is next. My name is Steve Hood. I live gap already had, but I have a couple, couple comments and full disclosure. I think solar fields are terribly ugly. I travel the US for my work and I end up in a lot of out of way places and I get to look at them. And I think almost everyone I talk to says that are ugly. And I think one of your",

The department issued the DPO on May 7 of this year, 2024, which initiated a 31 day comment period. On May 30, Chair Howe conducted a public hearing on the DPO at the Port of Moro Riverfront center riverront room in Boardman, Oregon. And the record was kept open until June 10, and it was actually. And that was kept open for the public, and then, or the applicant had until June 10 to respond, and then they requested an extension to respond to comments received by an extension of a day to May 11. And that's when we received their responses to comments received on the DPO. And that leads us to today, July 19, where we're continuing our council review of the DPL. This next slide is our energy facility siting process. I'll be. I'll summarize this. This chevron process. There's seven major steps in the review of applications for site certificates. Right now, we are in the fourth of the seven steps, right in the middle of the process being the draft proposed order. The first step is the notice of intent, which is the applicant'conceptual plan or a facility. Following notice of intent, there's the project order, and that's the department's blueprint for the application, the department's representation of what the applicable requirements are. The third step of the process is the actual application, both preliminary and complete. And now we're at the draft proposed order, which is the department's initial findings of facts, conclusions of law, and recommendations to counsel on whether or not the facility would comply with all applicable requirements. And this was also the first opportunity for the public to provide comments on the record. And so we received that. And following the draft proposed order step, we get into the proposed order, which is the staff's revised recommendations based on direction from FSEEC and additional evaluation. Following the conclusion of the public hearing and the public comment timefraame on the DPO and the following proposed order, we move into potential contested case and only those persons who have raised a relevant issue in person, at the public hearing or in writing by the comment deadline on the draft proposed order may participate in the contested case and the contested case process step is run by an independent hearing officer. Following contested case, we get to the final order, which is FX review of the hearing officers recommended contested case order if there is one, and ultimately an issuance of a final order, either approving or denying the application for site certificate. Okay? Okay. Today is yet another opportunity, continuation of council'opportunity to continue to provide comments to staff on the DPO and on the issues raised on the record of the public hearing. As I just mentioned, the next step in the process is the department's issuance of the proposed order, where we'll take into consideration the comments from council and comments received on the record of the draft proposed order hearing and agency consultation. When we issue the proposed order will also issue a notice of issuance of the proposed order and notice of the contested case. Okay. As I just mentioned, only those persons who commented on the record of the public hearing may request to participate as a party or a limited party in a contested case proceeding. And this is a representation of the comments we received on the record of the DPO. We received five oral comments at the DPO hearing and boardman or from the public, one from a reviewing agency, Morrow county, or the special advisory group and we received two written comments on the record, one from a reviewing agency, Morrow county again, and one public comment. And as I mentioned in the procedural history overview, we did receive responses from not certificate holder. It should say applicant. I apologize, not a certificate holder response. It's an applicant response. They provided their responses to all comments received on June 11. This slide is my representation of in summary of the main issues raised in comments, and these are really the setting the stage for the rest of my presentation. There is comments made about vegetation management and soil stabilization, as well as comments on the goal three exception, and comments and discussion on the applicant'organizational expertise. This slide is representative of what I'm not, what I don't have in this presentation. These standards listed on this slide, didn't have any, didn't receive any comments or, or will feature or won't feature any substantive changes, recommended substantive changes in the proposed order. However, all that being said, if you have you being council have any questions, comments, recommendations on any of these standards, I'd love to hear them. So I guess this leaves me with my presentation today. The rest of the slide deck will be on the organizational expertise standard, soils standard, land use standard, and the noise regulations.

        "text": " resources is delayed? That could be an uncertainty where we would have liked to have more clean energy resources developed, but we couldn't get them because of unforeseen barriers to getting those resources built. But it also could represent a policy choice where we don't want to build this as much because of stricter environmental controls. And so what if we were to limit the amount of clean energy resources built in the state. So that, that's a way of one scenario answering a couple of different questions and representing different, different priorities in state planning. So our step following that is to do this translation. So taking those what if questions, what does that mean in terms of developing a scenario? And a couple of examples are shown here. So first is what if consumer adoption of heat pumps occurs more slowly than expected? Our reference scenario may have, for example, 100% sales of heat pumps by 2035. Our alternative scenario there, where it's going more slowly, we maybe only reach 50% of heat pump sales by 2035. And so that's an example of a translation step then. The second is what if transmission expansion to access resources outside of Oregon is harder than expected? First option in the reference scenarios is relatively unconstrained to build new transmission or be constrained by what the potential to expand a particular path looks like. But, but we could expand those paths. And an alternative there to look at limitations is to not allow transmission expansion and see what that means for, for Oregon in terms of local resource build and the types of supply chain expansion that we would see. So as modelers, what we want to end up with is, is kind of a playbook for what we should do following the working group process. So we want to distill all of the information that we get and the refined questions, getting down to those five additional scenarios in addition to the reference case and develop what their quantitative definitions are. And this is an example of that playbook that comes from the Washington 2021 state energy strategy, where we had a reference scenario, which was kind of the older idea of having a business as usual be a fossil future. And then the, all of the rest of scenarios are meeting the, the emissions goals in Washington. The electrification scenario in this case was kind of like the reference scenario we're proposing in Oregon. And then we can see how the other scenarios are changed from that, that reference scenario. So taking, for example, transportation fuels there, where we are moving more slowly on electrification in vehicles, we can see the differences in that scenario that we're used to investigate. What would it mean to go more slowly, highlighted in the red text there. So instead of 100% electric sales by 2035, we're going to 75% by 2045, for example. So this is only an example and not indicative of any of the choices that we would be making here in Oregon, but illustrating where we would like to end up come September after the working group process. And we've decided what are the important questions to answer and what does that mean in terms of scenario definitions? So, following our modeling work, we will get into some additional analysis that is looking at cross cutting equity considerations. The first of these is energy burden and affordability. And the idea here is to look at the energy wallet for a variety of different customer profiles across Oregon. So not just focused on electricity, but all of the types of energy expenses that customers accrue over the course of a year. And the right hand side there is showing an example from our analysis in Wisconsin, where the top chart has estimated energy expenditures by household, and we see how those vary across different scenarios. So baseline we are, we're spending a similar amount in 2050 to what we are in 2022. This is a kind of a fossil scenario. And then we have other scenarios that are either going to clean electricity targets or net zero economy wide targets. And those have very varied level of electrification. So we see in a net zero economy wide case, then we're getting about a 20% reduction in our expenditures by, by 2050. But the distribution of costs are changing from largely fossil in 2022 to largely electricity costs in 2050 as electrification occurs. So that's shown for an average customer there. But we can also look at things that, that impact particular customer groups and, and apply this to the bills and the likely expenses that customers, such as low income rural customers or low income customers in Portland, for example. What are they going to see with changing energy usage over time and these emissions targets in the future? The chart on the bottom there is showing the changes in costs associated with when a customer buys an electric vehicle. So if they buy it in 2022, their costs are significantly higher than an average customer. If they buy it in 2030, that's kind of the sweet spot where they actually save money",

        "text": " folks because of the impact for what we're talking about. And I think if we leave it too subjective, then again, our responsibilities to the communities and that that they have, they should be able to go to sleep at night knowing that there is a real plan not to make believe my experiences. In moments of crisis, people panic and we need to ensure that the certificate holder and the developer are doing everything possible, that it's documented, people know what to do and there's no question. And to council members I'point, again, talk about oral areas don't have a lot of resources to start, so they may have to do something to support along the way to protect these areas. So I'm saying them more the better. This is Kent and I. Is there a difference between construction activities and times of just operation after construction as far as these types of wildfire provision concerns? Is it there's a fire? It doesn't matter whether it's just operation or whether they're under construction. Chair how I would say for firer response, not as much. It is more of an issue. I mean, fire at the site is a fire at the site. There is some issues that once there's things on the landscape, like once the battery system is there, the fire responders need to know whether or not it's safe to fight fire around the battery system. They need to know how to do that, things like that. So the prevention side of the planning, I think, does change quite dramatically. But the fire response side of it is less dynamic between construction and operation. Yeah, that too. Chair how? Councilloor I I would really like to see the certificate holder and the applicant, the developer engage with the local. We've already talked about this with the local fire districts, which are not just Morl county, it's Umatila county too. And that there could be possibly some on site training for those first responders and also that they could assess the wildfire mitigation plan and give timely response to that plan and any that those be, you know, that they have the opportunity to respond to the plan and any issues that they have with it and any potential issues that they might see. We've talked a little bit about capacity and having, you know, that's just our observation. So I'm sure that they would have the same observation and then also identifying the structures, you know, that are most vulnerable in the area. That would probably be an important part of assessing, you know, the wildfire mitigation plan and having a plan in place to address how they're going to, you know, rise to that conflict. So those are just two little things that I can think of, and I'm not even a fire expert. Right. So I just think about my own home and where I live, you know, that those are things that I would think about as a homeowner in an area where you're surrounded by dry land, wheat and towers and lightning and all these different factors that, that are real. So the big thing for me is really the coordination with the fire districts that that be addressed and that that be done in a timely manner. I don't know if anything in your recommendation talks about pre construction having things done before or not, but I think that's a relevant discussion for the council to consider. If anybody else has any thoughts on that, and I wouldry, this is council member Grail. And I would also suggest with that training and coordination. Don't forget the local utilities, because there is a big difference between going to a wind farm and handling your normal facilities. And oftentimes people think, oh, well, you're, you're align and you can figure it. Well, hold on, because I don't do this every day. So they need to be part of the mix too. And they are like qualify. They would be a great resource. They do have, you know, tools and they are considered first respond responders. So I would encourage them to be part of the mix. I've watched anyway, I just, from experience, I would say, don't forget to acknowledge that those are resources available. I just thought of something else too, that I wrote my notes and that is just out of curiosity, if the county emergency manager has been brought into the loop on this, this kind of stuff, if they are even on other projects in Oregon. But I think that's a good resource to have. Part of the discussion is the emergency manager for the county, both counties, two council members. Sure. How, if I may, I just wanted to add, to point out as we continue forward with this project, but so there is an existing condition that council previously imposed in the original site certificate. It's called Gen PSO three. It was before the wildfire standard came into play, but it. I'll just read it. It's prior to construction and operations certificate, holder must provide training on fire prevention and response. That includes instruction on facility fire hazards. They shall notify the department",

        "text": " the purpose of the program is to offset costs of planning and developing community renewable energy projects, to support projects in traditionally underserved communities. And we'll get to that definition that they use for those, those communities in a minute. And to promote small scale community renewable energy projects and finally, to provide direct benefits to communities across Oregon by improving energy resilience, creating local jobs, promoting economic development, and reducing local energy costs. And one thing I want to flag here on this is the statutory definition of resilience is sort of this combination of renewables and resilience. So you'll see that when we talk about resilience projects here, we're talking about things that sort of have those two components together versus just strictly resilience. Projects. So I just want to make sure from the beginning, I say that we can talk more about that. It's in the statute. It's directly there. So it wasn't sort of a choice of ours, but just want to make sure that we kind of all have that from the beginning, because resilience can mean so many different things in terms of this program. It's called community Renewable Energy grant program. So just know that that renewable is sort of, kind of a check box along the way. Moving on. I mentioned that. I don't think I have mentioned yet that only certain entities are eligible to apply for these grants. Irrigation districts, those of you on the phone included, are one of those potential applicants. Otherwise, it's tribes count, county cities, special districts, other munic municipalities. The only exception really, to sort of the tribes and public bodies is we mentioned consumer and utilities specifically to catch co ops, which, which are not a public body. Most consumer utilities are. And then the other thing to know is that the program cannot fund projects in Portland. Just so you know, the reason for that is that Portland already has a similar program, a program doing similar work with its own dedicated pot of money. So it, good thinking, I guess. They're already covered. So moving on to slide five, the budget priorities are also set in the statute. 50% or more of the grants have to go to community energy resilience projects. And 50% or more of the funding must be for projects that serve qualifying communities. So this is essentially a way of prioritizing projects. So projects don't necessarily have to be resilience projects, and they don't have to be in these particular qualifying communities. It's just, we have to make sure we hit our benchmarks for funding for 50% in both of those pots. And qualifying communities actually comes from the definition in House Bill 2021 of environmental justice communities just want to flag. It's a pretty broad definition, and we have, as an agency in consultation with stakeholders and our advisory committee have not chosen to strictly define this. So the definition and statute includes communities of color and communities ##iencing lower incomes, but it also includes tribes, rural communities, coastal communities, communities with limited infrastructure, and then finally, traditionally underrepresented communities, including seniors, youth, and persons with disabilities. So pretty broad there. Just to make sure folks know, when we say environmental justice communities are qualifying communities, what we're talking about, the advisory committee has been really important in getting the work done. We have one of the members of the advisory committee on Les Perkins, at least one. And it was really, really great that the, they set up this group. This group worked together on program design and are now going to help us with our program implementation. And then since the passage of Housev Bille 2021, we've been very busy standing up the new program. In the summer of 2021, the Department of Energy staff were assigned and developed an implementation plan, and that included operational staffing and it changes within the agency. And in September, we recruited that stakeholder advisory committee to help guide program design support development of rules. That effort resulted in draft rules being posted with the secretary of state's office on January 1. Those rules are now final, and our opportunity announcements for the program came out on March 7. We expect actually our applications to launch shortly, and we'll talk about that in just a second. Before we move on to the specific grant opportunities, I promise to walk you through a project just to give you some ideas. And I know that this isn't a project that is, like exactly relevant to you all, but I think just kind of helps to get those creative juices flowing, like I said earlier. So this is a project that Eugene Water and electric board, or EEB, completed a few years ago. The city of Eugene, like much of western Oregon, could be subject to significant damage from a Cascadia earthquake. And that is something that a lot of folks on the phone have, something they have to contend with as well. And as a utility that manages both electricity and water services, EweB recognized the importance of energy to water delivery and was well positioned",

Not all tribes are developing a PCAP, however, the ability tribes of northwest Indians Ati is also developing a plan that tribes within the region can point to. In addition to state's PAP engagement with interest, tribes in Oregon has guided actions for inclusion and tribal priorities which you see reflected in the draft, and we continue to engage with those tribes to make sure they are represented within our slide please a requirement for the PCAP is the analysis of low income and disadvantaged communities that will impacted by the measures as defined by EPA. For the purposes of the CPRG, low income and disip ##age communities are any community that is identified as disadvantaged by climate and economic justice screening tool or CGEST. This tool uses data sets indicators of burden in eight categories, climate change, energy, health, housing, legacy pollution, transportation, water and wastewater, and workforce development. It's quite comprehensive, over 20% Oregon census tract, so 233 out of 834 are considered disadvantaged. The map on this slide shows these communities and their locations throughout Oregon. While it only represents 28% of trackacts, you can see that by land mass, it actually represents a good portion of our state, which is something we really all need to be thinking about. Most of the measures included in the draft pcap are considered statewide, but depending on the measure, they may impact some communities more than others, such as medium and heavy duty reductions or moved to electric vehicles might impact urban areas, while heat pumps might be able to impact rural communities. More slide, please. I just wanted to point out for everyone who isn't already familiar, but our draft prity climate action plan is available on our CG website. The web address is at the bottom and it's about halfway down the page. And in addition, if you can change the slide on that same page, we link to our feedback. Survey one back, please. Okay, I think that there's a slide in between those two. Yep, there we go. It's like catchup. Like due to our very short timeline, we're accepting feedback through a survey. So we can move more quickly and evaluate incorporate that feedback. The survey is on the DED site, but it's also available at the link we're providing on this screen and I'll put it in the chat as well. And then you can also use the QR code to take you there. So for the english based survey english language based survey, those that feedback is actually due today and we would love your feedback. All of your feedback. It's really important not just for our PCAP, but also framing our comprehensive climate plan and all of our programs. For the spanish language survey that is actually due February 7, we wanted to give more time because that got up a little bit later due to simp procurement on our end. So please provide our feedback. We're excited to get it. We've already received over 70 pieces of feedback, so feedback related to the draft must be submitted through the survey just to emphasize that. And that's because we have to move so very quickly on our timeline. The feedback is anonymous and it will be used to inform our final PCAp as well as that comprehensive climate plan like I mentioned. So current open slides please. So while the feedback window hasn't quite closed, I did go in and have collected an example of what is being provided to us. So like I said, we already over 70 comments. A lot of that is coming from the more densely populated counties and then we have a lot of individuals that are commenting, which I think is fantastic. There's also some local government and private companies that have been commenting. So for transportation measure feedback we're seeing a lot of calls for electrification of vehicles, improved public transportation, public charging, reducing miles in vehicles, so we usually call that vehicle miles traveled and alternatives to vehicles. So there's a number of pushes towards more transit, but also to bicycles, etcetera. For building measures we're seeing asks for additional weatherization, energy efficiency or alternative energy such as solar, clean energy homes and buildings, and improved cos replacing gas appliances with electric and that includes heat pumps and water heaters. Those were specifically called out there for waste measures. We see methane capture for landfills and farm waste being asked to be prioritized. We also see food waste reduction, reducing plastic use and using more sustainable materials and reducing environmental impact. The other themes that have really popped out for our team include additional education and outreach on all of this single points of information or hubs focus on low income owners and renters use of cleaner fuels or cleaner energy sources in local level changes, which is very important, especially when you look at where this feedback is coming from. Understanding how these state measures can impact local level. But then also I think it's important for us to uplift those local level changes within",

The first relates to timing. As I just mentioned, to be eligible to participate in a condescent case on the application, a person must raise an issue either in person at the DPO hearing or in a written comment submitted during the comment timef Frme before the record closes at the conclusion of the DE at the conclusion of the the comment timeframe, the council will not accept comments after the close of the record on the DPO. The second criteria relates to the content for comments for consideration in the contested case, issues raised must be within the council's jurisdiction and must be raised with sufficient specificity so that the council, the department and the applicant understand the issues raised and are afforded an opportunity to respond to the issue. To raise an issue with sufficient specificity, a person must present facts that support the person's position on the issue. All comments submitted in a timely fashion will be reviewed by Odo and the council. Besides providing commenters with the opportunity to be eligible to be considered for party status in the cadastic case proceeding, timely and specific comments that point out issues with the application or the draft proposed order provide the department the opportunity to address these issues when we develop the proposed order. Now, on this screen, we have examples of the types of comments that would help Odo improve its analysis for the proposed order and those those examples are provided on the left side of the screen and on the right side of the screen, the right hand column. Those these are comments that are less likely to help us improve our analysis of whether or not the facility complies with council standards. Because this is a standards based process, comments that reference specific council standards and provides specific information supporting whether or not a standard has been met are more likely to improve our analysis than statements of support or of opposition to the facility. So the more detailed and linked to council standards a comment can be, the more effective it is for us to evaluate and address further on down the line. This is a screenshot of the project webpage for the wagon Trail solar project, and in a couple slides I'll provide this webpage link. It was also provided in the public notice for this meeting tonight. The web page contains not only a copy of this participation, but also the department's project order and the applicant application materials for the Wagon trail solar project. The page will be updated when we post additional or new documents, such as when we issue the draft proposed order, it'll be updated. It'll also be updated following this meeting to include the recording of this meeting, but currently the applicants application for site certificate is featured on the web page and included in this screenshot. You can see a exhibit files reference on the right hand side and this is uh, this exhibit files reference is there to support your review of the application materials. The complete application materials are again featured on this website, but this is just a quick u reference point to see which exhibits, uh, ident or address what subject material. The department also has created a lot of information that we hope will be helpful. Our website contains a public guide and a series of handouts to explain how the FSEEC process works and how to participate in our process. There are also options to sign up and receive email notices and instructions on how to comment on citing projects to be automatically notified for updates or on updates for this project or any FSEEC project you can sign up for.

All of those. Let's see now this before I hand over my presentation to the applicant. This next slide is just my contact info, but I my contact info will be shown at the conclusion of the presentation, so I won't linger too long on this and'll hand it over to the applicant to go over their slides. See? Hey Chase, thank you. And I just want to say thank you for all the work you put into getting this meeting together and all the hours that you and the Department of Energy staff have'put into getting the application to completeness. Just to introduce myself, I'm Ryan Hill. I'm a developer for the Wagon Trail solar project and a senior project manager at Next Era Energy Resources. I'd also like to introduce my director, David Lawler. David, you want to just introduce yourself real quick? Yeah. David Lawler, I'm the regional director for development at Nexterra Energy Resources and I'mad glad to be part of this public meeting. All right, thank you. And kind of how our slides are gonna run. It's gonna be kind of a big picture of who Nexterra is funneling down to more project specific details. If we could just go to the next slide, please. Right. So Wagon Trail Energy center is a subsidiary",

        "text": " was made. Thank you, Councilme member Devlin's comfortable, vice chair house, since you provided the second, are you comfortable still? Yes, I am. Okay, well, it sounded like there's already been plenty of deliberation. Are we ready to call the roll? Secretary Cornet, please call the roll. Perry Choctut? Yes. Ann Byer? Yes. Cindy Condon? Yes. Richard Devlin? Yes. Marcy Grail? Yes. Ken how. Yes. Jordan Truitt? Yes. Motion carries. Maun chair. Thank you, Mister Skidmore. Thank you. We look forward to working with you in the future. Sicily's been a great asset to helping us and we look forward to working with you as well. Thank you, chair. All right, the next and final agenda item is the Muddy Creek energy project appointment of special advisory group. This is an action item. Again, we have Todd Cornette, assistant director for citing, and council secretary to present. Todd. Thank you, madam chair. During the last council meeting, I did mention this. I think it was during his Hillary footitt's presentation or as public comment, I don't recall. But there was some comment about the lack of large scale solar projects in the Willamette Valley. And I had to mention that at that point, we did have a notice of intent submitted. We just had not had a chance to review it fully to make sure that it had everything that was needed subsequent to the June 1 meeting that has been done, that is required in a notice of intent was included. And so we do have this notice of intent, which is effectively live now. So I will get into the details. So the notice intent was submitted on May 19 of this year and the application is for the Muddy Creek Energy park. Thank you for advancing the slide. As you are aware, the submission of the notice of intent is the very first step in the process for obtaining a site certificate. The applicant is the Muddy Creek Energy Park LLC. They are a wholly owned subsidiary of Hanwa Q cells Use Corp. And in the next couple of slides I'll go over the details of the project and the location. But because the facility is greater than twelve acres, the project location is on high value farmland. It is in high value soils. Going back to one of the prior presentations, the threshold for FEC jurisdiction is met. And so that is why it is within the jurisdiction of the energy facility siting council. Nancy, you can advance the slide. Thank you. So this gives you kind of a laundry list of the description of the facility. So kind of the main description is that it's 199 megawatt facility, solar pv, solar generation. It would be located entirely within unincorporated Lynn county and entirely within within the county's exclusive farm use zone. Therefore, a goal exception to goal three will be required. Again, going back to Patrick's presentation, we'll have a lot of different conversations because of the type of farm use and the location of this project, but it will have to go through the goal exception process. So you can see in the secondary list the related supporting facilities. It's typical of what what we have seen with other solar projects. It would include the battery storage system as an option and the system would include 12ft by 36ft by 10ft tall enclosures. And that would be located sort of in the center of the project, would include a fairly short 230 kv gen line. And I'll show another slide which shows the location of the project and it'll make more sense about why that's so short. Inverters and transformers, a collector substation, 34.5 kv collector lines, a seven foot tall perimeter fence and you can see you one on 1588 acres or 2.5 sq mi. So a full perimeter fence surround that site and then in service roads probably around the perimeter of the project as well as throughout the internal site as well. Next slide please. So this is a zoomed out version. You can see the blue line running down the middle of the slide is interstate five. So you can see the black lines kind of in the center is the project LoC. This would be the site boundary. And so you can see that it's immediately adjacent to interstate five. And at the very bottom of the slide you can see how the lines of I five start to jar a little bit. And really, just off of that, the slide is Eugene and Springfield. So it's just really north of Eugene, Springfield, you can see to the west. I don't know how well you can see the slide, but you have Junction City and Coburg. And then to the north of the site on the east side of the highway is Brownsville. So this gives you a sort of a bigger sense of where",

        "text": ", can I respond a little bit to that one as well, just because it's. I think it's important. So, you know, at the notice of intent stage, which is where we're at right now, is we're seeing public comment, and that includes agencies. So the one slide, which had kind of the bullse s eyes with the study area and the analysis area, this is also something that the county can be very valuable at because you have a good geographic information system, you know, the maps, you know, the issues out there, you could say, look, you're sor predetermined area for this resources, half a mile. We think you should go beyond that. Or as Kate said, we can either increase those or shrink those based upon information that we get on the record. But that's what's helpful for us to know what else is out there. Is there anything that we're not aware of that we could be missing? So sort of at the notice of intent stage, you know, we're going toa be like, okay, what are your land use requirements? What do we need to include in the project order from the county? Then when we're reviewing the preliminary application, we want to know from the county they submitted all this information about the local land use ordinances. Did they get it right? Is it complete? Is it not complete? And then when we get to the point where we're writing the draft proposed order, which is functionally like a stack report, it'we're, looking at the project against the standards. We want your input as well, particularly on the local land use ordinanceces, to say, not only did we have the right list of them, but are we evaluating it properly? How would you evaluate it if you were doing the review? We want your input to make sure that we're getting that right. Are we putting the right conditions on? Are we interpreting things correctly? That's where we want the county's input. You can certainly participate, you know, kind of beyond if you don't like what we did, if you don't agree with what we did, you can provide comments on the draft proposed order. You can participate in the contested case. But prior to that, where we really, really need you to help us. So let me clarify, clarify for the sake of the public, too. So when you say the county, I'm thinking of two kinds of things. One is our very capable planning department and codes enforcement department. And so that, and they, and for example, if this was located a little, some slightly different land, that would include all the scenic area codes that the county would be applyingus. That's what they do. But another meaning of the county is the public, the people in the county. So I can imagine people would come to county commissioner and say, hey, this is what I think. And is that also a route that you invite people to make participate, citizen's input being drawn come through the county or would you prefer that to happen at the public hearing or both? We certainly don't have any preference. So if the citizens of the county want to lobby you as county commissioners to provide comment on the record, they are more than willing to do that or more than able to do that. And you can pursue those as well. They can also submit comments through our public comment timeframe. Okay, so that's really kind of a local, how the local process is going to work. Good does, in order to have standings at a contested case, does the issue to be contested have to be an issue that is raised previously or can you raise one issue and then learn something and cont, test something else? Sure. Thateah, I didn't expect it. Yeah. I mean, the short answer is it has to be raised at the draft proposed order stage. So we will provide a notice that the draft proposed order has been issued. And that timeframe, which will include an open public comment timeframe and a public hearing know could be here, could be in the Dallas, but in the vicinity of the project, you know, whether it's an oral comment or a written comment, that would have to be made within that comment timeframe and it's raised it or waive it. So you can't then later on try to participate in the contestic case on an issue you didn't raise. It has to be raised during that timeframe and it has to be related to a council standard. So the standards that we included, and it has to be sufficiently specific enough that between the draft proposed order stage and the proposed order stage, we can evaluate it. It can't just be a placeholder. We don't think you met this. It has to be why? And that then gives us, the staff, the opportunity to make changes between the draft proposed order and the proposed order. It gives the applicant an opportunity to respond and provide new information in the record. And it also allows the council to evaluate that",

        "text": " Joely here. You can correct me when you come up to the mic. And next will be Patrick Starnes. Thanks. I really won the lottery here. So yeah, my name is Joel Guyer. I been working over in this and doing bird surveys for quite some time and I wanted to bring your attention and ask you how much you've thought you've given to strict hornn larks, which are known to be in the area where we know this is a major concentration area for them. According to the Fish and Wildlife listing, there was a carve out for grass seed farming, specifically as a type of agriculture that tends to be friendly to them. And what you're talking about wouldn't be the same thing. So I wonder what discussion you had about as far for because I think there would probably be a requirement for federaligation what you're talking about. So thanks. So I'm going to take that one first, just because what I'm goingna try to do with probably some of these questions is orient them towards our standards. I think probably most of your questions should be answered by the applicant, but I think it's important also that, you know, I sort of orient people to later on in our process if you've got questions or concerns or comments, how those will connect. So we have two standards. We have a wildlife standard. So our fish and wildlife standard actually to ODFW's fish and wildlife policies on fish and wildlife habitat. So we will definitely make sure that you anything within the area gets evaluated according to the Department of Fish and Wildlife. The applicant will be required to conduct studies based upon whatever their comments are. I'm less familiar with that species, but if it's on the states threatened and endangered species list, then that will also be a pretty significant evaluation. Under that standard as well. Yeah, it's federally endangered, so, or threatened and the specific habitat type is normal grass seed farms. So. And then just, just for clarification, not everything on the states threatened and endangered species list is also on the federal list. Those lists may be different. So I'm just not familiar with this particular species. So we'll have to look at that. But I think you can answer the question probably in more detail. Thank you for your comment. This is Paul Hicks again from tetra Tech. And the answer right now is brief. We are aware of the LARC and we have met with ODFW early on in our survey process. And at their recommendation they ask we also the applicant, reach out and talk with us Fish and Wildlife Service. And so we have had a meeting with them and their staff about LARC specifically and looking at the potential for how to evaluate that. We did look for incidental observation while we were out in the field this spring and are going to continue to have follow up with fish and wildlife and with ODFW as we go through. I think it's right now we don't have an answer for like what mitigation would look like, if any, because we're still trying to get a handle on like completing the survey process. But I think it's noted that there's potential for habitat and so we're looking into that more closely. Thank you. Thanks. Ok, it looks like Patrick is up on deck and then either Daw or Dan Bowers will be next after that. I'm Patrick Starnes. My wife and I live on 122 Putman here in Brownsville. I grew up in Douglas county, so I, I'm not a pioneer family like many here today, but I did serve on soil and water Conservation District board for over ten years in Douglas county. So I have worked elbow to elbow with farmers and ranchers on those issues. But what brought us to Brownsville was 1872 house that we restored. Many people may know the Harden house on Kirk Street. I know Linda knows that we restored that. So we're excited about more electricity in the valley. My old man and I used to argue in the seventies during the oil embargo about the efficiency of electric cars. And that's what I wanted to talk briefly about compared to. He was a moower mechanic, so we would always argue about his v eight s versus my dream of electric cars because electric cars are about 90% efficient. The 10% we lose is from the friction. And as you know, if you work on v eight s or internal combustion, they're best at 30% efficiency and because we lose so much heat, you know, that's why we have radiators and all that. So I'm excited to see a lot more efficient transportation across the country, especially in Oregon. And I think one of our biggest challenges is our infrastructure favors other things. You know, if you look at Israel, they're starting to develop electronic or electric freeways and I think that may be something we may see in the future. So think of like a slot car so we won't have the need for batteries as much. So I'm just here to learn more about",

        "text": " approved but not under construction. Maybe this year, 2024. Department also has ten natural gas facilities, which includes two mist underground pipeline facilities, the mist underground storage facility, and then of these facilities over, all of these facilities are operating. The department has twelve solar facilities. Two are in operating or two are operating wheat Ridge three solar, and Montague solar facility. It goes by a name. I have a hard time saying it. I even looked it up in the dictionary. But Petawit Fields is kind of the. I don't know if anybody can say that, but I'm just gonna default to Montag solar, so. So, yeah, we have eight facilities that are prov. And under construction. Something. Oh, we have two. We have two that are under construction. Bakeove and solar and daybreak solar projects. Eight solar facilities are approved but not under construction. The eight would be Boardman's solar energy facility, Madras solar energy facility, Oregon Trail solar Facility, Obsidian Solar Center, Sunset solar project. Oregon Trail solar Facility, sunset. Already have sunset. Sorry, have sunset. So west end project Cardi generating station has a 50 wat, 50 megawatt solar facility that's been approved but not under construction. So I'm going to move on to other facilities. The department has three nuclear related facilities, the Trojan independent spent fuel storage installation, the IFCI, and that facility is near Rainier. We have two research reactors and Reed and Oregon State and University OSU. Also under other facilities is a 51.25 megawatt steam generator, and that's in the middle of a paper mill and it's in Springfield utility. So that's all we have is just the steam generator. Also, we have one ethanol plant that produces 44 million gallons of ethanol each year and is located in the boardman Industrial park port of Morro, Morl county. The department has one operating 500 kv transmission line. That's the Eugene de Medford transmission line. It's operating, it's a 46 miles, 500 kv transmission line between Pacific Core. Pacific Core metorating, sorry, Pacific course substation near Medford and then Pacific core Spencers switching stations south of Eugene. So that's that. That's the two meet up and endoints. Chair Grail? Yes. Councilin Byer, quick question. How do you track amendments, many of the things that have been constructed, especially when, you know, they're putting in new blades and things, how do you track those? They would have presumably new conditions and would add your workload even though they've already been approved. So usually when we do our kind of our first assessment of going on site to do inspections, we, you know, we find the major conditions that we want to review or any other materials we want to review. And if there's anything new, like they're building something new, then that's when, that's kind of how we go out and check on it and make sure that everything's going fine from that stage. Thank you, Secretary Cornet. Yeah. For the record. Todd Cornett. Thank you, Councilmb member Byayer. It's a good question, and kind of, you know, the answer varies. We will get an approved facility, and then prior to construction, they may change that. And if that happens, that's sort of almost a reset because we haven't really done anything yet. So that's much easier than a project that has been approved, has constructed as an operation, and then they add a different component. Now we're seeing wind adding solar or wind adding battery, because then you get the complexity of adding new construction, new operation, new pre construction, new retirement conditions. Not all of the old conditions directly apply. So it, you know, going to the point that Sarah was making, the amount of conditions, the FTE, the complexity, an amendment can add a significant amount of complexity to a project in terms of the conditions. And then how do those get integrated? And, you know, we could be dealing with construction and operation conditions on a facility in the same year. So it's a good question, and the answer is kind of, it depends. In some of, it's easier, and some of it is quite complicated. Thank you. And Tom, as you look at those amendment rules, this might be something to circle back on, because it just seems we'll see more amendments of existing projects. At least since I've been on, we've seen quite a few. And then just quite simply, we track it in a spreadsheet. And then also the department has two battery energy storage systems with already within already sighted facilities, and that would be port westward generating project. There's a four to six watt megawatt, or four to six megawatt battery storage facility there. And then also wheat ridge renewable energy facility, 350 megawatt battery storage, battery energy storage system,",

And I think with that, any last questions in terms of how this will flow today? Otherwise, I over to. Okay, sorry, please. Classic. Got the term. So many of you might have seen this slide before, but just in case, kind of our duty to make sure we know how this all fits together. U really big thanks to our consultants here from Hageri, as well as all of you who are doing at our open house. If you don't know me, my name is Rutine G. I'm associate director for strateg engagement here at Odo. So as you heard, you're going to hear a little bit about how we got to the point we're at. You know, what brought us here, the process. And I'm actually really excited to hear from all of you some examples, projects that you're working on or how you think about community benefits and really inform how we take this programs in the next iteration of developing criteria help us think about how to do what was sort of a selection process as well. This slide over here talks about our mission. It's a little introduction to Odo, if you don't know. We are here to help Oregonians to make informed decisions to maintain a resilient and affordable energy system. We advance solutions to shape equitable clean energy transition, protect the environment and public health, and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for current and future generations. Under what we do, you'll see kind of the way that we need commission and there's a lot of programs and divisions here at Odo. Exciting. We have a big report that we do every year. We run programs thatages with the, that the legislature has assigned to us. And for this funding opportunity we're talking about today, it will be a new energy program at Oto that's, you know, federally funded and it will help support a resilient and affordable energy system that kind of links back to ourion. Next slide, please. This is another sort of orienting slide. The picture. After the passage of both the IIJA and the Inflation Reduction Act, Odo recognized that the state would be receiving millions of dollars from the federal government. And the purpose of that is to invest in clean energy, energy effic resilience and other important priorities. We did a number of public and we discussed with our energy advisory work group early when these laws first passed, and we developed these guiding principles on this slide to help us figure out how to prioritize and how to think about all of the funding that's coming our way. So I won't read these all in detail, but, you know, we're basically focusing on equity, including geographic diversity, coordination with tribal governments where possible, providing technical assistance, focusing on cross agency partnerships where we work with EQ and quite a bit. So focusing on those partnerships to help us with expertise and then finally taking advantage of every high priority funding opportunity, but also ensuring that we're having the quality work that putits up every available dollar co best use. So that might mean we might not go to every single funding opportunity, but we want to try to balance that with these guiding principles here. And so you'll hopefully notice in our discussion today that we're applying many of these guidingles, this fundnding opportunity as well. Okay, I think that's it for me, and I'll pass it back to Christine. Sure. So I think we already handled the group introductions for today, so we can actually keep moving forward and move on to the next slide we want to introduce right online. You did earlier, but is there anyone else who joined that or is there anyone you missed a couple addition we've got right we trel one, Kyle from energyest of Oregon, Jessica Rikers from technology and technology and policy manager at Odin, Jim Cryider from the Oregon Rural Action and a member of the Environmental Justice Council Christine go lightly from Columbia river underible Fish Commission, Natasha Jackson from Northwest Gas Association, Sarah Buck Welfer from Pacificore and I believe those are the recent editions. So and then we also have whitmanor dig EQ as that I've mentioned. Okay, thank you. And then u next we'll just kind of pop into where all of this funding came from really quickly. I know many of you aren already familiar with it and have maybe attended some of our other webinars before, but'a quick refresher on where this funding came from and then we'll jump into the need of why we're here. The program is funded under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs act. This piece of legislation a moved thousand $",

        "text": " why we have radiators and all that. So I'm excited to see a lot more efficient transportation across the country, especially in Oregon. And I think one of our biggest challenges is our infrastructure favors other things. You know, if you look at Israel, they're starting to develop electronic or electric freeways and I think that may be something we may see in the future. So think of like a slot car so we won't have the need for batteries as much. So I'm just here to learn more about it and help if it need to bring people together. So, thanks. Thank you. Dan Bowers. Don Bowers and then Jim Johnson next. All right, I'm Don Bowers from Harris Beurorgon, retired farmer. First question is, what happened to exclusive farm use? We shouldn't even be here. I don't understand that at all. Anything you try to do that's not farming doesn't happen Inn county, at least as far as Oregon believe. First gr sexa or somebody off way far away from here in some other country, I guess, right. I don't like thing it looks ugly. It's you're putting it on farm ground, you're going to cover up farm ground. One of these days you're going to be thinking, man, I wish I had something to cook with all this electricity. But the farm ground isn to be covered. So I'm going to address the. So I'm going to address the first one and obviously you guys second one. And you're gonna be followed by Jim Johnson with the Oregon Department of Aquriculture. So he also may be responding to the exclusive AR use. So one of the council standards is land use. And as I talked about whether it goes through the county or it goes through FSEC there the properties in exclusive farm use zone land, it will have to meet all the requirements of the exclusive farm use zone. So those are all in Orego organised statute and Oregon administrative rule. So we will do that evaluation. We'far from over. Second, to answer your question, who is a parent company? Our parent company's name is Hanwa. Yes, they are re south korean. But I would d also like to emphasize that in January this year it did actually .5 billion of our module factory. So we can actually double the output of what we can actually produce here in America. And those panels themselves would actually be used for this project. I forgot to ask my question. I did an intro but I forgot to ask my question. Ok, go ahead. Is all the producers always ask how much per acre, because I understand there's a revenue for the landowner, and so is that a range of per acre or anything? When it comes to the leases that we sign with our landowners is not public information. We did do NDA with them, so for their privacy, I cannot talk about that. No. But can you talk about a range that landowners get per acre? That's something. Again, I can't really speak, but it does vary from county and state to state. But that's. That's pretty much how I can really say. Okay, okay. Jim Johnson's now. And then Tony Kuntz. Again, apologies if I'm getting your names wrong, or maybe Tory afternoo. My name is Jim Johnson. I'm water planning coordinator for the Oregon B reviews. You pointed out, Todd, I. A lot of questions to a lot of comments. I'd first like to point out that this 18 808 footprint involved predominantly value as defined dataral soil surveys. There actually are class one and two. So property class one soils are very rare in Oregon, yet we see those in the South Valley. We have prime farmland within the boundaries, and we also have prime farmland if drained. Drainage is a practice that farmers routinely use in the South Valley. So drainage is not something that would be an impediment to making something prime farmland. Choice f sec versus going toy County I wasn't going to talk about this, but it seems like there's a lot of questions about this. I'm really disappointed in THEEC process because the FSE Sec process for taking an exception to site on exclusive farm use own land is actually easier than going through the county process because the FSEEC process does not require that the developer look at alternatives deciding on high value farmland. So the alternative analysis is out the window. It wouldn't have been if they would have went before Lim county. And that's a policy question. I understand that, but I wanted to bring it up because it's an issue that needs to be settled. One last point on that. That really the reason that you haven't seen large scale projects in the Willamette Valley? Because LCBC adopted rules to dissuade the location of large facilities within the Willanaa Valley without going through the exception process. The exceptions process, it's not called an exception process for nothing. It's supposed to be difficult. The process is actually easier than what",

        "text": " to interrupt with sort of more detail or how some of what I'm going to talk about can affect your work down the road. Hel'have. A better understanding of that than I do. So I don't know if I need to do, like, the for the record thing, but I'm Christy split, the government relations coordinator for the Department of Energy, and I know many of you, so with that we can go to the next slide and I'll kind of dig in session and, and look forward to any questions or comments that you may have as I go through. And that is the hint for next slide. Nancy, thanks. So overall, I always think if you remember that talking about context can be really important. So before we dig in on energy themes and issues, I think it's really, I imagine that most of you are civically, all of you, the on council are civically aware and know that we had an unprecedented, longest and national history walkout that made session a little awkward. Toward the end, especially, we had a six week break in the state Senate being able to do business, and those who were still in the Capitol, including some of the folks who were not going to floor sessions for the Senate, continued to do the work of the legislature. So it was interesting. We had this walkout situation and nobody knew kind of what would happen with it, but we kept having committee meetings and moving those through the process, figuring out the state budget. And so when in the end, frankly, much to my surprise, there was a deal brokered to bring everyone back to the Capitol and finish the session off and passed nearly every bill that needed to pass, like the walkout did not affect, in the end, the outcome of session, I would say, I just think it's really important context and to understand that it did make for sort of different circumstances u than would have happened otherwise. So the bills may have passed or concepts may have passed, but things changed because of those dynamics. And so ill just kind of go through a couple of things, big picture, and then we well ll dig in on citing specific issues. So one note, contextually, is that the state budget, the amount of money that the legislators were able to put into the state budget was much higher than anticipated for most of the legislative session. We were thinking that the budget would be relatively flat from the past biennium, the state budgets on a two year cycle, and so everyone sort of expected something relatively flat. And then to make room for new things, there could be cuts to existing programs. That was sort of the general expectation. And there's revenue forecasts periodically throughout each year, and the may revenue forecast is the one that is the basis for the state budget. And it was much, much higher than anticipated. And so with that additional revenue, there was a decision made to invest about $90 million in climate and energy programs that was not expected. So that made for a very interesting time for us at the Department of Energy. Nearly 45 million of that $90 million will come to our agency, and a lot of new work will be underway at our agency because of that. So just wanted to flag that for you all. Another thing that was unexpected was the development of packages. So as a way, I think, I think this is right as a way of figuring out how to have fewer bills, have to move through the process in a shortened timeline because of the legislative walkout they ended up putting together. In the case of the climate package, for example, that's 20 different pieces of legislation that ended up in two bills. So that makes it really interesting to kind of look back and see what happened. If you look at the bill that passed, you'll get a very limited story versus if you break things out and, and look for those underlying bill numbers, you can find the public testimony, things like that. So I just want to flag that complexity as far as looking back at legislative history. And then finally I want to flag, as far as citing is concerned, that it was a major topic as respect coun council heard about that from me, heard about it from Secretary Cornet, and also heard about it from some of the advocates that had put together a sititing table. It never had an official name that spent a lot of time together, a lot of learning and talking together, introduced a few different possible pathways to pass legislation. I'll talk about what happened in the end with that package, but just wanted to kind of make sure you all know that was a major topic, and I think that it will continue to be a major conversation at the legislature going forward. So you can go back. Nancy, you were right with me. Thank you. So as far as what was in the climate package, I wanted to just give. So next slide, I just wanted to give just a",

        "text": " had noted before, the public comment period is open. It closes on May 3. So a month from today at 05:00 p.m. there are multiple ways to submit comments. You can submit them via email. You can make comments orally. You're not limited to comment one time. You can do it again. You can also use our comment portal. We have comment cards back there on the table if you wish to make a public comment oral comment tonight, we do ask that you fill one out so that we have your name for the record. Again, this public comment period is not a public hearing, and participation is not required to establish standing in the contested case process. So if you can scroll back down, we'll get to the open public comment. So the way this is going to work is we are going to open it up for public comment or questions. You can ask questions sup to the people in the room. If you do want to comment or ask a question. We do ask that you come up and use the microphone so that people on the webinar can hear as well and state your name. And the spelling of your name would be super helpful if you're with an organization, if you can tell us the name of the organization that you are with or represent, and then once we're done with the commenters in the room, we go over to Nancy and she will tell us if there are people that want to comment on the webinar or on the phone, and we'll walk through that as well. So there might be some webinar participants that want to ask questions or make comments, but our first priority is the people that actually came to the mean meeting in person. And so we wanted to open it up to you. So is there anybody in the room that would like to make a comment or ask a question? Okay, please come up, have a seat. Speak into it. Good evening. I'm Phil Brady and live in the Dallas, Oregon, and I'm a Wasoe county commissioner, so. Yep. Got a couple questions first. As a comment, I find it interesting, and a good thing, actually, that the applicant kind of drops out of the process or takes a back seat to the process in that latter half. And why I would say that is a good thing is from the public understanding it, you know, it's now the ode representing the applicant to the FAC. And so it's not like the applicants can't push in there. Am is that the way it's designed? Am I overint interpreting this take? Okay. All right. I'm going to do my best, and if I Imran Todd will quickly correct me. But we are, we are support staff for the council. So our role is not to represent the applicant. It's really to give an objective review of the application and whether or not it meets council standards. And that is our role from once the application is submitted, the complete application is submitted, then our role is to do that evaluation and prepare that information for counsel. I guess what I would want to clarify is we're not there to represent the applicant from that process on. They have their role as well. Would they have a role in, in. Later during, like the proposed order and the contested case? When we go to the public hearing on the draft proposed order, there's an opportunity for the applicant to make comments at that public hearing after the public has commented, and they can also respond to comments that are made in that public hearing. And then if it goes to contested case, there's also a role. Okay, got a couple more questions. I'm not drilling here, but. So as Wasco county commissioner, we will be part of this special advisory group. Yes. Is it our turn to participate? Stay with that slide, please. This is it our turn to participate in the public hearing. There in the middle block you can, but also a, as a special advisory group, you're in those little kind of blue green boxes at the bottom. You have, we have a responsibility and a role to coordinate with you throughout that process, and you can provide us comments as you see fit. It is important, though, if you have an issue that you might want to pursue through a contested case, that you make those comments on the record of the draft proposed order, in that order in noticing that we did get noticed today. So we're on that. Okay. And following up on this was, can I respond a little bit to that one as well, just because it's. I think it's important. So, you know, at the notice of intent stage, which is where we're at right now, is we're seeing public comment, and that includes agencies. So the one slide, which had kind of the bullse s eyes with the study area and the analysis area, this is also something that the county can be very valuable at because you have a good geographic information system, you know,",

Furthermore, I urge all Hillsborough community members to familiarize themselves with our public works facilities and services and to recognize the important contributions made each day by employees in the city of Hillsborough's parks and recreation, water and public works departments. The community gathering will take place on Saturday, May on the Tom Hughes Civic Center Plaza. Thanks, everyone. Thank you, mayor and council for the annual recognition. Just reminded us as we have a lot of equipment, all three departments, parks, plaza, there will be operators there. Children love it. So please come down, join the Saturday market. So hope to see you later. Thank you. And you know what? The grown up club and grandkids are just an excuse for us to be able to plan the cool stuff, too. All right, thank you. And our last proclamation will be presented to Amy Williams. And this is for building safety. Whereas the city is committed to recognizing that our growth and strength depends on the safety and economic value of the homes, buildings and infrastructure that serve our residents both in every day life in times of natural disaster and whereas, our city places high value on ensuring safe buildings for the protection of its residents from fire, windstorms, earthquakes, landslides, floods and other natural hazards and disasters and whereas our city encourages sustainable construction practices, innovative and inclusive building design, alternative energy and energy efficiency, water conservation, and reasonable safeguards for the protection of life and property and whereas our confidence is achieved through the devotion professional trades, persons, contractors, architects, engineers, fire prevention officers, building inspectors and plans examiners who work you around to ensure the construction of safe, durable, accessible and sustainable buildings. And wheReas, in observance of building safety Month, Hillsborough residents are reminded about the benefits of safe, sustainable and accessible spaces, whether at home, at work, or at places where we gather in our community now, therefore, I, Steve Callaway, mayor of the City of Hillsboro, Oregon, we hereby proclaim the month of May 2024 as building Safety Month in Hillsboro and encourage our residents to join with their communities in participation of building safety month activities. Recognition. The work that the building team does here in Pulsboro is amazing. We are very fortunate to work in this city. The projects that we get to see and work on are unlike anything in the state. So you will be fortunate to have this building professional group support this entire. So I appreciate the highlight. And we do get a month. How long does it like our house? From David City Council meeting this month. And next, we have an annual update on the family Justice center. And is it, is Judy here? She's not. She's not. Okay. Well, very good. Welcome. Nice to have you here. And we're grateful for the work that you do and especially for those of us here in Hillsboro. Thank you. I appreciate it. And thank you all for always taking the time with us. It is fantastic to get the opportunity to speak directly with you and a privilege to share the work that we've been doing in the community. So I believe you have packets of information. Wonderful. So I'll just give an overview since you guys have all of the fine, detailed information. But this year, in 2023, actually half a year gone. At this point in 2023, the family Justice center, we saw a great deal of expansion in. We expanded the number of folks that we served as well as the survivors that we saw, and we expanded the number of services that we provided. So we were able to serve and provide services for more folks than we ever have in the history of the family justice center. And that was always a concerning eyebrow raising thing for me to say, council meetings. But while the need is there, it is encouraging to me that we are beginning to meet the full scope of the need. So what we know is that over 40% of individuals will experience domestic violence in the state of Oregon and over 56% will experience sexual assault. So by survey individuals in a year, that is not 40 or 56% of the population of Washington county. So coming out of the pandemic, we saw a great increase in violence and abuse across the country. And here in Oregon, we also saw an increase in homicide to talk with you guys about that last year. So the encouraging part for me is that our numbers are going up, which means that we're starting to meet the need of folks that maybe were not getting their needs met before. The other thing that was fantastic is we have been able to scale to meet that need. We haven't been in the position of saying we're all out of resources. We aren't able to take anybody else this month. We don't have",

        "text": " last line item in this table on this slide, the draft proposed orderuance by the department. Our forecast is to have that issued in February, and although that's subject to change, but that's our forecast. Now, the next couple steps, the DPO hearing, if issued in February, we anticipate would occur in person in March, and that would be followed by council's review of the DPO, forecasted to be in April. And following coun council's review of the DPO, we would forecast the proposed order being issued also in April, with a contested case period spanning the remainder of April and into May. And if all forecasting goes according to plan, council would then review the proposed order in May of this year. So that's our forecasted schedule. All right. U as I mentioned, on December 22, 2023. So a month ago, approximately, the department determined that the wagon Trail solar project application was complete. An application is complete when the applicant has submitted information adequate for the council to make findings or impose conditions on all applicable council standards. And then following that completeness determination on January 3, 2024, the applicant filed to complete application with the department. Following this, the completeness determination by the department. The department provided notice to reviewing agencies and the public of this determination. And let's see this meeting tonight. The public information meeting is not a common timefraame, but we hold this meeting voluntarily to explain the project and the process. Now that we've gotten to completeness, but I want to just reiterate that or explain that a complete application is not an approval or an approved, uh, facility. It's just that we've deemed that there's enough information forsel to make findings or impose conditions. So 'still only at the third step of the process for application requirements and council standards, every project has to meet the same 14 general standards. The magnitude of what an applicant has to provide to document that they've met the burden of prooved for each standard varies based on the type of energy facility and the location of the project. Although what you see here on the screen is just a snapshot of a larger table from a department handout. I wanted to clarify that there is a correlation between exhibits in division 21 and applicable council standards, which are division 22. In rule, for example, the information provided in Exhibit U w waste minimization may correspond with both the waste minimization standard or also the public services standard. So although it's one exhibit, it could sprinkle into multiple standards, whereas the information provided in an exhibit s historic, cultural, and archaeological resources most closely corresponds with one standard, and that's the historic, cultural, and archaeological resources standard. Now, I mentioned that this is just a snippet of a larger handout. That larger handout, which features all of the exhibits and corresponding standards, can be found on the fact sheets portion of the department's website. All right, touching back on the draft proposed order based on the complete application, the department will prepare the draft proposed order, which contains the department's recommended findings of compliance or noncompiance with the Cing standards, as well as the conditions we recommend the council to impose under each of those standards. Once the department issues its draft proposed order, another round of public involvement is initiated. There is, as I've mentioned, a public hearing associated with this phase, and this would allow, or is it or is intended to allow anyone to comment on whether staff's initial recommendation in the draft proposed order is correct. A hearing officer conducts a public hearing conducts the public hearing on the draft proposed order where members of the public and reviewing agencies have the opportunity to testify at the hearing or or submit written comments by an established comm comment deadline. Okay. Public participation at the DPO phase anyone who participates during this phase, at the hearing or during the comm comment period. Well, I guess anyone that wants to participate beyond this phase, beyond the DPO phase must raise an issue either in person or at the hear in person at the public hearing, or by submitting a written comment to Odo before the DPO comment period deadline is before the DPO comment deadline. Failure to raise a relevant issue either orally at the hearing or in a timely submitted written comment precludes further participation in the FSEC process. So, in order to participate post DPO phase in the proposed order phase, or in contested case phase, you must participate during the DPO phase and within the DPO comment timeframe. Persons interested in being considered for party status in the contested case proceiving must meet two criteria. The first relates to timing. As I just mentioned, to be eligible to participate in a condescent case on the application, a person must raise an issue either in person at the DPO hearing or in a written comment submitted during the comment timef Frme before the record closes at the conclusion of the DE at the conclusion of the the comment",

        "text": " slide you can see how the lines of I five start to jar a little bit. And really, just off of that, the slide is Eugene and Springfield. So it's just really north of Eugene, Springfield, you can see to the west. I don't know how well you can see the slide, but you have Junction City and Coburg. And then to the north of the site on the east side of the highway is Brownsville. So this gives you a sort of a bigger sense of where it is. So it's right there, just north of Eugene and Springfield, right along I five. So next slide, this is more of a zoomed in map. Again, you can see I five is a little more to the left of the slide. You can see the black lines are the project boundary. And then the green line that kind of runs through it is an existing 230 kv Pacific core transmission line. So that's what I would assume the reason why they're proposing the project in this location, the Green Hollow square. It's a little bit hard to see, but you can see the purple line that stands out a little bit more. Just to the very top of that purple line is a green hollow square. Thank you. That is the existing substation? Yeah, that's the existing Pacific core diamond hill substation. This is why the purple line would be the Gentili line. That's why it's a very short Gentili line. The project surrounds where it would interconnect with the grid. So again, probably the main reason why they're proposing this is it would be very or relatively inexpensive to connect it to the grid based on its proximal location to the transmission line and the substation. The yellow square, you can kind of see at the bottom of the purple line. That would be the collector substation for the facility. And then the solid green square would be a ten acre centralized battery storage area. So that would be where the battery energy storage system and I talked about the configuration or the diameters of the container units, you know, that would hold the batteries. That's where they would all be located, is in there. So it gives you a sense of where the project is located and the facilities associated with the project. Are there any questions about the configuration? Yes, madam chair. Yes, council member Devlin. This is not to state anything for the record about the council's ultimate decisions relative to this, but if I've got the area correctly, and I'm looking at it on other maps, it appears that there'at least there's one area that is set aside for wetlands preserved that might be close to the area. But it appears almost all of the rest of the area is in active cultivation and I don't know if that's for grass seed, given where it's at or if it's something else, but it all appears to be, or much of it appears to be an act of cultivation. Yeah. Thank you, Counciler Devlin. I believe that is the case. So when we receive the notice of intent, you know, the purpose of the notice of intent is that it's a fairly general overview of what the project is, who's proposing it, where it is. So at this point, we do not have all of those details in the record. My understanding, though, is you are correct. I believe if not the entirety of the facility, then certainly the most of it is in grass seed production just in that area. Typically in Lynd county, there's a lot of grass seed production in that area. And I believe is that is. Well, we will certainly know more about that as we proceed further into the review process and that all that information will be required to be in the application once it's submitted. But again, I believe you are correct. Thank you. I don't have this on any of the slides, but I will make notes since we are just working on it right now, trying to get the notice out again. We'determined that everything that's required to be in the notice of intent is in the notice of intent. And we are working, particularly Chase McRaay Walker is working on the notices. And so we intend to have a notice, a public notice, sent out on Tuesday or Wednesday. So this would be the adjacent property under notice, the email notification. And then likely Thursday of next week, we'll have the newspaper notice out. So that will alert people, if they're not already alerted to the project, that we received the notice of intent and that we are going to be holding a public information meeting in the city of Brownsville at city hall. And I believe that is on July 25. That would be in the evening, starting at five o. But we'll confirm all those details. Those will be in the notice and we will send that notice out to the council as well. So you'll see that early next week. Next slide, please. I know we've done this several times, but it's probably",

        "text": " we certainly want to honor our recipient for the Agriculture hall of Fame as well. Okay, we want to thank everybody for being here today, and we most especially want to recognize Bill Phillips. He was a county employee at one time. He was the county extension director. We have a great partnership with the board of county Commissioners and the University of Florida, where we extend the University of Florida's research based information to our farmers in the community to help make them more efficient and better productive, productively, rather. Bill was very instrumental, and I know y'all have heard a lot about volunteers and things like that in the past when we've recognized volunteers, but he was very instrumental in starting our master gardener program here in Marion county. We're gonna have a celebration on the 16th, which is next Thursday, to honor him and all of the people in the community that he supported, and all will be there to help us share how much we appreciate his efforts and how much difference he made in our community. Agriculture is extremely important. It's a very big economic driver here in Marion county, as you all are very aware and most importantly is that, you know, before, and we talk about history, and unfortunately, I wasn't the best history student because I was a little bit of a slow reader, but I loved history. But as long as you were telling me about it, and I have really enjoyed Commissioner Curry and all of his information. But as far as history is concerned, you used to develop your calendars around the farming industry, and that was because it took so many farmers to make the food that was available to us. Now, an average farmer can serve or feed about 165 people with a lot less land, and all that because of the educational and research backgrounds in what they're doing. So here I am, talking way too long. I'm going to turn it over to Caitlin, who is our livestock agent here in Marion county. And then I'm going to let Bill just say hello to you and share anything he might have. Thank you, Lynn. Good morning. So I want to highlight that Farm City Week is a national event that we are fortunate to celebrate here locally, and it really does highlight the partnership between our rural and urban interfaces and the fact that each depends on the other. Agriculture is a huge economic driver, not only for the state of Florida, but nearly 25% of our workforce in Marion county is involved some way in agriculture. A lot of that is due to our large equine industry, and we rank first in the number of horses in the world. Here in Marion county, we also ranked 10th in the number of beef cattle, and we ranked first for the number of sheep and goats. So those are some fun facts, trivia statistics for you. The state of Florida is a specialty crop state, meaning we have over 300 crops statewide. We don't have all of those here in Marion county, but we do have quite a few. Marion county agriculture is quite diverse because unlike other areas, you know, the days of owning super large tracts of land are going away. But we have a lot of people moving here, buying 510 1520 acre pieces, and getting really involved in specialty crops, aside from just our livestock producers. So we definitely rely on our agriculturalists here, and we are super excited to celebrate all of them every day. That's our job. But we're excited to bring some of our best before you during Farm city week. And this year, it is Bill Phillips. I just want to say a few words. My history doesn't go back to 1840. In fact, I was born in Virginia, but I have lived here for 55 years and I've seen a lot of changes in the county. Marion county is a beautiful county for agriculture also. It's a beautiful county for growth and that's why so many people have come here. And I thought during the week what comment I would make to the commission and to you folks that are also here. It's an awesome responsibility to manage the growth and leaving land for agriculture. It's not an easy job. People want to come here. The county planners and the commission have to deal with the issue of growth and then leaving farmland to make our county what it is to be a great place to live. We don't want it to be all growth. We don't want it to be all our farms. We want to welcome growth, but to manage how that growth comes about and still leave land for farming is a tough job. And I hope and pray that you folks can be able to do that. So thank you very much for the honor and thank you much for being here. Well, thank you, Mister Phillips. We do certainly celebrate you and all of your contributions through the years and we're proud for you and we appreciate what you've done on behalf of Marion County. I think I can speak on behalf of this board. We have",

        "text": " believe that that was in the law. But it's also something we think is fairly important because we know that utility bills are a significant burden for a lot of customers. And we want to make sure that programs like this don't increase their bills even further. So if I could back up for just a moment not about the income qualified customers, but what you said earlier about whose program this would be. I'not sure you intended it, but how I heard this is, if you want to do this, you're on your own. It's your program. Good luck. That's how I heard it. And that doesn't feel like a partnership. And that doesn't feel like something that we're interested. And, I mean, we're not experts on energy and this sort of thing. And so I'm not sure if that was your intended message. That's kind of how it came across to me. And I'm not sure that you're going to get any jurisdiction particularly interested if they're going to have to take this on themselves. I mean, so I'm wondering if I. Did I misunderstand you, or is that really where went. What PG's position is like? This is just something you're offering as an enhancement that we might choose, or you're really entering into a partnership with us. That's a really. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify that. And I don't know if I misspoke or if there was a misunderstanding, but I'll just say if that's the message that I communicated, then I did a bad job. Because this is a partnership. We really value our relationships with the communities that we serve. And if anybody, if any city or county in our service area chooses to go down this path, we will be there to help make good decisions. What I really want to communicate, though, is that if Salem or Portland or Milwaukee or any other community chooses to do this, it's the community choosing to do this. PGE will absolutely support you as you make decisions. Even in the tariff that we've drafted, we say very clearly that there will be a PGE. Steve, what'the word we use, representative? I think somebody that can sort of serve as a consultant to help you understand the issues that you're facing. We will be there the whole time. My message is just that, like, this is a decision that only a local community can make. And we will support the communities that we serve regardless of the decision that we make. If you say no, then we will continue to be the partner that we have been for many, many years. And if you say yes, then we will absolutely need partners to make this program successful. Thank you. Other, other questions. I have about five or six questions, but I can waitill the end if no has questions. I don't need to interrupt it now. All right, I think we're ready to continue. Riley, I think we'continue. Okay. I believe that's the presentation. So I guess next steps. Steve, you want to go to nine? We have internally a very close to final draft of this community green tariff. We will be getting it out to stakeholders, including Juliana, in the next couple of weeks, and we hope to file it with the commission in the next few months. That's where we can really use help from our communities to show up at the commission and say that this is a structure that you can support. Because, again, we're doing this because of interest from our communities. And that's going to be very important to the PUC to see that this is a concept that our communities can support and would like to participate in, or at the very least have the option to participate in. We expect to have this approved by the commission by sometime before the end of the year if things go well. And once that happens, we can really start having conversations about what a particular program would look like for a community. We can begin those conversations before the commission approves it. But once we get that approval from the commission, then we will really have the total clarity on how the program will and will not work. Okay, I think. Are we ready for questions then at this point? Yeah. Great. All right. Hi, Riley. My name is Mike Slater. I hope you're well. I'm not an expert in this area, but I've been following it for maybe the past year or so. So I do have some specific questions, if I can go ahead. Yeah, of course. Okay. So my first question is, you said once the money is committed and that money is for the infrastructure to build a green facility. Is that correct? That's certainly an option. We can do a lot of things with this money. The other option that comes up, other options that come up pretty frequently are additional energy efficiency or like tree planting. Those are some things that cities have talked about using with using or funding with this program. Okay, so it could be like carbon offsets,",

        "text": " the community emergency response team could be operating, as well as other loads that are within the island district. But those would be the key ones from the perspective of assuring that structures or facilities that are essential to the public welfare and that energy dependent critical public services have continuity under a grid outage scenario. No, absolutely. And that is a sort of priority criteria for this program. And so as they would bepge customers, normally MPG would be involved in this project, then those customers are the ones that are benefiting, especially the emergency services. Emergency preparedness aspects of it definitely seem to fit under the guidelines of the program. Also want to point out the community grid Resilience grant program, which has aspects specifically for up to a million dollars toward. You have to have some renewable generation connected to. So you'd have to have like a solar with the battery backup. But that is a standalone project that the city could apply for and get up to a million dollars for a solar plus microgrid project. So I would definitely take a look at that program, if you haven't already. Which program? I'm sorry, I was distracted for a moment. Yeah, go aheadi no'community the Community Renewable Energy grant program Y and it's the exact samesolute program. Yeah, we're looking at that as well. A question in that regard, and I know that's way off topics, it just weighed me off. But the expectation in this district is that it will be built out over a series of years. And as vertical facilities or infrastructure are built with that would come rooftop solar, carport solar. So the pv generation will come online over time. So I think that being able to demonstrate the expected full pv generation upfro front isn't realizable because of the incremental nature of the build out of the district. But you got to start somewhere and you need a microgrid, you need a large best, which could be in the near term, substantially fed in the evening with clean power, and then be able to be used by PGE under a PPA to do load shifting during the daytime to reduce fossil fuel peaker requirements. Then, but under a black skies event, it islands whatever powers in the batteries available to feed the critical infrastructure within the resilience district. And then over time, I'm talking about within a three to five year period as projects within the district are built, like the public works facility, the police facility, a market rate apartment building retrofitting an affordable housing project with solar that we would incrementally be adding up to three and a half megawatts of solar pv that could also be feeding the battery and could, could supply it with power in an island mode. But the solar generation will come on over time, incrementally, and won't be able to be there upfron day one. One, one thing you could consider, and I'm sorry for, for interrupting, but one thing you could consider is the planning grant, part of C rep, to sort of flesh out the things that you've just talked about here today and get some funding to apply toward the planning of this project that you seem to have a really good idea of now. And then also consider, you know, altering the project around the requirements of this grant. Because, you know, again, it could be up to a $3 million. And if you had different projects, you know, different buildings can be different projects, even though in your mind there are phases of a project for the life of CRP, those could be separate projects because they're probably going to be behind separate meters on different buildings. And so the other thing I was going to recommend is that, you know, in the beginning, maybe you can do one public building, get rooftop solar, then you do have your generation going with the battery backup and the microgrid right from the beginning. That could be something maybe you could consider to have one building, one public building, get rooftop solar. So you do meet the generation requirement. Makes sense. Talking, John, you should really be talking to our staff for the C rep program probably about it. It sounds like maybe, yeah, currently have that application open. It closes on May 10. I know we are, and we're working on a planning grant application under c rep now, but I couldn't resist the temptation response to, you know, one of Clay's comments to wander into c rep territory. So I beg your indulgence in that regard, and I'm happy to stop, stop now. And there are open hours available with c rep staff. So we probably got your email address, but maybe if you pop it in the chat, we can make sure you get those. And then you could talk about this with Jason Canalsson team over there. Yeah, I've attended one of those house open hours and on my calendar to do so going forward. So yeah, I can continue this conversation with them. So thanks. Thanks again",

We have Dwayne Killils, Don Odo compliance officer and Sarah Estersson, Odo senior policy advisor, to provide counsel with an update on compliance program activities. I was. Thank you, everyone. Our lunch is here and since we're planning on doing a working lunch, how about we take ten serif. It's okay, we take ten minutes and we get our lunch and then we can continue on if everyone's all right. So we are re going to recess for ten minutes. Okay. The time is now 1110 and we are going to resume our meeting. We have the annual compliance review agenda. Item F Dwayne kills donk, Odo compliance officer and Sarah Estersson, Odo senior policy advisor, are here to provide counsel with an update on compliance. Okay, good mid morning, chair Grail and members of the council. Again, my name is Sarah Estersson. I'm the senior policy advisor in the sititing division and with me is our colleague and citing divisions, compliance officer Dwayne Kil stonk. So the goals of our presentation today are to provide you an overview of the compliance program and to highlight some of the changes we've been implementing over the last few years. We'll also touch on some of the challenges of the compliance program and some of our ideas for solutions that we'd like to just throw out there to get your feedback on. Next slide please. So the overall mission of the compliance program is fairly straightforward. It's to regulate and enforce the terms and conditions of site certificates that you issue you as the council. A site certificate has on average over 100 conditions. Council has 41 active site certificates today. If you want to do the math, that's over 4000 conditions that the compliance program is responsible for. Plug for a solution. When you are tasked with reviewing a draft proposed order. In that draft proposed order, embedded within each evaluation a standard are conditions that staff recommend. And then at the end of that typically 250 page document, all conditions are consolidated into an attachment. Look at those conditions. Ask yourself, is this really needed? Is this redundant? Is it clear? Because those are the questions that we're asking in the compliance program as we sift through 4000 conditions. Okay, so site certificates contain requirements that apply at different points in time. Those points in time are pre construction, construction and operation. And because these phases can happen simultaneously across projects, one of the changes we've been trying to implement in ##ally is to delineate these phases in task management and record keeping and in responsibilities. So pre conststruction as a phase generally I have been managing and support with the additional compliance officer position that we have. We don't have that fieldled right now, but we are interested in getting that filled. The next phase is construction. That phase is typically I am significantly supporting that phase. We get help from a senior sighting analyst, but that's pretty challenging given our workload and with support and inspections from our environmental consultant Hal and Aldrich. And then in operations, which is really the biggest long term phase of a facility and a site certificate is our lead compliance officer and Dwayne K. Killz Doock. That's also supported in part by our environmental consultant Hal and Aldricdhge. There's also another subpar of the compliance program which we call as incident reporting. This is difficult to predict, but it's a requirement and rule. And often in site certificates where a certificate holder has to report an event like a fire or equipment malfunction that resulted in an environmental impact like a spill or an explosion, worst case scenario. And then we track that. We evaluate whether we think it is an issue of non complliance or just limited to an incident. Either way, depending on the significance, we track remediation of the issue. Chair Gres. Sara, thanks. Quick question. Under the construction phase, are they complying with local building permits, or is that's really not even a review that they do. It's more of an FSE SEc review. So electrical and building code and associated permits are outside of f sector jurisdiction. Right. I think the closest we get is like conditional use permit and zoning permits. We require that those be obtained and demonstrated to us. So they're being inspected by the county building inspector and the electrical inspectors should be'sorry, this is Dwayne Hills, compliance officer. Greetings. Greetings, chair GRL and other council members. So, yes, so Cari generating station, when they built their little, they built a maintenance building and office space. Both they did have their building permit and they had it inspected. And then all of a sudden they had their electrical permit that was, you know, that they came on site and inspected.

We need every partner at the regional level, at the state level and the local level and the federal level to provide. There's a comment about this, our board saying that this was last time some of the fundings were even discussed at the federal level was the Reagan time, was the last time. So she resonated with a lot. We talked about, you know, really needing help to tackle this funding challenge in this problem. So it was a lot of those ask national, nationwide problem and we need help tackling this challenge. A lot of those rudder. So some of the discussions that we had and some of the things to carry forward as your board representative attending that, it's a really good discussion. A lot of the boots on the ground really brought forward even bigger. And some ask that was really important to the congresswoman. I feel like they shared some experiences, some of the real challenges and the federal level barriers stopped could cause people to be homelessness and besides the funding that we brought forward. So that was really good experience. Kudos to our staff, kud us to every community partner organization that was there. There were quite a few people, though. A lot of people showed up and it really made the congresswoman happy to see a great turnout. And I did let her know that all of our board members couldn't attend. I'm here and did the welcome and did a whole, you know, let us feel about hardwood Commons in district one and some of our good work. So kudos Marnie and Jess Larson and your team. And Metro was in presence. Quite a few teams of Metro was there. So we really did demonstrate the ask from our board to say, look, every, you know, the collaboration that's here, we just need your federal funding, give us some more money and she is going to work hard. And Erion Doyle, our government relations was in the room. So I think'get some money, hopefully. Right, Aaron, just because Aarn was there. Yeah, the lobbyist. Lobbyist is in the room. So good. Yeah. Good tour. Congratulations. Very well organized, very ARG. That concludes my update. Yeah, well, I have a tour tomorrow as well with AI Hillsboro, with Congresswoman Boonenamichi, and of course county staff will be there as city Hillsboro. So what are you going to take a look at you this. Where are we going? Do we know the hills? Oh, very good. Okay. Yeah. The Hillsboroug shelter site. That's great. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Right by the winle. Yeah. O. So, yeah. And then of course, I canceled all of my vacation and all of my meetings to be at Tom's retirement party. Oh, thank you. Thank you. I appreciate prioritize that, Tom. You just, just noted it's the only commissioner that. Anyway, with a little luck, I will be on an airplane and not delayed by weather or other logistics. So I would rather be celebrate on Friday, right? Ye, another one. Yeah, me too. I cleared my calendar for you because Jerry. That's right. Yeah. I also had a GPI meeting this last week. They've had a couple of marketing consultants, you know, working for a GPI to try and first of all, work on GPI's messaging and enhance their membership and certainly their focus in the Portland region. And then they also have another consulting company that's been working on how do we enhance Portland's national image? Talked about the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and others that have written disouraging articles on the city of Portland. And so how do we reach out to our media folks and get them to maybe modify that? So working on that all costs money to do those kinds of things, in which case we'd need spons, GPI would need sponsorships to do that. So that's their focus. I also had lunch today with person I hadn't seen for quite a while. She used to be with PGE. She now works with Zavtech, which Mea Rogers. So she explained it to me that when we have, especially our data centers, when we have a power outage and to the time that they can fire up their generators, there's a twelve second gap in there. So they're working with them on battery storage. So battery storage is kind of becoming a big deal. PGE'of, course, more interested in that, as well as number of other companies. But so she kind of explained that to me and what the purpose of and why she switched jobs. She'd been with PGE for 20 years and decided it was time for a new adventure. So she did that. But other than that, it's a pretty quiet week and we're going to enjoy it, because",

        "text": "Miss Les Perkins has joined us. I we'renna see what happens here and how many folks give folks a little bit more time to join. So far it's just you, though, less. So we might just elevate you to a panelist and chat with you. Perhaps we'get started in just a couple minutes, give people a chance to get on there. Well get started in just a minute. All right. I think we can go ahead and get started. We have a nice small group, and I'm kind of tempted to just see potentially if we might just elevate everybody who's ont to a panelist so you can kind of mute and unmute yourself as you see fit. So im telling my coworker Patricia to see if she can maybe do that. Im not positive, but its such a nice small group and that way you all can just kind of control how you interact because its just, it just seems like it might be a better plan to me with a small group like this. And I love it. It'like, perfect. So we're really grateful to have all of you here today. Nice to see some faces if you want work. ##nn I'll go ahead and kind of run through our agenda today, and I think we're going toa do like a little bit of a presentation and then we'll have most of our time for Q and A. So we'll go over the program, talk about a project example just to kind of get those creative juices flowing, talk a little about a bit about the application process, and then we'll turn the PowerPoint off, turn our cameras on if we want or not if we don't want, and just talk about questions that folks might have about the program. If you want to introduce yourself in the chat, go for it. Well, we can also do our round of introductions when we get to the Q and A or whatever feels right. So I'm Christriie split and the government relations coordinator at the Oregon Department of Energy. I'm here today with a couple of other of our program staff for the Community Renewable energy grant program, and just want to thank you for taking the time. I also really want to thank the Oregon Water Resources Congress in April, who I knows on the line for coordinating this and helping us to bring this opportunity to you all to learn more about what we think is an exciting opportunity for Oregon's communities, an energy resilience and renewable energy grant program that can support both planning and projects. So, so this is that agenda I mentioned. And then for those who aren't as familiar with Webex. I did kind of change the way this looks on you a little bit because all of you are now panelists, so you can unmute yourselves, turn your cameras on. Just thought it'd be better. Right. But you'll see that if you did want to raise your hand versus just like, literally interrupting me, which is fine, really. You can go ahead and unmute yourself and then, but you can raise your hand, and then I can call on you in like, a more orderly fashion, which might be nice, too. So you can raise your hand either by clicking on the little smiley face in the bottom corner of the screen there that you'll see at the bottom, and there's a raise hand option, or you can also click next to your name and raise your hand. And then hopefully you found the chat and you can just ask questions there. And I'll make sure as I see them, we'll either get to them in the moment or we'll go ahead and, and answer them when we get to the q and A, go through them there. So if you have something you want to ask, just get it out there and then I'll make sure we get to it. Let's see. So any questions on the agenda, any concerns about Webex, feel free to try raising that hand or letting me know. And it doesn't look like we have anyone on the phone, so I don't have to give that spiel, but maybe the other staff members that are on the call. If you see someone on the phone, maybe ping me so I can tell folks how to participate that way. All right, so let's get into the program a little bit. So the Community renewable Energy grant program was established by House Spill 2021 during the 2021 session, and it was known as the 100% Clean Energy for all Bel. But it also included this particular program. And the purpose of the program is to offset costs of planning and developing community renewable energy projects, to support projects in traditionally underserved communities. And we'll get to that definition that they use for those, those communities in a minute. And to promote small scale community renewable energy projects and finally, to provide direct benefits to communities across Oregon by improving energy resilience, creating local jobs, promoting economic development, and reducing local energy costs. And one thing I want to flag here on this is the statutory definition of resilience is",

        "text": " it's called the fire management plan. Trying to remember all the titles of it is an attachment to exhibit v, as in victor of the application. So there's a fair amount of detail, both in your construction and operation, about considerations that will need to be taken to reduce the risk of fire either moving through the facility or being created by facility construction or operation. Got it. Thank you so much for your response. This is one follow up in exhibit b in the application. It shows very clearly that EOS energy enterprises seems to be the battery OEM. If you guys were to go down the route of selecting the zinc hybrid technology, I just want to confirm whether or not it is in fact EOS energy as the zinc battery technology, or are there other zinc technologies out there that you guys are considering? I know that Logan had mentioned zinc air. I'm not sure if that was a mistake, but is EOS energy Enterprises the, the battery OEM? And the reason why I bring that up is they're building out manufacturing capacity in their Turtle Creek facility, which, which you would clearly, you know, be suitable for the level of scale needed for the project. So I'm just curious if there can be a comment on that. Yeah, great question. This is Lina again, and the application, the way the application is structured in exhibit b. Like, boy, because I thought you said be like Victor at the beginning, but exhibit B includes several examples of, for example, what panels, you know, an example of panels that might be used and some different figures for what the battery storage technology might look like, just so that you could t get an idea of how the project would look and what kinds of technology might be used. Those are just ex examples, and they're not a final technology selection. They're just intended to provide a basis for the impact analysis that's presented in the rest of the application. I don't know, Chris, if you want to say anything else about that. Yeah, no, no, just that. Yeah, we will kind of. Again, we're looking at really the test case. And so we do appreciate that you all provided kind of specific examples, particularly for measuring like how much panels might weigh if you pick a good example like that. But the department and the permit will not be vendor specific, so we're not holding the applicant to any particular vendor as long as you're selecting a vendor that has, you know, complied with the applicable underwriter, laboratory standards for fire safety and things like that. So, yeah, we, again, you know, I think what's in the application is really representative of what is kind of the worst, most impact scenario. I would say worst case because I think big facility is not necessarily the worst case, but most impactful configuration of the facility and it's not meant to be binding. At least that's how we view. Got it. Thank you so much for your time and good luck. Thank you. And I'll just say I probably did misspeak when I said zinc air, so AP proologies for that, but zinc hybrid is correct in terms of what we've described in the application and what the Veos example would reflect. And Mister Henry, I'll just ask. We probably got your contact information when you logged into Webex. Would you like us to share that with the applicant team? Hi. Sorry I was muted. Yeah, that's fine. I'm actually an investor in the company, so yeah, I'd love to have a conversation with someone offline about the opportunity for the battery project. So thank you. Yeah, we'll make sure you can get in, judge. Thanks. Right. Any other hands online? Okay, well, I'll give one last call for comments in the room or online if anybody wants to raise their hand'more than welcome and not seeing anybody, I'll just say thanks to everybody for coming out tonight. I hope this was helpful and we will at least be around for a little bit. I'm assuming you all can stick around for just a few minutes if people want to chat afterwards. We sure will. Thank you, Chris. And to all the folks that are on the line who didn't ask a question, please do find a way to get in touch with us and we'd love to keep a conversation going if you do have any questions going forward. Great. Yeah. And my contact information is on the screen now. So if you email me, I'm happy to pass messages along to the applicant team. Like I said, I, I think both my contact information and Logan's information or email address that we on our project page. And I'm sure you can find Pine gate renewables online as well. All right, do we know how many people were online? We had a 21 on. All right. Thanks again, everyone. We really appreciate it. Thank you. Thanks.",

        "text": " are things we should work on in terms of timeliness of reviewing agency comments that might help staff. It just seems like we're always waiting for additional information, not always, but sometimes, and we need the input from those agencies and if there are things we can do to streamline that process. So it's just something to put out there for the future. And yet again, they should be included on the list. So, you know, our mistake for not including, and I agree with you, you know, we just, like, we support councilme members, you know, we feel it's our job, well, to support everybody, frankly, to make sure that they understand how to participate in our process, what their role is and what are the things that we can do to make that as easy as possible. The difficulty with reviewing agencies is you, everybody's at capacity, and just because we can't even provide them resources, funding doesn't mean they have the staffing to be able to do that. So we spend a lot of time trying to, with reviewing agencies, trying to educate them, trying to help them, to give us the information that we need when we need it. It's an ongoing process and, you know, an ODFW who actually has a body, who's assigned to be our liaison, at least that's part of his role. No other agencies really have. I mean, they may have somebody who gets sort of, sort of maybe a sign, but, you know, in my time here, I've seen that happen and that person moves or they resigned to somebody else. There's a constant education component that we have to do for reviewing agencies because there could be staff turnover. There could be, you know, a long timerame between when we actually worked with that agency. It may be that, you know, we've had a couple of years where the projects don't really trigger that agency for review. I mean, they're all noticed, but not maybe substantively so they may not have participated a couple years later on, you know, we got to educate them again. So there absolute is a lot, you know, that we need to be thinking about to try to make that processes as easy as we can for them, for staff. Yes. Thank you. All right. Thank you. That's it. It. Okay. Well, welcome to the team, and we look forward to meeting you in person and collaborating with you as you get through the initial time. And if we can be of any assistance, as council members, I think we'd all be more than willing to offer whatever perspective we have. Wonderful. Thank you so much. Thank you. All right, next on our handy list is a request to amend mitigation plans. This is an action item. We have Sarah Estersson, senior policy advisor, here to present. Good afternoon, Sarah. Good afternoon, chair Grail and members of the council. For the record, my name is Sarah Estersson. I'm the senior policy advisor with the Oregon Department of Energy Siting Division. And our agenda item today is to present you with changes that are proposed by the certificate holder for the noxious weed control plan and the fire safety plan for patch way wet fields. Formerly known as the Montag Solar Project, Patchwayitields is a 162 megawatt solar facility. It occupies 1000, 1189 acres in Gilim county, and it has only been in operation for less than a year. They started commercial operation in April of 2023, so less than ten months. The intent of the presentation today is to achieve several goals. The first is to remind and inform counsel and the public that mitigation plans change outside of the formal permitting process, outside of the site certificate amendment process. Another goal is to pull the department and coun council into the details of mitigation plans, which can be challenging when you're reviewing a draft, proposed order, or even a final order just due to the volume of documentation you have in front of you at that time, and then lastly to seek substantive input on the changes that are actually proposed and any questions and comments that you might have. And I do apologize for my voice at the January meeting. We had a similar presentation, council review changes to proposed mitigation plans for four facilities. And so as we, as AMT just mentioned, continue to grow our compliance program, I believe this will be more common as we're able to focus on limitations and even failures of mitigation plans to achieve what they're trying to achieve, or they might need to change based on improved understanding of site conditions, better approaches that we want documented in those mitigation plans. Okay, so as discussed at the January presentation, we want to point out that the statute under Orus 469402 is the authority that council exercises to delegate future review and approval of mitigation plans to the department. This delegation applies oftentimes in pre construction conditions where a condition would defer final",

        "text": " the RFA one, the certificate holder did indicate that a lightning protection system would be incorporated into the turbine blades. That, from what I understand, provides a pathway for the current to go through the blades and downunce through the tower and be grounded to reduce fire risk. I think the certificate holder represents that that would eliminate fire risk from lightning. And I think we all know that's not the case. It reduces it or minimizes it, but there is still some risk there. The wildfire mitigation plan does call for monitoring during red fl white warnings. And based on some of the review of the data from the National Weather Service, it is my understanding that red flag warnings can be issued in Morerow county in conditions where there might be a dry lightning event. That means that there's a lightning storm combined with other high fire risk things. So most of the provisions in the wildfire mitigation plan are, are related to whether or not construction work will occur. U they do reference that there will be people monitoring the site and monitoring firew weather, and then during operations, it would be monitoring by the SCAD system that's incorporated into, into the facility components. Uh, I, yeah, I guess I will open the floor to you all to think whether, uh, you believe those adequately address these concerns or whether you think we should go more Gr. For the record, this is Marcy Grill. I think what I would be curious to know, obviously, there's a distinct difference between construction and operation. Generally speaking, wind farms don't have a whole lot of folks running around during operation, and so it might be something to identify during high periods. But the other part to councilmeer I'point about coordination in general. When I think about these wildfire mitigation plans, and I think about the ones that utilities have, that they have at least the ious have to submit to the PUC coordination because if, you know, my experience right now is during, um, high risk seasons, they are like, nope, you can't do anything. Shut it down. And so are, are they working together? Because in general, when you think about the transmission lines, you know, they're, they're doing their const. Anyway, it's just I think that's something to, to ask the developer about is are you coordinating with the other facilities, utilities and things around? Because that's where I think the risk may come. And then ultimately do they have the same bandwidth to stop work? If, you know, if a local utility is saying, you know, we're at a red five morning, we've got everybody out patrolling line because we're worried and you're just trucking along, that's not helping that community council byer, this is a much simpler God. So, but if we can have the provision about the lightning protection systems reflected in the wildfire mitigation plan, because I wouldn't have thought to look at the project'specs, I would like it there because that at least says, yeah, this is a thing and we're concerned about it in this context. Thank you. Thank you, council member. I will just say my own research on this show that if there are issues with the whitening protection system, that's when there can still be a fire risk. So I think we would also recommend that inspections of those components be specifiede. Thank you. So the next big topic area was that there was inadequate consideration of firespread potential during high wind events and that the potential for impacts to residentss, agricultural buildings, equipment, cropland and cropland soils wasn't adequately address in the wildfire mitigation plan. And so we agree with those comments. We do think that the plan needs to be revised to address these issues. We would like guidance from the council on to what extent you think those revisions need to go. How specific is good enough to, to really say this? I mean, in some ways, I think we would at a minimum, like to see at least contact between the rural fire service providers and an agreement that explains who will respond to a fire and where, and that there's a protocol for the on site managers to provide them with constraint maps or at least direct the fire suppression activities away from sensitive resources. In a more ideal world, we'd like to see maps and figures showing exactly how everything will go down, but I know that's maybe not realistic. So as we're open to any council suggestions on this issue, council Grail, I think I'm okay with putting a little burden on folks because of the impact for what we're talking about. And I think if we leave it too subjective, then again, our responsibilities to the communities and that that they have, they should be able to go to sleep at night knowing that there is a real plan not to make believe my experiences. In moments of crisis, people panic and we need to ensure that the certificate holder and the developer are doing everything possible, that it's documented, people know what to do and there's no question. And to council",

So I would encourage you to maybe read those deadlines closely and the parts around extension of deadlines, and see if you think there's anything, uh, that you would suggest related to that, especially those of you who, who work closely with developing projects. So we. We appreciate your close reading of the rules. We can go back and make sure that our rules, as drafted, match the intent and what's in the bell, since there's different readings happening. One thing that I'll flag to is in the conversations about the bill itself. It was actually the Department of Energy that actually first raised concerns about what we thought were shorter timelines. So we understand the concern, and we want to make sure that we do our best to honor it. So, thanks for flagging that. Know, we know that's an issue. Yeah. Thank you. Did Ray and Angela, it looks like you're. I'm not sure if we're able to lower your hands. Maybe send a chat if you have additional comments or please let us know. I think Gry's back again because his hand went down for ra. Okay. Yeah, great. Oh, Angela has more comments, too. Thank you. Yeah, sorry, sorry. Yeah, I think that you guys have a great source of data. If you take a look at what has happened over the last two years with the Oregon community solar program in IU territories, you can have an exact determination. There are 34 projects going on currently in that program, and most of them, as I said, are still in the planning phase. And so for a variety of reasons, you know, negotiations with interconnection and all sorts of things. And so perhaps reaching out to the folks who run the Oregon community sol program at Eto might be useful for you guys to get some data to see how long it actually takes these projects to get through the process of planning. That's a great idea. Thank you. Sounds like it's my turn again. Okay. Yeah, I have a ven of. Of comments in addition to that one. So just to, first of all, to add on to what Ray was saying. Yes. Planning often takes, well, I would say usually takes years for projects that are on the larger side, like a larger community solar project or a utility scale project. And so that is a pretty tight timeline in terms of extensions. Let's see, on number 14 on page five, has a good cause section for extending a timeline. And I'm wondering if we can think about other wording instead of good cause, because sometimes you need an extension, and it's not due to completely unforeseeable circumstances, but something that you reasonably didn't expect. So, for example, most often, delays are caused by the study process that utilities go through, and one can reasonably expect that those studies would be completed on a certain timeline, and then they might not be completed by then. And so I'm wondering if we can change good cause to something like reasonable instead. The term reasonable is defined in something that the PUC uses in different parts of their regulations, and it needs quot an event or circumstance that the grantee at the time the deadline is established, could not have reasonably anticip pa and not within reasonable control of the grantee. So that makes it a little more flexible what that extension could be for. The way it reads now, it kind of sound, I think we're all in like a Covid mindset that this would be like if the governor would shut down the state or something. But there are other, I think, better ways to allow folks to get an extension. And then the, I mean, the thing with the planning grant, like Ray said, that'six months is really short and realize that's in the statute and there's not a lot we can do about that. What that means, though, is that really the only entities that can probably take advantage of that planning grant are projects that have already started the planning process. And so then when it gets to the part about consultations that seem like a lot of consultations for planning, and I think if my memory serves me right, a lot of those were in the statute itself. So I guess the suggestion is that if we can stick, when it comes to consulting for a planning grant, we can stick to only what was in the statute and not have any extra ones, any extra consultations, because every consultation you add on makes it more unlikely that you can actually finish within that timerame and then I wanted to a comment about the opportunity announcements. I assume that those announcements are informed by the rules, but is there, would there be a case where an announcement would have new information or new criteria that wouldn't be included?",

        "text": " the megawatts of solar capacity deployed, the tons of CO2 avoided household savings, as well as average funding per household savings. In addition to that, there are requests for meaningful benefit plans. So one of those examples is that setting a minimum that 20% household energy savings is of the average household utility bill in the utility territory is achieved through deployment of these funds. So basically, we're looking to help save energy through solar technologies, particularly with low income households and disadvantaged communities. We're also looking to increase low income and disadvantaged households access to solar deployment options, deliver on energy resilience and grid benefits by creating capacity that can deliver electricity to low income and disadvantaged communities in the event of grid outage and maximizing household and community ownership models in solar technologies. Next slide, please. So in order to achieve those impacts and outcomes, we'll have to take on certain activities. The application from the US EPA breaks those down into a distributed solar market strategy, a financial assistance strategy, which they would like to see 75% of the funds to be used for financial assistance for these projects, and then a project deployment technical assistance strategy, and an equitable access and meaningful involvement plan. All of these applications right now are early stage concepts which we'd love to discuss with you all today. And with that, I'll hand this over to Rob del Mar to start to introduce our early stage concept. Thank you, Jen. And just an audio check. Is it coming through? Okay. All rightty and there we go. Okay. So for Oregon's concept to spend these funds, we've got some broad goals that I'll describe momentarily. And then we also have some more programs, specific ideas that I'll cover in future slides. So from the big picture, we really want to utilize these federal funds to bring benefits of solar installations to low income and other disadvantaged communities in Oregon. And to do that, we know we're going to need to be working with community partners to reach out to these disadvantaged communities. It will involve increased incentives for single family, multifamily and community solar projects that provide benefits to low income participants. We also would like to develop some long term strategies that can remain in place post 230 when the federal funds are no longer available. We would like essentially low income participation in future solar programs in Oregon, even when the federal funds are all spent. And finally, kind of over all of these goals, we would like to have a workforce development program so that we have a diverse and equitable workforce to essentially install all of this solar that we hope to install in the next five years. So this is a quick view of the different program tracks that we would like to develop within solar for all. And it starts with single family. And this will be, again, an increased incentive for low income participants to be able to access benefits of solar installations on their own homes and for folks that do not own their own homes. We have plans to also develop a multifamily incentive, and I'll get into these in a little bit more detail in a moment. And when we can't get the solar on site, we also have two different approaches for community solar projects. And one is community solar in investor owned utility service territories, and another is community solar in consumer owned utility service territories. And that's most of the rural parts of the state. And again, overarching all of this, we would like to be working on workforce development so that we can reach into every corner of the state with an able workforce and living wages to get all this work done in the single family program. We really want to utilize these federal funds to increase the incentive stack and cover a high percentage of project costs. And to date, we have had many different solar programs in Oregon. They've provided millions of dollars worth of incentives to Oregonians over the years. Primarily, we've been able to reach affluent households and moderate income households, but we haven't done a great job of reaching low income households with these programs. And so increasing this incentive stack with the federal dollars is one way we can see. To do that, we will be leveraging energy trust of Oregon programs. And the Oregon solar and storage rebate programs that are already developed already have a known application process and online application platforms. We want to utilize these existing programs to essentially minimize the administrative burden for contractors and homeowners to access these additional federal funds. We also recognize that to reach a new group of program participants, we're going to have to coordinate with partners and the Oregon housing cap agencies, Habitat for Humanity, all of these organizations, and many others we plan to work with so that we can make sure that we can access this new market and also coordinate work with other contractors that may be doing roofing or insulation or efficiency work in the same low income housing space. And finally, we'd like to explore ways to extend the federal funds to essentially provide support to the low income market beyond the grant period ending in 2030. And when we talk about increasing the incentive stack,",

        "text": " So last week, both councilmb members Truitt and councilmeer Cond and received emails from members of the public. I people just sort of searched you all out and tried to find your emails, and you both received emails expressing opposition to the project. Councilmber Truitt and Councilmber Con and promptly sent those emails to me asking what you should do with them. And so essentially where we're at now, because there's no open public comment timeframe, this creates a potential issue with the record. Council members are obligated to only rely upon information in the record with which to evaluate and issue a decision. So information that you receive outside of those timeframe must be disclosed on the record. So that's what we're doing today. You, Nancy, printed the two emails that the two councilme members received. You all have those. Chase, McVeay Walker, who's the project lead, has provided those to the applicant and we put them in the record of the project. So this is one thing that's important to make sure that it's all disclosed so that any final decision by the council is an appropriate decision and it's based only on information on the record. So now this information is on the record. So my recommendation to you, should you receive emails in the future, is to do exactly that. Do not respond, you know, forward them to us. If somebody engages you in a verbal conversation or calls you on the phone, my recommendation is to politely cut that off. And should you receive any kind of substantive information from them, it would need to be disclosed on the record, such as we're doing today, and forwarded to the applicant to make sure that they have an opportunity to respond to any information as well. What we've done with the two emails that we received or to the people who sent them is we've responded to them and told them we're not in a public comment time frame. It's not the right time to provide information to council members to influence them really in any way, whether you're for or against a project. But we want to try to pivot those people away towards staff. We do not have those limitations, so we're not subject to that same limitation. It is our responsibility to work with the applicant, to work with the public, to provide as much information on how the process works. And so we responded to them and said, you know, please don't send more emails to councilme members, but we are here to help you. We are here to walk you through our process, the project, do whatever we can to help you fully participate in the process. So that's what we want to pivot towards, is getting those people towards the department and away from counsel. So, yeah, I would say, you know, essentially this is primarily a quasi judicial body, not a legislative body. You do legislation when you do rulemaking, but the applications and amendments are quasi judicial and you are limited to the record. So it is very important that these projects be treated fairly. Again, doesn't matter if somebody's proposing, being a proponent or an opponent of the project, that all that information has to be on the record. So I know this is somewhat new to some of you. Some of you have had extensive experience dealing with these issues. So I would just stop at this point and say, is there any questions or thoughts or ideas or preferences in the way you would like to handle this? Obviously, we have to have in a legal way, but there are a number of ways that we can handle it as well. So I just wanted to throw that up in terms of any thoughts or ideas or any experiences you'd like to share if you've dealt with this issue before. So. Councilmb member Cond yeah, I have a question. I have never dealt with this before. So the fact that it's not a public comment period, but now it is part of the record, how does that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me that it's not a public comment period, but the comment is included in the record. So could there be a lot of emails that come in a non comment period that end up being part of the that we do this time and time again? Well, only if they search you out and find your information. If they send an email to us or try to provide comment to us, we let them know this is not a public comment period. It doesn't go into the record the same way. We're not obligated to provide that information because that's not part of the decision record. It's outside of a comment period. We don't share it with you, that then has no potential influence on you. But in this instance, if for your sake, council, counciltandan, you received this email and if you didn't share it, and then later on you use information in that email to help make your decision on the project, and that wasn't shared with the applicant and that wasn't shared with the other council members, that could jeopardize the",

        "text": " through us, it's the same require. Thank you. Okay, Steve Hood and then Lois Hawk is next. My name is Steve Hood. I live gap already had, but I have a couple, couple comments and full disclosure. I think solar fields are terribly ugly. I travel the US for my work and I end up in a lot of out of way places and I get to look at them. And I think almost everyone I talk to says that are ugly. And I think one of your standards is appearance. And I think one of the ways they mitigate that is they move them out into these areas that I work in that nobody has to see them. And that to me, is the polar opposite of what we're doing here. When we're parking it literally on the shoulder of the thoroughfare of the state, and it's got this ragged configuration, and everybody that passes by is going to have to look at it, and it's so big and so close that you're not going to be able to get used to it. You're not. It's just going to be an eyesore out there for 40 years. And I know that doesn't seem like much, but you'll be 70 years old in 40 years. That's how long that is. I mean, your kids will be flying cars, you know, by then. So we don't know what's going to happen, especially when I hear this thing about an experiment. But, and I'm also, I'm not anti solar. In fact, I looked at doing solar for my house and I, you can't see my house from the street or my neighbors. So I thought that mitigated the ugliness of it. But I called the provider and they said, don't do it. You're in a terrible area for solar. You'll never recoup your investment because of the climate where you're at. And so that made no sense to me why we would want to park one here. And I guess that's why it has to be so big. So that's the only way it pencils out for you. But then I realized that listened to your presentation. The reason it's here is because we already have, what did you call it? The power station. We already have a power station. So that just saves them a bunch of money and time. So it's really just a benefit to them is why they chose it. To put it here. You could build a smaller one somewhere else that could generate just as much power, or one this size, that could generate a whole lot more power. And I mean, we don't have to put it here. We send power clear to Texas, you know, through the transmission line so it doesn't have to be here to use it here. And the other thing that I thought about is, you know, something happened. I mean, you buy a house, you never know what's going to happen. Your neighborhood, you can always pack up and move, right? I mean it's a, it's expensive and it's a hassle, but you can always move. These are 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th generation families that are going to spend the next six generations. They can't move. And when I hear, I thought I heard you say a standard is not the depreciation of the people's. And that's'm shameful to me. That's amazing to me that that would not be a consideration when you're imposing this on people that have in essence no choice. So. But I appreciate your time. I. Go ahead. Just the comment on the reason why we're here. The main reason why we c. The project here is because there's actually demand within the Willamette Valley. If doing studies with theility, having conversations with them, there's actually a demand for the generation. A lot of people say that we should move the project to the east side of the Cascades, but truthfully, there's complications with sending power from east of the west side, especially over the mountain route. So if there was not a demand for it, then we wouldn't be here, I guess. Other thing is I talked to a guy who was a CEO of a big corporation down in California. California. He mentioned that a lot of people use this whole thing about grazing sheet because it's feel good thing, because they bring it in to mow the grass. It's the cheapest way they can do it. So really, again, it's a benefit to you, not to anybody else. It's just the cheapest way to mow. And then they're gone. Bring them in for a very short time. Everybody here knows how fast that happens and then they're gone. So it's really it to say that we're going to be raising sheep there unless there's some different plan. But it didn't sound like there's much of a plan. So it may not work. So in most parts of the US, projects aren't actually grazed by sheep or any type of animal, they're actually mowed, because when it comes to",

        "text": " for the applicable provisions of the FPA. So here's, this is just little blurb like, you know, we, you know, we reference and we talk about it under land use and public services. The context of public services was related to fire in those areas. But basically council does not assert jurisdiction of the FPA and refers the applicant to submit its request for exemption directly to ODF, the Oregon Department of Forestry. And so here, down here in this footnote, making you, everybody get real squinty here. Okay. As detailed in this order, the applicant recommends in council various conditions related to compliance with FPA. So related to compliance with the requirements would minimize potential impacts underneath applicable council standards. Butsel imposing such conditions is not intended to assume enforcement authority over those requirements, but rather council finds compliance with FPA would reduce potential impacts underneath public services, or it says protected areas, but in land use. So another example of this is council has conditions that say, and the certificate holder will build and construct and operate the transmission line consistent with NRC standards. Right. Right. And it's a represent, well, some of that comes from council'mandatory, conditions, but there's also these representations from the certificate holder that says, hey, we'Renna, we're going to maintain this standard. Council doesn't have. You're not saying, well, we are going to go out and we're going to enforce NRC standards, but it's more of a representation. So that's kind of aligning here. So now I'm going to go back to those, the certificate holders responses and the comments. So that said, because we know that there was a lot said about Forest practices Act, the certificate holder, which also they kind of reroute, which we hadn't really raised, that we specifically address in the second amended project order FPA requirements, which that's the document that says, hey, these are the applicable rules to your facility and there we kind of reroute them and direct them to ODF as well. So that said, I'm not going to go through these now. Idaho Power gives more. They kind of entertain and provide responses. Oh, I guess the one aspect of their response I do want to say down here. Okay, roads. Okay. So consistent with land use condition for Idaho powers, coordinating with ODF to ensure that all project related roads and forest lands will be constructed and up upgraded consistent with the FPA. It includes this plan for alternate practice and we'll finalize the plan. And so they're working on it and they're working with ODF andw on that. Council member Devlin has a question, I think comments for the comments that were provided by b two h. I frankly just assumed that, how would I say it? As the energy Facility siting council, there are going to be a lot of things like the Forest Practices act where the applicant is going to have to comply with if they become under that act, if they take any action that's under that act, they're going to have to comply with state law. In that case, if they have to have any fill and removal permits, they're going to have to go to DSL and get those. They're going to have to transport a lot of materials to build this. So they're going to have to comply with all odot requirements. And you could probably just develop a very long list of these. And it wouldn't be something that we would have actually in the order. It would just be assumed and I think expected that an applicant would comply with all other applicable requirements. And it could be a very long one list, to be quite honest. Of course, you're going to apply all OSHA requirements for all of your workers. That's a very good comment, councilmb member Devlin, and I know that you weren't here for the final decision on the application, so you're probably relative new to the project, but that is kind of the intent of the council's consolidated review. So it's interesting that you mentioned removal fill. The removal fil permit is actually under council's jurisdiction. Sosel actually did make a decision on the removal fill permit. So, but it's interesting because it's like there's some, it's, whether or not a permit is ministerial is one of kind of like those thresholds on whether or not it would be appropriate to be undersel's jurisdiction. It kind of is up to what the applicant proposes. Right. Because, you know, it's like applicants can somewhat opt for the consolidated review or go seek out their permits elsewhere. However, Oot is an external permit that they would never nonetheless need to comply with and get their permits from ODOT, comply with OSHA standards, etcetera. Yes, there's probably a long list. Yes. Yeah. So that said, I'm not going. I'm just, I'm not going to go over any more of the Forest Practices act comments or responses. And these are, I would say, stop b two h. They do",

So we'll be into grant complete and project completion on our first two construction projects from the program. A lot of our projects are a lot more extended in time. So that's why you're not seeing a lot more of the construction projects coming into completion. And then one of the items that James will be talking about with our proposed rule changes will probably wind up, we believe, are going to accelerate the timelines on a lot of the C rep construction projects.

Requ ##ested the bucket we had available this round, we actually bumped it up 6 million from 12 million in the first two rounds to 18 million in this round, which was a good thing, because this was the highest number of applications for a C rep round, as well as overwhelming amount of the construction projects that came in, which were a total of 55, 41 of those are resilience projects. And actually, we're in the process of doing some information requests, and we had a couple of projects select the wrong category on their application. So we're very likely looking at 43 potential resilience construction projects that would be moving on to competitive review. Along with that, we had 20 planning applications. And as I said before, with a couple of those round one planning grants, that wrapped up another really, really piece of exciting news for the program and really showing the efficacy of the program is that 22 of our 33 current planning grantees submitted for construction funding in this third opportunity round that represents 67% of our current grantees, some of those have not completed their planning. They're in that final stage of doing their project reports and their final documentation. So that's how they were in a position to have the information necessary to be able to move their projects into construction. So that's very, very exciting. It has also amplified the competitiveness. This has always been an excellent competitive program, but the competitiveness for the projects moving into competitive review has really gone up another notch. We're really excited for getting into that process for this third round, if we could go to the next slide, please. And so, as just a quick breakdown, construction resilience recommends equals out to 35.2 million in requests. Construction renewable sits at about 10.1 in requests, and then planning projects combined represent just a little over 1.5 million in requests. And I'm going to go ahead and toss it to my colleague Patricia for some additional information on round three. Okay, next slide, please. For the round three applicant type summary, there were the types of organizations that applied were tr. There were three tribes, two consumer owned utilities, seven counties, 24 cities, and 39 other public bodies with a variety of schools, community colleges, water and fire districts. Next slide, please. Energy resilience use cases included a range of responses to energy disruption events such as heating and cooling for emergency shelters, powering emergency response centers, power for first response responder facilities, drinking water availability and cooling, food storage, meaning food banks and distribution facilities. Next slide, please. Notable technologies included solar battery storage, microgrids, hydrogen. Hydrogen, meaning small scale renewable energy production, storage and electricity generation for emergency power, biomass and in line hydro and geothermal exchange. Next slide. And then several of the applications include grid tied battery storage systems to provide power for peak grid demand periods. Next slide, please. All right, as we said, we're trying to move it along just a little bit here so we can get into the rule changes as well, but just want to stop for a moment and see if there's any questions that our advisory committees have on the third, on the first two rounds or our current grantees or round three. So we'll go ahead and give that a moment. And Patricia, you'll have to tell me, I can't see all of the background screens if we have a hand raised or a comment come through. No questions. Well, hopefully we can at least get a thumbs up from everybody for the excitement of round three and those planning projects coming through, as well as some really, really exciting projects that are coming through for that third round. Patricia had mentioned the hydrogen one, which is a very interesting project utilizing one of our first instances of utilizing hydrant as a potential energy storage within one of our projects. So lots of very, very innovative",

        "text": ", and their values and community aesthetics and whatnot. And so for the local folks here that aren't aware, like I said, this is just a quick little research I did. But what I found out is the proposed acreage for the project area is thousand 1588 acres. And out of that, there are 761.89 acres that have a tax address out of Nampa, Idaho, and then another 76 acres that have a tax address out of Redmond, Oregon, which is a total of 837.89 acres owned by landowners that appear to not be locally present in this community, which totals 47% of the proposed project area. That's all. Thank you. I don't have any more cards. No more cards. I know there may be some people. If anybody else who's in the audience wants to comment, please raise your hand and I'll call on you one by one. Okay. I know you, and then you, and then we'll go to that side of the room after that. So second. Yeah, my name is Scott Arian, and I'm a landowner just north of this project. And you're supposed to represent and protect the people of Oregon. Is that correct? In a way. In a way. So our process is the. Think about it, is the environmental review process, or much like a county land use review. So we conduct the review. We have standards. You. We're here to make the process work for everybody, for the public, the applicant, the state agencies, local governments, tribal governments. Our process is to run a good process that ultimately holds the applicant accountable to meeting the standards if they can prove that they meet the standards. Okay. Are you trying to get in front of future problems? Yes. Okay. There's been a little bit of talk about the street torn lark. It's down to like, they're arguing how many birds, exactly? 900 to 1200 birds. And there's eight areas left of critical habitat. And this area where their project is and then up around Diamond Hill Road is one of the critical. One of the eight critical areas. You guys mess around with this bird and you folks out here. Well, so can I get you to, again, talk to the microphone? I'out here aware of the spotted o and what it did to that industry. Well, you are about have the gates of hell fall on your shoulder if this bird is listed. And you are about that close. People talk about a lot of things, but once this thing's listed as endangered, I'll tell you what happens. They walk out with a map, they put a big circle around. When they find arts again. Can I get you to speaking the mic? Any thing you get to do in that circle, folks, is pay the taxes. That's it. You don't do anything else. So all you folks need to think really hard. And you folks need to think really hard because this is not up on Humbuck Hill. And I am going to quote a politician told me one time when we were fighting this, he said, you loggers don't have enough votes. When this bird in this valley gets listed, it's going to affect everybody from Roseburg to Portland and beyond. And you folks are going to have your hands swifled. You cannot imagine what's going to happen. So you ought to think about this. And all you folks out there need to think about this. Thank you very much. My name is Dave Rogers. I moved to Oregon in mid seventies. About the time LCDC was being informed. Moved from California, northern California, as they were building homes, tracked homes, factories, industrial areas, and taking up farmland with these. And when I moved to Oregon, and I'm a solid conservative when I move. And when I first came to Oregon, the idea of LCDC and taking people's rights away from them and not letting them do what they wanted with their land really offended me for a little while. And then it became really clear that if we didn't have something like LCDC, we would end up just like California with every town attaching to every town and tractomess and farmland gone and orchards gone. My passion is wildlife, waterfall and conservation. This area that you're planning to cover with solar panels is one of the best natural wetlands, seasonal wetlands that there is. And you're gonna destroy two and a half miles that we seasonal weland actually more like 4 miles stretched out, but two and a half square miles of this excellent habitat with nothing to replace it. I've built wetlands all the way from down around Eugene all the way to north of Brownsville. We've got a flyway of waterfowl that use this in the winterime. Thousands and thousands and thousands of waterfowl. And what this will do if this goes through is to interrupt a section probably close to 4 miles long,",

        "text": "Good evening and welcome to the July 2 Hill Council meeting. We'll start tonight with our work session, and so thanks to those who are foregoing a little bit of sunshine this evening at our farmers market and are joining us. So with that, I will turn it over to Robbie Hammond. Thank you, mayor. Good evening, everyone. Tonight we have actually two work sessions scheduled before city council simply because both of them are fairly quick. If we don't get through the second one all the way, we can always extend it past the regular city council meeting. So the first meeting we have first work session today is Robin Strong is going to be providing us with our climate action plan update. So I'll turn it over to Robin. Thank you, Robbie, and good evening, council, and thank you for having me to join you tonight. My name is Robin Straughan. I use she her pronouns, and I work in the city manager's office as the sustainability and resiliency manager. I'm going to walk you through a pretty brief presentation, but I will have plenty of time for your questions if you have any questions. And as I just shared with the mayor, I am the lead in this area, but I am not the expert on all things climate. So I do have my note paper here to take down questions that I may not be able to answer, but I will try to answer whatever I do know. So here's a quick agenda for my presentation. I'll share background on the city's climate planning work to set the context for you. Next, I'll review the timeline for the development of the city's climate action plan. Then I'll discuss the data and projections for greenhouse gas emissions specific to Hillsboro. I'll share the engagement and outreach activities that we have done so far to support this climate work, and I'll wrap up with other climate related projects and programs underway at the city. And feel free to stop me any time if you have any questions. So here's a visual depiction of how the climate planning work fits into the bigger picture of the city's work. So the climate action plan was initiated last summer as a way to comprehensively address climate change in our community. Our climate is changing as we've seen with more extreme weather events and prolonged heat waves. We're expecting one this weekend, so hopefully you're all preparing for that. So this plan will document how the city will reduce our contribution to the problem, as well as help our community adapt to the changing climate. So the climate plan was one of the recommendations of the city's environmental assessment. That assessment was completed by Portland State University in 2022 and defined key environmental and natural resource recommendations for the city. The assessment work is one of the city's environmental sustainability priorities and is now incorporated into the city's new strategic plan. And the strategic plan is one of the city council's priorities to help keep programs, projects and all the work that the city does on track and accountable to the city's mission, vision, values and goals. So this shows a timeline of the climate planning work indicating some of the key milestones in the process. And keep in mind, this is a two year project, so we're about halfway through the plan process to date. So in the next few slides I'll spend a little bit of time on each of the projects we have completed so far. Those have check marks on this page. So I'll share a recap of the Kennedy Greenhouse gas inventory and also show a forecast that I haven't showed to you before of the greenhouse gas emissions for our community. I'll go over the stakeholder workshops we hosted and I'll share the GHG mitigation measures we are considering, as well as an overview of the city's climate change page. And the work that's still ahead of us includes a specific look at the benefits of our greenhouse gas reduction strategies on low income and disadvantaged communities, an assessment of the workforce needed to complete the measures we want to do, development of climate adaptation and climate resilience strategies, and gathering input from our community. So we'll also be working on the development of the plan documents, which will include city operational strategies and climate goals. We're currently aiming to bring the plan to council for review by next summer. Are there any questions on the timeline? Okay, so this chart provides an overview of the community community greenhouse gas emissions inventory showing where the biggest sources of emissions are. In Hillsboro, we know that greenhouse gas emissions are and the burning of fossil fuels are responsible for climate change and warming our planet. So as a reminder, I presented the full greenhouse gas inventory report at the council work session last December. So this is just one slide recap of that longer presentation. So just a quick snapshot to remind you of where we are with our emissions. So on this chart you'll see the blue, yellow, green, yellow and orange bars represent our local emissions. So local emissions occur directly in the community or nearby due to activity in the community. The energy used in our buildings, primarily electricity and natural gas and transportation energy which includes gas",

        "text": " strategy meetings? And I might just say, I'd interpret the term financial support broadly. If there's really any support that you think would be important, I might say yes. And I'll just mention, because you can see the second question up here, even though we haven't gotten to it yet, but just to get folks thinking who have already answered this question, the next question is going to be fill in the blank. But I kept these bullets just to give a sense of some of the kinds of things that we're thinking of. But I know that there are others and we're just really interested to hear from you in a fill in the blank format about resources might help enhance participation. And I'm not sure, I'm kind of looking to Jessica Abbeby, I'm not sure that we're going to see the answers that are fill in the blank up on the screen. Is that right? Because for me, anyway, it kind of threw me back to the first question, or maybe we haven't teed up the second question yet. I do not see the fill in the blank question. Ok. It hasn't come up yet. I saw it for a moment. I think maybe it was just to foreshadow it coming. You want me to go ahead and which to that question? Y yeah, if you don't mind. I think we've given folks enough time and maybe I can add while people are filling this in, that we're also happy to hear from you if you want to go kind of consult, consult with others and come back to us with ideas. We're very happy to hear those ideas, too. At the end of this. Oh, you can see mine. I put a period and so I could see the responses, something I'answered, so far. We have an energy strategy email address or you can use my email address. We're very happy to hear from you anytime. But this is also a great chance for the broader group listening into the webinar to see a little bit of the types of things that folks might think are helpful to support participation. Jessica, you popped up, so maybe there's a question relevant to this that we want to talk about. It's not relevant to this. I want to make sure that we give people time to fill it out. But I do have a couple more questions for you whenever you're ready. Okay, well, and maybe what I'll do. Abby, can you leave this open? I. And I might just read out a few of the answers that we're getting now. And then. Jessica, I was gonna go. I think I just have one more slide, and then I'd pass it back to you for the Q and a, if that's okay. Absolutely. So I think. I think there's some really great ideas here, like support for mileage for people living in rural Oregon. It seems like there's a lot of virtual meetings here, flexible meeting times. So, again, I think, Abby, I think you can keep this open while I go to the next slide. So why don't we keep it open for a couple more minutes, and then folks can kind of type anything in that they're still mulling over. So, yeah. So this is my last slide, which is, how do you get involved? There are a few ways. So I realized that we still have some details to work out that we weren't able to present today. And that's, again, because we're just onboarding our consultants, onboarding currents and west. So there are a few things that we'd like to encourage you to do. So one is to check out our project page, which you can see here. You can also sign up for email updates on our project page. And that would just make sure whenever we send something around, like when we have the forms ready in a link for expressions of interest for the advisory group, we'll send it around an email. We'll also post something to social media. We might do some outreach just directly, too, to make sure that we get the word out as widely as possible. But it's really helpful to us if we know that folks are signed up for email updates and are aware of the project page, which is also where this presentation, the slides, and the recording will be posted. And then you can see here the email address for the project as well. So I think the only other thing I'll say here is that the one kind of concrete entry point that we have right now is the advisory group and filling out expressions of interest. So if you think you might be interested in, just keep that date range in mind June 10 to 24th to prepare your, you know, just to prepare to fill in your expression of interest. And I think it was July 9 or 10th that we would be planning to have that first meeting. We thought it would be helpful just to give everybody a heads up on when that might be so they can mark their calendars. So with that, Jessica, I'm",

        "text": " to work out a few essential financial details, but we expect that to be wrapped up soon and then we'll initiate the process it just described. Next slide, please. So one of the key procedural elements that we initiated the notice of intent phase is to a request counsel appointment of a special advisory group. Special advisory group is a term defined in statute, and it is a designation applied to the governing bodies within the location where the project will be located. So in this instance, is within the city of Medford and Jackson county. The governing bodies there are City of Med, city council and Jackson County Board of Commissioners. Those two entities, once appointed, will play a very important role in this process. We will give them a formal letter, but do outreach with them where they identify requirements from their local zoning ordinance or development code and comprehensive plan that they believe applies to this project. They can also provide interpretations, findings of fact, conclusions, conditions that they would have applied that same criteria to a similar project, and we would assume to use that and understand it so it can be consistent, and then we'll work with them throughout the entire process. This is actually, I think, a lot of our favorite parts of the job, to work with counties because they have positions that are the closest to what we do. So they actually understand generally what we're asking of them because they do it in their own daily life. So next slide, please. So as vice chairman, vice chair Hal mentioned, we are here today to requ council appointment of these two entities, City of Medford City Council and Jackson County Board of Commissioners, as the special advisory group groups for the proceedings of the application for site certificate, which includes the not of intent for the lone pine to whtonone transmission line project. And I believe the two options you have is whether you choose to appoint them in one single motion or in a combined motion. Now, the floor is worse. And is there. This is consant fire. Is there a rationale for doing it as one motion versus two? Is that for the jurisdictions convenience or does it matter? I. I would think there might be slightly slight benefit to doing them separate. Just for the record, sometimes governing bodies change. Like we've had a county court become ab board of commissioner. So if we can keep them separate. It might be easier, but that's why. Otherwise, I don't know. Vice chair, how are you? Ready to entertain a motion? Oh, yes. I had't unmuted and I was busy talking away there. So anyway, sorry, if there's no further discussion, then I can't see you. So somebody speak up and make a motion. Either one or a combination of one or separately for the city and the county. This is CI. I'm m happy to make a first motion regarding Jackson county. So, chair, how I moved that the council appoint the Jackson County Board of Commissioners as a special advisory group to advise the council in proceedings related to the review of the application site. Certificate for loan p to Whetstone transmission line as presented and recommended by SCA. Okay, do we have a second? Sure. How? This is kr by our second. Okay, we've had a motion and it's been seconded. So, Secretary Cornet, could you please call the Ro. Kent how? Yes. Ann Byer? Yes. Richard Devlin? Yes. Perry Chalkt? T? Yes. Cdy. Condon? Yes. Motion carries. Mister vice chair. Thank you. Okay, so we're ready for a second motion. This is Caine. Member condent. I'm happy to make a second motion regarding the city of Medford. Chair, I move that the council appoint the city of Medford City Council as a special advisory group to advise the counsel and proceedings related to the review of the application for the site. Certificate for the loan. Pine to Westfone transmission line as presented and recommended by staff. Second. Okay. Okay. We've had a motion and a second by Councillor Devlin. So, let's see. So, Secretary Cornet, do you want to call the ro or am I hearing that maybe somebody's wanting to say something? We didn't hear anything here, Mister vice chair. Oh, okay. I heard a few things come through, but. Okay. So, secretary Cornet, please call the roll. Ann Byer than Perry choct t. Perry choct two ye. Yes. Thank you. Cindy Condon? Yes. Richard Devlin? Yes. Ken Howe? Yeah. Motion carries. Mister vice chair. Okay, thank you, Secretary Cornett. And with that, I'll turn the meeting back over to chair Grail. Thank you very much for taking care of that.

We would be expecting to issue that proposed order next Friday or next week, I should say prior to April 20. Sixthadline if that timeline holds, then we would be looking at a deadline for contested case requests on May 27, right before your may meeting, which was scheduled for May 31, at which is the earliest d the council can make its final decision. Just note that all of that is really contingent on the discussion today, as well as whether or not there's any contested case requests after we issue our proposed order. Slide please. Just as a brief reminder, the facility we're talking about today, Wheat Ridge east, was originally approved as part of the Wheat Ridge Wind facility and that facility was approved in 2017 and has subsequently been divided into four successor facilities, Wheat Ridge one, two and three, and then Wheatriidge east which we're discussing. Wheat Ridge east originally was a separate turbine group to the east of the whe ridge facilities connected to the main site with a 30 1 mile transmission line which actually if we go to the next slide'see, a map. Thank you. So you can see in sort of the northeast corner of the map on the slide are the wind micro siding corridors and then the remaining corridor going to the south and then the west is the interconnection transmission line corridor. That's a overhead 230 kv transmission line. This original facility was approved to include 200 wind capacity as well as 20 battery storage capacity within this 4582 acre site. The sites located in both Moro and Umatila county the next slide please. As you can see in RFA one, the certificate holder is requesting authorization to expand the site. This includes of a different couple types of expansions and we got some comments that this wasn't entirely clear in the previous strap pro order, so I'll try to lay out how we'reending to explain it in the proposed order, but hopefully also give a better idea of what's happening. So from that 4582 acre approved approved site boundary, which is the same as the micro citing borders. Currently, the certificate holder proposes to expand the site boundary out to the property lines of their lease boundaries for the facility, and that would occur both in the approved portions of the site to the north of Butter Creek and then in these newly proposed areas to the south and along the old the approved transmission border route. I'll give the numbers in a minute but I just want to make sure that that's clear and that's represented by the dark purple line which goes out from the blue to the dark purpl. Within that expanded site boundary the certificate holder also requests to expand their microsing corridors to accommodate up to 41 additional wind turbines. And that's reflected by the white purple filled areas on the map. So in addition to expanding the site boundary and the micro sighting areas, the certificate holder would also be realigning the proposed transmission line corridor around a new route. It's not entirely easy to see from this figure, but most of the route does follow what was previously approved. There's a little bit of a difference in the middle part of the site but most of the differences are on the western edge of the site where it's just the transmission corrior and you can see those purple areas as the transmission line approaches highway 2200. Seven great to break this down more numerically and if I could get the next slide please. Ok this would include an increase in the cyer boundary area of approximately 74,400 acres and then an increase in the micros sing areas by about 10,000 acres. And those are significant numbers and I just remind everyone on the council that this is wind facility so things are dispersed. So I did think it would be helpful to look at the actual disturbance ackeress the facility components as proposed in request from amendment one would occupy about 165 acres. That includes wind turbines and their associated footprints as well as the substations and the transmission line support poles. That's an increase of about 118 acres over what was previously approved and it's about three and a half times more permanent disturbance area as well was previously approved. There would also be an additional 635 acres of temporary disturbance during construction of the facility and that total 1121 acres of temporary disturbance is the area that would need to be revegetated and restored after construction. So that all make sense and if I could get the next slide. As far as the facility components themselves, as I mentioned, the certificate holders proposing to add 41 new turbines. The turbines would also be redistributed throughout the site. So they're not all I guess not only 41 turbines would be siteightited in the new areas, but the facility would be kind of reconfigured with this new total amount of turbines and a total of 300 total nameplate capacity to accommodate the larger energy facility. There's also changes to the related or supporting facilities",

        "text": ", we would look at potential impacts of noise from the facility to that. Similarly, you know, we would, if there are, you know, noise issues associated with, you know, sensitive fish and wildlife habitat, we would work with, with ODFW. Regarding that, I'm not aware of any particularly that that's occurred. Certainly, you know, if ODFW, you know, some, you know, nesting species during certain times of the year that were very sensitive to noise, that would be something that could get included in our review. I'm making that up. But, but it's possible I just had, had had the experience of analy hearing report about know with actual figures for you can't go above at certain Dec levels. So. Thank you, council member Byer. Thank you. Just a quick question. The only project that I've been involved with that we really got into the noise standard was the b two h transmission line. And in that case there was an allowance for mitigation to address the noise issues. Is that a component of the existing wind? Okay. And it's a component of the existing DEQ noise rules? Okay. Okay. That was question. So those could be rolled forward to solar as well, necess in this example for wind and what we're proposing in solar, you know, if you, if you go above ten, so youume 26 and you're say, you know, at 27 and you got to go to the landowner, you know, the Landtern can negotiate. They could basically say, build me a sound wall, replace my windows, put insulation in, or just give me some money and I'll sign waor. I think there's a lot of then power within the hands of the particular landowner. Good. I appreciate the effort to do this rulemaking and to kind of set that safe harbor for developers so they don't have to assess the ambient level because that's got to be a tough charge. So I appreciate staff working with DEQ to address that issue. Thank you. Next on my list is there is an existing battery energy storage system working group. So, you know, as you are aware, we, most of our certain solar facilities include a battery storage component. The use doesn't exist in statute or rule in the exclusive farm use zone. So for us, it's just a related and supporting facility. By itself, it doesn't exist as an allowed use. So that's what the group is really looking at. At the end of the 2023 session, there was a bill. Hospital 29 89. And the dash two there was an attempt. And so that's what this group is starting with, is that two amendment and then having some conversations. So it's a representative Marsh from Ashland. She's the one who's leading it. And if there are agreements, her intent is to have this done during the 2024 short session. So this would be a statutory change. I'm going to give you a little background for those non land use people. Really, what they're looking at is the exclusive farmy zone. That's where most of our facilities are located. That's where I think the likelihood of most of these. There are three types of review uses within the exclusive farm you zone. The first, which isn't really a review use, it's a use by right farming. You can farm in the exclusive farm you own. You don't have to ask permission, you can just do it'no. Review. There's no. No questions about that. The next is what's referred to as a type one use. And so if you look at the statute and the exclusive farm you zone, it'll have type one and type two. And the type one uses are very minimal review, and you're limited to what the statute includes. So you can't. The local governments cannot add additional requirements outside of some minimal public health and safety requirements. So there is some provision for that. But it's largely counties have to implement and council has to implement what is in that particular described use. Then you have the type two uses, which are conditional uses. There are then quite a few elements within the Land Conservation and Development Commission statutes and rules, and then local governments can add on whatever they want, likely. And so it's a much higher level of review. So there's been two meetings so far. The last meeting, I think there was some agreement that the battery energy storage should be listed under a certain acreage as a type one use and over a certain acreage as a type two use. They're still working through that. I think that's the best sort of idea, you know, because there's this minimal level of review, and it probably makes sense at a really small scale battery storage project, should have minimal review. But, I mean, we're dealing with ones that are 30, 40 acres in size. You know, that's a lot of land that's consumed by battery, so that probably justifies a higher level of review.",

        "text": " like I said, it's approximately 12.6 sq mi of private land. And from what I understand, the only portion of the facility that would actually extend into Sherman county is that transmission line. Should it move in there because it's right up against the border. That's correct. The site facility is not is purely within Wasco. One of the proposed interconnection points is that line you see extending north that goes the Sherman county. And that's an option? If they have one of two options, yes. So just next slide. Very simply I. This is just a really greatief overview of what's in the notice of intent. So what is this facility? It's a proposed 800 megawatt solar volt energy generation facility with related or supporting facilities that include up to 800 battery storage, 34.5 collection system, a collector substation, and o and m building and overhead 500 kb gen high lines, vening access roads, staging areas, and as Jeff had noted, they're looking at two options for what we call a point of interconnection or a POI. One would be directly adjacent to the facility. The other option is that they had to go north about 4.5 miles to connect with a different VPA substation. Next slide. So I just wanted. This is not the public comment period of this meeting, but I wanted to talk a little bit about the public comment period on this notice of it sent. As I had mentioned, the public comment period opened the day we issued the notice on Octo ten and it will be open until December 1. There are multiple ways to provide comments. You we have a comment portal you can email me. It's all in the public notice. There's a copy of the table back there. You haven't received one. And it's really, like I said, opportunity. You can email me. You can send them snail mail. We take comments tonight. These will all become part of the comments that we include in the project order that I'm gonna be preparing. As I noted before, it's not a public hearing. The public hearing comes after we issue a draftting postal order and it's not required to comment if you wish to participate in a contested case at a later stage, and we'll open it up for Q and A in public comment after Dep has an opportunity to provide is his presentation. Next slide. This is also information that's on the public notice, but this is my contact information, my email, my phone number. Please feel free to comment. Contact me again any questions or any comments that you want to provide to the Department of Energy as we move through this process. And then the next slide, we have an amazing web resource, web based resource. We have great web page. This slide is really just to show you that there are several places in the Oregon Department of Energy Energy Facility siting council website where you can get all sorts of information. Have a project we page set up for this facility. We will update that project page as things move along. There are ways to submit comments through the Internet and our comment portal. Any comments that weive get uploaded to what we call our citing dockets so people can review and see what's been provided. We have a very public process. We have a public guide on how to participate in our process. We have handouts on that back table that also you can take with you that outline our process and how it works and what our standards are and and where we're at in our process. And there's some good links down there at the bottom of that page. And so, like I said, I just really wanted to thank everybody here in the room in particular and anybody that's participating online for participating in interven and at this point, I am going to turn it over to jackff, who will talk about the facility. You're on. You're okay? You' good. Okay. Um, thank you. Anyone for anyone who just walked in or just joined online. Again, my name is jeff Watson, uh, manage of Savy on energy and lead developer on this project. Uh, I'm gonna keep things brief. Want to give everyone some time to make sure their questions and comments are heard and answered. Um, so justnn quickly give an overview of savvion as a company and then problems. So Savion, uh, is we are a US based developer for renewable. Would that be solar today? Pb uh, storage or wind? Based out of kansas city of missouri U operating in 33, excuse 33 states across the US U Saion is a portfolio company of and wholly owned by Shell Energy. Savion effectively functions as shells renewables arm in the United States. So while we are owned by shell, we do operate as our own entity. And the benefit there is that we get to utilize any sort of connections or existing structure shell may have in re nobles energy, et cetera,",

        "text": ", why are you not going through the county? Who is? Who is. I've seen you before. I just don't know where. Maybe. Yeah. The process, the reason why it's not going through the county is just based on the acreage of high value farmland. So it's based on a standard. So I know there's a, there is a choice as to whether or not the council can go through, you know, the county's land use review. Right. But because city, the facility itself exceeds this high value standard, it puts it in the jurisdiction of FX review. So that's why the application, the permit itself is going through FEC. Does that help? Yes, but I think you have a better chance not going through county. The commissioners, I think you stand a lot better chance, and I think that's why you've chosen to go this way. I can respond. So that was my mistake. I thought you were asking about the land use question. But. So we have, we have an Oregon revised statute. We have a definition of an energy facility. And whether it's wind or solar or pipelines or other things, certain things over, you know, a specific threshold, automatically go to the energy facility siting council. This project, because it is on high value farmland and exceeds 160 acres, it is within the jurisdiction of the energy facility siting council. There is no opportunity to go anywhere else now within our process, the land use is an option by the applicant. They could request to go through the conditional use permit process with the county or have that consolidated into our process. That is their only choice of election there. But the application as a whole far exceeds anything. They would have to be at 150 acres to go to county jurisdiction, and it's a lot bigger than that. So they chose to go through f. Sec. FSe sec. Yeah. So the energy facility siting council is the act FEC. So that's it's. Which is state jurisdictional. So the project is big enough. It is our jurisdiction no matter what. I'd like to also know how many people, local people, are going to be employed by this. So during the construction of this project for 18 months, it could range anywhere from 100 to 300 personsage. Those be union jobs. The average is about 100 persons per dayion jobs. That is, it would be subject to requirements from tax credits and stuff like that. So I'm not too familiar with the exact definition or what their exact requirements are, but if it does require union jobs, then we would have to use union labor. Right. And then when the project is fully built, it would be employing about one to three persons for the operation, not including anything having to do with panel washing or anything of that sort. Okay. Okay. And are there no american companies that are doing this? There are a lot of companies that produce energy, that produce projects. So we have companies from the United States, from this region, from Europe, from Canada, from Asia. They come from all over. So this organization is kind of like a conglomerate of a lot of different countries. Is that right? Or is it just South Korea? The parent company itself is just South Korea. They do have companies elsewhere in the world for various things. And just maybe this doesn't answer your question, but hopefully it adds some color. One of the things I touched on when I presented is that we're vertically integrated and our panels are actually made in the United States. There are not many manufacturers who have factories in the United States. There's probably less than ten in the United States that actually build their panels here. And so, yes, we are a south korean company. Well, at least our parent company is, but they're heavily invested into the United States. Okay. And I have been to South Korea. I love South Korea. I have nothing against South Korea. It's just that I would like to see Americans working, and I don't support this at all. It's going to be ugly. It's going to take the farmland, which I'm not obvious, there's been so many comments here I'm not familiar with all this stuff. I'm learning it too. But, and just to reiterate, this is the very very beginning of our process. We're not close to a decision. We don't have an application yet. This is just the notice of intent. It's sort of. Okay, so have another town hall like this somewhere else. Somewhere else in a bigger location. Alban. Yes, I understand. Bigger facility. Yes. In Albany, in Lebanon. You know, in Harrisburg. Yeah, I know that it is here, but there are people that have. Yeah, our requirement is. So we have. This is a public information meeting on the notice of intent. We will have a public information meeting on the complete application and then a public hearing.",

        "text": " new development, they're required to annex into the district and to provide street lighting with development. And we also provide on request light shields for some people. We've been doing a big conversion to led lights and some people are asking for light shields which reduce the undesired glare in particular areas. But it's a relatively low cost and this program has been going along pretty well. 150 pro one time charge. Yes, it's a one time charge, an installation charge. And that's my presentation. Any questions? I was wondering if you could talk to us about what are some energy saving initiatives, either in your district or just county wide, that can help reduce the burden of the electricity grid, and where? I don't know who funds these programs, if it's state or county. I'm just curious if you can talk about where there are initiatives to either use more energy from other sources than buying it off the grid that come in from. That's a great question I can address. Perhaps the things that we're doing on the county side for sure are in terms of our efficiency of the fixtures, the LED conversions. We've been partnering with PGE for probably six or seven years now, working through that process. We're getting really close, I think, either this year or in this upcoming budget year, completing that transition. So the vast majority of our street lights will now be leds. So the power usage is way, way lower, probably like 20% of what it used to be. So that's been a big improvement in that regard. And then I think there may be a larger question that we couldn't answer from our perspective, just about broader initiatives around increasing efficiency, or looking at, as you say, other alternative sources for electricity. But PG certainly is right there. Trying to also do the same thing in terms of just reducing their reliance on fossil fuel. And I want to also point out there's an added benefit with the conversion to the leds beyond the reduced electric draw. They also have a much longer lifespan, which reduces the amount that is being spent on maintenance and replacement. Thank you, that's very helpful to understand. Is there any use of solar on the lighting that maybe draws the energy from this solar power or use of electric batteries? I'heard of stories where after usage in electric vehicles, the batteries from the cars can be used to power things like street lights because the batteries still have a longer useful life of maybe another ten years. So I'm just wondering if you're looking into those options as well. I'm going to say no. That sounds very Jetson's like to me, but know I appreciated where you're going with that, and that's a really interesting topic for us to be thinking about. My understanding right now is at the scale that we're working at, the battery power limitations are still ##nna be somewhat challenging and the distributed nature of the street lighting system may make that a little bit complicated. But I do think that as the technology continues to evolve, those are certainly things that we'll be wanting to take a look at. Thank you. I have a question. How long does it take from the time that somebody makes a request for streetlight to when that's approved and until when it's implemented? Yeah, that can also vary. Yeah, I would think it's in the order of months. I don't think this is a particularly long process. I don't think it takes a year. But I would have to ask Stacia about that process when she gets back, if that's okay. Yeah. So do you have much of a backlog of requests right now? I think she's got a request or two that she's working on, but I wouldn't say that there's ever a backlog. Okay, thank you. Any other questions or discussion for SCl one? Thanks Mister Adams, Mister Roberts. Thank you. So the next thing on the agenda would be public hearing, but we had some more discussion or questions about SDL. We do SDL number one first, and then we do Washington county budget second. You want to call for motion? Oh, so there's two motions. Yes. Okay, so the one is in front of you. If you're ready to receive it, I'll make it for you. Yeah, we need have. Oh, first. Okay. Okay. All right, so we're ready for public hearing for USDL one. Okay, turn over to Clark Moss. Thank you, chair Everton. This is now the time for a public hearing on the service district for lightning budget. Dis. Does anyone in the auditorium wish, should I public comment on the presentation? As you've heard from our land use and transportation staff, give you just moment to raise your hand or start coming forward. Not seeing anyone in the room. Would any member online weish should provide public comment on the services for line number one budget. As you've heard the presentation, give you just a moment to utilize raise hand function.

I think it's just interesting now that you, we're seeing different technologies and the proliferation of different technologies, and the reality is the rules and statutes just havingn't contemplated like battery energy storage systems, you know, where the world is catching up to some of these, you. And it's not battery, not new hydrogen, it's not a new technology, but the sort of significant increase in and proliferation of them is. And so we're going toa be dealing with these things for a while. Very good. Okay, let's see. Thank you. And we are at the end, so any comments for the good order? Oh, wait, yes, we got to go back to the letter from, it's the extension. Comment period. Extension by Miss Crai requesting the extension and everybody's had a chance now to read her letter. And, and do we need any discussion of that? Shar. Great. You, anybody have a question or comment after reading it? Yes. Caor Byer. Excuse me, apologies. I'm not cont contentous, just, just want to acknowledge the request and understand that there's never enough time to comment, but that the comment period that the department offered, according to our council, was 45 days as opposed to the minimal 21. So I suggest that the department has offer, offered a robust comment period and would suggest that we continue with this process and staff has proposed. That's a motion, it's a statement, but it could be a motion. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Further, I just have a question. Is the mapping, the mapping tool that the staff uses is available on the website and is public to use, is that correct? Secretary Cornet? I know, I. Assistant director for today. Thank you, Counciler Iim. And so we want to take an opportunity. Most times we actually don't use sort of a ArcgIs mapping. We use our own, like the same data that's available on the, you know, RSA tool. We talked about the ESA tool. It's a publicly available tool, you know, online mapping tool. And we include a link to that in the notice. And so I'd like to take an opportunity, if you would, with some of the questions that were raised. And I think, know this is probably a good opportunity for those who aren't familiar with the tool. You know, we've done some education, but it's probably a good reminder that we need to do better in terms of our education on the use of the tool. And so, you know, again, in the notice there's a link. If you go to the web page, you know, for the project, there's a link and. Okay. All right, so. And this will look a little differently. So if you go into just the. Here, I'm going to actually go out a little bit. Sorry, this is so a little bit on delay. All right. Yeah, sorry. Everything is a little weirdly on delay here. So. All right, well, I'm just going to go out this way. Sorry, this is incredibly awkward because every time I move there's like this. Is that just the main page? Yeah, just. I don't know why there's such a delay on this thing. It is not working. Do you want to come here and look at it and see? Because I don't know if it's me or. Well, we should be. Oh, maybe that's the problem. Yeah, you can leave it there. Okay. But then you. Do you want them to see this page? Oh, yeah. Sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. There you go. Sorry. Give me a second. This will be easier just to kind of go out to this, the main landing page of the state. Okay. So this is where I wanted to start it from. All right. So this is if you go to the Oregon Department of Energy's main web paage and you see over on the right hand side where it says here, oregon renewable energy siting assessment tool. I think it's the mouse. And this is a weird. Ouch. Where is. Geez, it's really being weird, isn't? Yeah. Glitching and jumping all over the place. Touch it. Yeah. That might be an easier way. I'll do it that way. Okay. All right, so then if you go on there and you see the RSA icon, click on that and then that launches the Oregon Explorer. So this would be the same thing as if you hit the link from the, you know, page and then",

        "text": " more of a cohesive approach or, you know, a baseline approach, at least with wildfire plans and we mitigation plans. And now here we are looking at, you know, a goal three, which is a really big mitigation plan. So, and something very new for this council. So just wanted to make mention of my, that caught my eye. Thank you, mister chairman. Councilloor Dean. I'd take more time, but can I get a clarification from legal counsel on an issue? The goal three exception is in essence being made by the council, so that's reviewable. Does Morrow county have to go through a go through exception process also? Meaning if the application was before Morrow county, is that. Well, if it was before Mor. I think in our process, from what I've been told before, we have the authority in this area to, you know, grant the goal three exception, subject to review, of course. But if we granted, moral county doesn't have to go through the same process. Right. It's my understanding it's part of the side. If the application were before the county, would the county have to grant a goal three exception? That's the question. Coun councilor. Yah, I believe that is that they would. But I'm going to defer to Secretary Cornett, given his experience with local land use issues. Yeah, thanks, Counciler Develyn. For the record, Todd Cornett. So in this particular application, you know, an applicant can either choose to go through in an FSEEC project jurisdictional project, the applicant can either choose local land use review or council land use review. In this instance, they chose council land use review, which means the entirety of the land use gets reviewed by council, including the goal exception process. So in this project, you know, for this particular element, the goal exception is entirely within your review. The county certainly can comment, and they have, but they do not have the authority. If the applicant had chosen the local government to review the land use, the goal exception would be within their authority. And if the project was not f sec jurisdictional, but was of something, you know, in the range of this size, but not have sector jurisdictional, it would also require a goal exception. So you have the 1220 acre threshold for goal exception. If it removes twelve acres of high value farmland or 20 acres of arable land, it triggers a goal exception. So the county would have to go through the goal exception process if it was their jurisdiction anyway. So, I mean, the short answer is, or any significant solar sized project in the exclusive farm use zone, a goal exception would be required, whether that's done through the local government or through the council. Okay, I thank you both for that clarification. I just wanted to be sure that this wasn't a dual process, that the council actually had the authority, and obviously the county would have the authority if the African had chosen to go that direction. So council has sole jurisdiction over the goal exception on this project. From a process standpoint, you know, it sounds like, and just going back to accountmemb member buyers, as I understood it, you were sort of validating maybe the desire to come back and review the goal exception. I still think it would be valuable to continue with the presentation and to maybe dispense with the other comments and issues. And then at the end of this, you can let us know, you know, if that's still what you want us to do is to come back, you know, with the goal exception at a future council meeting, which we can do, and whether that's the sole focus or whether there are any other elements that you would like us to review as well. But I think probably the other ones are probably fine, but we can also analyze those. But I would say recommend that we continue with Chase's presentation and then loop back around and then you give us your clear direction as to what you would like us to do. Yeah. Thank you. Sure, Chase. For the record, Chase, Winley Walker, and the last remaining five standards that I'm going to review go through actually didn't have issues related to comments on them, so they were just ones that I thought were unique or interesting. So next slide, please. For the retirement and financial assurance standard, council must find that a site can be restored to a useful non hazardous condition following permanentss ceation of construction or operation of the facility, and that the applicant has a reasonable likelihood of obtaining a bond or letter of credit satisfactory to the council in an amount adequate to restore the site to a useful non hazardous condition and in their application. The applicant estimates that the proposed facility'useful life to be 50 years in their application and the applicant provided evidence in the form of a letter from an FSEEC evaluated and pre approved financial institution, specifically",

        "text": " the Oregon Trail solar boundary, and the other piece was this 1228 acres that was approved with the creation of the site certificate for Oregon Trail solar for a approved microsiding boundary, and for RFA one. It's important to note that the certificate holder committed that the footprint for the solar should not exceed 400 acres within that 1228 acres already approved for solar. And this slide is just a real quick procedural history on the RFA was filed originally in August of 2022. We issued a DPO, had a DPO hearing in January 2023. How the in person hearing and conding reviewed the DPO with counsel. Those comments into consideration issued a proposed order and a notice of contestant case on January 25 and on February 24, that opportunity to request a contested case closed. There were no requests for a contested case and so we're here today to review the proposed order and a possible final decision to council. So just really briefly, the request for amendment one that the certificate holder requested was to amend condition 24 to extend the construction commencement deadline from August 30, 2022, pump that out three years to August 30, 2025, and also to make a revision to existing condition 50, Part B, which was to modify the cultural resources monitoring requirements. This is a refresher scope of review for a time extension request is basically considered a general reopener. So that department in ITSPo and its proposed order consider any changes in facts or law since the last site certificate was issued. And that was the scope of our review as a department when we prepared the DPO on the proposed order. So this slide just shows the site boundary area that was approved by the department for the RFA one. Because Oregon Rail Solar has shared and supporting facilities that it shares with Montau Wind and Montau Solar, the department approved the certificates holder request to exclude the transmission line from the RFA one analysis area. So the site boundary, excluding the shared transmission line and other shared and related facilities such as the battery storage, which is located on Montau Solar, are not included in the RFA one analysis area. So the department had nine commenters that commented on the DPO and that included members of the public, the landowner on which the facility was provide members of representatives of trade unions, Gilliam county, the certificate holder, and comments from council members during the hearing and also during council'review. And those are summarized and compiled in attachment b to of the proposed the next slides are basically to set the stage of what we're going to discuss in the revisions and additional findings of fact amended conditions that were issued in the proposed order. So for this slide, these are the standards that, based upon council'review of the DPO, and also the department preparation of the DPO, the proposed order. There were no new substantive amended conditions. There were no substantive findings fact identified in the draft proposed order or the proposed order. So this is the review that was consistent with no changes. Hey, Kate. Yes. You seem to be fading in and fading out a little bit. I don't know if it's just the, you know, proximity to the computer, but just to let you know that you're kind of, you know, again, fading in and fading out. Okay. I think it might be the technology because I haven't moved. Good to know. I'll try to at least project a little louder. Thank you. Okay, thanks. This is Perry Chocu. For the record, Kathleen. It says the standards where there were no new impacts or new, new substantive, amended conditions record were recommended or made for the draft proposed order. Now, on the historical, culture and archaeological resources, there were phase one archaeology done. Yes. What about phase two? If the general public is allowed to this area and even the private owners, those indicators on the surface could be removed in the forms of artifacts or clusters of flakes or bone or shell or any of that. Was there phase two archaeology done on this? I do not believe that the condition for the cultural resource monitoring was based upon archaeology. It was based upon the confederated tribes of Youmatila's identification of potential historic properties of religious and cultural significance. And so the monitoring condition was developed with them in the original site certificate, and then based upon the work that was done on montty solar and the monitoring work that Immatila did there, the certificate holder worked with confederated tribes of Umatila to come up with this proposed recommended, and it allows more flexibility for the tribe and the certificate holder to determine how much and where they're going to monitor. So in that regard, it was, I think, outside of that specific question, because there were no phase two site to be identified. This was identification of hipposis. If that answers your question. Okay, thank you. Okay. And so this",

        "text": ". Good evening, everyone. My name is Paul Hicks. I work with Tetra Tech Engineering. While I am not the applicant, I work on behalf of. Of the applicant in a few things. One is working on developing the application for site certificate that's being discussed tonight. The other is supporting and doing the environmental survey work that's being done for the project and other aspects that might support permitting for the project. So that's my role. Our role is Tetra Tech. And appreciate your time this evening and good after or good evening. My name is Brian Tran. I'm the development manager at Qcells. And I'm the applicant for the Mu Creek energy Park project. Next slide, please. So we have a few things on our agenda for this PowerPoint. If we could just go ahead and move on to next slide, please. So, I work for a company called Q Cells. Q cells is a vertically integrated solar developer based in earvertated. It means design and produce our own solar panels. We have a team of which I am part of, actually develops solar projects throughout the United States. And we have our own construction management team who oversees the construction of our projects. Two things to note is that our panels are actually produced here in the United States. We have a factory in Georgia where produce all our modules. So they are us made and we actually min our own silica material solar panels here in the United States. My team, we focus on development of projects solely in the United States. And our EPC team is actually ranked top ten in the United site. Please. So we're here to talk about a project called Mudy Creek. Muy Creek is a proposed dual use project that is sized at 199 mw with a battery storage component. We're hoping to also incorporate sheep grazing on this project as a dual use component. It is located just about 8 miles south of Brownsville, closer to the Coburg area. Just north of the Coburg Hills area, our study area is, or the facility site boundary, as much we're calling it is roughly 1500 acres. This includes areas mainly for study. So when it comes to environmental analysis, reingr. Species, et cetera, this is kind of the area that we're focusing on with our pre preliminary studies and desktop analysis. We're kind of thinking it's closer to 100 acres when it's fenced. Uh, currently, the project is 100% non irrigated dry, dry crop, and it's currently growing rye grass. It's fortunate we can't grow rye grass and have solar at the same time, but we're hoping to keep the project in production or the land itself in production. The land is 100% leased from the landowners, so we did not purchase any of the properties for this project. Right now, we're thinking that construction would start no sooner than the third quarter of 2025, and it takes about 18 months for construction. So we would be most likely done by the end of 2026 for the substation. There is an existing substation there. It is called the Diamond Hill substation. It's 230 kv. And we already have gone through the process with utility to go ahead and connect our project at least with an agreement, what we call a large generator interconnection agreement. Next slide, please. This here is a facility site location, kind of like a vicinity map. The area that is outlined in black is the study area that we have. And it might be a little bit hard to see, but it is just west of Harrisburg and north of Coburg. Next slide, please. So not that one. We can't make updates to that or change it, but we have the computer screen. Once we're done here, we can zoom in. We can zoom in on a lot on the properties if anybody wants to stick around. And we can walk you through that a little bit later. Sorry. East. Okay, so this map is a little bit more zoomed in, kind of like the site layout or overview. Everything in black is our study area, and it might be a little bit hard to see there, but there is a green square that's fall like the line. All green square is the existing diamond hill substation. And one thing to point out is that there is a vertical blue line on just to the project. That is the I five. So the project itself is solely on the east side of I five. And some of the existing infrastructure in this area does also include the step. Can we. That is the road, but the substation itself is named Diamond Hill. Next slide, please. Okay, so moving on to the of this project, we didn't start from. We didn't kind of just throw a dart and just land in where we are today. There's a lot of extensive research that kind of went through this to get to where we are today. We'know that there is a need",

        "text": " item than thank you very much, chair Hal, and good evening to you and the members of the council. For the record, my name is Chase McBay Walker. I'm a senior cing analyst with the Oregon Department of Energy. Nancy, can you go next slide, please? As chair Hal mentioned, for tonight's Agenda item B, I will be providing you with an overview of the proposed wagon Trail solar project, as well as a summary of the energy facility sing process for an application for a site certificate, and then we'll hand off the presentation to chair. How who will serve as the presiding officer for the DPO? Public hearing portion of this agenda item council's review of the DPO, including comments on the DPO, is anticipated to occur at the June council meeting. So that's the next step. We're bifurcating the review of the DPO in the public hearing. The applicant tonight will have an opportunity to provide and or present their comments on the DPO, and we'll also have an opportunity to respond to any comments received at the hearing tonight. In addition, because the comment period deadline is next Friday, June 7, the department requests that coun council hold the record open for the applicant to respond to comments received by the deadline until 05:00 Pacific time on Monday the 10th, to allow for them to have an opportunity to respond to any comments received by the deadline. And lastly, coun council also has the opportunity tonight to provide comments on the DPO and on the ASC an overview of the energy facility siting council. I'll keep it brief as Kelln has already gone over this, but the energy facility siting council is a seven member, volunteer, Governor appointed Oregon Senate approved council and the Oregon Department of Energy's siting division serves as staff to council. While Odo staff makes recommendations to the energy facility siting Council or FSEEC, it's FSE SEc themselves yourselves. That is the final decision making authority for energy facilities under f sector jurisdiction, including the proposed wagon trail solar project. Next slide please, which brings me to a brief overview of the proposed project. The Wagon Trail solar project is a proposed up to 500 megawatt solar f solar photovoltaic energy generation facility proposed by Wagon Trail Energy Center, LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Nextera Energy Resources, LLC. The facility is proposed to be to be siteed within a site boundary of 7450 acres, all of which would be in Morrow county and within exclusive farm use zoned area private privately owned exclusive farm use zone. Of that 74 50 acres within the site boundary, the proposed facility would permanently occupy 3641 acres. So less than the proposed site boundary and related to our supporting facility components include up to 500 mw lithium ion energy storage and that would be siteited in two different locations, a northern battery storage component and then a southern one, as well as two collector substations, a northern and a southern 34 and a half kilovolt collection system, 0.6 miles of 230 kv transmission line and also up to 47 miles of access roads. Next slide please. Now I'm getting into the process steps there's seven major steps in the review of applications for site certificates. I'd like to emphasize that we're currently at the draft proposed order step, which is the fourth step of the seven. The first is the applicant's notice of intent, which is their conceptual plan, if you will. The notice of intent is reviewed by the department and the department issues a project order which is the blueprint for the application. It dictates what the applicable requirements are and would be. Following the project order, the department receives a preliminary application for site certificate from the applicant and through reviewing agency coordination and coordination with the public via a public information meeting, the department reviews the preliminary application for completeness and ultimately, once completeness is reached, a complete application is provided to the department, which is where the recommended findings in the draft proposed order are based off of is the complete application following the draft proposed order, the department and following following the public hearing and FX review of the draft proposed order. The next step in the process is the proposed order and that's staff's revised recommendations based on comments received. If there's a contested case. That's a step following the proposed order, and only those persons who have raised a relevant issue in person at the public hearing tonight or in writing by the comment deadline, which is next Friday, June 7, may participate in the contested case and the contested case process step is run by an independent hearing officer following the contested case process. Should there be one? Is FX review of a contested case order, if there is one, or and or review of the proposed order and the issuance of a final order which approves or denies the application for site certificate this slide represents the procedural history for the Wagont Trail solar project. The department received the applicant's notice of intent in",

There are also options for the local governments to defer to FSEEC after consultation with the developer. So that's what the bill did. I think there's a likelihood moving forward that there are going to be standalone battery energy storage systems. Council has reviewed. I just pulled the numbers recently about four gigawatts of battery energy stor active battery energy storage systems. Right now, these are related in supporting facilities. So they're not your ear jurisdiction because it's battery energy storage. It's your jurisdiction because it's part of a wind or solar or natural gas project that is your jurisdiction. So it would be something like an o and m building or a transmission line. So that's why, you know, we have so much review of these. But, you know, if somebody came in today and said, I want to build a, you know, standalone battery energy storage project, not f sector jurisdictionalless, they, unless they opt in.

Madam chair, councillor Devlin, if they did an independent battery storage and it was not subject to our approval, whose review would it be under? It would be the local government'review. So either the city or the county within whose jurisdiction the project would be located and then subject to whatever the zoning ordinanceces for that particular zone, whether it's exclusive farm use or industrial or commercial. To my knowledge, the only standalone battery energy storage system that exists in Oregon is in Salem. Portland General Electric owns it. It's in city limits, not f sector jurisdictional. We several years ago toured the facility, which was interesting, but so they can be located pretty much anywhere that's in a building, and there's a bunch of batteries on racks, more like a server room is what it looks like. But we're obviously seeing ones out on the landscape that are more like in containers. So there are variations in the way these things are developed, but I think at least the ones that are coming to FSeEc as part of others are more in these sort of container unit type situations. So Coun, Councilor Condan, again, a follow up to Coun councilor Devlins do as these proliferate, or could proliferate. Was there, do you know if there was any discussion about possible f sector jurisdiction just for these standalone units that are bigger? We've got some experience, certainly, with assessing them. Any idea on the conversations that took place? I don't know that anybody was advocating for jurisdictional or F Sec jurisdiction, you know, sort of right out of the gate. We'll see how these move forward. We've had some projects where, you know, it's been, they've been quite large in terms of the physical footprint. So we'll see if that translates into the legislature or others wanting. And I know, like, I think at least from the development community, they want the opt in option, but I think probably local governments, and, in fact, there were quite a few tracking the bill, quite a few local governments that participated and commented, and they did not like the opt in provision. They wanted to retain jurisdiction. Okay, thank you. One last question, Councilloor Devlin. This is just a hypothetical, but in most cases, if a party built a battery storage, it would be receiving power from one of their other facilities in a different location. Has there been any instance that you know of, maybe not in Oregon, of somebody citing a battery storage in an area with low power rates, like a co op storing the power and then reselling it when the market is at the highest prices? So, for the record, Todd Cornett. Thank you, council member Devlin. No, I'm not aware of the circumstances. I mean, the way that it's articulated, and this is not necessarily the entire universe of possibilities, but the way it's typically articulated is as we're moving towards renewable more, more reliance on renewable energy, which is intermittent. The solar panels only work when the sun is out, and the wind turbines only work when the wind is out. That, and sometimes those create excess capacity, meaning there's more production than the grid can take. And so the basic idea there then is to have battery storage that can take that excess power, hold it for 12 hours, and then release that onto the grid when the solar panels aren't producing power or the wind turbines aren't producing power. But I have not heard the circumstances, council member Devlin, that you just articulated. Madam Chair, I. We should encourage, actually, in projects, battery storage because",

        "text": " Just make, just making sure. Just making sure. Okay. Just want to make sure we aren't having, having a problem. So. Okay. All right. So I'm going to provide a presentation overview tonight on the draft proposed order on request for amendment two for the boardman to Hemingway transmission line site certificate and go over some of what is in the request for amendment to just kind of administratively. As far the agenda tonight, we are having two hearings on the DPO, and there's a lot associated with both of them. I'm in my presentation. I'm going to kind of go over the DPO and what is in the request a little, in some detail, but I'm going to remind council at your June meeting, we will also be going over, we'we'll, do a review of the DPO and the comments received in responses to those comments. So that's kind of coming up, but I'mnna. Kind of, I'm gonna move pretty quickly because we do. I want to be mindful of the folks that are here potentially for the second hearing. And that I think we may have quite a few people that would like to provide comment. So I'm just good. But if I'm going too faster, if you want me to slow down, just have, you know, wave your hand or throw something at me and I'll stop and we can go back and clarify any questions. So maybe was this go going toa work for me? Oh oay. And there's a little bit of delay with the presentation. And so this is kind of what I just went over. I'm going to talk about the overview. There are kind of some template slides that that chair Howe will go over in advance of the hearing. And then during the hearing, this is kind of the outline of the hearing. So the certificate holder will be provided to an opportunity to provide their comments on the DPO, and then the members of the public can provide their comments on the DPO. And then Coun council has an opportunity to provide any comments or concerns they have on the DPO or RFA two. And then it finishes with the certificate holder having an opportunity to provide any responses to any of the comments received. And then we have kind of built in, which is now typical for most of our dpos and our hearings, kind of a built in opportunity for the certificate holder to respond to comments on the DPO. And we've just kind of lined out June 3, which is this Monday at 05:00 p.m. for that, however, the certificate holder could request more time or modify that council's discretion. So council has received all the comments I have received to date, either via our online portal or via email. And the comment, and we'll go through that. But I just wanted to clarify. You've received it with a supplemental staff report and then just ongoing today because we've gotten a lot of comments kind of up till the last minute, and those have all been provided to council and also to Idaho Power, who's the certificate holder? So the energy facility siting council, the review, that's a consolidated review for large energy facilities in Oregon. It is you folks here. This is kind of an intro slide for people in the audience that may be new to FSEEC, but it's a seven member volunteer group, governor appointed and senate confirmed, folks from all over the state. And we over here at the siting division at the Oregon Department of Energy are your staff. So we help guide you through the process. We help guide the public through the process and the materials. And then we also navigate other resources like reviewing agencies and consultants and working with applicants and certificate holders. So this is kind of our chevron for the amendment process. This is just kind of like high level where we started and where we're at now, there's the box around the DPO phase. So for folks that are new, this is not, there's no decisions that are being made tonight. This is a hearing. And as we can see, we have more steps that we're going to complete along the way that are also going to be in front of council. So what is the facility? So the approved facility includes, this is 273 miles in Oregon of predominantly 500 kilovol transmission line that crosses five counties in Oregon. That is the approved facility. We call it the ASC approved facility or the application for site certificate. It's the original transmission line that was approved in the ASE or the application for site certificate. Now the approved facility. So, and I know that this doesn't, folks on the webinar could probably see better than us here in the room. But the map on the left, these are alternative routes that were approved in the ASC. So these are ASC approved alternative routes. And then, you know, and so that all happened in 2022. We got final approval. And then, so, and then 2023, we reviewed request for",

So again, it's an opportunity for local governments together with their households and small businesses to drive acceleration for renewable resources and emissions reduced at pace faster than PGE in the state of Oregon. So it's community wide since recently we filed our clean energy plan and it provides insights into how we intend to comply with HA Bill 2021, which require an addition of three to 4000 non imiate resources by 2030. We have valued the input and engagement and feedback from the city'staff here, and that includes Heather and Ryan on development of this. One of the things that we're going to do is PGE's procurement cycle. So we'll put out a 2023 RFP and it's scheduled to identify viable projects in the spring of 2024. And at that point, PGE would be better positioned, or best positioned to share indicative pricing for a potential muni tariff offering, noting the inability to provide pricing today given the procurement environment challenges, namely macroeconomic pressures, supply chain inflation, soar tariffs. So again, we're going to wait until 2024 just to have a better sense of where we're at with that community supported tariff. There's another way that I wanted to highlight as we work together, some things that could be coming up that I will work with your staff on is potentially sing generation storage and electric vehicle charging in the community. And you may have heard that we just announced the second largest battery storage facility in the metro area in the country. It's the second largest in the country and we'll be looking for more of that. And that could be something that we'd be coming to you. The other area is federal funds. As we look to see opportunities to maximize cost efficiencies, we may be looking to partner with you on potential federal funds. And like I said, we have applied for over 500 million do and we're going to be looking for more so that we can utilize those funds in support of this clean energy transition. With that next slide now, I'm happy to talk to answer any questions. Well, thank you, Wendy, for that presentation. I have a quick question on storage. We met with a commercial storage provider recently who looks like planning on something on Fairview Industrial. Is that something that you're involved in? Is that. I wasn't clear what PGA'pge's role was with that project. Do you know about that? I do know about that, and we have received questions about are we talking to them? And we are talking to them from an energy capacity perspective, so serving them. But I can find out more because again, I just got an update over the weekend about them. And so let me get an update and I'm happy to send that along to you, mayor, and share what kind of engagement we're involved, but yes, we are aware of that facility. Thank you. Yeah, it looked pretty exciting, but I wasn't really clear about the business model. It seems like it's going to be a commercial venture where they buy electricity from you store then sell it back or something. Is that kind of the idea? I don't know. I just know it's a larger scale commercial battery storage. So I. But again, I will get the details because I'm not sure myself. Thank you. Other questions? Well, I'm really interested in a thousand page document but do you have like a ten page document? Executive summary? Yeah, an executive summary. I would love to see something like that. That's better than one slide but not 10,000 or whatever it is. Thousand pages. Oh, is that, is that council president Stapleton? It is. Okay. I can'I'm, sorry, I can't see you. Yes, I'm more than happy counor Stapleton to send you the executive summary and that is a much more digestible document. So I can send that to Heather and Ryan and they can pass it along to you. Thank you. I'm really interested in trying to find ways to c solar locations within the city that can kind of help get us more sustainable and reliable electricity here and what that looks like and how it would work. How can we help you get that done and what does it look like in our community to see that? So we did a tour of the new public works building on Friday and got a little bit more information on the new micro grid going in there and with the solar panel will feed it. It's really exciting. Yeah, I want to know like that but bigger, right? Yeah, I want to know how that looks across the whole city. Yeah, yeah, ysoutely. Absolutely. And I just want to say again, working with Heather and others, we that microgid was a huge win. It's the first one in the state that Odo awarded and the first micro community microgrid. So we're really excited about that project and thankful to work with your",

Like, yeah, we pay our taxes. U but the other thing that's like kind of important, right. Is the operational jobs that it'bring. Right. Obviously you have the construction jobs bring spending in the, in the local economy, but operational jobs. Right. This will give Morro county three to five high paying technical jobs that can then be levied into a career at next year or any other energy company, honestly. Um. And then, right, we, we don't purchase land, we just lease the land. So we'll be returned to them at the end of the project. And obviously, right. We submit our decommissioning bond prior to construction. So, you know, we are returning the land to the condition it was before. Next slide, please. Yep. And so we have a. We've determined through our studies that the facility has minimal impacts to other environmental resources. ##ces partially because we are cing some of the facility on dry land, wheat, and that is previously disturbed land. Right. So that is a balance that we as a developer have to face. Right. It's disturbed potentially endangered species habitat or build on previously disturbed land. And we do balance that and, you know, we do take those decisions very seriously. Next slide, please. Right. And then just kind out. A follow up in the DPO department found that facility would, including mitigation, not cause significant adverse environmental consequences or impact, including mitigation, have a beneficial economic impact. Would not cause significant adverse social consequences and would not cause significant adverse energy consequences and would have a positive energy consequence by producing clean, renewable electricity. You next slide, please. Yep, and we've kind of already stated that could you please just go to slide 26? So a big thing for me, right. I'm in the county a lot. If anybody ever wants to walk through any of the, the wheat ridge facilities, this is my contact information, I'll organize it, I'll be there to walk through. I'll teach you about the technologies. Um, I just like want to be the example of like, we hear feedback, we listen, we take it into account and we try to get better and do good by the community as well. Right. And peinning, any questions from the council? I think that's all I have. Great job on the slideslor condon. Thank you, Cindy Condon, for the record and short, it was just nice to hear you. What seems like outreach to the community landowners and you're working closely with them. It sounds like you're very collaborative and that's nice to hear. Here we are. And you know, it's collaborative with the county as well. Like the county is revising their community w wildfire protection plan. And I told Steve like, hey, let me know as soon as you get that done because I want to incorporate our facilities. Wildfire mitigation plans to fall in line exactly with that. So there's no gaps in either of those plans. Right. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Councillor Devlin. Thank you. Than m chairman. This may be may already provided the explanation for a question I had. The very significant amount of storage you're building that's intended then to serve more than this solar farm. Correct. Is since facilities are so close together. Um, so it kind of depends. But ideally it would just be to serve the, the solar farm. Right. I can't speak in like exact specifics. Right. But you know, with transmission in eastern Oregon to getting to the load centers to be as constrained, the more storage you have, you can then instead of not producing energy with the existing panels, you could store that energy for, you know, whenever you're not producing to didn't discharge it would be the concept of it. It's just one of the larger percentages of storage that I've seen in an application, so. Okay, sir, any other comments than thank you, Mister Hill? Yep. Thank you all for your time. And I know y all put a lot of effort into reviewing these applications. I appreciate it. If there's nothing else, for the good of the order, the time is now 901 on May 30, 2024, and the public hearing on the draft proposed order for the wagon trail solar project is now closed.

The school building is also provided with backup power and serves as an emergency shelter. The system provides value to the community in addition to the value of the water and energy resilience features. The school benefits from energy bill savings and EEB is able to use the batteries to provide grid services during regular day to day operations. Next slide this is a schematic diagram of how the microgrid system is put together, showing the electrical loads that can be served by the system during a power outage. The battery storage units, which are shown in black, can be charged by the solar and a natural gas generator, and that is assuming natural gas is available during a natural disaster. The water well and the critical loads within the school are shown in green and the switch at the main breaker near the top of the dotted line area ensures isolation from the grid and that's to ensure the safety of emergency crews working on local power line lines during a power outage. So now that the program is nearly up and running, the agency started to hire staff that will run the program from here. Pandian Krishnawami is on the line and is our energy services manager and James KL has been leading the work on the program nuts and bolts and will take things from herei yes, my name is James Kogl. I'm policy analys for the program. So the program will provide grants for planning and constructing renewable energy and energy resilience projects. Opportunity announcements were posted on March 7 there are four of them, one for each of the project categories. $12 million was made available between the four opportunity announcements. More opportunity announcements will be announced after this round closes with additional funds. Online applications will open shortly. We will only be accepting applications through the online application. Next slide Please Opportunity announcements outline the minimum required information for a complete application as well as detailing how applications will be scored during the review process. This includes required information about the project, the applicant and partners, and consultation with different stakeholders and groups following the review of applications to make sure they contain all the required information and are eligible for the program. The applications will undergo a competitive review process assessing the strength of the project and it feasibility, as well as how the project meets the program's priorities and targeted benefits. The score and criteria includes topics such as project leadership, involvement of environmental justice communities, jobs and economic development, direct energy cost savings, families and small businesses, inclusion of inclusive hiring and promotion policies, procurement of services from disadvantaged businesses, assisting with natural hazard mitigation plans, and geographic and project diversity. The grants will be awarded on a competitive basis. At this point, we don't know how many grants will be awarded and how the funding will be distributed across the four categories. How the funding will be distributed will depend on the number and strength of applications in the different buckets along with the required funding allocations. State in legislation Next Slide Please so the online application is still being finalized and is expected to be available shortly. You will be able to access it from the Community Renewable Energy grant program webpage. The Red Arrow kind indicates where it'll be when it's available. Next Slide Please if you're familiar with Odo's custom service portal, you'll also be able to access it here by selecting the financial incentive drop down menu and selecting community renewable entity grant program there. Next Slide Please once you get the application, you'll be able to apply for a planning and construction grant. Change information on withdraw an application using the drop down menu. Next slide Please after that, if you haven't already, you'll be asked to sign in. If this is your first time accessing the customer portal, you need to register and create a profile as well. Next Slide Please so once you start an application, you'll be given information about the eligibility requirements for the program and ask to confirm whether or not you and the project meet these requirements. Next slide please and then it kind of flows into the application itself. You'll be asked for details about the applicant organization. Next slide Please and there'also be opportunity to provide contact details for an application which will be the person Odo which is out to contact with any communications about the application and any questions that we might have. You'll also be asked about if you're partnering with any organizations next slide please. And you'll be able to input information about project partners. I'd required documents relating to the project partners in the application portal. Similarly, if you're working with a contractor, you'll be able to put their information on a subsequent page. Next slide please. As you go through the application portal, you will then be prompted to provide information by the project. Details of what information will be asked can be found in the opportunity announcements. Before you submit, you will be able to review the document submitted and you can click back through the application to check information that has been submitted. Next slide please so once you've submitted your application, this kind of chat shows the process,",

And that's all I have to report. Thank, all right, thank you. Diane T. Nouchi Dennis Clean Water Services, you chair, Harrington, and good afternoon, board of clean water services. We were really honored to be able to host the water caucus and I want to thank you, the board, for being there. The team was sending me kind of blow by blow pictures because I was back in Denver facilitating the water research foundations rack committee. And what I do there is we select the research, the water research for this next year. So I'm really grateful that you were there and that Hillsboro, South Hillsboroug is amazing and also what Tiger is doing. And I thank you for acknowledging that and just the difference that it makes here in Washington campus. It's pretty special. But I really want to give a shout out to Tracy Rainey. Tracy made this happen. Joeall supported her, and the whole team of clean water services really rallied to do that presentation. And they, they did such a fabulous job. They even had them in safety vests and hard hats to tour a Rock Creek facility. But it was really great to see them there. We had a great meeting with Maria Pope and her team from Portland General Electric, and we have some things that were really excited to work with PGE on. We're really looking at how do we collectively plan for the future to address the electrical needs that clean water services will have as we serve this growing region. But even looking at reliability and resiliency measures such as standby generation and battery storage, and also these community based solutions. So that was really exciting to do some more understanding of emergency management coordination in the event of the Cascadia event, and to make sure that we're sharing some of these best practices for business continuity across our organizations, and they're going to share with us, so we can do our planning on potential pricing increases and so we can plan what our operating expense will be. But it was a great meeting. Thank you, chair, for making that suggestion. And we really enjoyed our time with Port General Electric, and we're very thankful for Maria Popin. Her. Well, it's been interesting going on walks during the spring season, and Tanya and I had a meeting with CEO Maria Pope, PGE e CEO Maria Pope and members of her team subsequent to the ice storm in January. And they really, their urban tree expert and Miss Pope helped me internalize how in many older neighborhoods, the electrical power poles are in the backyards. And, you know, if you've got two streets and houses sharing that backyard fence line, and spring is a great time for seeing how all the different bushes, you know, rododendron bushes can get huge, right? As well as the trees, vine maples and otherwise. And to see how the lines go through multiple lines. And there were different trees lost as well. I know it was very predominant. And Commissioner Tre, 'district it's pretty amazing. And those neighborhoods need to think about if they need to make some changes, because there really continueous susceptibility in future snow and ice storms. Tell you something I hadn't really thought about. It'been interesting season for walking around. Ege does have a program called Right Tree, right place. And if you google that, you can find it on their website to try and help each of us figure out the array of landscape materials that our local nurseries offer and try to imagine what size these plants will be in 30 plus years in order to figure out where we should plant them. Yeah. Interesting. All rightty anything else? For the good of the order? Okay, well, that takes us to the end of board and leadership communication, so we'll move on to an executive session. Do we have a motion to adjourn to executive session pursuant to ORS 192.660, sub two, sub I for the purposes of performance evaluation? So, second, we have a motion and a second. All those in favor, please vote by raising your hand or saying aye. I did t. There you go. I was looking at him. I do. Any opposed the motion carries unanimously, five to zero. Ok.",

        "text": " on development of documents and permitting and things like that that also happen in planning. But there's no exclusion for feasibility that I know of within our rules or the bill. And James can correct me if I'm wrong. I'll take one more from the chat, then I'll go to Scott with his hand up, and then we'll go back to the chat. So Kristen was wondering about the timeline for a word version, like a worksheet. I just want to be clear that we can put something like that together. The checklist is designed to sort of have that function so that you can kind of like use the checklist to get organized ahead of time. And that's already available, but it's not in word. And then the other thing is that the opportunity announcement directly follows the application. So if you have the opportunity announcement, you can kind of go through it and figure out what you need to do. So we'll have some conversations about getting some sort of worksheet potentially up and online, but we don't necessarily have a timeline for that, I think because we felt like the checklist might have checked that box, no pun intended. But stay tuned. We'll make sure if we pop something online, we send it out to the folks that are online right now. And then, Scott, I'm goingna unmute you. Go aheadation. And on the word version, you know, suggestion is even if you just did, like, screenshots of the online application and posted those just so people could, you know, know to how to start formulating an answer to the questions, the opportunity announcement is great. It's got lots of information, but it doesn't actually ask the the questions. So my question has to do with, we're looking at a community resilience project and the description of the community benefits, number seven, that we have to be located in a qualifying community. And to find the definition of qualifying community, it jumps you over to ORS 470. And a qualifying community is a community that qualifies as an environmental justice community as defined in ORS 469 A. So when you switch over to 469 a, an environmental justice community includes communities of color, communities experience lowering incomes, tribal communities, rural communities, coastal communities, et cetera, et cetera. I'm in Grants Pass, Oregon. Our project would be located in Grants Pass. As selected, I think we would qualify as a rural community, but I don't know what the definition of a rural community would be. Can somebody help me out to point me towards the direction to see if we actually are an environmental justice community that is a. And therefore qualifying community? Yes. So I just decided to share my screen so folks could see that list that you just rattled off of what? The definition of environmental. I missed that slide. Yeah. Oh, no, it's fine. You just rattled it off. You found it your own way. One thing I'll just note is we have that advisory committee that we were asked, that we were asked to work with, and it was wonderful to work with them. We're really glad to have their advice. And one of the things that they said was that they wanted to avoid being overly prescriptive about the definitions for this. And it made us a little. I think us government types are like, but we want specificity. But it was, what they had to say was like, it's really up to a community to decide and to show how they fit this stuff ##ition in the application. So we're respecting that. And so there's not like a hard set definition. Yeah, but I think I will let James and Rob dial in. But I think if in the application, when it talks about how you serve these qualifying communities, there's some portions that ask those kinds of questions, you can explain it. Why do you think grants pass is a rural community? And how do you also, how will this benefit communities experiencing lower incomes or communities of color within grants pass? And so on and so forth? Okay. Does that sound right? James? Rob, want to add anything? Yeah, and I would just say one of the resources we put on a website was a list of kind data or indicators that people can use to kind demonstrate how the community might fit into one of these definitions and how they might be able to demonstrate that. So I would check out the applicant resources list, and we kind of try to use a variety of different resources depending on which one an applicant may wish to use to demonstrate that. Yeah. And I would reiterate what Christy and James said, that in the absence of a strict definition, think about how a competitive review committee would view the project based on what you're telling us about the community benefits. And like Christy said, if a project within grants pass is located in a location that can serve lower income residents or communities of color or under underrepresented communities in some way, that's going to, you know, support that argument that",

        "text": " Oregon Department of Energy to come and give us an overview of what happened relative to climate related bills during the session. And then certainly would welcome opening up it up to others that might be able to add some information and or perspectives on the session. So with that, I'll turn it over to you. Christriy Great. Kathy, thank you so much of chair McDonald, I should say, in a meeting, and nice to see you, by the way. So if Abby can go ahead two slides, that would be a great place for me to start. Thank you. All right, well, I think I know many of you, but for those who don't know me or forgot who I was since I was last last at the commission, I'm Christriy sp and I'm the government relations coordinator for the Oregon Department of Energy. And I always like to start any conversation about what's happening in the legislature. With the big picture, I think it can be really easy to get down in the weeds or focus on just the issues you're tracking. And I think that actually what's happening sort of overall in the headlines really makes a difference for kind of the tone and tenor of how the issues that you care about most actually play out in the capit. So with that said, I just grabbed a few of the headlines from the day that session ended on March 7 to just sort of give a flavor for how the session went. And actually, the boldest of them is the one that that I think really stands out the most is someone who's been through a lot of short sessions. I think this is my 8th and also who also has experienced the sort of tumult of the last several legislative sessions, just that this one seem to go pretty well as far as the partisan ranker goes. That has been such a big feature of last the last several sessions. That's not without exception, but it'certainly the bills weren't being read aloud in the same way they have been for years now, which slows down the process. And also kind of like is this daily reminder of the partisan ranker, if you will. Also the the there was no walkouts or even really any talk of walkouts. It was all very, very much focused on issues that there was there was bipartisan support for. So I think that really helped. Those issues were drug policy for those who haven't been paying attention. There was a lot of conversation about measure 110 and making changes to that measure, which was voter approved. But the legislature now is kind of having their say and what they think based on seeing it in action for a couple of years might be some changes to make. And that, that was one very high profile issue. Housing was another issue. And Alexis Hammer from DLCD is going to talk a little bit about housing when I get to my last slide. When I ask for folks in the audience to participate, he's already ready to talk about housing for us. Addressing homelessness was another major, and that includes a multitude of related issues, of course. And then a surprise big issue, also with, by strong bipartisan support in the end was campaign finance reform, which has been a topic both at the ballot box and in the legislature for years and years and years without limits actually taking effect. So, so this is a big, a big deal for Oregon. And I think on climate and energy issues, money and politics, just as they play into most issues, money and politics certainly plays into those conversations. So I think it'll be really interesting to track how that big headline level issue filters down and affects our work in the legislature in the years to come. Those limits take effect next year. So the election this year, this fall, will not have those limits in place. And in fact, there was a large contribution just made that made the news yesterday. So just know that that will continue to be the case until next year. So I would also say that while these were the headlines, even when the headlines were not energy or climate in the last several years, often they were, it was still a really big deal issue where there was always some sort of major effort that was happening that was controversial or contentious, and that was just really not the case. This year. We did have some energy, really bills that were somewhat contentious, but either they passed or they didn't. But there wasn't like one huge thing, like, if you think two years ago during short session, we were working on the cooling relief package. We were working on. That was a short session bill. We've had major bills during the long sessions. There was the big climate package last session two years ago or three years ago, there was the hospital 2021 clean energy conversation. So. And then before that, the cap and trade conversations, of course. So I think it was just a really different session than it has been for a while on energy and climate, but",

        "text": " so we'll get to you in the chat, don't worry. But Alex just asked a follow up about what it requires separate application and my understanding is that it's, yes, you would have to apply separately even if you weren't sure which avenue you were going to go. Is that correct, James? I think if you were in the kind of the planning stage, it just says would it require a separate application for renewable with resilience versus standalone renewable if both options are possible. So we would only be able to grant one grant for the projects. I would say if you're kind of in the planning space and you are thinking about what your project is going to be, we recognize that projects aren't going to be fully formed in the planning space. And if the development project that results from a planning phase isn't like 100% kind the criteria, we're just hoping it results in a project, a proposal for developing a project in the end. So I would say if you're in the planing stage, you might not necessarily feel like you want to put two applications, but if you're in kind construction kind of side of things, it's to get, make sure you kind of have all information in an application that would, we needed to be covered in both applications. You'd possibly want to kind of submit both, but I can kind of follow up on that as well. Yeah, that sounds like a good approach. Michelle, we're ready for you. Someone will get you off mute in 1 second. You should be off mute now. Michelle, one of the projects we've been considering after last summer, so we operate the Tilamook airport as well. And for we needed, we need new fuel. We have fuel tanks over there for both 100 loled and for Jet A. There was a fire up highway six. We were caught in a conundrum with, we worked, had to get with Department of Energy for an emergency fuel for air support for the fire. Our tanks didn't. They barely met the minimum of 10,000 gallon delivery that was required for that. We're in the Oregon resilience plan as one of the top airports for that. Would that type of project fit into this? As far as resilience, Rob, I'm going toa direct that one to you. So the cost of the storage tanks and fuel would not be an eligible cost. However, if you wanted to have a pumping station for those tanks that were powered with solar and battery backup so that you could still pump the fuel in the event of a disaster, those components that were associated with the batteries, solar and pumping infrastructure would be eligible costs. So we can't buy the storage tanks, but we could buy the infrastructure to make sure it's operational in the event of a power outage. Okay, perfect. I just didn't want to spend all the time on something that wasn'didn't. Fit in the proper definition. So thank you. Yes, and that's exact. We were pretty close to that Jed issue over the summer as a department, and we actually are kind of looking at federal infrastructure dollars to be able to, that could be used for things like that. So I'll make a quick note that it's something you're interested in, and if we see something called on the pig that could work for that, we'll let you know, because it's definitely. Thank you. I mean, we're looking at probably about a million dollars for that updated system, and it's just, it's not in our budget anywhere. And we were really stuck with the fire support for that fire. Yeah, yeah. And the same exact thing happened in southern Oregon just before you, too, was two places over the summer with really similar issues. So thanks for the flag and feeling like a little bit it's all coming full circle. No, you guys were, you were rockt stars and helping us get that within three days because the fuel supply was so tight at that point. So thank you. Yeah, thank you so much for saying that. Okay, great. I'm going to get into the chat. Now's a. There's a pretty long list here, so I'm going back to Jim Baird. His question is going to go to rob. Under power generation, biogas is listed. Would a cogen project be considered a renewable energy and resilience project as it replaces grid power? Making the. I'm gonna have ignorance here. I don't know what WWTP stands for. More resilient. So, you know, as far as a co cogen plant goes, if it's able to operate and provide electricity and thermal energy, when the grid is down, then it would definitely count towards energy resilience. And we do have provisions to count that thermal energy as value towards the program. So as long as it's able to provide backup power when the grid is down, it would count towards resilience. And as long as it's running on a renewable fuel, then it would count as a renewable. So hopefully that answers the question. Great",

        "text": ", best practices, just, y'all are just such a wealth of expertise and knowledge. So just mostly flagging that for during planning. Did I speak to that correctly, Jenny? Absolutely. Absolutely. Okay, great. Well, thank you so much for being here, too. Yeah. So, and we'll continue to update this plan development resources list. I got to get a new version up there after this webinar as we've already had some really great updates. So that will be a living document that as more resources come online, we'll make sure to get them up there for you. So our website is, as you might imagine, our program page isRt of our clearinghouse for all this information. One thing I haven't yet chatted about with you, or I guess I briefly mentioned is we have a great comprehensive faqs document just like our plan development resources list. I'll continue to update that as I get questions that I think other folks might have. I'm sure some of the information we'll go over in a moment is in there and we will be on there as well. So just want to flag that for you. And as I said, our webinar recordings will be up. Our first webinar slides and recording are already up and this one will be up shortly. There's that link to our program page. Another thing to flag is that public utilities in Oregon are directed under HP 3630 to be a resource for counties. So utilities that are in your county serving customers or operating energy infrastructure are directed to help comply with information requests, provided the information is not exempt from disclosure. So just want to flag that your utilities are a resource. There's plenty of components of these planning requirements and content where they might really be helpful thinking about mapping energy infrastructure or identifying energy needs of your critical public services facilities. And there might be some really fruitful opportunities for collaboration to meet your county's needs and meet some utility needs as well. And then me, as I've mentioned, I am here coordinating this program. I'm here to be a resource for you. Now, when you're in the program, if you have questions, if you want to know if we have an expert, or I can connect you to someone that can help answer some of those questions. I'm really just here to be a resource, so I think with that we can switch from presentation mode to question and answer. And Sarah, you're here if you want to introduce yourself, that would be great. Yeah. Hi, everyone. My name is Sarah Murky. I am the community navigator. So my job is to support communities, environmental justice communities in accessing federal and state resources for energy projects. So as these plans get created and adopted, if there are certain components of the plan that, you know our projects, I would d be the person to step in and support you in navigating that. I also act as very much the front door to Odo. So obviously Hannah is s kind of the main person for this. But if there are other programs and services that OTA provides that you are interested in learning more about, I'm happy to connect you with the right person or even answer some of those basic questions. I joke that I try to know 5% of everything, but know who knows 100%. So that's my job. And I'm also playing MC today, so I'm happy to open it up for questions and then we can go from there. It looks like there's already a few questions in here. Tamara asks, can you clarify adoption requirements specifically, does a plan need to be adopted as an amendment to a county comprehensive land use plan? If no, can adoption be by resolution? Yeah, my initial response, and I'm looking at Max to get his take on what I'm going to share. But, you know, the statute doesn't say if. It never says it needs to be adopted as part of your comprehensive land use plan. So I think just that it goes through your formal county adoption process. So as resolution, I think would be great. Max? Yeah. Hanah, do you have the statute specifically in front of you? I think it just says adopted as part of the natural hazard mitigation plan for the county. Is that right? Is that what it says? Specifically, counties need to adopt it via their county and incorporate it into their natural hazard mitigation Ana corporate. I think the answer to the question then is however the county sees itit for formally adopting it is appropriate. And so Tamara, if it's by resolution or some other process, then I think that that would be appropriate. Absolutely agreed. Okay, thank you. And then Tamara. Yes, we do have a list of contractors. I'm go going to drop that plan development resources list in the chat right now and you'll see that the first page is that list of contractors. Alice has already beat you there. Thank you, Alice. Appreciate. And I actually will be, as I mentioned, I'll be getting an updated version",

        "text": " of the contested case proceeding. The department will prepare and the chair will sign the final order. Animatemitted site certificate if approved as approved and directed by the council any questions on process before I go on? Thank youay. So this proceeding is on the wheat Ridge renewable energy facility East. I did want to show that on this slide. The components that are now included in Wheat Ridge east were originally approved to be included in the larger wheat Ridge wind energy facility. The site certificate for that facility was issued in April 2017 and authorized construction of 500 wind components divided into two wind turbine groups, Wheat Ridge west and Wheat RDGE east, that would have been connected by a 30 1 mile intraconneectionion transmission line. The Wheat Ridge Wind energy facility was administratively divided into Wheatridge one and two in May 2020. The latter, Wheat Ridge two, contained a portion of the Wheat Ridge West Turbine Group solar components added through an earlier amendment in all of the Wheat Ridge East Turbine Group and interconnection line in November 2020, whe rich two was again divided into three daughter facilities whe reach two retaining the wind components in the western turbine group, Wheat RngGe three containing the solar components and Wheat Ridge east containing the eastern Turbine Group and the interconnection line. Slide please. So the site certificate for Wheat Ridge east, excuse me, authorizes Wheat Ridge East Wind LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nextera Energy Resourcesc ##c to construct and operate up to 66 wind turbines with a combined maximum name plate capacity of 200 mw related or supporting facilities, including but not limited to 20 megawatt battery energy storage system within a 4582 acre site in Morrow and Uattila county. The certificate holder was deemed to have began construction prior to the administrative division of Wheatridge wind, but none of the components authorize as part of Wheatridge east have'built yet. It's important note so the department received the preliminary request for amendment one of the Wheatriidge east site certificate on May 16 of last year. We reviewed the preliminary request for completeness, issued a determination that additional information was needed on July 14, and the certificate holder provided partial responses to the request for additional information. On September 1, October 27, December 7, and December 21, we reviewed all of the RAI responses and determined that the request, with the responses and revisions contained within revised exhibits, contains sufficient information to make recommendations on all applicable standards, rules and laws on January 26 of this year, the certificate holder then submitted a complete RFA. On January 30, the department issued the draft proposed order, which is the subject of tonight's hearing, on February 29, concurrently with a public notice notifying the public of the opportunity to provide comments and establishing April 4 as the demoay of for written public comments. As I discussed earlier, the department requested thesel hold the record open until April 8. To provide the certificate holder with a opportunity to respond to comments. We will present a complete review of the draft proposed order at a future council meeting, likely the April meeting. The certificate holder has requested that the public review process be expedited to the extent possible, so we're continuing to work on scheduling with them and to accommodate their request to the extent we can without impacting opportunities for public participation or the council's review slide. Great, so you can see a graphic representation of some of the changes proposed in request for amendment one on the slide here, the approved site boundary and micro citing Bor are shown in the dark blue color that kind of runs through the middle of the site there in RFA one, the certificate holder proposes to enlarge the site boundary by approximately seven 4403 acres, which would result in a total site area of 78,985 acres. That change, which is represented by the dark purple line, would expand the site boundary from the microsing boundaries of the facility components out to the boundaries of the subject property or the Le property or lease boundary. Excuse me, as shown in the lighter, purple filled areas, the requested amendment would also expand microsiding corridors by approximately 10,058 acres, which would result in total micrositing area of 14,640 acres. As you can see, almost all of the expanded microsidine areas are in Morrow county and the area south of Butter Creek. I did want to note, just for the record that the if you're looking at the version of the presentation that's posted online, this slide did have an outdated figure that contained an additional access road corridor on the eastern side of the site that's no longer proposed. So if you notice a difference, that that's why, in addition to the physical changes and changes to the site, I did want to point out the certificate holder also proposes to expl extend the construction completion deadline by three years. That would extend the deadline from May 24",

        "text": " are available, policy priorities, all of those things that would drive potentially different decisions in the near term. And so by looking across a few different futures with our modeling, then we can start to illuminate what are the pros and cons of going one direction versus another, looking at the types of strategy that if we're making near term decisions now, will, will manage or mitigate uncertainty. And the other important note here is that with this modeling, we are not trying to predict the future, but instead we're trying to make robust decisions or choices in the face of an uncertain future before us. So what are we doing with the model? We are calculating the energy needed to power an economy while meeting those policy targets. And in doing that, we're looking for what are the least cost ways to provide that energy. And there are a variety of strategies out there to do that. Building out the different supply chains of the forms of energy that, that our economy is consuming and to get to a cleaner energy system in the future. This might involve things like efficiency, clean electricity, electrification, clean fuels, carbon sequestration. It includes detailed electricity sector modeling. So the electricity sector is, is somewhat in contrast to other types of fuels, something that, that we have to model on a short timef frme to be able to capture the operating constraints and the challenges that that system faces. And so we are modeling that at an hourly level and looking at the integration of that with other energy supply chains, optimize fuel supply know, as we move forward in time, we start to see an increasing integration, or options for integration through things like the production of hydrogen, for example'we're. Not trying to answer all the questions in the energy strategy with the modeling, but we are trying to provide direction and a framework to understand trade off between different pathways, policies and strategies. This is economy wide modeling. It's looking at all sectors and the types of measures that we would take in those sectors. And it kind of is complementary to the other planning work that is happening. So what the utilities are doing with their irps, what state agencies are doing with planning for different sectors of the economy, what other organizations are doing, where it is often much more detailed near term modeling. But this is providing that economy wide framework that, that gives contrast and trade offs between strategies in different parts of the economy and can kind of act as, as a centerpiece pulling everything together. What does it not do just to set the expectations going into these working groups of what we can and can't do with this modeling? So we're not focused on one state or single utility service territory. We are recognizing that Oregon is part of a larger electricity sector. It's part of national fuels markets and potentially new markets for things like hydrogen derived fuels, new types of biofuels. And so we are, we are modeling that connection and that, that role of Oregon as a piece of this, these larger energy systems. We are not modeling liquid or gaseous fuels and electrification separately. And so everything is interconnected together. And we may see as we move forward, the lines between traditionally siloed parts of the economy, somewhat blurring because we start to use clean fuels that maybe have a renewable or electrical component to their production. It's complementary to these other planning processes. As I mentioned, it's not replacing the detailed planning models that are happening at the utilities in particular. It's not a loss of load probability model. So we're not carrying the 60 years of, of very granular historical data to be able to do those kind of calculations. We have rules of thumb, but it'it's, complementary to that detailed planning process at the utility. It's also not a nodal production simulation. So we are, we are running zonal pipe flow on, on our transmission sector or transmission in the electricity sector. And so no, no sort of dc or ac flow constraints and transmission planning at a detailed level would be done at the utility level and then'it's not a forecast. So it, it's designed to help with decision making rather than forecast what will happen in Oregon. And so it's kind of laying out targets for what we would like to achieve in the future, recognizing that there is a, a whole lot of uncertainty that's going into that. And what are the decisions that we can make right now that are going to put our best put forward to achieving those in the future. So what are the characteristics of energy pathways modeling? So we are running least cost energy system optimization and it's across eleven states. It's matching the Oregon's energy demand and how that demand is, is evolving over time with supplying the energy. It's looking across the whole energy sector and the economy. So all forms of energy are considered in there. It's structured to meet Oregon's energy policy objectives. All emissions are, are accounted for. So emissions from energy, emissions from other sectors. So when we're trying to meet the 2004 targets",

If not, I just want to share with everyone that we're a team that represents experience in federal grant program design and implementation. We're here to support the office of Department of Energy in any way that they need. We're listening to all of your feedback. We'll help incorporate it into the program narrative and we're looking forward to working with you. Thanks Christy, to Bryson and your colleague. Want to introduce themselves or if they are able to. Yes, let's. Oh yes, you are on camera. Yeah, please come off mute and please say hello. Yeah, good morning everyone. Katie Tski here. I serve in the preparedness division at Hagerty Consulting and really excited to bring experience with statewide energy planning and Gr resilience to this project. We're supporting other states with similar efforts. We're try honored to be supporting Odo and look forward to working with all of you. Thank you. Hey everyone, Bryson schook here. I serve in the recovery division with Hagerty Consulting. I just want to echo Katie's sentiment as well as Christie's sentiment. We're excited to work with you and excited to just apply our knowledge from other projects to your project and really make this the best process for you. Look forward to working with you. Great. Thank you so much. All right, Rob, next slide, moving on to public comments. Please raise your hand and you'll be called on to unmute yourself or type your question in the chat window. Please keep your comments and questions to under three minutes. We have time for others and as a reminder, if you are on the phone, you can press star six to raise your hand and star three to unmute yourself when call on you and I see that we have our first question or public comment for the slide. Britany Davidson oay hi, my name is Brittany Davids and I'm Withego Organ Realural Electric Cooperative association. Thank you for the presentation. I found it very helpful. We will be submitting comments later this week, but one thing that I just wanted to to mention, especially after I'm looking at the map of the disadvantaged communities so many of those will fall the, in the low small utility sector. So I think it's unfortunate that that doesn't play a larger role in how the funds get dispersed. And while I understand U Matila megawatt wise fits with the large utilities, I don't know if it's a good equivalence to put them with the large utilities. They serve 18,000 customers, PGE 800,000, Pacific Power 600,000. So I feel like that should kind of be taken into consideration to not just their megattt sales but also their, the service areas and the number of folks that they serve. So thank you. Thanks, Brittanney. Appreciate that. Other comments, Janine, bringing you off mute here. Hey, thank you. Jine Pr ceeb. Really appreciate the opportunity to weigh in and see how this is evolving. You know, and we got those first announcements about the IHA funding for grip. You know, we're all really excited. We see these huge numbers. But as you learn more and more, if you're a small utility, you realize that your chance at getting a bite at the Apple is very, very limited. We're going to be very challenged as smaller utilities to put together any kind of transformative project that is going to compete for national funding. So really the state formula grant is our best chance as smaller utilities to bring needed dollars for resiliency, wildfire mitigation, natural hazard mitigation to these communities. So I'm going to jump on the bandwagon and just encourage reconsidering the minimum threshold. I know that that's not the cap. I understand that, you know, qualifying projects that you'll be able to rejigger those funds, but really the larger utilities are almost guaranteed dollars and we are not. And along those lines, I just suggest that to the extent that Odo has any discretion here, I know you're following the federal mandates as well, but whether it's through technical support or just looking for ways to streamline the process and management for us. So that's commensurate with the award amounts that the administrative burden is just scaled towards as much simplicity and management, you know, reduce management burden as possible so that we're really leveraging these dollars for community benefit for our customers versus trying to fill out all the paperwork. And you know what it'like, when it's a federal grant. So I know that would be my second major comment is just make this as easy as possible for any of us who are lucky enough to get some of these dollars. Thank you. Thanks, Janine. Appreciate that. Jennifer. Dolly, we'll work to bring you off mute. There you go. Thank you. I just want to echo the comments of Janine from EWeb in",

        "text": " most of these over to Edith for her to answer. Thank youa. Thanks, Jessica. So here's the agenda for our conversation today. We're going to start with an overview of Oregon's energy landscape and a description of what the energy strategy is and why we need one in the first place. We'll then talk about how we're approaching the technical analysis. And finally, we'd like to provide some details on ways that folks can get involved in the process. And we'll leave about 30 minutes for questions and answers at the end, which I think Jessica already mentioned. So again, please type in questions as we go. We'll be tracking these questions, and we're looking forward to hearing from you towards the end when we get to the Q and A. So I'm going to start with a couple of polling questions. So this is the first test of whether you can find slido on your screen. So the first question is, did you attend the energy strategy launch webinar in November 2023? Yes. No. Or maybe you weren't aware of that meeting, in which case there's a recording on our website you could check out. And I'm going to give a minute for answers to come in. My slido just popped up, so maybe that was the timing for you, too. And this is, this is turning out to be a really useful question because a number, I can see that a number of people did not connect to that webinar, and that's totally fine. And we're going to give a lot of the background that we gave there today just to bring everybody on the same page. And then we'll go further and start to talk in a bit more detail about how we're going, about getting started with the work. So thanks for answering that question. So the next question is, what are you most interested in learning today? So we're talking about a few things. What is the energy strategy? How will the energy modeling inform the energy strategy and policy recommendations, and what are the opportunities to contribute to developing the energy strategy? You might think all of the above, but we're looking for whether there's kind of a primary purpose for you today and what you'd like to learn. And I'm just going to give a little bit more time for folks to answer this question because this is really helpful for us to see. I should add that the full answer to the question of what is the energy strategy? Will be answered by November 1 of next year. But today we'll talk about what the idea is for developing it. All right, I'm just going to give it another minute so that people have a chance to respond. And so while you're responding, I'm just going to move on. But, Abby, maybe keep it open for a little bit so we can catch any replies that are still coming in, if that's okay. Okay. So thanks for that. And I really want to start kind of by stepping back for a moment to look at the big and complicated picture that is our energy system. So this is a sankey diagram from our biennial energy report. This will be updated November of this year, in fact. And it's kind of a noodly flowch char that shows you where our energy comes from and breaks it down by what's producing that energy and how we use it. And there are a few points that I want to make here. First, we produce some of the energy that we use in state, but most of it is actually imported. And that's part of the picture that we need to keep in mind when we talk about developing an energy strategy. So on the far left of this slide, you can see energy produced. So that's energy that we produce. In Oregon, you can see imported electricity, and then you can see other energy that's not electricity, like natural gas and petroleum, that's imported from outside of the state. And then you can see that here we use kind of generic energy on the far left. And then the next set of bars talks about what kind of energy that is. So energy is produced by hydropower, wind. Further down you can see biomass, coal, natural gas, petroleum. And then if you go even further to the right, you can see that a lot of that is converted into electricity. And then finally you can see kind of the breakdown of how that energy is used. It's used in homes, it's used in businesses, in industries and in transportation. And so I think that, you know, two takeaways from this complicated slide, I don't expect anybody who hasn't seen this before to absorb it fully. But first, we use energy from a lot of different sources for a lot of different purposes. That's our starting point for our energy strategy. And secondly, some of that energy is produced in Oregon, and a lot of it is also imported. And this is the landscape that we're starting with. So in this slide, it's a little easier to see where our energy comes from. So you can see in",

You could maybe even just talk about something that you're intrigued by, but you don't have your all the information line. Yeah, you don't need, like, doesn'I'm. Not asking for your expert analysis or whatever, but just like, hey, this is something you might want to pay attention to. For example, I'm aware that there's a pas bill. I'm curious about it, but I haven't read through of it and so I look forward to doing that and reporting next week. Thank you. And maybe I'm gonna le on Jason. So similar to what was introduced last year but a it's a basically a study he pass some b so basically doing stud and keep track. Okay. That's a big thing. Do we want to just kind of go down a lot? Maybe we'll just starty rn uh, so I only have one bill that's been u that's on my quue something about battery storage or energy. I've actually handed that to juliana, our climate action plan coordinator. So she wrote up some information on that this morning. I need to read through that but I ended up getting routed through public works and she's outside of the house so. Okay. That's the only thing. Okay. Thanksottor Jeremy. Recreationality ye is really important that that the law that we have around that is it's been challenged a few years ago and then it was rewritten and now we're kind of back where it got some legal hold punched in it again. So I think that's really important. Just anything around the homelessness issues. Of course. Of course. Justin, are you hearing anything on that recreational I meeting you bill? I haven't but I haven't been that building yet, so. Okay, thanks. Just and Jerey else who join out euis and I are both tracking in SDc bill right now. Can you tell us more? I'm assuming they, they want to raise the SDCs. No, probably not. They want to take how they related. So it has to do with u with municipalities deferring SDC's for developers. Right. So essentially it gives them an extra pot of money to work with when they're putting those housing u pieces together. The state or the bill it house 40 99 is proposing to set aside a pot of money that the state would then in turn by that debt. Anything. Wow. What do you mean? What? Sorry I was asking because I got the same bill and I wasnna ask you if you were going to cover it. Oh yeah. So it's interesting right. So. So we would defer the assessment the state would within buy that assess or that deferment from us. So it would put it would the money within has to be come back to us as sdcs and use only as can and it puts the the responsibility on the state then to collect that money from the developers. And so the idea is that you start with, you start with start with a lot of money. You lend that money or you lend that money out but you put that money out to the cities and then state then recoups that money so that they have it's a cycle. Then they have more money to buy those deferment debts from cities and they can kind of keep that machine going. Okay. And it takes a lot off usus because it puts the department revenue behind collees act from the city to. Interesting. Okay. Can I just. So they would be collecting it from the developers, you all developers or the specific developer that. Right. So if we choose to do an SDC deferment, we would have the opportunity then to sell that deferred amount to the state. The state would buy it. Okay. Send us a check. Okay. Okay. And then they responsible then for going after the individual developer who received that SDC department. I'm not always great at reading body language, but our financial chief financial Bo now is, he's got some interesting situation going. I've seen a new line that has no I therer. This is all the back fashion that we haven't yet done. The bills dropped late. Um, when? Thursday? Wednesday. We just started point. We like weallfer to do all of in our working stuff. They get'excited don't we? Yeah. We don't need to get into the RA on all of. We just want the highlight. You can also see that the subject matter our expertise relies on because it impacts so many other areas, it relies on this whole brain trust to come up with a representative position for the city to consider adopting. Sure. And so you'll just see that there, in addition to just's forehead, there will be a lot of other attention. Um. This is great. This is, this is important to the mayor is s making the staff nuts by",

Maybe we'll get folks just one more minute, then we. Well go ahead and get started. I do see it looks like Santiago might be just as an attendee in there, too, for the SBW team. I don't know if he can be promoted to a panelist. He needs to be. Yeah, he is supposed to be speaking, so can he be promoted? There he goes. Ye. Looks like he's there now. Great. Okay. I think we can go ahead and get started. We may still get a few more folks joining along the way. But this is the July 17 meeting of the Oregon Building Performance Standards rulemaking advisory committee meeting. And today we've got an agenda that is gonna start out covering the methodology for energy use, intensity target development. So, know, up until this point, we've kind of been focusing mainly on the language in the Ashe standard 100 text itself without really getting into the targets for buildings. That would be one of the pathways for meeting, for being compliant with the building performance standards. So we've engaged with SBW and some of their partners to help us with first defining what the methodology is for analyzing different building types, different average euis for generating our building performance targets. So today, we're go. Going toa have SVW kind of go over their methodology and present that to the rack for comment and feedback. That'll take up about an hour, we think, of this rack meeting, and then after that, we'll get into discussion of energy data aggregation. So, this is the concept of how, you know, if a building has multiple meters, multiple tenants with multiple meters, what's the process for a building owner to get access to the aggregate data of all those meters to be able to report for VPS compliance? Then we'll kind of talk about something that we've discussed a little bit at previous meetings around campuses and buildings that are all maybe on the same meter, that may have different compliance schedules or may have different compliance requirements. Maybe some uncovered, some covered, some tier one, some tier two. Talk about those scenarios, little more definition around those. That was an item that was on the last meeting'agenda that we didn't quite get to. And then we'll review the appendix that covers the tier one covered buildings reporting requirements. So, kind of the process and the criteria that will need to be reported based on the different compliance pathways. And then we'll talk about kind of wrap up in next steps. So, with that, are there any comments or suggestions or edits from the rack members regarding the agenda for today. Okay, I'm not hereing in any, but certainly feel free to make any comments along the way. So with that, I think we'll turn it over to the SBW team to present their discussion of energyod energy target setting methodology. Awesome. Thanks for Q andss upleak and really nice to meet everyone and see everyone on the call today. So welcome to your first interaction here with the SBW team. We're really excited to be working with all of you and working through the EUI target development. If we can flip to the next slide. This is just a little using Webex guide.

We're happy to help you out. Flip to the next slide. So we've got our own agenda for today to guide you through the next hour. So what we're going to be doing is we're going to review the EUI target development process. We'll go through the methodology, the discussion about Meani uis and target setting, and wrap it up in next steps. But I want to let everyone know we want your comments and discussion throughout the presentation. So if any anything comes up, put it in the chat. Unmute, put your hand up. We want to get to it kind of right as it comes up. So happy to hear from that. And there's also going to be time at the end of each section to hear your comments and questions. So please speak up if anything catches your eye or if you want any clarification and flipping to the next slide, this is the team that's going to be working through this process. So from SBW, we have faith in and Santiago, they're all going to be presenting today. They're really our technical team. They're getting this work done. A really, really solid team. They're going to introduce themselves when they speak, so you'll hear a little bit more from them later on. On the facilitation side, just supporting with making sure folks are heard and have a chance to speak up. We have myself, I'm Kirsten.",

        "text": " so we can utilize more clean energy sources. Is that something that's being considered or is that something that could be applied as a grant? I'm just wondering where that stands. Do we need power grid? Power grid modifications? Okay, great. Thank you for these great questions. First of all, Washd is definitely on the list of partners that we invite to the forum, and in addition they sent staff to one of the forum meetings. But also I coordinate with my grant counterparts at Washot and DEQ behind the scenes regularly as well to make sure we're not stepping on each other's toes. That actually gets to why energy generation wasn't included in the short term strategy where we were just about to wrap up and the type of feedback that actually we're really looking for to see if and how we would address this over the long term because this first plan was really focused on things that it make sense for our region to implement in five years. And I think some of the uncertainty that you're describingsel Rosenthal not just in terms like the grid capacity, but also the state just changed its regulations to require utilities to bring a lot more clean energy into their supply between now and 2035. And so I think there were a lot of questions that we grappled with where it seems like there is something our region could be doing to increase renewable energy generation. And it felt like we need a little bit more thinking to think about exactly what that will be. Because if the state is going to require utilities to get cleaner andid, if utilities are still talking back and forth at the state about whether or not we have the capacity to do that, we of need to see how that conversation plays out a little bit to know where we can best make a difference as locals. And so that's really great feedback because you're giving me something to kind watch out for that helps us figure out how to move forward with this area in the next round of planning. Well, just a comment I had from PG and E was when it came to long term battery storage for alternative energy sources, that they were not the technology leader. They would apply and adapt and implement things as the situation improved or as incentives improved. So that seems like a direction we're going to be going at some point, but I understand the state has to be involved. Other questions? Not seeingone else's hands up. So thank you very much, Elliot, for coming today and letting us know what's going on with this grant process and looking forward to working with you on implementing this eventually throughout the Washington county area and individual cities. Thanks for everyone's time today. All right, that brings us to four b, which is the transportation development tax rate update. This would be led by Diami. Is Diami here? There he is. The TDT ordinance requires an annual rate adjustment. This is a non discretionary action, but still must be approved by the Washington County Board commissioners. This year, the TDT rate will increase by. Is it up by or to 8.29%? So, diamy, you're on. So sorry, chair. If I could really quickly, just a couple of little administrative things I wanted to note. Commissioner Fi and Mayor Winsel had joined during the last item, so make sure you knew they were there as well as we're running a little bit ahead of schedule actually today, and so we may need to juggle the order just a little bit. So after the TDT item, I may suggest that we jump to the JPE agenda and impact agenda next. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Welcome, Br. All right, thanks, chair. Yes. So per the TDT ordinance, Washington county staff and the board of county Commissioners are required to take action on the TDT rate adjustment on an annual basis as you described. And that rate does go into effect July 1. And to answer your question, in terms of the rate adjustment, it is 8.29% is the increase over the prior year. And that rate adjustment is based on a five year rolling indexed average weighted based on construction costs, labor, and right of way costs. And so we have calculated that the rate table is in your packet and so happy to answer any questions. This is not, again, just non discretionary, so it's more informational for WCCCC members, and our board will act on it in May in advance of the rate going into effect in July. Questionsister Diami pretty quiet chair. I might just make a note. This is a recurring item that happens every year, and Asomi pointed out it's really non discretionary in the TDT code, but it does require board action. And so one of the challenges that we consistently have had with TDT is that the index really isn't truly keeping up with cost increases. And so it's always a bit of a lagging indicator. But we are pleased to see that there's a fairly significant increase this year. I mean, and",

        "text": " council can only hear comments on this amendment, many of you know that I'm the main liaison to Lake county. So any questions that don't have to do with the amendment, just take those up with me. I'll leave my cards around. And I think that the main thing to address is that we have added some irrigated land, which we know is a sensitive thing to do in Lake county. There's not a lot of private land, that is, and there's not a lot of irrigated land here. So we did check with the landowners to make sure that they would be able to move their water rights. They've already put a letter in the record that they're going to move their water rights. And then it's further confirmed, with the additional things that you put into the draft proposed order, that there will be ample evidence that the water rights will be moved and there will be no net loss. The other changes are mainly technical. Just to clarify. We probably would have raised the voltage. It's. Anyway, no matter which site we choose, the change to 138 was just a technical change that would have been common. It would have been likely to happen on either side and then the length of the gentili. I just wanted to explain. We undershot a little bit when we initially put in our application, and then as we were looking at where we actually would put a substation, we decided to move it pretty far north on the parcel that we're microsing on. So the 89 acres in which we're microsiding, that gets us further away from the closest neighbors, which we thought was a sensitive way to site, and we will allow a pretty good buffer from. From a big new piece of infrastructure. That's about all I have. As I said, I'll leave my cards around. So questions not related to the amendment that aren't appropriate for this hearing can just come to me directly. Thank you. Thank you. Are there questions from council members here? Yes. For the record, this is pares. Council member, talk to the record. This is Barry Chocate, and I want to notify you that I have a conflict. Being a newly seated member of the Klamath Tribal Council, we have entered into an off project monitoring agreement and an agreement with Obsidian, and therefore, I have a conflict in makingsel or, or making a statement or decisions. Thank you for that notice to the council. So I think we'll just won't expect to hear anything from you during this time. I'm going to ask council secretary cornette to address counciler Shocksuit. Yep. Thank you, Counciler Shockuit. We remember that you did recuse yourself previously on the Obsidian solar Center project. So I think that's appropriate. There is no decision making tonight, but there will be at some point in the future, so we will make note of that. So thank you very much. Thank you, Counciler Byer. Thank you, chair Grail. Just to make sure I'm clear, the proposal is really to give you some options in where you send your geni lines, is that correct? Yeah. Our original application had us interconnecting on the west of the three sets of lines. The bisect that property, and we, it's most likely we will interconnect to the east set of lines. So this amendment allows us to interconnect to the east set of lines. Great. Thank you. And thank you also to everybody who showed up tonight. This is really impressive, and I've never been here before, so it's pretty exciting. So thank you for welcoming us here. The other thing that I always have to get straight in my mind with amendments is that all the conditions in the original site certificate carry forward to this amendment. So all that's being proposed is additions or major or minor tweaks to those original conditions. And this is kind of a question for Cap, but we're really just adding conditions to reflect this new configuration and the wildfire, which is a big deal. So thank you, council secretary. Yeah, I just wanted to remind everybody, and we do have, we had the maps up earlier. If anybody, during their testimony, or if you just brought kind of the question up about some of the physical locations, if anybody wants to make a point, please just let us know. We can go to those slides and help kind of point out if you have anything specific that you want to comment on, and it would be helpful to have the map up. Thank you. Thank you, councilmber Devlin. Good job, Anne. Thank you. Thank you, madam chair. This is to the obsidian representative. And counsel can stop me if my question is outside our purview or he feels he needs to. In this changing of where the water rights are being used, I would anticipate that the underlying landowner will have some costs associated with that in most cases, because they'll actually",

        "text": ", about 3.5 gigawatts of wind. And then over the, you know, primarily since the early two thousands, the number of projects that have either been approved and let their approvals expire or withdrew or built less than what was entirely approved almost equals what is actually active, about 3.5 gigawatts of wind energy. So that gives you an understanding. Next slide, please. So getting into the battery storage question. So battery storage is not f sector jurisdictional by themselves. So the standalone battery storage wasn't and is still not a sector jurisictional. But just about every project that we have now has a battery component. So a new wind project, a new solar project, or even amendments to add solar to wind typically always includes battery storage. So you can see in terms of the active amounts of battery storage, about four and a half gigawatts of battery storage is currently active. Most of that is currently under review. A little bit is operation, but the majority is under review. And during the last legislative session, House Bill 40 115 was approved. Previously, battery storage wasn't even defined in statute. And so I think there was a kind of a lack of clarity about what the regulatory path is. I think there's still some work needs to be done on that. But currently, based on that bill passing, battery energy storage systems are defined. They're defined in FSEEC jurisdictional statutes, but they're not by nature or by definition f Sec jurisdictional, but they can opt into FSEEC. That was what the development community had advocated, and that's ultimately what was passed. And Todd, when they are standalone on agricultural lands, is there, do you happen to know if they're a conditional use in agricultural lands? Yeah, I has to go through permitting. Thank you. Chair McDonald. Yeah, I think it's not clear, but I think what everybody anticipates is that it would not be a conditional use. That it would be, and excuse me for getting into land use a little bit, but there are two categories of uses allowed an the exclusive farmone, type one or sub one, and then type two or sub two. The first category, sub one uses, have very few standards that are specifically listed in statute. And then the sub two uses are conditional uses. I believe that everybody anticipates that a standalone battery energy storage system would be a utility facility necessary for public service, which is a sub one use. Great, thank you's. But it's not explicit. So I think there will probably likely be future legislation to help further define that. Next slide, please. So I mentioned that the ESSic process is a standards based review. I'm not going to go through any of the details of these, but this lists the 16 general standards that apply to every project. Now, the applicability of these standards, you know, sort of modulates based upon the project and the location of the project. So they don't all have to meet the same sort of level of justification to meet each standard. It really depends upon the circumstances. So if you're in an industrial zone in an urban area, your fish and wildlife standard is going to be pretty easy to meet. But if that different project in pristine habitat could impact significant wildlife, it's going to be a much higher burden and a lot more effort that's going to need to be met. So I'm not going to spend any time on this other than to say, you know, we work with you, our reviewing agencies, the state agencies, local governments, tribal governments, and we rely upon them heavily to help us where we don't have the subject matter expertise in some of these areas. Next slide, please. And then briefly, I'll just run through our process. So there are seven main steps in our process, starting at the notice of intent. Really, that's a high level overview. The applicant must submit, you know, about 100 pages of desktop level analysis of what the project they're proposing and where, and then we send that out for public comment. We have a public information meeting in the vicinity of the project. We seek input from the public, from the reviewing agencies. We do our own analysis, and based upon that, we issue the project order, which is really just a set of standards that that particular project has to meet. What are the analysis area distances? How far do they have to evaluate the project per standard, you know, in terms of what needs to be submitted in our application? Then they have two years within which to submit a preliminary application. We evaluate that to determine whether it's complete or not. And a complete application just means that we have enough information to review the project, not necessarily to recommend approval. And so we work heavily with the reviewing agencies when we re reviewing it for completeness. Once it's deemed complete, we also provide notice. We have another public information meeting in the vicinity of the",

        "text": "All right, so everyone, I'm Christriy Stebington. I work with Hegrger consulting. I'hoping the Oregon Department of Energy put on this event today. So just to kind of give you a quick background on what this is, I think many of you have participated in some of these feedback sessions in the past, but we're here to kind of discuss some of the changes and updates that have been made to the program narratives that was submitted to the US Department of Energy. But there are still some areas of this program that we're looking to refine, notably the selection criteria that we'll be using to kind of score some of these programs. So we're goingna go through a couple of areas for feedback and review, and we're hoping to get a really good discussion both virtually and in person. And so we're going toa try to also help moderate and make sure that if there are questions in the chat or comments, that we're kind of addressing both of these simultaneously. So we may have to interject in person to make sure that virtually people can participate as well. So just know to expect that. And I think we can move to the next slide, please, and just kind of run over some of the agendas and objectives today. So I think I covered some of this, but just to give you a quick overview of what this will look like, we'll do the welcome and introductions. We'll do a very brief for anyone who hasn't been part of these sessions before, very brief, kind of overview of the IIJA Infrastructure Investment and Jobs act and this particular 400 01:01 d funding. We'll also do the overview of the process, kind of what the submitted program narrative looked like, what changes were made based on feedback we've received, and then kind of looking forward what we're still looking to get back on, notably the competitive review process, minimum application requirements, and then community benefit as well. We do have some other information that's available today that you might be interested in, but if we get to that, if there's time, we'll certainly do it. But we will have these slides available for everyone afterwards, just in case. And I think we can go to the next slide. All right, so for virtual participants, and I just want to make sure I hit all of the important points on this, we do have a comment section. We want to make this as inclusive as possible. I think I mentioned that already. So for anyone who's virtual, if you have comments, please feel free to put them in the chat. If you raise your hand, we'll have both someone from Odo and someone from haity kind of monitoring to make sure those questions either get answered in real time or we'll bring you off to contribute to the conversation as well. So we'll definitely be watching for that. And I know Bryson is on. He will be helping us moderate and kind of helping you to direct sort of where to do what in terms of raising your hand and making sure that your voice gets free. So thank you. We do a sound check online. Can you hear Katie in the room? Okay. Yeah, I hear. I see nods. Ok. Okay. Fantastic. All right. And yes, if there's, at any point, if we fade out or if there is challenges with tech, just throw something in the chat. We will be watching and try to get that resolved in real time. All right. And I think if there is nothing else, we can move along to, I believe, to Ruci to kick us off and kind of introduce the day for us. Yeah. Thanks, Hagerty, Christie and Katie and Bryson are consultants. Really happy that they're here to facilitate today because we would have to and we really appreciate their help. I just wanted to sort of set the stage and make sure that you are familiar with the Oregon Department of Energy. This is our mission. On the sideide, our department helps Oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable energy system. We advance solutions to shape an equitable, clean energy transition, protect the environment and public health, and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for current and future generations. And then below that is a very short list of all the various divisions and programs and services that we offer at our department kind of rolled up into this list. And today we're here to talk about an energy, a set of funding that will create a new program at the agency. So that last bullet there was energy program. That's what we're talking about. And that's going to support our ability to have a resilient and affordable energy system in this state. So you can see some really strong connectivity with our mission and our service. I think we can go to the next slide. So this slide is just a list that we put together of some principles. After the IIJA and the Infrastructure Reduction act past, we recognize that we would be receiving millions of dollars in funding to",

        "text": " donut hole that you guys are creating. I have some direct questions that nobody's been able to answer yet. The first one is for you guys. Oregon's known for being a right to farm state. A lot of complications go. When you are mixing industrial with or residential with farming, what kind of complications are you going to see by doing the sub midle farm ground? Like I said, I chose not to succumb to $800 an acre or the 30 $40,000 signing bonus of the deposed, because I don't want to play that game, and I don't want to do that to my neighbors. I'm a right. I mean. I mean, the choices that other farmers make with their land is their choice. And I have nothing against that. I'm not trying to be sensational, guys. I'm just saying that that was my choice. The neighbors want to do something with you guys, that's their prerogative. You know, we live in a free country, and I believe that should happen. But the problem I see, and I guess it's self serving, is what happens to me in the middle of this, with your solar panels all around me. I mean, there's a couple of us there's Esther Gar. There's myself, Jesse Farber. He's here somewhere. You know, some of the things that you're proposing are flawed. And here's what I'm going to say is, you know, I've got friends on both sides of this, so I understand the need for electricity. I definitely understand as the fourth generation farmer, the need for farmland and preserving that land because we're being encroached on from sobo, many sides. Do you take into account from your administrative rules? I'm not buying this. It's not all laws and oras statutes. A lot of what you do is administrative rules. Somebody's making this up as they go along. I spent the last 14 years of my life on the city of Harrisbro planning commission. I'm pretty good at figuring out this was nothing more than end around to get easier path. Okay. I understand that you used the rules in your benefit. Those of us in farming usually don't get that option because we don't have lawyers on retainer. We don't have a lot of stuff. So that being said, what do you take into account for those that are left in the middle of this that have to farm? Because some of the complications that come into this are going to definitely fall into the right to farm laws ors statutes, not administrative rules that you can break or snap. That's a great question. So we've talked mostly so far about direct impacts and that absolutely indirect impacts are something we're going to look at. So when Jim Johnson from the Oregon Department of Agriculture was up, he talked about a case, Supreme Court or land board of Appeals case that is applicable to us as well. We will evaluate that. So that's, again, why I appreciate you being here. Appreciate the comments up. We will evaluate the indirect impacts on adjacent properties. And so we want to know, are you able to get your farm equipment in there or is that going to create, you can't get through the donghnut hole. You have certain agricultural practices that are going to be impacted as a result of this. We absolutely want to hear that in our process, in our application right now. How are you talking to find out what those answers are you. We're talking to you. So we're seeking that information. Just one guy. But that's exactly what we're here for is we're seeking that information from you because you're the one who's going to be impacted. You're the one who knows your farming practice. We want to hear from you about that. The truth of the matter is each person that owns a property should have rights as long as they don't infringe on other people if they want to. If my neighbors want to participate in this project, so be it. It's not my place. I don't feel it's my place to step in the middle of it. But by the same token, what you're proposing is definitely going to step in the middle of my. What I'm doing. You know, I keep hearing this sheep, sheep, sheep. Okay, I understand that. But I get the feeling you guys have never even seen a sheep and certainly not one in my neighborhood. You know, I've got a very dear friend over here that is very sheep.

        "text": " expanding access to energy efficiency and clean energy for families, communities and businesses, delivering reliable, clean and affordable power to more Americans, and building the technologies of tomorrow through clean energy demonstrations. Additionally, this program, like other federal energy programs, is covered by the Justice 40 initiative. This federal initiative directs 40% of the benefits should flow to disadvantaged communities. Back to EU gine thanks Emily. After the passage of both the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs act at the end of last year and the inflation reduction, actually, I guess it was more than the end of last year. Got my years mixed up. But after that bill and the Inflation Reduction act last summer, Odo recognized that the state would be receiving millions of dollars from the federal government to invest in clean energy, energy efficiency and resilience, among many other important opportunities. So through a series of public webinars and discussions with our energy advisory work groupoup and other interested parties, we developed the principles that you see on this slide to help guide our overall approach to the federal funding for all of the programs, in addition to grid resilience. So I won't read all of these word for word, but you can see that we are hoping to consider equity at every step, and that includes geographic diversity. We want to make sure that the benefits of this funding make it to the Oregonians who need it most and are distributed equitably around the stateage. In designing the programs and distributing funding, we will coordinate with tribal governments as much as possible and communicate clearly, inclusively and efficiently to ensure that stakeholders in the public are informed and supported where possible and where internal resources allow. We hope to provide technical assistance to build community capacity and support grant recipients. There's actually a position funded in the governor's requested budget to help us do this. We're working across agencies to leverage expertise and support historically underinvested work to further energy and climate goals and to provide other community benefits. And we'll also try to take advantage of high priority funding opportunities while also ensuring quality work that puts every available dollar to its best use. So these are the principles that we are applying across all of our work on federal funding as we think about program design and implementation. And hopefully you'll see how the program that we're talking about today is aligned with these next slide, please, and back to Emily. All right, so the purpose of the funds, as outlined by the US Department of Energy, is to improve the all hazards resilience of the electrical grid against disruptive events, generate the greatest community benefit in reducing the likelihood and consequences of disruptative events. Advance DoE'equity environmental and energy justice priorities, including the Justice 40 initiative and invest in the Americas s workforce. Next slide please. This application to the US Department of Energy is nearing submission. We are required to submit a request to US DOE by March 31, 2023 for the first two allocations of funds under this federal program. ODO is the state agency that will apply for, receive and administer these funds. Next slide, please. Under this program, states, tribes and territories apply directly to the federal government. Once awarded, these grant recipients can then run processes to issue sub awards to entities eligible as sub recipients, such as an electric grid operator, an electricity storage operator, an electricity generator, a transmission owner or operator, a distribution provider, and a fuel supplier. It is Odo's intent to focus on electric utilities. Next slide, please. Although the legislation contemplates allocations over five years, USDE intends to issue the first and second allocations of funding at the same time, accounting for the extended application deadline. The first two allocations for the state are listed on the slide, both a little less than $10 million. This program does have two match requirements. First, the state or tribes are required to provide a 15% match. Secondly, sub reccipients are then required to provide a match as well. Subreipients will be required to match at a rate of either 100% or one third, depending on their electricity sales in the previous year. Next slide, please. And while this list is not exhausted, some of the eligible activities permitted under this award are weatherization technologies and equipment, fire resistant technologies and fire prevention systems monitoring and control technologies, the undergrounding of electrical equipment, utility pole management, the relocation of power lines or the reconductoring of power lines with low lag, advanced conductors, vegetation and fuel load management, and many more. However, funds are not allowed to be used for a new electric generating facility or a large scale battery storage facility or cybersecurity. We've learned since our last public hearing that USDE consider solar panels to be a part of a new electricity generation. So while in general microgrids are allowable, grant and match funds would not be able to pay for solar panels as part of a microgrid installation. Next slide, please. Federal funds will come with requirements that apply to the",

        "text": " just want to be sure that how we're going to facilitate this meeting is that we do have, as panelists, our advisory committee and the oo staff that just introduced themselves a moment ago. And as I said, there's going to be time reserved for public comment on the agenda of today's meeting and then the follow up for the rule changes. And as always, we really like to begin these meetings before we jump in by talking about our community agreements. And these are designed to foster, inclusive and a respectful meeting. We just want to have everybody just follow along and agree to being present and ready to learn from the information provided and comments from any particular individual, as well as including respect into that in your communication and responses. And just like to remind folks that learning often happens outside of our comfort zones. And it's, and we can be okay with that and include that in our discussions and then listening to learn and not just only to respond and just, also just want to thank everybody. As always, we're doing these online things. The gremlins, the technical gremlins can pop up at any time. And if we have that, please be patient. We'll definitely try to work around that. And as I said before, if you have any particular technical issue or request beyond just a comment, please chat Patricia. She's available to help you with that. And so with that, we will dive into our agenda briefly on the next slide, please. So this meeting we're going to, as we wrap up this aspect, we're going to dive into going over some possible legislative concept changes. Christie's going to give a breakdown on that. We are going to act because Christie actually does need, I believe, to exit this meeting a little bit early. We are going to have a quick little time for advisory committee comments and questions for Christie about this concept change. So it's another little change in our normal format. And then from there, we're going to just do a brief C rep program update very briefly on our current grantees and some of the highlights, as well as a quick update on where we're at in the round three process. And then, of course, we're going to go into James, he's going to do a presentation and breakdown of the proposed rule changes for the C program. And then, as I said before, we're going to get into some committee feedback and discussion on this advisory portion and then some public commentary on both the meeting today and the proposed rule changes. And with that, I'm going to toss it over to my colleague, Christie. Thank you so much. It's nice to be here talking about this today. So we. So I kind of want to start by just noting that in a minute, you're going to hear about recent changes to the, to the program that already passed through the legislature that I know Jason wrote you about during or right before the legislative session. One thing I think we at the Oregon Department of energy have is an attitude of just wanting to make sure that we're constantly approving our programs to make sure they work best for the people who are using them. So in this case, the eligible entities for our program for the community renewable energy program includes public bodies, consumer own utilities, which, by the way, most consumer utilities are public bodies, but we wanted to loop in the cooperatives, who are not public bodies as well. So consumer owned utilities are listed out as well, tribes are listed out as well. And we know that we've been getting plenty of applications from public bodies and from trib. Trib. But our consumer utilities, from the beginning of the program development, have raised some questions and concerns about the program. And so one of the things that they brought to our attention, really, from the very beginning, was concern about the definition of the energy resilience projects that we have for our program. And that's because our definition of energy resilience in our program includes a renewable energy aspect. And there are many energy resilience projects that are out there that a lot of our utilities would like to be able to complete or find funding to help with completion or with planning, for that matter, I suppose, don't have necessarily, a renewable component. There's also an issue in our consumer own, some of our consumer owned utility territories, where they can't actually add more renewables to their grid because of their contract with the Bonneville power administration to buy, to be one of their power providers. So it kind of creates this situation where they really, the program was designed to include them very intentionally, but in many cases, they feel like it's a program that doesn't work for them. And we've been hearing about that and thinking about ways that we could potentially make some changes in the future, really, since the inception of the program. And we heard about a situation with federal funding that needed some attention. And this was sort of the idea that we put forward to the governor's office. And one thing I want to be really clear",

        "text": " and they don't work six months out of the year. So I'm just wondering, are they just going to be an eyesore for half the year and only providing, like, energy for half the year? Because that seems like a really big project and a really risky thing when we don't have the data to go out, 40 years to put upon the people of this area, when we don't even know if it's going to work year round, and we don't even know what the long term impact is. That's all. Thank you. Okay. My understanding is Katie Glover is back in the room. So, Katie and then Chad Higgins, some people want some answers to my question. I'll stay. When it comes to regards of any white papers, things of that nature, we could post it on to our project website. I'm not sure if there's something we should be posting to the portal for the project, but also, if there's anything that we would like for you all would like follow up, that's definitely something, something we could put on our website. Thank you, Katie. Hello, I'm Katie Glasser, and I want to start out by saying that actually, you guys did do a presentation to the Lyn county farm bureau meeting last month, and we appreciated you guys coming. It was, I think it went longer than you guys expected initially, but there's a lot of back and forth. You guys talked about what you were doing, and then we had a lot of questions and gave some suggestions, too. And one of those suggestions was that this is a very controversial issue. And we suggested get out into the community, talk to people, make sure that you're very transparent, you're sharing everything you can with us. And one thing that we really, really said was, don't plan a meeting in the middle of harvest. And you looked at us and very sincerely seemed like you would kind of follow some of these suggestions and said, yeah, that sounds like some, some good advice. And so here we are, July 25, in the middle of harvest, and I'm looking around and I'm actually surprised at how many farmers I see and how many should be in the field right now. But they're here because this is such an important topic, an issue, and it's going to be impacting a lot of people. So the main thing that I want to say and bring up is, I guess I do lean more on the side of, with private property, we should be able to do what we want. However, we have land use laws and at county level, state level. And I guess what's frustrating about this is because your company has enough time and money, you're going to be able to do what you want, whereas the rest of us that don't have that time and money have to follow the laws. And that is frustrating to see over and over and over again. And so why not? Instead of trying to be able, like, instead of trying to get, like, the governor to sign off or whoever needs to in order to get this project going, why not get lobbyists and go to the cap capital and change the law so that we can all do these things if we want to? But I guess that's my biggest frustration, is that because you have enough money, you get to be above the law. I guess I'll take two of the questions, at least that I heard, and you guys can respond if you want to. First, she was looking at you guys. We scheduled the meeting. So if anybody's to blame. You can blame the Oregon Department of Energy, not the applicant. That's our responsibility. So we will take that 100% so. But I will also say that when the applicant submits their notice of intent, we're on the clock. We have to provide notice. We have to get memos out to reviewing agencies. We have to provide enough time in advance of the meeting. We have to provide enough time after the meeting for public comment. We have to synthesize all that information and put that into a project order within 140 days. So we don't have a lot of time to play around with. So we could have done better, and we will do better and look forward that in the future. So again, that's on us, not on the applicant. What was the second part? Above the law. Thank you. Sorry. And I will say nobody is going to be above the law in this. That is entirely what our process is about. You may not agree with the laws, but we do have the laws. We have statutes. We have rules. That is exactly what the Oregon Department of Energy, or at least my division, is here to do, is to ensure that whatever they submit is consistent with the requirements of the energy facility siting council. And if we recommend approval to the council, it's because we believe they have provided enough evidence in the process to meet the requirement",

So if see, if you get to the map a different way and you want to see all the FSEEC facilities, you can choose the energy group and then scroll down and choose Odo facilities database and then click the Oregon Energy Facility siting council facilities layer which will show you the layers of all the facilities on the map that you have shown that would include this facility and all of them that are on the map. You can then change a lot of the visual features of that. You can change the transparency by using a slider. You can. And you can go ahead and click through two of these slides. You can change the base map if you want to see topographic relief or roads or something like that. One more slide. Yes. So you can change the base map and then you can go to more slides. You can also view the attribute data to get information about how many megawatts of facility is expected to generate, what the size is, where it's located and etcetera, by clicking view additional details. All right. And then one last feature we wanted to show you often, people, and if you could go, I think it's two more perfect. A lot of times people are interested in how close is this to my house, or how close is this to a road that I use or a park that I like to visit. And so there is a measurement tool built in. You can see where it's highlighted. There's also sometimes a little toolbox on the right side where you can get a measuring tape and measure from point to point to see your site boundary. And that'give you in the measurement of your choice. I went through this kind of quickly. I did want to point out these slides will be posted to our website, so if you want to revisit them, if you're trying to use the tool, you can get that tutorial. Also, we do have the restet tool pulled up on the computer over there, so if you want an in person demo, we'd be happy to provide that after the meeting. Okay. And that's probably enough talking for me. Thank you all for bearing with me. So again, this is my contact information. I'll show it at the end and I will turn it over to the Sunstone team or the Pine Gate team to give an overview of the project. Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Okay, great. Thank you, Chris. And thank you to the department for organizing this event and allowing us to participate and share some additional information about the proposed project. Thanks to everyone in the room who came out and joined us tonight, as well as all the folks on the phone. We appreciate it and look forward to having a good discussion with you. My name is Logan Stevens. I'm VP of project development at Pine Gate Renewables U. Pine Gate is the sponsor owner developer of the Sunstone Solar project. By way of background, I started my career in utility scale solar development back in 2011, and my current role at Pine Gate involves leading our western development team active across multiple states in the region, as well as personally leading the Sunstone development effort with support from a ton of folks, some of whom are here tonight. Next slide, please. Joined tonight by a few colleagues. Nikki Oldlson is our senior manager of stakeholder relations at Pine Gate, Linna Fossum, Northwest Energy lead at Tetra Tech, Ariel Stavitsky, attorney at STOL Reeves, Jeff Fox energy consultant with Fox Energy Strategies, and David Weiss, I believe is on the phone. He's our vice president of project delivery, whose team will be involved in actually constructing the project once it's approved. So just, just to say as well, each of the folks I mentioned, as well as many others inside of Pine Gate and at our consulting firms, have been involved in the development effort, in crafting the application that's been finalized and is in front of the department now. Um, for the next 20 minutes or so, I'm going to give a very high level overview of the project and kind of highlight some of the key sections of the application, and then the whole team will be available to help answer any questions at the end. U a bit of background on Pinegate. So we're a privately held american company, founded in 2016. Our headquarters is in Asheville, North Carolina, but we're kind of spread all over the country where actively developing in 30 plus states. We have close to 300 full time employees, extensive experience developing, financing, constructing, and operating facilities of this type, and we have a legacy of success in Oregon as well, with 17 operating facilities here in the state.

        "text": " to their cost and, and characteristics. That's great. Thank you. So just, just a note for folks. You all, I don't think can see all the chat questions that are coming in. So we're doing my best to work through chat. Let's bring a couple the verbal questions there. I'm trying to go in chronological order. Let's promote Andrew and Jake and we'll do a couple verbal questions. And then I'm going to come back to some of the ones that have come in the chat. Andrew, jump ini I have a question, I guess two part question. I guess. One is, will you be able to model different types of, for example, solar resources, for example, like, like utility scale solar versus commercial rooftop versus residential rooftop? And then the other question is, would you be able to provide a rough estimate of in state generation of, like, renewable energy versus imports from out of state? And if not, is there a technical reason for that so that you could help me understand that? Yeah. So the answer to both of those things is yes. So on the solar side, then we will have grid scale solar resources, and those will vary by their location in terms of quality and cost. And then on the, on the demand side, then we have the option for rooftop solar and the model will have the ability to economically build those out. But it will, will tend not to do that just because of the economics of rooftop versus grid scale. But we will, we will put in a forecast of how much rooftop, at a minimum, is going to get built out. So how much do we expect to be built over this time period? And that will, that will be in the model. And the advantage of that is that even though just on a purely economic basis, the grid scale is, is winning that competition, there are other benefits to the rooftop systems that economic competition is not picking up. And one of the largest ones is taking the stress off cing and permitting such a large number of grid scale renewable resources. And so we will show the impact of. Well, we will not show the impact of, but the rooftop systems will be part of, of that portfolio in the future. If we want to show the impact of that, then a DER focused scenario would be the way that we would do that, where we show what if we had higher levels of der adoption? How would that impact costs? How would that impact the rate at which we need to cite and permit grid scale resources? And is that a useful policy for Oregon? And if I may. Yeah, I just wanted to jump in because I think this is a perfect example just to help people with an example of the kinds of what if questions that Jeremy presented on earlier and that we'll be looking to help us define what the scenarios will be in the working groups. And this is one of the core functions of the working groups, is to dig into these kinds of questions and envision what but scenarios would provide the most fruitful information to address kind of questions and concerns that folks have around the state. So I just wanted to point that out before we move on to the next question with an important caveat that we can't model everything. We have constraints about how much budget we have and how much the modeling we can do. So a scenario might have multiple things in it, so we'll combine things into a scenario, but because we're limited to how many scenarios we can possibly run, caus it takes how many days to run a scenario once you got all push the button to go. Jeremy. Couple of days, yeah. So it's not a simple chug and play thing. It's a very sophisticated model that has a lot of iterations in it. Thank you all. So let's promote Jake. We'll grab another verbal question, and then I'm gonna try to run through a bunch of chat questions in the next 15 minutes or so. Jake? Yeah, I mute Jake, if you're talking to us there, you can you hear me? Thank you. Got. Yeah, I have a couple follow up questions that maybe tie together some of the earlier answers with that. And I guess in the backdrop of this is the statute says that this exercise is to implement the states energy policies. And I I guess there's a question about how that's officially being defined relative to what'on statutes, which are a lot more electric power focused, versus transportation, which is also dependent on a lot of electric power. And the genesis of this bill really was born of, you know, particularly Ken Helm. But other legislators, you know, a history of concerns that the investment, the IOU utilities are effectively excluding primary options from the model for the grid power solutions, and in particular like rooftop and the Willamette Valley solar and a number of things like that. So I think we view this exercise as primarily directed at trying to remedy a lot of those deficiencies and ensure those things",

        "text": " record keeping. So I'm looking to see if there's anything else to make sure to tell everybody. But I think those are the main, main points. So, Rob, if you want to go ahead and flip to the next slide, that might be the beginning of your slides of your overview. Yes. So at this point, my colleague Rob Delrle, hand it over to him, and he'll give a program overview. Thanks, Wendy. I'm Rob Delr, and I'm a senior policy analyst with Oregon Department of Energy. And I'm gonna go through a few slides for a quick overview of the program. I think that for the attendees of this meeting, if you've already read through the rules, you're probably pretty familiar with this, but we wanted to provide a little bit of background. So right out of the bill, House bill, 2021, we get sort of the purpose of the program. And the purpose, as stated in the bill, is to offset costs of planning and developing community renewable energy projects, support projects in traditionally underserved communities, promote small scale community renewable energy projects, and in this case, small scale means less than 20. Finally, provide direct benefits to communities across Oregon by improving energy resilience, creating local jobs, promoting economic development, and offsetting local energy costs. This program is a little different from previous programs that we've run here at Odo, and one of the differences is that this program is only open to public bodies. So in order to apply for the program, you have to be one of the entities on this list, tribes, counties, municipalities, special government bodies such as ports and irrigation districts, and also public universities, consumer owned utilities. And the bill has a provision that it's not available in cities greater than 500,000 people, and so it's not available in Portland. And that was essentially a nod to the Portland Clean Energy Fund, which is able to provide for similar types of projects within Portland. And so the idea is to take the funds for this program and really spread them around the state and focus more on the rural areas. There's two budget carve outs within the bill, and 50% or more of the grants have to be awarded for projects that are serving qualifying communities, and 50% or more have to be for projects that are energy resilience projects. And so the energy resilience projects would include a renewable energy generation system, such as solar, but also include some sort of backup storage component like batteries, so that it could provide services within the community in the event of a power outage. Qualifying communities have a definition within the bill and within our rules, and this is how they are described in the bill. Communities of color, communities experiencing lower incomes, tribal, rural, and coastal communities, communities with limited infrastructure, and communities traditionally underrepresented in public process and adversely harmed by environmental and health hazards. And this includes seniors, youths, persons with disabilities. So, as you can see, it's a fairly broad list for what is a qualifying community. And a lot of communities will presumably be able to check several of these boxes within there as they describe the communities being served, and that will help them to qualify for that budget, carve out, and also for some priority scoring, which is described in the rules and in the bill. The rules that we've all read leading up to today were put together by Odo staff with a lot of help from an advisory committee, and the advisory committee was described in House Bill 2021. And we spent most of last summer recruiting members, and we ended up with a really great list of folks to help us with this. We have representatives from tribes, from utilities, cities, counties, representatives from environmental justice organizations. I won't go through the entire list now, but we did have a lot of help from, from some very qualified folks, and we'd like to once again say thank you to our advisory committee members for all of the help in developing these draft rules. The timeline for the program started late summer, early fall last year, where we recruited our advisory committee, and we started to work on program design. And from September, really through now, we've been working on the program rules. And from now until March, we're gonna also be doing community outreach and continuing to add staff within the Department of Energy to administer the program. And in March, that's when we're going to officially launch the program by issuing opportunity announcements. The opportunity announcements will be for four different categories of grants. Two of the categories are for planning grants, planning energy resilience projects, and planning renewable energy only projects. Those grants are up to $100,000 and can cover up to 100% of project cost. And we will also have two categories of construction grants. Energy resilience grants can get awards up to $1 million, covering up to 100% of project cost, and construction grants for renewable energy systems only with no resilience components, also up to a",

        "text": ", oh, well, if you only had let us known sooner, we could have mitigated the harms to a greater degree. So if there are no harms to be mitigated, then waiting could still be like, for example, the next working day or two days later could still be considered promptly because you were able to address the issue in a prompt sufficient fashion. I don't know if that answered your question at all, but that was my best attempt. Well, thank you for that. But I guess I do continue to question it. It's not the, you know, circumstance that a week doesn't make any difference. It would, you know, it's an incident that prompt could mean a week. It's the one that is shorter than or those that are shorter than a day. And I don't know whether, you know, the notice is necessary because the state needs to take some action or, you know, why we're notified, you know, and if there would be a reason for the state taking action on a much more timely basis, then the next working day is the notice and so the action is taken later. That's what I'm a bit confused about. Yeah. And I guess part of the problem is that we don't really have, there's not like a whole bunch of incidents that I could go back and look at and analyze and say, well, would it have been okay, what percentage of these, would it been okay to do the next working day or whatever this, we don't really see a lot. And so there's not really, it's all sort of hypothetical. Right. So just a suggestion that I was thinking about. My mind is leaving promptly in, but no later than the next working day or something to give rise to, I guess, some discussion about, well, what kind of incident would take u require or suggest a much more prompt notification. And I just offer that as something I was thinking about. But councilor, is, did you want to add to this discussion? Thank you, chair. How, yeah, I just, I thought that one of our previous meetings, there actually was an incident with a key being left in place somewhere on this reactor or on their computer, and it was an incident that was reported, and it, I can't recall the timefraame that they reported it. Maybe Secretary Cornet might recall, but, you know, I just, maybe that's an example that's notable here for this discussion. Yeah, I can chime in. Thank you, council. I'm, you're correct. It was the Reed research reactor, and there was an incident where, you know, with the key being left in and sort of people walking away from the facility. And I'm paraphrasing, so please don't take that exactly. I'd have to go back and pull the information out. But in that instance, even with the next promptly, it took some time for the certificate holder to notify us on behalf ofsel that an incident had occurred. So that's probably not a great example. And we want to make sure, from my perspective, the unlikely event that something significant happens, and it'on, a Friday and Monday is a holiday, the next business day could be three or four days away. So, not that I think that the operators would wait that long, but we want to make sure there's a reason why these have site certificates is because they are nuclear facilities. While they're small and there's not likely there to be significant issues, there is that possibility. And so there's a reason why they are site certificates and council has authority, you know, it'for, the protection of the citizens of the state of Oregon. Certainly the nuclear Regulatory Commission has more understanding and more authority, and they should. But there is a role for council to play. And so this is really where, you know, you need to be thinking about what is, what's appropriate is, you know, in your role on behalf of the citizens of Oregon, is it maintaining promptly, you know, and then doing something like, you knowister Conan said, but no later, then leaving it promptly or the next working day as the operators would like to have it consistent with the nuclear Regulatory Commission operating requirements? Counselor Devlin, I M. Chairman, I had a practical question. Should something, let's say, occur at 08:00 a.m. in the morning on a Sunday, how would you notify the Department of Energy? So the nuclear safety team has an on call responsibility. So each member of that team has an on call responsibility. If there is an incident, among other things, this wouldn't be the only thing, but they would be receiving that phone call and could, you know, mobilize or help mobilize any kind of response that was needed. They would be in contact with, you know, the governor's office and whatever appropriate entities would be needed to respond to and deal with that. So again, we would be",

        "text": " panels need to be put south the control tower, loc out the control tower and then layer stud be done. But the overall, the overall question of whether solar is appropriate for airports has been resolved. And so that kind of raises the question here and whether it made sense to look at solarlacement Saleem. I think the answer is very much that it does. Right now the Salem is undertaking a master plan for the airport. We're looking at expanding commercial service, looking expanding additional general aviation service. We have a significant amount of land which is not developable because of airport restrictions and flight restrictions as well as floodway issues. And so to me that strikes be really a good opportunity to co locate renewable energy in the space that might be less efficiently used. A number of airports now New York timesports at 20% of all municipal airports have some solar. A few airports, including Chattanvia, Tennessee have all of their electric electrical operation needs met by solar. I chatt to a 2.8 megawatt system. It covers all their operational needs, which just kind cool u and so I think it's just a common sense recommendation that city council use the opportunity of the master planning process to expand the scope a little bit and conduct a feasibility study for solar at the airport. Well, I don't think we want to engage greenwashing. I think it does help sell the fact that we are potentially resuming commercialical service there and provides at least some sort of offset to the fact that we're going to be expanding pot potly greenhouse gas emissions in the airport. And finally, u there is a resilncy component to this, because if we we integrate that with a micro grid and battery storage, then it's a potential to be able to function, uh, in a natural disaster situation, which I think is one of the real rationales that we have in Sal for having an airport. So this is very consistent with the purpose the airport. I did talk with the airport general manager, uh, was there, oh, hey, John, you're doing a great job. Within a day responded to my emails, which is one of the things I love about Sal. Staff is very responsive, and he thought that was a very good idea. I won't be words me about, but very good idea. I did also bring the climate change committee meeting. I think it was favorably received. But I just wanted to go ahead and see if we can get u therater here of at some other public body and sale for them. And so I would make that motion. Can we send a letter? Thank you. Do we have a second on that motion? Secret second is by eis conversation. Just shout out, great job. I think is wonderful proposal and exciting st to be looking. Thanks, bo also the same full support u commissioners later. We also have my full support behind this. I think this is very well crafted, well thought out idea, and it is well timed with the attempt to bring commercial air service back to the salem mayorport. And one of the things I appreciate about this approach is that the request is not to include and to force it into the project, but to request the feasibility, um, is that diplomatic, political way of polit and shoving u which u with the right connections. City of salem was well vised for that addition to the airport that could easily be sourced by funds outside of what's need to be allocated for bring commercial air service back. Something that you might be interested to know is that, um, Salem is a test site for microiated studies by Portland General Electric. And they turned their small building over on 6th Greth street, right across from U city maintenance shops, into a test site. And as a part of leadership Salem with the Chamber of Commerce, I got to go tour that this year and get a presentation about how they're studying micro grids and how they can invest in place and use in communities. So there's definitely some support. I think PGE on something like that to add generation. And then you might actually find that u the fly Salem group, like my friend har would actually be supportive with this about what it would add to this. The city as far as the offsets and electrical generation. So state of old. Shey call it votog. Commissioner Augysine. Commissioner iz. Commissioner I Commissioner Gol I lein a leader. Commissioner Beer Brendel. Hi. So that concludes any discussion on item 6.2. We move on to seven, which is information reports. I see none as listed, but I also see Lisa'reaching for the mic. Anydy for planning administrators work are in eight. Sorry, I was just preparing. Thank you. Upcoming meetings on the fly sheet. We do have a compens change the six.

        "text": " Energy's implementation of the law created this grant program to provide utilities with money to improve the resilience of the electric grid and to encourage the selection and development of grid resilience projects that prioritize disadvantaged communities. Our first objective gets right to the resilience improvements by looking at how your projects will decrease the frequency and duration of grid disrupttions. The second objective is to see how and where projects improve good resilience to benefit disadvantaged communities. In this program, disadvantaged communities are defined and identified by the climate and economic justice screening tool. We will look at how your projects will decrease the frequency and duration of good disruption, specifically in disadvantaged communities. Where that applies. I won't get into the details of the climate and economic justice screening tool today. That's the links and stuff are available on the website, along with a lot of documentation around that program, the Justice 40 program, and everything related to that and the climate tool. But we're here to answer questions around that today too. And then our third objective is to select projects that maximize community benefits overall. So we'll look at your community engagement and any workforce support and development aspects of your projects. Will your project reduce the use of fossil fuel generators? We will also look for project measures that support emergency preparedness and emergency operations. And we will also consider project diversity in geography, technologies and scope, as well as the type and size of the utilities for the applications that weive in the first round. This is a list of the eligible measures from the federal guidelines. If you have very specific technical questions around these measures, it might be better to put those details in an email so we can research and provide detailed answers. The main point to make about the eligible activities is the scope of the project. Using one or more ballisted activities should reduce the frequency in duration of disruptive events. New generation and cybersecurity measures are not allowed under this program. I mean, they're allowed, but they're not eligible for funding or for grant funds. Now I'll quickly discuss some application details. Here's the homepage for the Oregon Department of Energy. The first column on the left lists are incentive and efficiency programs and here you'll find a link to get to the grid resilience grant program page. Andy Little Red Arrow to show the way on the other website or one other website navigation tip the blue banner at the top stays with every page the on the Odo website. So as you move around the website, you should always see this blue banner and see these menu choices at the top, including incentives. When you select the incentives menu choice at the top, you get a drop down list of links to all the incentives programs, just like on that column that I previously showed you, including another link or another way to get to the grid resilience grant program. And then after you get to the grid resilience program, this is what you'll find. The program information is in the center column and the left column has links. The left column has links to other programs. The program schedule is in the center and will be updated as needed. So always return to this page for the current and official dates and deadlines for the program. The application documents, including instructions, are on the top right hand side of this webpage. As mentioned earlier, the application submission portal is still being developed, but it is not needed to complete the application documents. The portal will be a place to upload completed application documents and to provide a place for a digital signature to lock in your submission by the 01:00 p.m. june 14 deadline. So on that right hand side of the web page, this is, you'll find all of these documents linked. And so here, here's a list of them again, just so they're easier to read. They're all available on that right side of the website. The exception is there is no template for the grip letter. Grip refers to the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships program. Also from the IIJA. It was a program where utilities and other entities could apply directly to the US Department of Energy for very similar funding, but it's in a different section of the law. Also referred to or the section number is 40101 c. And sometimes the whole program is referred to that 400 101 c, just like our program is often referred to as 400 101 d because that's the section in the law that derives the program. If your utility is applied for funding under the GRIP program, a letter is required giving a summary description of the project for review to the US for review by the US Department of Energy. And just another reminder and a reference back to the schedule. Even after we have selected the projects we would like to put forward, we have to submit all of those project details to the US Department of Energy for their final approval before we can proceed with a performance agreement. And that's referenced back on the schedule. But I just wanted to mention that again here. And that's it. That's the whole summary so we can get to your questions.",

That would be in the evening, starting at five o. But we'll confirm all those details. Those will be in the notice and we will send that notice out to the council as well. So you'll see that early next week. Next slide, please. I know we've done this several times, but it's probably a good opportunity. UMd, this is Cindy. Sorry to interrupt. Before you go on. Um, are. Can you go back to the previous slide just for a second? So, um, are the enclosed black areass, are those u separate tax slots or property owners? Do you know how many property owners are involved? I do not recall. I'm sure that's in the notice. Of intent just based upon the acreage. I would imagine there are multiple tax slots, you know, even if it's all under one ownership, which I believe it is. But I would need to confirm that. I would think that there are certainly multiple tax slots that it would be located on. Okay. And I was just curious if the tax lots are represented here by the line. You know, we've got not just a boundary, but there are internal. I was just wondering if those were designating the boundary lines, probably. Well, I can't confirm that. Sometimes the property or the project boundary lines do follow tax outlines, but sometimes they follow farm field. So it could be the property owner has different farming on the same tax lot, you one a good, valuable farm and maybe want a less valuable farm field. So I've not done enough look at the details of the project to be able to confirm one way or another, but we will have that information moving forward. So, unfortunately, I'm sorry, I don't have a good answer to your question. No worries. Thanks. So, going back to the steps in our process. So the slide shows the. The major steps in our process. And then those are the top roadw, the chevrons going from the notice ten all the way through the council's decision. The second row would be the main driver of that phase. And then the next two boxes are really the sort of participation opportunities and who participates in it. So. So you can see that the first box, the notice of intent, that's where we're at right now, and that's surrounded by the yellow box. The applicant is the main driver. They submitted their notice of intent. This includes a public notice, which, again, I indicated we are working on right now. There will be a public comment period that'll be in the range of 45 days between when we send the notice out and then when the public comment period won't conclude at the public information meeting, it will go past that. And then there's also agency coordination. So we will be getting out memos very soon to the local government. I've been in communication with the local county planning director already, and this is what we're doing today, is appointing them to, you know, to be a special advisory group. That is really the purpose of this agenda item, not just an overview of the project, but then we'll also be sending memos out to state agencies and tribal governments that are identified in this process as well. And just a reminder that they submitted the notice of intent the latter part of last month. And the notice of intent is good for two years. So they will have two years within which to submit their preliminary application. If they fail to do that, the notice of intent will expire and they'll have to resubmit a notice of intent. So, and then also the timing trigger from that date in May when they submitted the notice of intent is the next phase, the project order, which is the list of standards and requirements that has to be submitted in the application. We, the department, you can see we're the driver of that one. We have 140 days to issue the project order, and so we have to sequence getting the notice out, holding the public information meeting, sending out memos to all of the state agencies, local governments, tribal governments, getting comments back from them in order to inform us on what should be included in the project order. And again, we have 140 days. Next slide, please. So going back to the land use review, Patrick talked about this on one of his slides, and, you know, if you remember the diagram, talked about sort of the two paths where there was a local land use path or the FSE Sec path. So the applicant, until they submit their preliminary application, has the ability to choose who's going to do the land use review. They can choose the local government to do the land use review, or they can choose FSEEC to do that review. In the",

So the yellow is the boundary for wagon Trail U. The purple, that's kind of overlaid the yellow boundary with the blue dots, that is the existing wheat ridge one and two wind facilities. And then the corridor that's moving all the way to the east, uh, and then through the Morrow Umatila county border. That is what is currently permitted and has a site certificate as Wheat Ridge east. And then, just a caveat. There is an amendment in the approval process that will expand that boundary, which I have on the next slide. If we could just go there. And so that mor County u Matila county boundary and Peninsula still there. But then to the south of that, we've expanded the corridors for Wheat Ridge east more into Morrow county. So I just didn't want to confuse anybody of what's currently has a site certificate and then what is in the routing process. All right, next slide, please. Thank you. And then just kind of to talk about a little bit of solar energy and renewable generation. So a project this side can power up to 95,000 households and that'be clean, renewable solar energy. It's going to create jobs, both construction and operation and maintenance jobs for the project. It's going to diversify income streams for landowners. It being a solar and battery storage project, it has minimal visual and sound impacts. There will be no water either consumed or discharge for the operation of the facility. And then if being a renewable solar site, there's going to be no negative discharge or emissions. Next slide, please. And then I also want to include some information on our battery energy storage system, just because I don't think this is talked about as much, but it is kind of a critical piece in the renewable portfolio. Right. So u whenever there's surplus power generated with our solar arrays, that'll get fed into a inverter, which then changes that electricity into dc electricity, charge our batteries, and then that battery could be charged. When it's sunny, it's bright, we're produceing electricity, and then that energy is then going to be released to the grid at nighttime, or maybe the solar array is not producing on cloudy or. Or a dark day. And really, the biggest asset of that is it just kind of levels out the power output curve of the facility. And here are seeing some pictures of what a battery energy storage container looks like. So, u it's a self contained, prefabricated unit. Um, that is approximately the size of a shipping container, but everything is self contained, self operating. And then you'll leak them in series for your actual output. But I think everybody in Mor county knows what a solar panel looks like. I wasn't sure if everybody knew exactly what our battery containers looked like. Next slide, please. All right, and here's my contact info. One caveat to this is I'm way better at getting to my email. So if you email me any question you have, or if you want any additional resources or information about the project, it's just easier for me to track, respond with additional resources or information, and then I can always give you a follow up phone call if needed. And the only thing I would add, if you just go back one slide, if you would, is the bottom two are actually the adjacent facilities that are already built. So there is already battery energy storage, as you see in the bottom left hand corner, as part of that wheat ridge renewable energy facilities. The plural, the three that are already built. All right, thank you very much, Ryan David. Really appreciate it. We're going to now move into our q and A and comments section of this presentation for phone participants as well as the webinar participants and those that areending attending in person in Lexington. And I think we'll first take comments if there are any questions, if there are any, from individuals in the room. And I'll rely on Nancy or Veronica to tell me if there are people I can't see as I'm sharing my screen. And then we'll once in room and Lexington attendees have commented, we'll move into those participating via the webinar, and then we'll move into those on the phone line. Uh, last and on this slide, I have instructions on how to participate via the webinar or via the phone. And I'll keep this up through the Q and a session. Okay, so we'll just go around the room here, and I'll start with our guests here and see if they have any comments. And one with Mike. I just have a question, because I have the solar panels behind our house and the battery storage, is there any standards or",

        "text": " Summit Ridge Renewable Energy Facility. It is not about the summit Ridge wind farm project. And the notice of intent is really the first step in the FSEEC review process. And I'll say FSEEC, that is an acronym for the Energy facility siting Council. They're the entity that has to review and approve a site certificate from the state for an energy facility that falls under their jurisdiction. And the applicant team? It is. The team is with Summit Ridge Wind, LLC and Apa power. So, just a really quick overview about the Summit Ridge wind farm, which many of you are familiar with. The certificate holder did submit an application to terminate that site certificate on March 8. Public notice on that request or the application to terminate was issued on the 13 March. That public comment period closed on April 1. So it is closed and it will go to council for a possible decision at the April FEC meeting to be held on April 19. And I believe that's in Salem. It's in Salem. So you can participate remotely if you don't want to drive to Salem, if you're interested. Okay, next slide. Is there something I missed? Oh, okay. All right. So back to us and why we're here a little bit about the energy facility siting program. So we oversee the review, decision making, compliance for large scale energy facilities and infrastructure. In Oregon, the energy facility siting Council is the body that actually makes the decision on an application. It is a seven member board council. They're appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Oregon State Senate, and they serve terms. The Oregon Department of Energy staff, who we are, we work in support of the FSEEC, and we help do the technical and environmental review and document prep that goes into all of these applications, all the review process that we have to go through in order to make sure that our standards are met. So basically, in concept, we are a consolidated review process. So it consolidates local government review, state, other state agencies within the state that might have an. A role in a resource. And the purpose of that is to eliminate duplication, speed things up, make it a little more streamlined for both review decisions. If it goes through judicial review, we review the compliance aspects, any applicable council standard, applicable laws and rules that we have to consider. Our process also has built into it a public participation process. It's very important to our council and our process that the public be allowed to participate and be provided information and opportunities to provide comments. And it happens at several stages in our process, and I'll go over that in a little bit. And then we also coordinate what we call reviewing agencies, which are those other entities within the state, or maybe a local government. We have special advisory groups, which are the local counties that may have county jurisdiction in the area. And we also consult with TR tribal governments. Coordinate with them on comments that they might have on our review. Next slide. Okay, so what is an FC jurisdictional facility? There are several definitions. The one that this facility, this proposed facility really meets is that it is an electrical power generating plant with within capacity of more than 50 power proposed for a wind facility. The applicant is proposing an estimated peak generating capacity of 201 mw, or an average generating capacity of 67 mw from the facility from wind. And therefore it is an FCT jurisdictional facility under this Oregon statute 406 9300, subpar eleven, sub part eight, sub part j. All right, so when a proposed facility meets that definition as an F SEC jurisdictional energy facility, the applicant must obtain a site certificate from the energy facility, siting council before it can construct or operate that facility. And to obtain that site certificate, the applicant must demonstrate that the proposed facility meets the standards where standards based process. And I'll have a slide on that in a minute, set by council in chapter 345 of the Oarss, the Oregon administrative rules and other applicable Oregon statutes and land use planning goals. And as I said, because we as staff serve as supportive council, we will conduct a lot of the technical review of the information that's submitted by the applicant as part of their preliminary application. At this point, like I said, we're at a notice of intent stage. So we're step one. They've submitted a notice of their intent to apply for a site certificate. So we're really at that first step. Next slide. So this is my favorite slide because we can show kind of at a glance the whole process in one slide. So the red box is where we are. As I stated, we're at the notice of intense stage. There are seven major steps in this process that goes all the way to a final order in a site certificate at the end. There's a couple of things I want to cover on here. The notice of intent submitted by the applicant",

        "text": " few different possible pathways to pass legislation. I'll talk about what happened in the end with that package, but just wanted to kind of make sure you all know that was a major topic, and I think that it will continue to be a major conversation at the legislature going forward. So you can go back. Nancy, you were right with me. Thank you. So as far as what was in the climate package, I wanted to just give. So next slide, I just wanted to give just a quick sort of overview of what was in the climate package unrelated to sing, and then we'll turn to sing. But all of these are energy related and of course, would be of interest to any of you. There were additional dollars put into existing energy incentive programs. There was a kickstart on federal home energy efficiency and grid resilience programs. There was a building efficiency package that was four bills that got combined into one of those two bills I mentioned before. There were dollars for resilience, and that included for what are called hubs, which is sort of a, a big nebulous, a new idea that includes a lot of different components that can help a community be better prepared for an emergency, and that includes some energy elements. And then also energy resilience planning. And then finally the Oregon Department of Energy staffs, the Oregon Global Warming Commission, and the underlying statute passed in 2007 and had not been updated since. I think you're all aware, climate change has sort of evolved since 2007, and so the commission will evolve as well. That starts with a new name, the Oregon Climate Action Commission. I'm sure you'll hear us call it OCAC, and that will be coming with the new name and having some new members starting in the new year. There's also some scope of work changes for the Oregon Global Warming Commission. The department has been doing that work with one third of a staff member since 2007, and now there will be four staff members for the commission. So it'll be a big change for our agency and for sort of a sister commission, since you are another commission within our family. So with that, I'll move on to the things that I think will be of most interest. But like I said, I always like to make sure you have a big picture understanding of what's going on. And probably the biggest bill of session for this particular group is a market change in jurisdiction for solar. And I know that you all heard about this concept along the way here and there. To be honest, it wasn't one that at the start of session, we were expecting to see. It was not one that was being discussed at the sititing table that we talked about earlier and that you heard from during the process. This was actually a concept that came from some developers, sort of appeared in a late breaking amendment a couple of weeks before what's called deadline day, when bills move out of committee. And so it was a little bit of a surprise to us when it came forward. Many of you may remember that in 2019, there was a similar bill. And what it does is it changes the jurisdiction of counties and whether or not they can do energy facility siting. This bill was limited to solar. There was a similar bill four years ago that was broader. This one was just solar. And Todd was gracious enough to put together this table that we have used to sort of show that evolution over time. So 23 29 was that bill four years ago. So four years ago, EpSeEc had this jurisdiction that was, that did not belong to counties. Counties just had these smaller projects in that first column. And currently, you can see there's sort of a range of when a county can do solar sighting versus FSEAC is the place for that to happen. And you'll see that now four years later, that's being increased again. I'll say there was, like I said, this was sort of a surprise to us, and sot of came in a little late in the process. There wasn't any discussion really on this concept. And House committee, but there was robust discussion in the Senate and some amendments made to the concept, particularly around decommissioning. I would say it would be a good shorthand way of putting it just to make sure that counties are not left on the hook with cleaning up a site at when it's no longer in use. And this is where I would love for Todd or for secretary Cornet to feel free to weigh in. He's thought long and hard about this and maybe can talk a little bit about the effect that we expected to have on the energy facility siting council. One thing I'll say is, if he doesn't want to, that's fine. But one thing I'll kind of say before I turn it over to him is, you know, there's two ways to look at this, and you can go back to that slide that had the table on it, if that's okay. There's two",

        "text": ". Thank you. Appreciate it. Sam Myers. Yeah, thank you, Sam. Myyers, 68453 Little Buttercryek Road, Hepner, Oregon U. Yeah, I appreciate, I too have super concerned about the ground contamination. Uh, it's difficult for me to fathom that that has not been fully addressed. I talked to multiple, multiple developers who could not answer that question. What happens when a fire moves into a solar array? What's left on the ground? If you guys can't, if you don't know the answer to that, then there's, I don't know, I don't know what's to talk about. Because it's like it's a abject failure, it's a dereliction of, of pursuit to put solar panels in this area of Morl county, such central Morrow county, because there's going to be a fire come through at some point. And if you don't know what's going to be left on the ground, if the ground is, is unproducible because it's so toxic that the plants will absorb the toxicity and make the seeds dangerous to consume, and you've just ruined a fire that size. It's going to be so difficult to fight because you, you're dealing with panels everywhere. It would be a responder's nightmare. If you don't know what a fire is going to do in this array, in this area, then you have no business discussing this as a renewable energy. I was approached by multiple developers wanting to do this, and as soon as they couldn't answer that question, I said, hey, I'm, I think I'm out. Not to mention the absurd subsidies that they were getting. This is, everybody should know this is just a sham. He said, what do you want? What do you want per acre per year? Said, what do you want? I said, I't know. I'll take the current panel dollar figure and I'll multiply it by three. So I said, $1,200 per acre per year. It's like, I think I can do that. I'm like, wow. So this is all coming through the Biden administration's infrastructure bill. And I'm like, wow, what a waste to support something this strong that produces this little amount of electricity and potentially can damage the soil. But then, have you ever looked at the Oregon department of Ag'website, how they're screaming about acres being taken away from agriculture? It's like, did any of the agencies actually communicate back and forth? They're literally saying, this is a wreck. We're losing too many acres, too many valuable cropland acres. The ode over here is trying to get this all thousands of acres used for solo U. So I don't, I don't, I don't, I just, I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't understand the push. I, too, thought about this agraabletai so, hey, let's try to configure a combination of proper land use where you have supported panel arrays. You farm underneath it, and so you maintain a more balance between the potential for weeds to be out of control. You still can generate some electricity, but everything has to be very, very, it's a very specific sort of landscape I'm talking about. So I shared that with one of the developers is like, I can't do that. And becausees I know what you're talking about, I can't do that. I don't, I really don't have the. It's just, it's too complex. It's too much money to set up a field that has rows of arrays, but you actually can farm successfully in between those. That's too, too far in the future for what I need to do today. So I hope this makes sense to you because it doesn't make sense to me how we could strip farmland from producing what the world needs, and then we could also put it in jeopardy of long term soil destruction from contamination from whatever's in us. Not that I know that that's for sure, but that nobody could assure me there weren't risks with what comes out of and drips down from a fire. Nor could they tell me what would happen in the hail event that we had, what? In 95, I believe we had a hailstorm that took down a lot of propops, saw an Instagram post where a destroyed solar array. So there you go. It's like, how short could this 2000 acre solar farm be? Lifespan, potentially? I don't know. But I appreciate you guys so much. I really didn't come here to intending to do this, but I have first hand experience and have thought about this and we're like, this is financially more than we would ever make for a second on dry land. Weedat. But I'm like, I can't. I can't be the generation that puts something on our soil that damages it. I don't want to. I don't want to be that. I don't want to have. I don't want to make that mistake. Thank you, mister Myers",

        "text": " of the most rununded service territory. Surrounded you 30 foot right away, surrounded by 150 foot trees. So anything that we can do to mitigate that risk, it doesn't really matter whether it's fire or snow or anything goes or wind, that's when those trees go down. So I like the middle part of that lists a lot. Only speaking from, from my viewpoint, as you evaluate some of this stuff, I would think that folks in the city may go months and months and months without an average folks in the country. They may go weeks, you know, sometimes days, depending on where they live. So I think it needs to be weighted that way a little bit. Again, just speaking for me, as you're considering that list, looking at the actual reliability statistics of the areas that are impacted by it, if you're aiming at a more resilient grid than the places that are out more should get a lot more. Thank you. So I'm looking at that distributed energy resource, including microroids and virus, and there's some asterisk know what is the asterisk that is referring to another program that we have funds microgrids, including solar, which is well as the Community Renewable energy grant program. Yeah, it's got the same amount of funding as this program focuses on micro grids and renewable energy. And for that reason we're steering this program more away from micro grids and towards the grid hardening. And so while it's an eligible measure in the program, it's, it's not going to be a priority within more the criteria unless we decide as a group that we want to change that. Okay, great, thank youb. Is it also include that in the some part of it that it's clear that this funding can not be used for certain measures like the purchase of solar panels. It's more like complementary measures that right? Yeah. So that sub is qualifying that last bullet where a new generation is not included but batteries on their own can be considered a distributed energy resource and the program will provide that le but not new generation. As, as we look at the consequence, extreme events that have occurred over the last several years, um, large geographic areas are or shut down dead bust as part of the preempted public safety power shut offffs. In this program, health utilities designed for intentional islanding like Cougar Dam was brought back online and islanded in the heat of b. So can this program help BPA and the core and utilities come up with contingency plans that when of wildfires coming through a particular area or an ice storm or whatever, they can, you know, isolate the threatened areas without losing power to large swotss of the country? Yeah. So the monitoring and control technology need get included ##using and circuit reclors and all sorts of really control technologiesbe some of our utility partners can speak in to a degree that's kind of hard to do. The way our system work instructucted so much of my the mod system u so, you know, for us example, we can't island off's not just island out portions of our system because there's no other sourc how you can. I know Stu so we don't have generation internally to be able to say, you know, take this sect off but we can back feed through here because we have our own generation. But building more transition to be able to have loop feeds and other feeds that definitely would help. We don't have a lot of I guess called distributed generation. I know Pacific Northwest national labs is working on how to island small hyro and working with BTA and the poor and BLM. So that might be something to explore. Yeah, good idea. One thing we had, we had one hundredus out in 2019 due to a snow spamp. And one thing we found ##nly is if folks didn't have communications infrastructure, didn't have enough reliable backup to stand, so we not only the power kind of went darken down, one system went down because uh, you know, general, the fue wasn't fueled or possibly didn't start. I can remember the exact thing. You know, this could help folks harden the communications infrastructure and provide reliable back power so you can communicate because that got to be a pretty hard to stand a system back up when no one could talk them. Excellent idea. We have a um, kind of on the same lines of that. This fund any string with backup power for individual residences. Not individual residences, but something like emergency response and communications. That's probably an instance where this program could look at batteries and put them in a positive competitive light within the matrix. That's what the group decides we want to do. So that's an example where standalone batteries that bring a lot of value outside of the discussion of microgrids and solar and stuff, but just batter red Dec to as well. I think at times as a utility, you know, electric utility, I we had a tendency see a littleer tunnel vision",

And so we'll kind of talk through what that looks. I don't know about you, but I'm not as familiar with energy modeling as some, and it is really technical if we go to the next slide. But essentially we're going to create a baseline, kind of baseline course scenario where we are trying to get from where we are today to meet our emissions goals in 2050. And taking a look at those emissions goals, how can we be on a trajectory to get there? What kind of changes do we need to make? What do we take into consideration? So we have that course scenario, and then how can we compare it to. So what kind of things can we find out by comparing different options of, let's say we're going to electriy a lot of transportation. Okay, well, does that happen faster or slower? And how does that change things? Do we retain fuels like natural gas within buildings long term, or is that change? There's a lot of different trade offs and evaluations, and that's kind of where we can kind of show the differences and opportunities within the state and kind of the economic or equity or other impacts. But the model can't answer all questions and so we're not going to necessarily litigate existing policies. We're going to be taking a look at what the future could evaluate, and there's some limitations to it. So it's not going to solve all our energy problems so much as it's going to be an evaluation kind of what the future might look like. And when you look at energy modeling, the importance of developing it is really developing it to create a trajectory. It's not to predict the future, not to predict exactly what's going to happen 20 years from now. I wouldn't trust it if it did. If anything, it's putting on its trajectory so we can see what the next, like three to five years should look like to make it, point of sudden, the right direction. Okay, next slide please. So, and it serves to inform our decision making. So, as I said, it's not going to predict the future, but it's the investigation of the different choices and options. So hopefully by doing this, we can have great conversations on our working groups and different engagement opportunities and talk about the different opportunities within the state of what should be incorporated or considered, and hopefully develop some strategies within the state of how do we can invest state dollars and what policies we need to develop to set us on a good trajectory for the future. Okay, next slide please. And so in, within all this, we're going to be trying to figure out some big energy questions. And so here's some kind of examples of pressing questions we have in energy and all naturally curious and want to know what our fe future is going to look like. But these are all the different things that we want to try to answer. By comparing different scenarios or different pathways, we might be able to go as a state. So, for example, what if some technologies or new clean energy resources are delayed or not developed? Hydrogen is certainly an option. That's certainly something we want to develop as a resource. Is that quickly developed and we certainly have immediate hydrogen supply or that s slow to develop within the state. And what will that impact and what would the cost of those different alternative fuels andus consumer adoption of, of heat pumps, likeric vehicles, certainly. I know you talk about transmission expansion. Is it easy to expand transmission and have access to the state? We certainly know there's going to be more wind development east of the Rockies. There's going to be a lot more solar development within the southwest. Is Oregon able to tap into those, develop transmission lines, so organize access to it? Or if it doesn't, does it need to develop more of a energy within the state? Because transmission expansion is hindered. So there's a lot of options there and things to consider. Okay. And I'll turn you over to eat it. Thanks, Michael. Yeah, next slide. So I'm going to take us a little bit into the weeds, but not too far, I promise, of the modeling, and it's so that you get, you can understand a little bit, kind of how we'll be looking at the world to come up with what's going to come out of all of this technical analysis. Because in the end, at a high level, what we're going to be doing is engaging with folks over the next few months to understand what the priority questions are that we can answer with this kind of tool. So essentially we can pull a few levers, but we have a budget. We can't pull every lever. And so we can test out if we have more or less transmission. What does that mean in terms of how much resource build we need in the state, outside the",

All rightty good morning, commissioners Chair Harrington. Thank you, clerk Moss. Welcome. And good morning, everyone, to Tuesday, June 18, 2024, the Washington County Board of Commissioners work session. This is Chair Katherine Harrington. I'm joined by Commissioner Roy Rogers, vice chair Nafisa Phi, and Commissioner Willie later today in our business meeting. I do anticipate that Commissioner trees will be zooming in from a different time zone, so we'll see how that goes for her. So we have two topics on our agenda before we go into our business meetings that are absolutely jam packed with the Housing Authority board of directors meeting and then the board of Commissioners meeting. Between the two meetings, we will be approving, if I have my numbers right, seven different budgets today. So it is a big budget day. Does anyone have any questions on either of the formal agendas before we move into work session? Just wanted to double check, so. Okay, well, without further ado, I can't remember. I can't believe I actually remember to check in on the formal agenda. Skip that step so many times. Amanda Garcias Snell, could you come up and join us and discuss the advisory council on Racial Equity appointments? Welcome. Good morning. Good morning. So, Amanda Garciasl community engagement manager as you may recall, when your board created the advisory council on Racial Equity as part of the equity resolution and community input, that because it was a new advisory council, we staggered terms. We had one set of terms that were folks serving two year term and then the rest of folks are being a three year term and from now on, folks will service for year term. That two year term has ended. And so bringing forward to you all recommendation from the advisory Council on Racial Equity to reappoint three existing members and then appoint to new members to fill some of the existing vacancies. And then we'll work to fill the rest of the, we'll focus on the two new members, Anna D. Deiana Johnson and Maye Mohamd. Anna Deiana Johnson brings experience as a disability advocate. And then May Mohamd is a muslim woman and a physician in the community. The process for Acre is to, there's a membership committee out of the Acre members that look at the applications and then also do just a brief 15 minutes conversation with folks to better understand their interest and what they might bring to the council. And so they have recommended those two for new members and then existing members, Don Kuma and Sue Saina Afamoyi, who is. Those are two of the founding members of Acre or the original members of Acre. And then Peter Hainley, who stepped in a midterm vacancy so ly would be reappointed to serve his first term. Commissioners, do you have any questions? It's been good. I spoed by everybody, right? Yeah. Ye, these are great applicants and I'm really pleased for the folks who are seeking reappointment as well. They've been great contributors. So, yeah, it's really wonderful. I think we're ready to do the appointments. Thank you. Terrific. Thank you. Well, that brings us a little early. I hope we're not catching our public safety and library local option levy team off guard. And if we have. Darn. Come on up anyway. Come on. We have plenty of chairs and plenty of mics. Welcome. Welcome. This bright Tuesday morning, I am just grateful that we are on the west coast and not having to deal with a heat dome. I have lots of relatives out there. There. Oh, my gosh. Don't worry. It's survivable. It's just brutal. It's brutal while we're doing it, isn't it? Good morning. Chair Harrington, board. Thank you for having us today. My name is Erin Calvert. I'm one of the assistant county administrators. I'm joining Danny Ledesma, another assistant county administrator, and Philip BRS for the communications officer. And today we're gonna talk with your board about the timeline and milestones for both the public safety and the library local option levies. And I would also like to add, we have Sheriff Caprice Massey, you're with us as well than. Thank you. Excell. Is the clicker even on yet? There. There you go. Okay. So the purpose of today's presentation, of course, is to establish board representation on steering committees for both levies. And I'm going to talk a little bit about this a little bit more. This actually will be adding a little bit of project structure to the levy work that we'll all be doing together. We're going to describe the progress so far for both the library and the public safety levy",

        "text": " I heard. So you have issues like that. And then let's go down to this next one. ##ide so this is an issue that we're working on to right now. And it's pretty confusing, perplexing for me, maybe, because I just don't understand these components. But all the literature I read about these components, these MC four connectors are having issues and starting a fire. So the certificate hold, this is a notification one. So the certificate holderll notify the Department of Energy within 72 hours of their currents involving the facility. If a, if b, a natural event such as earthquake, flood, tsunami, tornado, or human caused events such as a fire explosion, affects or threatens to affect the public health and safety of the environment. So what we have here is this is the same facility, Montiger Montague solar facility reported on August 14, 2023, a 2.5 acre, 2.5 acre brush fire caused by the failure of these MC four connectors. So the one on the right is our most recent reporting, but the one on the left, that's the one that happened first. So the MC four connector caught on fire and started this fire and started this brush fire. Right. The one on the right, they found they got to it before so that the fire event September 17. So they got to that smoking kind of part before it hit the ground started fire. So there's definitely an issue with the MC four connectors. And to me, you know, I did a lot of reading on literature about these MC MC four connectors, and they've been on, they'been out there for a long time. They're proven very reliable. So to me, I don't, I'm trying to figure out why what happened? Did they get a whole bunch of them, you know, that are maybe have some manufacturer issue, maybe it's installation because they said that they're doing some field assembly of these and c four connectors. And to me, being in construction as long as I was, I know it gets super dusty out there. And if these guys were just, and this is just my hothis, my thought, if the guys are throwing it in their pouch and there's dusty and stuff and then they put them together like they're supposed to, you know, maybe there's an issue there they still haven't figured out and we're still monitoring. But the last that they told us is they're replacing every single MC four connector in that solar facility. So I do intend on going out when they start putting those together, for one. I just want to gain more information because things like this, for me, is great knowledge for inspecting and going to other facilities that probably have the same MC four connectors. So it's just a good learning experience as well, but obviously not for them. It's very expensive. And that's all I have to for today. Is there any questions? Any questions? I see a thumbs up, so thank you. I can't even do in a mic or that's it. Okay, well, Sarah's giving a head nod that that's it, too. I making sure I don't miss anything. Thank you. That's again, I, you know, the work that you're doing like everyone else is extremely important, but in terms of holding people accountable, and I have all kind of theories on some of the things that happen, and I will be inquiring elsewhere, but we appreciate you being with us today and helping get through that agenda item. So it's, we are now at, let's say, action item. It says action item on here. The next one is when, oh, we did the plant compliance for you. All right, everybody good? We need to take a break. Everybody's good? Trucking on. We are trucking on. So the next item is Sarah Estersson with the council review and decision on amended mitigation plans. And Sarah, floor is yours. Thank you very much, chair Grail. Again, Sarah Estersson, senior policy advisor with the Oregon Department of Energy siting Division. Our presentation today is intended to be equal parts explanation of process and a substantive request for council approval. From a process perspective, council reviews and makes decisions on whether to grant site certificates. Site certificates can contain conditions that either directly require mitigation or require implementation and inherence to a mitigation plan that is typically attached to a final order in draft format. So site certificate conditions require mitigation or they refer to mitigation, and both the condition or the plan oftentimes allow a deference to department staff to approve an amendment of those mitigation requirements. But they also require that if the department reviews and approves that, that we bring it to council for concurrence. But it's sort of like outside of the formal amendment process. So we believe we have that authority under 469402 for the council to delegate and def, for future review and approval of a mitigation plan to the department. So our intent is to",

        "text": " the technical analysis is really looking at existing models and plans. So we're going to ground the analysis in recent utility integrated resource plans, clean energy plans, CPP compliance plans. We'll also be reviewing Oregon energy policies and document how the modeling accounts for them. So I've already mentioned a number of those policies. We also will be reviewing from a regional perspective. So it's important to take into account the Northwest power plan and also to follow key developments as the Northwest Power and Conservation Council develops the next plan and works on what we'll go into that. We'll also look at the POC, the Pacific Northwest Utilities Conference committees 2023, Northwest regional forecast. I think there's a more, okay. Yeah. We'll also be looking at regional program design elements so things like the Western Resource adequacy program, the different energy markets that are under development or already operational in the region. And we'll be looking at regional transmission planning efforts, including the Western Transmission expansion coalition, WestEc. So I'm going to pause there because kind of, that kind of wraps up the part of the presentation on the modeling and the technical analysis. As I mentioned, we're in a really early stage of this, and so this is really to give you kind of a shape of how we envision the modeling will look, how we'll be working with SETI to evaluate different pathways. And I'd like to pause to see if there are any questions on everything that's been presented up to now. Hi, Edith. I do have a question from Bill. He's interested in how local community opposition to renewables or new transmission systems might be figured into the analysis. Yeah, that's a really good question, and it's a difficult question to answer right now, the beginning of this work. But I'll say that this is one of the reasons that we are working on an energy strategy, because we want to hear from you how you view some of these challenges and some of the issues that are coming up in that opposition and to understand how this analysis could speak to that, and there may be places where there are limits on how much we can do in the technical modeling. But I'll just remind everyone that there'll be a policy discussion next year. And I think some of these things will more easily be addressed when we talk about policy gaps and policy opportunities. But, and we're also, we're also following, I should mention the solar Rules advisory committee right now who are doing some important work on this point. So we're very much paying attention to that, too. And I don't have any more questions, but I will just flag for folks again, if you do have a question, please add it to the Q and A. I'm keeping a close eye on it and can relay them to Edith as we go along. And Bill, thankd you for your answer, by the way. You did. And if you don't know how to see your q and A, look at the bottom right hand side of your screen. And there's a circle with a question mark inside a box there. And if you click on that, your q and a should pop up. Other than that, I don't see anything else having come in the chat. Okay. Thanks, Jessica. If you think of questions that you didn't ask now there's still a chance at the end, so it's not too late. All right. So now I'd like to turn to engagement opportunities since this is, I don't know, I'm thinking of this as the fun part. This is where we all get to, like roll up our sleeves and talk about what Oregon's kind of needs and opportunities and what sorts of solutions we can work on together. So as with the technical work, I'm really happy to say that we are getting ready to bring on board facilitator who has, like with our technical consultants, the Clean Energy Transitions Institute. Kerns and west were chosen through a competitive procurement process and we're thrilled to be working with them. We're just bringing them on board, as I said. So I'd like to caveat everything I'm going to say today by we still have to work out the details. And so I really encourage people, and you might hear this a few times today, to sign up, if you're not already signed up, for email updates, to check our website, because now that we are bringing kerns and west on board, we anticipate things moving pretty quickly and having more information for you shortly. Oops, sorry, I meant to speak to this slide. Okay, so first of all, we have three kind of structures in mind, three groups in mind for the energy strategy and for anybody who is there for the November webinar, this remains unchanged. So we have an interagency steering group that's already been formed that serves to ensure state agency coordination. And this group includes us. It includes the Department of Land Conservation and Development, the Department of Transportation, the Public Utility Commission, Department of Environmental Quality business, Oregon, and the governor's office and other agencies who are also",

So at that time, when you raise your hand, we'll call on you, we'll promote you, and you will be able to speak, can be heard and responded to in the main session. I'll just note that with this number of folks, we may not be able to get to all the questions that come up today, but we're going to provide some other avenues at the end of our conversation today, both for asking additional questions of the project team and getting response or submitting public comment. The chat function is available. You can use the chat function for technical requests. We have some project support folks that if you're having any problems accessing features or tracking the conversation, just let us know. You can also use the question or use the chat function as questions come up for you throughout the presentations, and we'll do our best to answer as much as we can today. I'll just note when using chat, I'm going to ask you all just to be mindful of not using chat for what I call virtual side conversations. It can both be distracting and really not helpful for a conversation, but rather to ask questions. And then just finally, we do have members, both have working groups and some members of the public. So just note that your chat will ultimately go to everyone so we can go to the next slide. As I said, as we move through our time together, you're going to have two substantive presentations, one an overview and onboarding into the Oregon energy strategy, and then another presentation on the strategy modeling. We're going to ask that folks hold their questions, and we won't be calling on folks until both of those presentations are done. But we have built in about 30 minutes for working group members Q and A for conversation and discussion, and then we'll land with some next steps. Hopefully, you all see your journey as it moves forward. We'll provide an opportunity again around how you can also get questions answered, reach the project team and submit public comment. Going forward with that, I'm going to pass it to actually, no, I'm going to pass it back to myself for working group agreements as we can go to the next slide. Thanks, Gill. As we spend our time together and as you all leave from this kickoff meeting and go into your working group spaces, we're going to offer the following both as best practices, but also as an ##k because these spaces are really meant to provide and result in productive, constructive conversations and discussions. We know that the deliberate attempt to get folks with varied perspectives, from different interests around topic areas that are critical and important to the work that we're all doing together, that you're not always going to agree. Importantly, where you get to consensus, where you find agreement is really powerful. But also so being able to disagree and deliberate with intention is also incredibly valuable and informative for Odo as it does its work and for Ceti. These agreements we offer in the spirit of productive, constructive conversations. One is to listen carefully, to really seek out and try to understand why someone might be bringing a perspective, what is their interest, what's their expertise, what's their experience that lends itself. So really listening to understand, to try to learn from each other as you do this work together and to do so in a way that is respectful, that is candid and honest and open, but ultimately leading towards constructive and progress. We're trying to move together to advance this work in ways that we'll meet the most needs across our state. We ask that you have an open mind, again, that you all may not agree, you may be coming from different perspectives, but that you're open to other ideas. You're not coming in so grounded in what you think, that you're not willing to listen and learn and hear other perspectives, that you are curious and ask questions and you clarify and you try to understand the why with, again, deep curiosity. That you're open, transparent, inclusive, and accountable. That you respect differing opinions. A lot of this is building off for each other, but powerfully seeking to resolve those differences in these spaces could be one of the most important aspects of the work that you do. Finding common ground will be incredibly important, as difficult as that may be in certain situations, and then just recognize that we all come into these spaces with different levels of experience, we have different personalities, and just really being cognizant of how much space you're taking up, it's step up, step back model. If you're the first person to raise your hand every time we ask, maybe you take a moment, take a breath, create some space for others. And if you're one of those folks that sits back and processes and takes more time, push yourself out of that, not into the anxiety zone, but into the growth zone, and",

        "text": " more in a moment. In terms of eligibility for this program, the program is open to all Oregon's 36 counties. The only other eligibility requirement is that a county does not have an existing energy or energy resilience plan that meets the content requirements of House Bill 3630, which we will go over in a moment. If your county is one of the counties that has an energy or energy resilience plan, most likely you're going to be able to access this program and these funds to update that plan and meet the content requirements of House Bill 3000 630. Just give us a shout when we can have a conversation about that together. There is no match requirement for this program, and it is a non competitive program for counties. Our application window opened on May 22, 2024, and will be open through February 28, 2025. And our program deadline is August 1, 2025. So in terms of the plan requirements, as Maxt said, the requirements for plan content are stipulated in House Bill 3630, and we're going to go over each of them just so we can really be clear about what we're talking about when we're talking about the requirements for this plan content. So the first one is that plans need to be based on and plan for short term, medium term, and long term power outages. These terms in terms of what they mean, they're not defined in the statute, but our guidance for short term is hours, medium term is days, and long term is weeks. You don't have to hold to that. But that does fit within the broader state approach to resiliency. And really, when we're thinking about things like Cascadia, that potential for weeks long outages. So something to consider there plans need to identify and map existing energy infrastructure in the county, including transmission lines, distribution lines, substations and energy storage systems, natural hazard risks, and communities that experience social vulnerability and social vulnerability, if you're not familiar with this term, refers to a group or a portion of the community's level of resilience in the face of external stressors such as energy disruptions or disasters. It's a composite measure comprised of different socioeconomic and demographic factors. So thinking about things like age, access to a vehicle, housing type, level of english proficiency, things like that, that can either increase resilience or lower it and increase vulnerability. Counties need to consult with representatives from environmental justice communities to identify and map socially vulnerable communities. Environmental justice communities are defined in Oregon statute in 477. So not in this one, but what that term, what that definition comprises. It's a significant definition. Rural communities, communities experiencing lower incomes, communities of color, tribal communities. We have the full definition in our faqs, and we can definitely go over each of that, but just wanted to give you a sense of what that term means. So reaching out to representatives from these communities to identify and map where social vulnerability is occurring in your county. Identify potential locations for community resilience centers and communication zones that the public can access during a power outage. So as it might sound, the intention of a community resilience center is a place that members of the public can go during an energy disruption during an emergency, likely intended to be provide services and resources for broader emergency needs. But specific to energy, you would be thinking about things like heating, cooling, air filtration and then charging of devices, charging of mobile devices. There might be other communication tools there, ham radio, satellite phones, things of that nature. And counties need to use locations of communities that experience social vulnerabilities to prioritize where these potential locations may be. So, thinking about where the communities with the most social vulnerability as priority places for some of your resilience centers, plans need to inventory the energy consumption needs of critical public services facilities. So you're seeing that term that is in our definition of what community energy resilience needs. It's really central to achieving it, central to these plans and what is a critical public service facility. This is defined in house Bill 3630. It is a facility related to law enforcement, fire protection, health and medical services, sanitation services, fuel and fueling, public works and engineering, public information and communications, and emergency response. And while that might sound like a lot, if we're thinking about an emergency, those are the essential services that to have community response happen in an emergency are really critical and to make sure that folks stay safe. Plans need to identify critical public service facilities where the development of alternate energy generation and storage resources will meet local energy resilience needs. The image shows some wind power and some solar power, but there are a lot of different ways that counties can approach alternate energy generation and storage resources. It could include these other renewable sources of energy. It could be backup fuel, fuel resources, generators, micro grids, battery storage, lots of combinations. And it can really be driven by your county's needs and your county's goals. Identify",

        "text": " And so that modeling is desktop versus on site. There stills to be actual modeling later on. But in that sort of front end, they can use the assumed DVA and then either can't go over ten, you know, increase it by ten. Or if you do, you have to get a waiver from the landowner. That waiver process could be the landowner doesn't care, they're fine, or they request new glass, new insulation some sound wall, something to mitigate the, the impacts. But that ability for the landowner who'going to be impacted can negotiate whatever it is that they're interested in to ensure that. And then, so it's really that two things that using that assumed DBA baseline and then that waiver process that only exists currently for wind because that was at the specific carve out that Tom'referring, to. So our proposal is to make that same, those same elements applicable to solar. A solar panel does not create noise, but the inverters, the transformers, the electrical lines, the battery storage, 100% those make noise. And in most circumstances that we've seen, you know, in solar projects, those exceed those not to exceed maximum thresholds at the point source. That doesn't mean that they're necessarily impacting, you know, adjacent noise sensitive receptors because of attenuation by distance, you know, that goes down, but it means that that needs to be evaluated because the location of houses, you know, you know, can be in close proximity to some of these facilities. So, so again, the base idea is it's worked for wind. It doesn't, doesn't remove any standards or requirements. It just allows for some more flexibility for the developer of the project. And then one other element is these are not council rules, as you're aware. They're the environmental quality commission at the Department of Environmental Qualities s rules. So we maybe the only ones implementing these days, I don't know. But because this is not your rulemaking, we're not asking you to have this on the list. We, you know, have had a conversation with the EQ. They're interested moving forward. But what they said is, hey, we haven't implemented these rules in 20 years or something. So, you know, you have the experience. This is really more oriented towards your stakeholders. So while they are going to be the decision makers, we're going to be doing much of the leg work. And, you know, a lot of it was done before. We're, we're not proposing anything really any different than what the wind rules say. So it shouldn't take much substantive work on our part, but it will take some sort of procedural effort on our part. That's why we wanted to make you aware of it because even though it's, I would say, probably hopefully minimal, it's still going to take some time. And so, you know, that's going to be primarily Tom's time. So that does remove his ability to work on some other things at the same time. Sure. Grail just to follow up. Yes. So thank you. That explains that. It's sort of a safe harbor for the developer, the baseline regiment. And then I think these are the standards we applied for the transmission line. Correct. Okay. Okay, so, yeah, it's the same, it's the same overall standards that app to any facilities, whether it's wind or solar or transmission lines or any type of facility. The only difference is based on those 2004 changes, which are only al. So this is to update to apply to solar. And thank you for doing the work of an agency. Ye, council member Condndon. Thank you. Chair grout, just a question and came up in B two h discussion as well with, when we discuss noise, the noise standard seems to be directed at human impact. Is there any analysis done? I don't think it's in the standard at all for a wildlife, not explicitly, but implicitly. So, you know, this standard is for sor, you know, either new industrial uses on existing industrial locations or, you know, non currently industrial locations. So creating, you know, a new kind of big industrial use. And what's that impact? And it is primarily oriented towards, and it's not construction. Its operation primarily, in fact, exclusively oriented towards, you know, impacts to, you know, people. We have, noise is an issue that is evaluated in protected areas, in recreation. So those, those don't have to meet the DEQ noise rules. They're just, hey, what's going to happen with this project? Is it going to impact a protected area? That part of that protected area is related to, you know, keeping the noise down. We look at that. We look at that same thing for recreation implicitly, you know, that also would be an issue for wildlife. So that would be part of the evaluation on the fisher wildlife habitat standard. There's nothing in there that",

        "text": " on the phone. A good reminder from a colleague just now, I believe you. It's one stars three and one star six. And I always get worried, but I believe you. Click star three to raise your hand and then star six to unmute yourself. So I'll confirm that and say it again in a minute the next time I have an opportunity to talk because, oh, I did it right. So star three to raise your hand, star six to unmute. So that's how you'll participate. So I don't see any questions in the chat, although I do see lots of great introductions from around the state, and we'll just move on to the program. And like I said, we'll get have plenty of time for Q and A after we kind of run through, run through our prepar prepared piece here. So for now, I'm going to hand things over to Rob Del Mar and to James Kogl, who are certified smart people when it comes to this new program. So, Rob, I'll go to the next slide and let you go. Thank you, Christriie. And I'm Rob Delmar. I'm a senior policy analyst with Oregon Department of Energy, and I help to put this program together over the last six months or so. And House Bill 2021, also known as the 100% Clean Energy for all bill, establish the new Community Renewable Energy grant program. And the purpose of the program, as stated in the bill, is to offset costs of planning and developing community renewable energy projects, support projects in traditionally underserved communities, promote small scale community renewable energy projects, and finally, provide direct benefits to communities by improving energy resilience, creating local jobs, promoting economic development, and offsetting local energy costs. Next slide, please. So one of the features that distinguishes this program from previous programs in Oregon is that it's only open to public bodies. Eligible applicants include tribes, cities, counties, and other public bodies, including these special districts. And there is an exclusion in the bill for cities over 500,000, which in Oregon, of course, includes only Portland. The program is also open to consumer owned utilities, and the Portland exclusion was done in recognition of the Portland Clean Energy Fund, which can provide funding for similar types of projects within Portland. And so. Next slide, please. Another focus of the program, another feature of the program is its focus on community energy resilience. The bill establishes carve outs where 50% or more of the funding must go to community energy resilience projects. And 50% or more of the funding must be for projects that serve qualifying communities. And we'll look at what that means in a moment. Next slide, please. So, qualifying communities include communities of color, low income communities, tribal, rural, and coastal communities, and other traditionally underrepresented communities. In Oregon, the definition of the bill is fairly open, and we're hoping to see projects kind of in every corner of the state. According to these, you know, the carve out to get 50% of the funds to these communities. Next slide, please. The bill also called for an advisory committee to work with the Department of Energy on program Design. And now program implementation. You'll see that clean water agencies had Alan Johnson from City of AG Gre Gresham representing clean water agencies. We also have Les Perkins of the Farmers irrigation district on our committee. And so we had a really good group of folks help us put this together. And they're going to continue to help us implement the program. Next slide, please. Since the passage of House Bill 2021, we've been very busy standing up the new program. In the summer of 2021, Oto staff were assigned to the project and developed an implementation plan, including operational staffing, and it changes within the agency. In September, we recruited the stakeholder advisory committee to help guide the program design and develop the program rules, and that effort resulted in draft rules being posted with the secretary of State's office on January 1, and those rules are now final. Our opportunity announcements for the program came out on March 7. Next slide. So before we move on to the specific grant opportunities, I'd like to walk through a project that the Eugene Water and Electric board completed a few years ago. The city of Eugene, like much of western Oregon, could be subject to significant damage from a Cascadia earthquake. And as a utility that manages both electricity and water services, EWEB recognized the importance of energy and water delivery and was well positioned to support a resilience and disaster recovery within Eugene that could address both the energy and water issues. Next slide please. So EWEb considered community energy resilience based on the rule of threes, and that is, in the first three days provide access to drinking water. In the first three weeks, repower critical facilities, and in the first three months, complete system repairs and restore restore service. Next slide please",

        "text": " a day or over 24 hours a day. The electric fire trucks that are on the market right now are about twice as expensive. So, as an example, these fire engines were about 700,000 apiece. 750 or a diesel engine. The electrics are 1.2 to one point form. The electric fire trucks still have a diesel engine. They do, yeah, they're hybrids, they hybrids. And so the battery runs for about 2 hours, and then the diesel motor in the back turns on, and then you were on diesel t until it charges the battery back up. So you really run, you run the hybrid. So you're paying twice as much for a hybrid. Some of the, some of the LA bought one, have that it st even in service yet. Theyve had a lot of issues with it. Pierce does build one. They, they sold one to Portland. Portland bought one, havent got it yet. And I think theres some delays on that. And then the other issue that I think, and they wont sell you a fleet of them. They will sell you one trop. And ive had manufactured selling. We will not sell you a fleet because its not dependable enough to be run as a fleet, prot. So I think it's. I think they're a little premature at this point. I think if they can get the design where the truck will run longer than 2 hours on the battery, the battery is more sustainable. You know, we're running this fleet will be run almost 18 years. Get out of it. You know, is it a fabric in the last 18 years? Probably not. So there's a lot of unanswered questions, I think, but it, in the future, I think they're going to continue to develop this. We're seeing mean look at passenger cars. They come a long way in their, their length of travel and how efficient they are and all those kind of things. Fire trucks are just like I said, they're just bas right now. So we. My recommendation was you go with the diesel fleet. This is that with the number of calls we're running, you know, we may be looking at replacements. Link in less than 1815. Is that the average want run. So we're constantly watching what's in the field. One of the things we did do with this SL is we replaced all the rescing tools. The jaws of life used to be gasoline motors, hydraulic fluid through hoses. That's how they've been forever. The new ones are mining are all electric battery. They're faster, they're cheaper, less weight. They cut open and close very much very quickly. You cut a whole car apart. So. So we are. We are looking at the technology that we can or we can electrify things go away from that's. That's a two cycle motor. It runs when you run that pump and so it does have emissions and carbon footprints and. And the batteries have some too because lithium stuff for disposal. So we are. We are experimenting where we can and where we feel it's safe to do so we're not have impact community that being our. Thank you. Yeah it's good folks haven t had that conversation. And also just for everyone's information all of the diesel that we run in the city when we can. Yeah. Is most of the time it's all u in allc we've been doing that for quite a reason. Well what if we wanted to replace that the flee in half the time. I'm curious about thea how much impact the diesel engine vins have on resale value. Shorter period of time. Probably a discussion for down the road but let's say we wanted to replace that a mo electric or something like thate. I guess what I would say is the sooner you sell something the more value it's going to have in a resale market for somebody else to buy it. I mean as an example when we sold our last fleet they were 18 years old and the market at that time they were about 30,000 since was thousand dollars putment. Right now fleet is telling us our current trucks that we have will be worth about 100,000 bas on the market. So we'll get more money for those hundred thousand each. Yes. Yeah I was like really 30 grand. They're 18 years old but they do have a value so it just depends. So if you're you know large cities will run and sleep for ten years and then they put them in reserve status and then they' they'll buy. We wouldn't be able to do that at least for ten years because of so what I would recommend if that is consideration is don't buy half to I and that's what I was thinking trying it out charging in one of our stations or something I the requirements for this truck battery charges electric truck battery are significantly more than TEsLA. And it's about $250,000 at each station for all the charging. So it's not just across the truck it's the",

Okay, well, I guess we can go ahead and get started. Yeah, go ahead. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to the Oregon Department ofergies energy Efficiency and Conservation block grant program. We're casting a webinar to help answer all questions that you may have. And I think we've won some sort of award for having the longest webinar title that I've ever seen. So ads off to us at this point. Let's see on our next slide, I want to just introduce our EEC CBG team. That's a lot shorter version. I myself, I'm Roger Kainu. I'm an analyst with the organization. Been with energy for about ten years now. And I'll hand it over to Emily. Thanks, Roger. Hi, everybody. My name is Emily Salmey. I am one of our federal grants officers at OtO. I've been with the agency for just about a year now and I'm sort of involved with all of the different federal opportunities that some of you probably heard about coming to the state and helping us acquire those funds and figure out what to do with them and then track them as, as we go through these projects, making sure that we're using them appropriately. And I'll hand it over to Sarah. Hi, all. My name is Sarah Murky. I'm the community navigator for the Oregon Department of Energy. I started last year in a new program and my job is to help environmental justice communities access federal and state funding for energy projects. So field, feel free to reach out to me with my email on the screen on this or this program, probably Roger and Emily are the better people, but for any of our other programs that you're interested in, I'm happy to be the front door person. Thanks. I like the way you put that. Sarah, the front door person. Very good. All right, we can get started with some program goals for the EECBG program. They're made available through section 4000, 552 of the IJA to support local government projects. The aim is to reduce fossil fuel emissions, lower a community's total energy use, improve energy efficiency, and also or build a clean and equitable energy economy. Eligible activities, I'm going to cover these in greater detail later, which is in a broad brush attempt here. We want to, we want the eligible activities to be centered around energy efficiency. So building audits and retrofits that include grid interactivity, electrification, and home energy scoring. So those sort of messaging campaigns throughout your community, and then also energy savings, performance contracts for efficiency and electrification of your own municipal buildings. I'm sure some of you have had ESPCs before where you hire a contractor and they come out and do the energy work for you. And also we're including building efficiency and electrification campaigns. The next category is renewables, and that is solar installations and battery storage, such as power purchase agreements and direct ownership. Transportation is a third bucket, and that's centers around electric vehicles for municipal fleets, EV charging infrastructure for the community. Well, by the way, we're recording this. I think we probably mentioned that somewhere in here, but also this information will be available in the recording and the slides available on our website. So you'll be able to dig into that. And at the end of the webinar we'll go ahead and open it up for questions so you can come back and say, hey, what about that slide? And I had a question about this or that, so just want you to be relaxed about what we're going to cover eligible entities. This is Emily's slide, so take it away, Emily. They great. Thanks, Roger. I'also mentioned that this. Apologize if you already said this, Roger, but this slidehow is posted to our website. So if we're going too fast for you, feel free to follow along through our website and download that presentation there, however you guys want to use that. One of the things I should probably just mention is that the EECBG award was given to us through the US Department of Energy. And one of the requirements of this, and hence the reason we're talking to you guys today, is that we have to sub sub grant at least 60% of the funding that we received. And that's what we're getting ready to open this this week. So one of the big questions that we've gotten around this program so far has had a lot to do with. Am I even eligible to apply? Right. So one of the rules is that you must be ait of unit of local government. Pardon me. And so while we know that that obviously includes cities and counties, we've done a little bit of research and digging and found that that also includes other local government entities. So if you're curious about what that might include, or if you are one",

E erica was just about to start our economic opportunities, so I have some hard copies here if anybody needs a hard copy. Okay, like we're all good. I'm going to share my screen here. Hold on 1 second. Oh yeah, I'made that just for you. Thank you. You have a background 101 on how this who community? Yes, I do. Here. Is that part of. Yep, that is. I just need to we go. There we are. The magic, the magic of screen sharing on it just takes me a minute with live streaming and getting everything ready. I know. So yes, tonight we're going to be talking about a little refinement to our economic opportunities analysis. Our last economic opportunities analysis was adopted in 2021 and it was adopted as part of the city's comprehensive plan update. Tonight I'm going to talk a little bit about the state requirements for an eoa. I'm going to talk about what has changed from our last eoa, the three major things that have changed from the last v away. I'm just going to give them away here. Really quick is our employment growth forecast and then our forecast for land, our land forecast for needed employments and then also ourable lands inventory has been updated. So next at our next meeting on April 25, we'll have a hearing on this subject and the planning commission will make a recommendation to council. So whether or not to approve this document or approve it with modifications or just to deny it. So what is goal nine? So I've already talked a little bit about our state land use system with our planning commissioners and we have 19 statewide planning goals and how our comprehensive plans for cities and counties need to address all applicable planning goals that relate to their cities and counties. We have twelve statewide planning goals that are applicable to Sherwood and goal nine. In the statewide planning goals section talks about economic development and what we really need to do is cities and counties. We need to provide adequate opportunities throughout the state for a variety of employment jobs to create vital communities for the health, welfare and prosperity of",

        "text": " be reimbursable, is that correct? Yes. So it's kind of how the rules have been written in that cost the project'still, eligible, but only those costs incurred after the application deadline would be eligible. Costs for the grant to fund, for the grant funding to be used on. Rob, you want add that? Well, just one thing, and I think Charlie mentioned that for a renewable energy only project that's a constructive project, the grant is only able to cover 50% of the funds anyway. And so I think the part of the question was getting to, you know, those funds that are expended prior to the grant deadline, could those be counted in the 50% of funds that are provided by the, not as necessarily as match, but as those funds that can't be reimbursed by the grant. And therefore, you know, if you were starting a project now and incurred some costs, anything that you purchased now I think would not be reimbursable, but potentially could count as the 50% of project cost. And I'm not sure. I wanted to just clarify with James how we think about that. Would those be eligible to count as the 50% of project cost that the local. That the partner is providing? Yes, as we got it written in the rules, that would be count, but. So the funds expended could be included in that kind of total project cost, but our funding would only be able to cover those costs that are expended after the application deadline. So thanks for that clarification, Rob. Ye does that help, Charlie? Yeah, I think that answers the question. And so, so long as we didn't spend beyond 50%, we might still be in a position to reap the benefit of, of the funding. Okay. And'that's how I see it, at least at this point, is we wouldn't be exceeding that. So that helps. Thank you. Great. And I think Leah's question just gotott answered as we were chatting about can you use incurred cost before the application deadline for the matching portion, for that matching portion for clean energy projects? That then the answer, I think, is yes. Right? Yes. And it's not like, correct me if I'm wrong, but it's not like precisely a dollar for dollar match. It's just we can cover up to 50% of the cost for it. All right, any other questions? Any other, I don't see any other hands raised. Nothing in the chat. This is usually the time where, like, five questions come in at once. Keith, I'll let you know when you're off mute. All right. You should be good. Thank you. Yeah. Keith Hmman again, city Forest grow light and power. He does. As part of that 50% match, does in kind work done by the utility constitute a portion of that? Is it all just financial? 50%? Do e thought on that. So I'm just looking at the precise language, because we have some language in our roles about not covering kind staffing costs. That kind would be covered in the ordinary kind of work processes of the project sort of thing. The organization, I should say. It's in the statute, actually. It's in the rules and the statute. Yeah. Yeah. So if it's like, if you hire a consultant or something like that, that could be covered, but staff for its existing staffing costs, that's the statute limits that. Okay, so you mean, like, we couldn't construct portions of the project or prep work that would not count towards it then our own crews, correct? I think that's correct. We can keepith. We'll look into that to make sure because I think things like the materials could be covered, you know, but I think it's just the actual staff time. That is what it's like if it's an existing staff member, that seems like the statute was trying to dissuade against that. Gota okay, thank you. Yeah. All right, jennifer has your hand up. Go ahead, jennifer. Point with community solar, if there was storage added to something like that, would that be considered a resilience project and be eligible for 100% or is a community solar project always going to be just a renewable category? Rob. So, adding storage to community solar could definitely turn a project into a resilience project, so long as that storage was serving some community resilience function. And so, yeah, definitely. I think that we'll probably see more and more community solar projects adding storage for exactly that reason. And within the competitive reviewing process, you, there will be an evaluation of just how much resilience benefit is brought to the community through the project. And so, you know, a project that's powering a community space, a library, a fire hall, things like this are really clear examples. But if it's a you, a",

        "text": " screen council councilmb Devlin council talk to to everybody did there thumbs up. Thank you. Providing such clarity and the last update is the important in way amendment number one and the challenge on the denial of the contestication I'll turn that over to mister as well. I provideed you an update last month that in that matter was filed in Union County Circuit Court in that we intended to, we had filed mot to transfer to the Supreme Court. That motion has been denied, so for now it stays in Union County Circ court. Council memberer, just a quick question. We got the l to the Supreme Court down Onilla coing project. Any idea publication there? I can'tember time they had to decide. Yeah, recordnet. The Supreme Court has six months within which to reach its final decision, and I believe that not the time of filing or is it the time of was six months from when the petition was, petition for review was filed. And right now I, I can't recall stop my head on that petition as well. I want to say it was wr, early in November. The oral argument was right. So it might, it might have been early December. Right. It might have been early December and probably to three soc, availability is just a reminder. The Boardman Hemingway project U, you know, which was quite vol, luminous and complex. They issue their final decision in four. Yeah. So I don't, that means I'issue this decision, you know, in less than six months. But I think, again, going back to how our process works is, you know, that it gets refined along the way from the notice of intent to the draft proposed order, you know, all the way through cont test the case in the final order that there is a good, clear, clean record. That's the design that the Supreme Court then has all of that information that's well articulated and that's the design is to allow them to be able to have all that information with which to make a relative decision. Nancy, can you the slide, please? Okay. See that very well. So, you know, it's not every council meeting, but when there is some incidents or significant compliance activity, provide you that update. So we did receive earlier this month from the Biglo Canyon wind farm a incident notification. So they found a broken bearing, blade bearing bolt at the base of a particular wind turbine. And they notified us within the timeframe after the incident that was sp, they tested all the bolts on that particular wind turbine. They all passed. And just as a reminder, this was an issue where we've had, you know, elements with the bigow canyy wind farm wind turbines. We had other issues with Bo and other things falling off the wind turbines, but they currently have a monitoring protocol which on an annual basis, they will go out and check all these same pol on every singleter. So, you know, in this case, you know, not great that the BoL fell down, but, you know, what are they, what are the follow up activities? And that's, I think, where it's always important. What do do now they already have protol. It was previously every four years, now it's every year. So we concluded that there was no additional follow up that's needed. They reported it. Finally, they already have an annual protocol for testing those. So for us, that was sufficient to move forward and conclude this incident. Okay, moving on to. We are currently in the short legislative session, so we talked previously about three bills that relate to the energy facility siting Council House Bill 40000, one five that proposes to add a definition of battery energy storage systems in FX definitions. So as you recall, we have numerous projects where the council has reviewed and approved battery storage, but those are in conjunction with a wind or solar or natural gas facility, so they're not bying themselves. So currently there is no definition of battery energy storage, whether it's in FX statutes or conservation development commission statutes or anywhere. We know there needs to be, you know, a lot more battery storage systems out there. And the market is such that we're going to start seeing independent ones not associated with projects. So that's what this legislation is intended. To start. Start with is to create some justification that there is a path. So what it would do is, you know, I said put a definition in and then it would allow opt in to FSEC by a developer. That's all the battery, or that's all the legislation does. It doesn't clarify how at the local level it would be reviewed and approved. There's different thoughts on that, but I think this is the first of probably, you know, a couple of different builds related to battery energy storage. I don't think this will be the end of it. I think this is just the beginning of it. So likely we'll see more of",

        "text": " required by the goals, then must reject the exceptions. So that's my bottom line. Thank you. Other comments. Councilmember Byer, thank you. And I would concur with counselr how goal two is a foundational goal. And I think I agree with the odo counselor that it just doesn't require this activity, this setback requirement. More credit to you, Matila county, for adopting it, but it doesn't apply to our, it doesn't directly apply to our process. It just, it just doesn't. So thank you. Thank you, Counciler Devlin. Oh, yes. I would concur with two counselors that spoke before for me and also would want to state for the record that because of this ultimate underlying basis, that we can only impose those requirements required by the goal in terms of specific standards. There are some of these exceptions which I do not have adequate evidence to say whether this is a part of the facility, whether this goes through three zones or four zones, because actually that whole argument is moot at this point. Once you've made the decision that you can only apply the standards that are required by the underlying goals, then these other questions are moot. And I don't see any reason to decide based on each exception in that case. Thank you, councilmber Condon. Thank you. I concur with the counselors who have spoken so far. I can't make can't get there for the exceptions. Thank you. So for the record, this is Marcy Grail. As I stated, I have things that I question. I do want to be clear. You have council members who are representing all over parts of Oregon and I think we all take our responsibilities really seriously. I'm a very literal person. I've read documents and I can't get past what I've read. I've listened. It's compelling arguments but I agree with the rest of the council. Thank you. Jordan had to step away. I don't believe he is with us now. Thanks for reminding. But the last text I got had popped away. Just confirming so I can make the note. So for all of the group three exceptions, you're essentially going with number one, you agree with the hearing officers findings and conclusions in the proposed contestic key. I'll make note of that. So I think at this time we can go to the next slide and this is the proposed order review at which point I hand it back to department staff. So it is 1217. Can either have Kate come up and go through the last kind of portion of this or we can take a break and get lunch and come back. Just depends on what counsel council wants to do. Oh, are you all feeling is I here? Take a break. I've heard take a break. You have sandwiches. We did do this as a working lunch. So in time to grab sandwiches, eat a bit, but feel free also to be eating while Kate is presenting the next one. So however much you want to take to do that is your choice. Recommendations on time? Ten or 1510 or 15? What's your pleasure? Let's go with 15. We could take a minute. So the time is now 1218. Oh goodness. If we could come back at 1233 that would be great. Thank you. All right, thank you. The time is now 1233 and we are going to resume our meeting. We have Kate Sloan back, ready to continue on. Kate, the floor is yours. Thank you, chair Grail and counsel, for the record, this is Kathleen Sloan, senior sing analyst for Department of Energy and I am resuming our review of the proposed order of the Nolan Hills wind application for site certificate. So we're on agenda item one b and I'm going to pick up the review of the proposed order under the land use standard with a couple of caveats. Next slide. So in the comments received from council on the draft proposed order, we had two issues identified. One was the goal three exception for the solar facility. It's more than twelve acres and an EFU exclusive farmaruone and item number two was the Umattila county two mile setback, which was the subject of contested case and counsel has just reviewed all of that. So I'm not going to cover that topic in my presentation. I will just focus on the goal three exception as this was not the subject of the contested case. Next slide. So, just as a refresher, the proposed facility would be up would include up to 1000 896 acres for a solar pv photoopvoltaic, energy generation components, a battery storage system and associated roads. The solar components would impact over twelve acres of high value in arable farmland and for that reason required that council take an exception to the statewide policy embodied in goal three for agricultural lands order to be cited in the proposed location. So this was part of the request to hold the record open and during council'review in May of",

        "text": ", we can go on to slide five. This is just a quick diagram of what we think you're probably seeing in front of you as the Webex format. It seems like it looks different on different people's end sometimes, but we just want to make sure, you know, take a second right now to kind of look at how you can share your hand. On my screen, it looks like a little bit of a raised fist sitting side by side with the smiley face and some forms. Sometimes people see the smiley face and they kind of hover over it and then they get that raised fist. That is a tiny raised hand, I guess. So you can look for that now. So you know how to raise your hands. And then you should also be able to see a place to open up the chat. And so if you haven't open chat yet on mine right now, I'm clicking it. It looks like a little quote box at the bottom. So make sure you open up your chat. And, and then you can ask questions in there as well. So take a second, make sure that you know how this is going to work today. And then for those on the phone, you can use star three to raise your hand, and then we'll unmute you and we can call on you. And then we'll practice us asking a question and then waiting in awkward silence to see if anybody has any, anything they'd like to contribute. So if you have any questions about using Webex or having any issues and want to flag those for us, I'm going to go ahead and count to ten and see if anybody has any issues, then we'll move on. All right. I think we're good to go on to you, James. Thank you, Christy. So quick summary of what happened in the 2023 legislative session related to this program. House Bill 30040 nine extended the sunset of the Oregon Solar Pl storage rebate program, and that is now extended to January 2, 2029. The end end of session bill also included an additional investment of $10 million in the program. And there was also a tweak to some of the language that is used in the program. The existing language in the Oregon laws required that a contractor purchase, construct, and install a paired solar and storage system together. House Bill 340 nine amended that language and requires that only the purchase need occur at the same time and the installation may occur separately. The solar electric system and the energy storage system still need to be paired once fully installed. This change comes into effects at the start of 2024. Before move on, are there any questions about anything that happened at the legisl session related to the program? Okay, I'm talking on mute. I was just saying I don't see any hands raised. And just a reminder, for those on the phone, you can press star three, but it doesn't look like anyone has any question in the legislation. Thanks, Jamesames. Great. Thanks, Christy. So now a quick, high level overview of the rulemaking process. So we're in the early stages right now information gathering. We start off with some stakeholder consultation, and after kind of gathering the information and considering all the feedback, we'll draft up some rulural language and then file them with that draft language with the secretary of state. This kicks off another comment period during which we seek additional feedback on the rules and the draft rule language, and it impacts. So the fiscal impact or some of the other impacts that will be listed on the rule proposal form. We review and consider all this information that we received during this comm period, and then, then we go move into finalizing the rules and then file those with the secretary of state. And only then, once they're filed through the secretary of state final rules, do they become effective. So this process can take a varying length of time. And for this rulemaking, we anticipated taking approximately about four to six months. But that might change depending on what we're hearing from stakeholders. So we're posing a few changes to the program rules, starting with one of the ones I just kind of mentioned during the legislative session. We're proposing changing the definition of paired solar and storage system to align with those recent legislative changes. So this will require only the purchase of a paired solar and storage system to occur at the same time. The installation may be done separately afterwards. We heard that there were delays associated with the shipping and installation of storage and want to hear whether they're still occurring and which of the options I'm going to go through in a moment would be the most effective at reducing the impact of those delays within what we can do with the program and how the program runs. So the options being considered include permitting the solar incentive portion of the rebate to be claimed separately from the storage portion following the installation of the solar system and proof that it's all complete. This would include passing any inspections from the authority having jurisdiction. It",

        "text": " issue. Well, I don't want to speak for next era, but I thought that they actually have a policy for 34.5 kv lines that are there underground. We haven't dealt with high voltage underground proposals yet. I was seeing more lines. Big change. Any other comments? Okay, as previously stated, the comment deadline is June 7 at 05:00 p.m. the applicant will be given until Monday, June 10, at 05:00 p.m. pacific time to provide responses to comments. However, if requested by the certificate holder, the department is authorized to grant them additional time to respond. Does the applicant wish to provide any responses tonight? Yes, sir. Thank you for the opportunity. Again, this is Ryan Hill with the wagon trail solar project. And could you go ahead and go to slide 15 that I sent over earlier? Yeah, slide one five. I just kind of want to address some of the comments brought up tonight. Sorry. Let me get logged in here and just kind of talk through our thinking specifically on the goal three exception, but to kind of answer some other things. Right. The ouroxious weed plan, our fire mitigation plan, those are living documents. Right. So we, we update those when there's a new piece of information. And, you know, a larger company like my parent company, Nexter Energy Resources, we're going through pre construction compliance of a wind project also in Morrow county. And so all the lessons learned that we get from that noxious weed mitigation plan, fire mitigation plan, we bring to our other projects as well. So while you might not have seen those changes for this specific project, they are coming. Additionally, I walk through with the Moore county emergency manager this week with our operating site, right. Just to get his input on our operating facility, what we could do better, his input, the coordination with the local first responders. And then we went a step further where we brought in our construction superintendents to talk about, hey, what are we doing during construction? What can we do better? You know, how are we going to coordinate with the county if there is an emergency, whether it's fire related or a personal injury, you know, working out all those details. And then additionally, you know, he get to see up close and personal, you know, a battery storage system as well as solar panels and wind turbines. So I think it was a good experience for him. And so we are doing that coordination. And, you know, sometimes all of these plans are pretty detailed, but it's hard to include every little thing we are, we are doing within the county. And the same thing goes for the noxious weed plan. You know, we talk to our neighbors, Chris, he'll let us know if he has an issue for sure. And then, you know, we try to be responsive and correct that issue. As well as working with Corey Sweeney at the weed superintendent for Morrow county as well. It's taking those lessons learned from our operating or further along in the permitting process projects and pulling that to these projects. Like all these documents are living documents and need to be updated as new information, recommendations from county staff or, you know, subject matter experts comes up to date. And then just to, I know there's a little bit of mystery of our agricultural mitigation plan. So I just kind of want to talk through how we got there and what, what our thinking was right. And so just an overview of the land we're using. Um, predominantly not high value farmland. We're not using any irrigated landh. It's mostly dry land weekeat. And yeah, we are expected to impact about 3700 acres of that land. Next slide, please. And so here'here's kind of the reasons for a goal three exception. And just to be clear, uh, I think we fall under the, that third bullet point, um, for other relevant factors or what to referred to as reasons, just to be clear. All right, next slide, please. All right. Exception is warranted to allow a locationality dependent facility that will fulfill important state and county goals by providing renewable energy and minimizing impacts on local farming practices. And I kind of want to discuss more how we're trying to minimize our impacts on local farming practices. Next slide, please. All right. Location dependency, right. We already have. We own and operate two existing facilities directly adjacent to the wagon trail solar project, and then we operate a third additional facility there. We were trying to group these projects as close together, one to not spread out all over the county, all over the land. The closer that we can get all these facilities, um, you know, the more land there are adjacent to farm around. And we don't have a bunch of little nooks and crannies within",

        "text": " will feed it. It's really exciting. Yeah, I want to know like that but bigger, right? Yeah, I want to know how that looks across the whole city. Yeah, yeah, ysoutely. Absolutely. And I just want to say again, working with Heather and others, we that microgid was a huge win. It's the first one in the state that Odo awarded and the first micro community microgrid. So we're really excited about that project and thankful to work with your staff. The other one that I want to know, and I dont have the numbers in front of me but I certainly can get the most. Ryan might actually have them. But because you were a member of, you signed for the green future impact and you were a part of green future enterprise in terms of city facilities energy, you are tremendously ahead on getting your again, city facilities from renewable resources and I'm happy to provide those numbers but Ryan may actually have them as well. I don't want to put you on spot, Ryan, but you might have those numbers as well. We're right around 85%. 85% of the electricity for our facilities are renewable. Electricity that we buy from PGE is renewable. There's also we buy from Sam Electric, and the facilities are in their service territory. But what we purchased from PGE is around 85%. Does that. So if you were to factor in the co generation facility at will a lake, does that number even go up higher than. Because I'm assuming we're not purchasing that electricity. I'm not sure how that factors. Okay. Cause that's electricity we're generating. Right? So this would be electricity that we are purchasing forge. So in terms of totally usage, that would be an interesting thing to look atuse. That's a huge amount that's powering out basically that whole facility. Great, Michael. Yeah, I do. So, wendy, thank you. This is Mike Slater. I'm a Salem planning commissioner. I'm very interested to just pick up a council, councilloor Stapleton, on how we expand the footprint of renewable energy in Salem and storage facilities. I'm particularly interested from a resiliency standpoint as well. Have you worked with a city that has developed, like, their own energy plan, like a renewable energy plan or resiliency plan, like a citywide, to get what councilloor Stapleton was talking about, like a long term city strategic plan? Well, there's a few cities that have climate action plans, and I think each of them has a slightly different focus. There's certainly about reducing the greenhouse gas emissions, and some of them have components of resiliency. But again, this is probably Multnomah county and city of Portland may have components of that. Milwaukee also has a climate action plan as well. But part, I think, if I. And Heather certainly can correct me, but a part, I think, of the city of Salem was a resiliency component, and the microgid is an example of that. Again, that was the first one that we're doing that is all connected to, certainly includes battery storage and the public works building and community members. So that's the first of a kind. And that really is towards resiliency, because in the event that facility would continue to operate. But we are happy to look at more ways to build on that in Salem that if that is of interest with all of you as leaders. So you don't have. You aren't aware of a city that has, like a master plan or comprehensive plan related to energy production, distribution, storage. We have a transportation master plan. We have a comprehensive master plan, a parks master plan. I'm just wondering if other people have an energy master plan. No. No, we don't. We don't? No. In fact, again, I'm just going to compliment you, because City of Salem has generally been at the forefront before you had the climate action plan. You did have a. You guys can correct me. City staff can correct me, but you had an energy plan in terms of energy efficiency and conservation and some targets around that. Before. I can say this, because I. I'm going to age myself. I've been here a little. A while, and I can say that it was ahead of many other communities when you first introduced even an energy plan. I think that was from 2010, I'm not mistaken. Energy efficiency block conservation, block grant program. We had a community energy plan that was developed back then. Can I lean into this just a little bit? And, Chris, I'd love to hear your thoughts, but I would love to see this. This idea of a comprehensive plan on how do we get to this place where everybody has that micro. What is it called? Grid. Thank you. And. And renewable energy is. It's across the city. And for those purposes, both the twofold, being resilient and also addressing our. Our",

        "text": " and sometimes those create excess capacity, meaning there's more production than the grid can take. And so the basic idea there then is to have battery storage that can take that excess power, hold it for 12 hours, and then release that onto the grid when the solar panels aren't producing power or the wind turbines aren't producing power. But I have not heard the circumstances, council member Devlin, that you just articulated. Madam Chair, I. We should encourage, actually, in projects, battery storage because of the issues that secretary has cited and the fact that sometimes they can't sell their power, sometimes they produce more of their power. But what I would hate to see is some sort of speculative way in which somebody might try to utilize low rates that might be available in a co op, and then to sell the power in the open market at the highest rates that they could get over a period. Also, I would hope that the local governments and I would assume that they would, they would consult with their local energy provider, because some extra loads that are not anticipated can cause difficulties for some of those providers. Thank you, Councillor Devlin. I do think it's a really interesting question. Yeah. For us all to contemplate. Yeah. No, I hadn't contemplated that. Again, the, you know, all the conversation has been about sort of the circumstances that I talked about, but never had heard that one. So that is interesting. Thank you. Next, House Bill 40 90. So that was a proposal to eliminate F sec jurisdiction on projects that are entirely proposed on federal lands that did not move forward. So that one did not get through the Senate process. You got through the House but not the Senate. And then finally, House Bill 1525. So this was, as I indicated before, a much larger bill. One component was Portland General electric made an amendment to that that would allow for standby generators to be connected to the electrical grid and dispatch to the grid in certain circumstances. So if you recall, in order for a. A standby generator, you know, as defined, it couldn't be connected to the grid. So this bill changed that, that standby generators can be connected to the grid, and inir circumstances, they can provide power to the grid, and then it still retains that they're not f sector jurisdictional or they're exempt from f sector jurisdiction. So essentially, as I stated before, this would create a functional peaker plant, a cumulative peaker plant across an area. You have a lot of data centers, have diesel backup generators. You intel, Oregon, Oregon, Ohsu. All these sort of big companies, big industries, or big sort of facilities who need back of generator typically have those diesel generators on site. So as the, I guess the way to kind of describe it as there is more issues of renewable energy and more inconsistencies, or we get circumstances like the power, the snowstorm and the power outages, this creates more opportunities for those to kind of ramp up as a peak or plant would in those circumstances. Those circumstances are defined by the, by code of federal regulations. So they can't just use it all the time, but there are some limitations as to when they could use them. Buyer. So because there are federal regulations defining the circumstances, there would be no f SEC rulemaking on this, or would we do a rulemaking to ref, like the federal standards? Yeah, that's a good question. We probably do need to do rulemaking to reflect that, but we wouldn't be in any hurry just because, you know, statutorily it's changed and, you know, we probably need to clean up our rules to reflect that consistency. But, yeah, no hurry on that. Okay. Thank you. Because we just had this long list. Right. All right, next are future council meeting dates. So the next council meeting is April 19. That will be in Salem. We'll only need Friday. So I think that'be more of a typical 830 to Nish. We are still trying to finalize the agenda, but at least the one agenda items that we know right now would put us in that kind of range. And then, again, thank you. We talked about this yesterday for willingness to move the May meeting to the 30th and 31st. So not only did that have some potential benefits for yesterday's wheat Ridge amendment, again, assuming no major issues come up that would allow then a final decision for that project at that, if there are issues that come up or we get a lot of information on the record or the certificate holder needs more time to respond, there probably wouldn't be time to get to that, you know, final decision at that meeting anyway. But we have other projects, and that extra two weeks gave us some good time for some other projects that are going to be on the main meeting as well. So right",

Should there be one? Is FX review of a contested case order, if there is one, or and or review of the proposed order and the issuance of a final order which approves or denies the application for site certificate this slide represents the procedural history for the Wagont Trail solar project. The department received the applicant's notice of intent in November of 2020. Following receipt of the notice of intent. An amended notice of intent was provided to the Department in June of 2021 and in August of 2022, the department received from the applicant the preliminary application for site certificate. In January of this year, the applicant provided the preliminary application was deemed complete and the applicant provided a complete application for site certificate. And just earlier this month, the department issued its draft proposed order on May 7 and today, as highlighted and indicated here in red, we're at the draft proposed order public hearing in the next step in this procedural history table is the close of the public comment period, which is next Friday, June 7, following close of the common period, and we anticipate FX review of the DPO and of public comments to occur at the next council meeting, which is June 14. As I just mentioned, on May 7, concurrent with the department's issuance of the DPO, a notice which included information on the ASC. The public comment period ways to submit comments in public hearing details was issued by the department and anyone who wants to participate beyond this point in the FSEEC process must raise an issue on the record, either in person or remotely today at the public hearing or by submitting a written comment to the department before the deadline, which is next week, Friday, June the 7th, at 05:00 p.m. pacific time. Want to reiterate that failure to raise a relevant issue, either orally, today at the hearing or in a timely manner submitted before the deadline precludes further participation in the FSEEC process. Persons interested in being considered for party status in the condested case proceeding must meet a couple criteria. The first relates to timing. To be eligible to participate in a contested case on this application, a person must raise an issue either in person tonight at the public hearing or in a written comment submitted before the deadline of June 7, 05:00 p.m. pacific. The council will not accept comments after the close of the record ation after the close of the record. The other two criteria relate to content of comments for consideration in the contested case. Issues raised must be within the council's jurisdiction and must be raised with sufficient specificity so that thesel, the department and the applicant understand the issue raised and are afforded an opportunity to respond to the issue. To raise an issue with sufficient specificity, a person must present facts that support the person's position on the issue, and with that, I think I'm ready to turn it over to you. Chair how this is a public hearing on the draft proposed order on the request for a site certificate for the wagon trail solar project. I, Kent Howe, energy Facility Sititing Council chair, am serving as a presiding officer for this hear. Today is May 30, 2024. The time is 08:02 p.m. this public hearing is being held at an energy facility siting council meeting in person here in the riverfront room at the for of Morrow and Boardman. This hearing is also being held via a webex webinar with a call in option for those who cannot participate in person or via webinar. Tonight's hearing is being recorded. The presentations, written comments and oral testimony are part of the decision record for the request for the facility. The purpose of the public hearing is to provide an opportunity for the public reviewing agencies, counsel and the applicant, if they wish to do so, to present oral and written testimony on the request and the department's draft proposed order. The 31 day record of the public hearing comment period on the draft proposed order includes the hearing tonight and is scheduled to close next Friday, June 7, 2024, at 05:00 p.m. pacific time pursuant to oAR 345-015-0220 Sub five A and b.

We don't know all the details of this particular location. That's what our process is about. Okay, so with that, again, the notice of intent stage. And so what that means is the applicant submits their notice of intent. We provided a public notice. Hopefully you got that. We have an opportunity to submit or to sign up to receive email notices. If you received a paper notice, you will continue to get paper notices because you're within a certain distance of the project location. You can sign up to receive email notices as well, if that's your preference. We've got that signed up or set up there, and we do have at least one. We have Department of Agriculture here today. So them to all of the different natural resource agencies seeking their input throughout this process. So that's, again, what we're to do today. Like I said, the next step is the project order. It's the next chevron on here. That is the laundry list of us saying to the applicant or this project in this location. These are all the requirements that you have to meet, meaning you have to submit all of this within your application. We will review that. We'll give you an opportunity to review that. The next stage is the preliminary application. So you can see up there, there's a preliminary application for site certificate and an application for site certificate. That's with the PAC and the ASC. Preliminary means that when they submit that to us, we evaluate it to determine whether or not it's complete. Did they submit everything that we had requested? Now, that's not a public comment timeframe. When the application is deemed complete, once we say you have submitted everything that we need you to submit, that doesn't mean it's ready for approval. A lot of times people equate one with the other. It's not that. It just means that we have enough information to evaluate at that point. Once it's complete, we will do another full notice. Like, we will have another public information meeting like this in bigger location and not during harvest time. So we will do that better. But that'll be an opportunity for you to, again, it's not a public comment timef frme it's really getting you all set up for the next stage, which, and we have a bunch of funny terms, but I'll just, they are what they are. So the draft proposed order is the next stage, which is really, it's us, the Department of Energy, looking at their application and evaluating that and saying, chase brought up the slide before with all the standards. We go through it standard by standard and say, this is what the applicant submitted. Did they meet the standard? Do we believe they met this standard? Then once we issue the notice on the draft proposed order, that is a public comment timeframe. Again, Chase talked about our standards. If you're commenting, you don't have to do that today. You can say whatever you want. You can say whatever you want throughout the process. But once we get to that draft proposed order stage, our authority, the council's authority, is limited to the council standards. So if you bring up something that's outside of the council standards, we really can't do anything with that. So that's why we want you to be thinking about what are our standards? Whether you like this project, whether you don't like the project, whether you like us, don't like us. It really is the standards. That's what I want everybody also to walk away from today is be thinking about, did they submit an application that shows that they meet the standards? Did we write a report that also recommends to the council that they met the standards? That's an opportunity for you to agree with us or disagree with us. And again, we encourage that. Also, Chase will talk about this later throughout process. We are not proponents to their application. We are the review agency. We're here for them. We want to run a fast, efficient process for them. But we also wa wantna run a transparent and open process for you. So any of you, we have our contact information on notice on the website. If you have questions throughout this process, contact us. That's what we're here for. So with the comments that we receive on the draft proposed order, we write another document, which is the proposed order, which is really just taking into consideration all the comments we've received from the public, from state agencies, local governments, tribal governments, do we make changes? Is, is there anything that we didn't get right in the draft proposed order that based on those comments, we want to change? So that's the proposed order. The next stage is if you commented during the draft proposed order on a council standard and you still think that we didn't get it right in the proposed order, then you can",

        "text": " or have been living in the country for an extended period. If south korean companies want to do business, they should petition their government to change the policy. And some of us would be more open minded. Don't act as though we're on anything resembling a level playing field, because we're not. Until then, I see no reason for any south korean company to get any sort of exception. Thank you. Thank you, Mister Roya. We definitely were able to hear you that time, so we got everything. Sory about that. Hopefully I didn't just blow out the room. No, no, no, no. You were fine. I just was saying that we got everything on the record for that, so thank you. Good deal. Appreciate it. Thank you, Hillary Foot. All right, can you hear me? That is, we got a little feedback, but try it again. They are getting a little feedback. Yeah, not sure we're not getting feedback from us, but try again and see if it works. I can hear my echo. Echo. All right, apolog for that. Is that working? Can you hear me? Yeah, we can hear you fine. Can hear fine. Hillary, I don't know if you can hear us, but we can hear you, Fin, even though I've got a little bit of echo in the backgroundground. All right, well, we're waiting for Hillary, Will. I will check. Okay. That doesn't sound like it's getting feedback. Hilary Foot is the farm in forest specialist with the department of Land Conservation and Development. So I think she's probably been on all night. She's heard all of the comments related to Agric. Hopefully she can help wrap some of this up. Hillary, you're unmuted. If you want to try again. Hillary, if you can hear us, you muted yourself. All right. While we were waiting for Hillary, does anybody else want to make a comment? Okay, we'll give it a few minutes. All right, try that again, Hillary. Oh, you just muted yourself. Okay, we unmute the line. Perfect. Todd, can you hear me now? Yeah, I can hear. Okay. Thank you, Todd. And council members, this is Hilarary Foote. Apologies for the confusion. So I am the farm and forest land use specialist with DD, and the night is no longer young. So I'll be very, very brief with my comments this evening, and we'll follow up with written submissions. So the first thing I wanted to say, it was really to echo Jim Johnson from the Department of Agriculture's comments earlier this evening about just the history of farmland protection in the Willamette Valley and also about the importance of the farm impacts test in the review process, rs 215 296, and join him in encouraging the applicants to really paid careful attention to the standards established by the courts on the degree of analysis required to adequately address the potential for significant impacts to surrounding farm operations. And then secondly, I will say something else about the soils mapping. So, as Todd has pointed out this evening, all solar projects that fall under the council's jurisdiction do not meet the AC rage specials that are established in our agency rules. And therefore all projects that are reviewed by the council necessarily require an exception to the state's agricultural lands preservation goal for this particular project. I just wanted to know, express some concern about the possibility that there also might be an exception required to the state's agriculturally and preservation goal, not just because of the jurisdictional threshold, but because of other standards in our agency rules, particularly the standard that prohibits the sing of solar facilities on class one, class two, prime or unique soils, particularly given the extent of prime soils that appear to be mapped in the project area at this very early stage of the review process. So I just want to express that I'm also quite interested in seeing the project facilities laid out over the soil mapping for NRCs capability classifications as well as the farmland classifications relative to that particular standard. All right, and that's it. Thank you for the opportunity to get that in. Thanks, hry. We got it. Okay. T, I don't see anybody else online, so I did have a question. Are you, you guys getting any subsidies or special tax write offs or privileges with this project that you'll be doing? So, when it comes to solar projects in general, this. This, for the entirety the United States, there's something called ITC. It's a tax credit. So just from a general standpoint, that is something that this project would have just because all other solar projects. And when projects happen, it as well. And then. So the answer is yes. But that's a standard thing that happens with all solar projects and wind projects. Okay. Because earlier you're saying, and it shows back on your signs, too, that it'll be bringing in 1.6 million",

        "text": " policy question. I understand that, but I wanted to bring it up because it's an issue that needs to be settled. One last point on that. That really the reason that you haven't seen large scale projects in the Willamette Valley? Because LCBC adopted rules to dissuade the location of large facilities within the Willanaa Valley without going through the exception process. The exceptions process, it's not called an exception process for nothing. It's supposed to be difficult. The process is actually easier than what LCDC's regulations are. Comment about dual use I'm hearing a lot about dual use. We're going to do agriculture along with solar and the like, and that sounds really good. Welcome to Webex. Enter your access code or meeting number followed byel. That sounds really good. But livestock grazing, especially sheep, is an extensive use. Enter your attend id number. None of the capabilities that you, that these soils produce in terms of growing high value crops. You're not going to run a combine with a 30 foot header through solar panels. You're not going to be able to plant perennials like hazelnuts in an area where you've got soil panels. So dual use sounds really good, but it's limiting the diversity, the ability of a farmer to change crops, to use alternate farming practices and the like. And grazing is really about as low a value of use of this high value land that you could use. Farm impacts test one of the requirements that you're going to have to meet is what's called the farm impacts test. Under Oregon state law, that doesn't change. First off, I really want to make sure that the energy Facility sitighting council and staff understand, and I believe you do, that that analysis is now really geared towards a decision by the Oregon Supreme Court in the stop the dump coalition versus Yam Hill county. And in that process, I got to flip to my other notes here. Several things are going to have to be done. Number one, the analysis has to be on a farm by farm basis, not just an overall analysis of the large area. It has to be on a farm practice by farm practice basis. So there might be 40 different practices going on one individual farm. You have to analyze the impacts of this operation on each individual practice separately on each individual farm within the analysis area. That gets me to the analysis area. Half an acre doesn't even touch what the character of agriculture is. In the south Willamette valley, especially this area, the analysis area needs to be much, muchr larger. Half a mile could be a half a section. There's a lot of farms out here that are. One farm is bigger than that, and yet the character of the area is multiple farms doing these large scale agricultural operations. You need to take into account the factors of the type of agriculture to figure the analysis area, and a half a mile doesn't cut it. The farm impacts test also requires that the cumulative impacts of each individual impact be considered for the entire area to determine if there will be adverse impacts to farming practices. I think I'd just like to to end about farm impacts. One of the farm impacts that we've found, and we haven't got a lot of experience in the lat valley because we just had small projects or whatever, but they have basically generated speculative land values that farmers cannot compete with farmer cannot compete with an energy company in terms of how much they rent or lease the land based on that. And so that is an impact to the large scale, large term ability for farmers to grow in this area. There's no new farmland, so how do farmers expand, they rent or lease other for people's lands. There are a lot of absentee landowners in the Willamette valley. That land is available to farmers that are farming. This speculative land value type situation takes away those abilities from farmers to expand. And lastly, I'd just like to end with something that I'm always pointing out to. Agriculture is not only land dependent, it is soil dependent. It's quality soil that they need. Developments like this are land dependent, but they are not soil dependent. Thank you. So I don't have any response to Jim's comments. I just want to point that out as a model. So when I talked about before making comments and tying them to our council, council standard, that's exactly what Jim just did. So that's our land use standard related to the exclusive farm use zone. You provided some very specific comments that allow us to think about, you know, what are the impacts, what are the issues. Allows the applicant to think about it as well. So not that you have to make that during your comment here, but if you're thinking about, you know, providing written comment, that was exactly the kind of comments that we're looking for. Hey, so I'm gonna say Tony. Yeah, Tony Cub. And then next will be Lois Haw. I live out on gap. Our ranch is about 800 acres",

        "text": " our sector jurisdiction, I highly encourage you to engage in our process because it will help our council make a decision. So we are at the very first step of a notice of times after the public meeting and the public comment period closes. And during this time, we are also coordinating with what we call reviewing agencies. Reviewing agencies are local governments, local, effective governments, the state resour agencies like we have ODfw here tonight, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. We as a department at division have to engage in coordination and consultation with all our stateing agencies and also tribal governments, tribal governments, and again, to engage, coordinate, make them aware of the project and get input from all of these entities on how this proposal is being presented or issues things that we need to consider as we review through our standards. So based on all of the comments weive, we move on to the next step. And that's the project order. I will be preparing the project order. So the project order is basically a summary of all of the input we get, run it through a filter of our standards, and come up with what we call analysis areas that are required for each of our standards, that be what needs to be included in the actual application, because at a notice of intent, it's a notice of intent to filed or submit an application pre site certificate. No application has actually been submitted or received. So the applicant is preparing all the materials to include in their application with at this time. And so while I write the project order, they're working on their studies and coordinations and analysis and coming up with their plans. And then we issue the project order and it will tell the applicant what needs to be included in that application. And that is. So we issue the project board the notice ofent is valid for two years. So in the time that from the notice intent phase, we received a complete notice of intent on this project on September 28 and 2023, they have two years to submit an application. That applicant has indicated they would like to submit it earlier than that. But just realize there's a two year window that they have to submit that application. So it could be as late as September 2025 that they would actually submit the but it's up to them and how custom they get it all together. So the next stage is the actual preliminary application and then what we call a complete application. So again, they submit information to us for review and the application is quite expensive. There are exhibits, documents, survey reports, everything that gets in there. We again issue a public notice. We will open it up again for public commenting and then we have an information meeting at that point too. And that's important. There's been particularly a long period of time that's elapsed between the NOI and the actual application. And again, we review with the four game agencies, reviewing agencies, the tribs, the local governments for this project because it's located in Wasco and Sherin county. Both of those counties have been identified as special advisory groups, they'board of conditioners, Soasco county and Sherman county at the ability to participate in our process as what we call special advisory groups. And they will also provide input throughout our process. And then the next step is the draft proposed order. The Department of Energy Pych Division staff, we prepare the draft post order and it's our evaluation of the application materials and as we run it through a filter of our standards, so we make recommendations. In those draf post orders we include conditions that need to be, that should be added to a site certificate. These are all recommendations for our council. We have then issue yet another public notice and it opened up another comment period. But we also hold what is a public hearing, and that is after the materials have been made available to the public so that they're on our web page. You've been received it a noticed there's ways for people to go in who are interested or read all these materials, or maybe they just wanna read some of them. And the public hearing is a formal public comment period. And when I had mentioned the contested case proceeding, which is built into our process, if you want to participate in a contested case, or think you might, it's very important that you have commented on the record of the draft. It's a really important thing to keep in mind. We bring that draft proposed order to the Energy FAC citing Council for review. After it's gone through the public hearing, we canile all the comments that we received and they review it and they will make comments themselves and make recommendations to us and things that they might want to see or change. And we take that information and we process it and add it into the document and edit the draft proposed order. And then it becomes the proposed order. We again issue a notice. When we issue that notice, there's a notice, the opportunity or a contesting case pro and there will be information on",

Hey, so I'm gonna say Tony. Yeah, Tony Cub. And then next will be Lois Haw. I live out on gap. Our ranch is about 800 acres and'been in our family since 1860. I have mostly comments, not questions. To me, this is a land use issue and it's not a state thing. And I kind of kick on with the guy previously, but I'm pretty sure the Linc county commissioners are not for this and they weren't to begin with. Just in some conversations I have and it appears that going through this process is like making an end run, trying to get past it, find the easy way. I believe in elected officials that I have some input on and certainly not appointed officials that I have no input on. I don't know what the law was or I'm goingna call it a law, probably not. But that deals with solar, it seems to me, or I was told that in regard to solar plants or farms like this, the law was set up to deal with eastern Oregon, not the mid valley. And that's bothersome. I'm also bothered by the fact that I think it's more of a political issue that it's a along I five. And we can all just see that and see what we're doing. I guess EFU means that it never has met anything differently. It's exclusive farm use. And this is not several concerns of me. The Pacific flyway, it's right through there. There's a 600 acre plus. I don't know what to call it. It's about two to 3 miles north that the thank you. US Department of Ag. That's wildlife refuge for birds. That's definitely within not your concentric circles. There's a local elk herd, I'm going to say between 81 hundred that move along the corridor there from the Cobra curls up to the exit and Coberg and all the way down to, I'm going to say at least indian head. And, you know, fencing off an area this big, I can't imagine the impact it has. Oh, well, I missed. Dang it. I miss him. Thanks. Good job. Okay. Thank you, Lois Haw. And then Jim Fairchild is next. Sorry, we'll take care of that for you. It's Mister Trann, could you just describe some of the other projects you have in Oregon currently? I'm sorry, can you say that again? Oh, Mister Tran, could you describe some of the other projects that your company has developed in Oregon? And is there a sister project that would look very similar to this one that we could look on maps and see what it looked like and talk to some of the locals and see how they felt that the project went? Thank you. That is a great question. This would actually be the first project that we developed in the state of Oregon. That's why I think it's very crucial to come to meetings like this to hear a lot about the local community. Because as we state before, there's a lot of things that we don't know. And you all live here and you guys know the best about it. So there's a lot of intricate details that you can't find online that you can only have in conversation. This would be the first one, and we're hoping to learn a lot and get a lot of these comments so we could put a list together and extrapolate some data that makes this a better project. But I would like to say that Oregon State University has some projects for Agriultai. So I'm sure if you reach out to the university, there might be a little bu in the right direction for some things that have already been built. Do you have any other projects in similar rural areas somewhere else in the country that we could look at and look at the history on. Yeah, we do have a portfolio of projects built throughout the United States. It's easiest to find them on our website for qslls.com dot. There's nothing in particular that I can name off top of my head that would be something that's easy to visit. However, do we have information online? And if you want, we can go to after this and get some contact information. I can send you some links to some of the projects that we built. Right. And I have a comment. Yesterday in the New York Times, they actually had an article on what is happening to rural farmland across the country in solar development. And it was in fact, the reason I even looked at it was I saw this, don't destroy our farmland. And it was a poster someone was holding up in the picture. And I read it and it was kind of sad because it talks",

They might have additional comments at the very end. We take our proposed order, we take to council for approval. It's council, ThEc council that makes the decision to grant or deny a site certificate for a facility. So if you look at under the pointy arrows, there's different colored boxes under each of those and what'that's showing is who's basically the lead on that. So notice if it intants's the applicant'job to prepare that the project order, it's the Department of Energy I staff that prepare that. Again, the application materials are prepared by the applicant. We prepare the Cing division the draft proposed order and the proposed order council is the one that makes the decision on the site. This is kind of a big overview of our process and what is not on this slide is the appeal path.

Can you take questions during this or do you want to wait? We would like you to hold questions to the end, but if you want us to go back to a slide, we can do that in June. So I had mentioned earlier, reviewing agency this is just a little bit more information on, you know, what are the reviewing agencies, what is their role? How do we utilize reviewing agency input and coordination and the reviewing agency serve a really important role in our process because they provide comments on the post facility within the jurisdiction or expertise of the agency. So if there are sensitive species, then we talk to DFW about habitat and habitat mitigation plans and the species that might be impacted. So it's a really important part of us getting information. And like I said, these are the state agencies, the local governments, the tribal government. Sometimes it's a federal agency depending on facility and if it's in, you know, federal jurisdiction. And all of them help us as a siting division to just identify and determine what kind of studies and what kind of analysis needs to be conducted, which permits are required, any kind of specific rules or administrative rules or statutes or ordinances, local zoning considerations, things like that, that we really value that input. And we look to different agencies for expertise. So we have reached out to all of the reviewing agencies where we received the notice of intent and issued our public notice. And I am in the process of coordinating with all of them to get input and comments that we then pass on to the applicants so that they can incorporated into their planning and design. And the goal is good site. So, and like I said, we have two special advisory groups on this proposed facility, which is Wasco and Sherman county. Okay, next slide. I think I went to the next slide without telling you to go to the next slide. Yes, you did. Okay, we're done with this. People catch up. And it's basically everything I just said. So, next slide. So I mentioned 16 general standards that are required for us to assess and determine as we review information. The state c process is a standards based review. So it's based on these 16 standards and it's evidentiary. So we need to see information that demonstrates the burden approved is on the applicant to provide that evidence, to demonstrate that they meet that standard. It's our job as the Cing provision to evaluate that evidence. And that's part of what we're consulting with our reviewing agencies on studies that have been conducted at the application phase. And then we make those recommendations in our gradicalosed order to our council, the energy facilities, sititing council, and they are the ones who ultimately evaluate all of the information in the record to decide whether or not to point it a site certificate. Because we're at",

        "text": ". You know, they're not, we're not going to have, it's not like a big generation project. You're going to bring a bunch of union workforce to do these things. So I think you need to be really realistic on that point. That these are pretty much in house utility type projects is my guess a death funding rate, even with the mash. Correct. And I'm not sure if you're aware of honestly, labor costs are for line workers in Oregon, around $60 an hour make double time overtime. The benefit load is probably 75% of that. So you're talking $2 a minute overtime. So it's expensive work. The gentleman from Douglass articulated something that I think is really important. You know, governments often have contin a government plans and they're internally focused. And utilities and public works have continuity of operations plans and they're internally focused. What community benefit me means is a community focused continuity of thessential services plan. And as he described. How do you keep drinking water, sanitation, you keep warming, cooling, you know, food preparation, communications, keeping medicines, refrigerating. And so I would think anything that could enhance the continuity of central services for a community is not going to typically get funded in the rate base. This might be a place to be that'sell. I think that's a very very good point. Talk about to event we have things but she discuss. You know represents muus colleagues and their family located in town. You know we have some towns in our there's a small town drur they're their own utilities. We don't provide service. Some help bring that but they have different uh. Different ideas when it comes to resiliency. Because they don't have any generation. Everything comes from someone else. There's a transmission which there out androl the things that really affect them the most are traffic a lot car hit pes affect those bookolks a lot and down trees just physical issues that they. So it's. But they're a community so it's. It's just hard for us. It's hard me a little bit to wrap my around. Community benefitits that community general defined as the most amount of people or is that a community defined as folks who are underserved or folks who a particular demographic whether it's economically social or however you define them. Is that also how you define a community? Because our. We're a monopoly so to speak. We defined service territor. If you move there that's bring the account. So we know by definition and byention design we serve everyone who comes u so as diverse as the folks who live and we don't have a lot of control. Maybe this would be a good time. I know that you prepared to talk about a projects that could be through this program. If there's no questions that have been going on. There was one pat, I think that we with. With the clarification on the microgrip component it's still eligible but not recommended at this point into in I think yeah I would say eligible but not likely to score well depending on the final criteria establish. So Phil, I don't know if you want to go ahead and describe we could kind of think on sure half the brain split it up all way up there but we have. We have a uh. We have a pre good SC system. But one of the problems for to do is to make that work robust because we do. We also a broad day temature. We have fiber to all of our substations in fiber cover. Very soon the complete system. So everyone will be able to have access to fib, the MA who wants to wants it. So we want to leverage that and increase our state of penetration to control our reclosures in the field. Because we have a lot of rec closures in the field. But not all of them are connected. So they can be remotely controlled. So we have to roll truck, roll someone out to go up and put that new closure in. What we call one shot for a fire mitigation. What, what know, a reclosure works. You'll see a fault and then based on the current it will try, it will open up and hope that fault clear is going to close it and does it three times. Because you may have seen, you know, your w link a couple times in the power is out or they link once yourire from the power stays on. What has happened? Say a tree or lamb or car, whatever came in contact with that line generated a fallt current. And either the branch burned through or just fell off, just did strike and fell off and it clears, it opens back up and. Great. Well, during fire season that's not great. We want to limit thegition points because we really, we only have control over, you know, the fire current fuel air igition. We don't have control of one component addition. We've got a really tiny r of when we do everything we can control the fuel as much and it really'we. Had some limited",

I just know that the same company was just awarded at Wheat RDGE east and there were some updates to that wildfire mitigation conditions and whatnot. And just wondered if those match up to this one. They ok? Yeah. Yes. And then this also brought up another thought. Has the department looked any, looked further into having ODF come and bring a presentation to the council? And also I believe they are working on a newer data report. And so as far as, you know, fire risk throughout the state. So just wondered if there's any follow up on that. Thank you, Secretary Cornet. The record. Todd cornet. Thank you, councilme member, iam. We are in the process of looking to determine when the best time to do an agenda item. We have it kind of on the list, exactly what the month is. We're not sure yet and what that will constitute, but the basic idea is sort of an evaluation of the wildfire standard, you know, what's going on currently, you know, out there, you know, in the world with, you know, the public utility commission, the Oregon Department of Forestry, others. And so we don't have anything definitive yet. It's definitely on our list. We've been talking about it, but don't have anything exactly planned yet, but we will. Do you guys happen to, have you heard anything about where they're at and their, as far as their new data and their new report that they're working on? Have you heard any information on that? Because I looked on the website and I couldn't find. Yeah, we've been talking about it. I'm not sure, to be honest. So I don't know exactly what's going on. This is a fairly dynamic area right now. Obviously, there's been increased wildfires, some related to transmission, the public utility commission, the utilities, the Department of Forestry, and not just Oregon, all over the western states as well. So there's a lot going on with this and, you know, we'll try to get our hands around as much as we can when we bring that up to, you know, coun council with that agenda item in the near future. But it will be in the near future. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Next slide, please, nancy, or on next slide, please. Okay. And this is my last standard to go through. And this is the noise control regulations for DEQs, noise control regulations and noise standard. And for in the DPO, well, the operational noise from the proposed facility was evaluated to the maximum allowable noise limits. Construction noise isruction knows what's the word is distraction. Well, operational noise was what was evaluated and the noise sources used in the noise modeling evaluation during operations where the battery storage, heating, ventilating and air conditioning units, electrical components step up transformers, main power transformer at the collector substation and the transmission line. In their evaluation, the applicant identified 33 noise sensitive receptors. The applicant'noise modeling results showed that the proposed facility operation would exceed the maximum allowable standard at seven noise sensitive receptors at nighttime and at four noise sensitive receptors within the analysis area. And so in the DPO, the department recommends that council find that the facility as proposed would not comply with the requirements with the DEQ noise regulations without additional mitigation. And as such, the department recommended a condition that, or conditions that would require the applicant to provide the department with information that identifies a final design location to be built, be it in phases or all at once, as well as the maximum sound power level for the facility components and the results of the noise analysis of the final facility design performed in a manner consistent with the requirements of OAR 340 350 three five, which is the DEQ regulations. And this analysis, this additional analysis that would be conditioned in would have to show that they would be meeting the ambient noise degradation standard and would not be exceeding the maximum allowable noise standard. So although they'there modeling results showed that they wouldn't meet it, we're conditioning that they have to meet it prior to construction. Councilloor Byer so this is something that we as the council would delegate to the department to ensure that this standard is ultimately met, even if we make a finding that as proposed. It's not that I'm a little queasy about that, but I think there's a workound. I'm just not sure what it is. So thank you. Okay. Well, um, that's, I believe that's it with my presentation. If there's additional, um, guidance on what you'd like to do going forward and if, if there's additional standards you'd like reviewed or u. I'm all, I'm all ears. This is Ken. I've got one question that I should have brought up before we jumped to wildfire, and it was regarding the goal five area and just wanted to make sure that there's not any historic,",

So is the applicant here tonight and do they wish to provide testimony? Hi, my name is Ryan Hill. That's r y a n h I l l. I'm representing the wagon trail solar project. I just want to say thank you to the council for coming out here, spending your time to review our application. Thank you to chase for all the good communication, and thank you to the public for coming out and, you know, having interest in our project and other projects similar. Thank you, sir. Before I open the hearing up to public testimony, I want to remind the public that prior to the close of the record, you may submit written testimony in a variety of ways. The comment portal, email, and handing in your written comment tonight, I'd like to get a sense of the number of people interested in testifying to determine if I need to set time limits. I've got three here. Could you raise your hand if there's any more that want to. Looks like one. Two. Okay, so maybe five. And do we know how many are on the phone and on the webex? I've got one person with their hand raised. Okay, same time, five minutes. Okay, so with that, we're ready for Miss Tamara Mabboitt. Nice to see you. Have you started the clock? Okay. Very exciting. I don't often get a sit on this side of the table, so it's very exciting. Thank you, chair Howe and members of the siting council and staff. My name is Tamra Mabt. I'm the Morrow county planning director. Today, I just want to brief, briefly summarize. Morro county is very supportive of this project, and we've submitted comments, I believe, three times formally into the record. And the board of Commissioners will consider an additional letter the next time they meet, which will be Wednesday, June 5. Again, the county'very supportive of the process. What I want to call to your attention tonight is this complicated conundrum with a goal three exception. I think this is the time to get it right and set a good precedent. I think your staff has it correct in their analysis of goal three. They reference a court of appeals case about whether or not goal 13. Compliance with goal 13 is sufficient reason to justify goal three, and they concluded it does not. And we would agree with that. I. I spent the day today with some of your agency counterparts, Department of Land Conservation and Development. The entire day was looking at solar sing rules. We had a lot of discussion about goal five, protection of other resources, and balancing that with goal three. I think. I think the process works for the most part. And in the past, most recently with the Oregon Supreme Court ruling in favor of the, the state and the sititing council, where you did not implement local standards, I think this is a time when you can agree that there is an appropriate place for local government. The staff, I think, has done a good job recommending some mitigation to offset some of the impacts to removing farmland from production. I'm just not sure that that's the right formula. And what I would like to see, and I expect the board of commissioners will have it in some formal written letter next week, is that we maybe make that a little bit more formal instead of off the cuff. So we have another solar development in Morl county. They've taken great steps to quantify that impact, and they also work very closely with staff and our elected officials. We have formal agreement their application will come before you rather soon. That gives the county the comfort that that exact number is the correct number.",

And I just want to thank you all for the robust discussion and questions you had for staff. Really showed when staff presented then to coun council, like, all this stuff was answered, as well as my knowledge for the other counselors for their questions as well. So you guys make me look really good, and I really appreciate it, and I thank you very much. And I have nothing else for tonight. Did you want to. We had a work. There was a work session before the last council meeting. Can you briefly give, like, what's like, the council is going to be looking at the UGB expansion coming up, and so when people start hearing about that, what's our resource as commissioners and as public? Or I can put you on the spot and let Eric answer. Yeah, well, like, what are the next steps? The council is going to be bringing it before them soon, aren't they? So the first meeting of the next two months, it's on the council work session agenda to discuss a proposed letter of intent to Metro for a proposal for an urban growth boundary expansion. Ask. This was going to be my next topic for staff comments. We are actually going toa be holding an open house on Sherwood west on October 4 from 530 to 730 at the Ridges school. And it's gonna be some, you know, information about the plan itself and then, you know, feedback on, you know, potential UGB proposal. So we'll be seeking some input from the community as well. Sorry, council, I didn't mean to put you on the spot. I thought you guys, this is new information. Yeah, and that. Exactly. It's brand new information. And that information is going toa be posted online and we're sending out postcards to folks in the mail tomorrow. You know, property owners with insur ##wood west and those property owners that are also adjacent to Sherwood west get'll get notified. So we'll have flyers out in the community as well. That's from 530 to 730 on October Wednesday, October 4 at the Ridges elementary School. Yeah, the counselors had a really good like fact gathering meeting at the last meeting. So it was kind of interesting to hear that the process and the public outreach that they're working on and the work sessions that they're going to be having at the first of each month. So that was really, really nice to hear that we really are wanting more community inputs, but we also want to inform the community as well. Not just like, yes, I want to do le experience or not. That's not as helpful for us as the council for guidance. And so more information, I think is what's going to happen at this kind of a town hall type of thing where people can ask questions and kind of get a better gauge of where the community is at that point. Feel free, show up and you guys want to and provide testimony even as citizen make clear on light commission. But you guys, they are all short residents anded access, so feel free to come. I don't know that you guys are have another opportun like formally weigh in on whether expion Gu so the formal application is due to metro by next year on April 5. Now the letter of intent is due or letter of interest is due to Metro on December 1 of this year. And that letter of intent does not bind the city to anything whatsoever. It's really just a letter that tells Metro we're thinking about making a formal application to you next year. And that formal application may look like this. And what that looks like could change, you know, between December 1 and April 5 of next year, depending on, you know, additional community outreach that we do and additional information that council will receive, they may make some modifications. I think,",

        "text": " Location dependency, right. We already have. We own and operate two existing facilities directly adjacent to the wagon trail solar project, and then we operate a third additional facility there. We were trying to group these projects as close together, one to not spread out all over the county, all over the land. The closer that we can get all these facilities, um, you know, the more land there are adjacent to farm around. And we don't have a bunch of little nooks and crannies within the facilities where equipment's not able to access. Additionally, a big factor is having access to transmission interconnection rights as well as you re like, okay, it's cool that you can get your electricity to a utility, but can you actually deliver that power where it's needed? That's also a big constraint that I don't think we've kind of talked about. So there's. There's multiple factors of being able to connect and actually deliver the power where it's needed. Those are two different things. And we are set up in this specific location to meet all of those needs. Next slide, please. Yep. And then this is just a visual display of all of our operating projects. So the light green is the wheat ridge east wind project as it stands now. And then the orange and blue outlines are wheat ridge one and two wind facilities. And as you can see, the wagon trail solar facility, which is that purple outline, is built right into the U. Kind of the layout of the existing wind facilities. And another benefit of that overlap is we're allowed, you know, we're able to share facilities between three, you know, in this case, up to five different energy facilities. Right. So then you have less operation maintenance buildings, less substations, less overhead transmission lines scattered throughout the county. So we're able to share all of those existing facilities and not disturb any more land to get power to the grid. Next slide, please. Thank you. Okay, so talking about our direct and indirect impacts to agriculture, as I said, we're expected to impact around 3700 acres of arable land and with no loss to irrigated land. So kind of what does that look like? We had eco northwest do a economic impact study of, you know what, pulling this amount of dry land wheat crop really affects the economy. And I think the direct impact is pretty easy to say. Right. The landowners that land we're using who farm that land are being compensated via a solar lease. Right. They're getting a monetary gain from the use of that land. The hard thing to kind of determine is what about the people who are indirect affected, whether that's tenant farmers, the local agricultural industry, stores, suppliers. And that's where we kind of really targeted what we're doing. Right. U and so talk about tenant farmers. We have a great relationship and history, proven history of contracting the tenant farmers whose land we're taking, whether it's due road grading, road improvement. U you know, it's not that we are trying to like displace them, move on and not be associated with, with them. We are just trying to substitute their income with, instead of farming, it would be a support of the energy facility. And we have been extremely conscious of that and, and tend to do so moving forward as well. The other factor, the, the indirect impacts of developing agricultural land. So through our study, we're expected to impact approximately $487,000 per year of dry land wheat. And that'll be kind of the impact to agricultural economy. And what we did is we looked at what are we currently doing? Like, what are the real numbers in Morrow county that we are spending? Well, luckily for us, we have the operating solar facility and we know exactly how much money we're spending specifically on weed abatement, weed mitigation. So we took that number, got a quote from our same vendor who's located Morrow Umatila county, who, who operates, who purchases his chemicals from more county grain growers and also in a Hermton. And it turns out we were spending more money than the farmers were spending to cultivate that land. And that's based off of numbers that Mister Roush gave us, as well as the tenant farmer on the other property gave us. So it's like, okay, well, I understand those are not dollar for dollar replacements, right. I think that's like an important acknowledgment to make. But it's also, you know, we are still spending in the economy. We are using local business businesses to help us out. And that's where it came from. And so really, that $500,000 contribution has nothing to do with offsetting the, the indirect impacts, so to say. Right. Because we have the numbers, we have the proof that we're spending that money in the economy anyway. Really what it came from is listening to the public saying like, hey, there's a need to, you know, help out these",

        "text": " had a community energy plan that was developed back then. Can I lean into this just a little bit? And, Chris, I'd love to hear your thoughts, but I would love to see this. This idea of a comprehensive plan on how do we get to this place where everybody has that micro. What is it called? Grid. Thank you. And. And renewable energy is. It's across the city. And for those purposes, both the twofold, being resilient and also addressing our. Our energy needs in a renewable way. I would love to see something like that become part of. Of our plan moving forward. It's intriguing. I don't know enough about it yet to have an opinion either way, but I'm interested in the idea. I think that, you know, if we're ever going to move things significantly, you have to have. You have to have a plan that takes us over the long haul and not just, you know, you know, really these smallmental things. So I would like to know more about that. I don't know. Are you aware of one somewhere? No. O kind of. Okay. And so this idea of us kind of leading the way, I really like that idea, too. Right. I mean, part of it is frustrating because you think, like, I don't know how you all feel, but I'm always like, I'm pushing. Right. And I want to do more, and I'm constantly thinking that other people are ahead. But then when you learn that we are ahead, it's twofold. You're very proud of the work we're doing, but you're also frustrated that not more work is being done and no one knows. And nobo. Yes. Everyone thinks Portland's in the lead, but I would love to keep pushing the part. I do have one more question, if I could. Yes. Can I just share with Councillor Stapleton is I think one of the pieces that will further refine in terms of a program is I did mention the community supported renewables tariff and the kind we call it the Muni tariff. And both Heather and Ryan have been involved in providing feedback and learning more. And that is where the entire community. It's a program that potentially the entire community would be getting their energy from a renewable source. Again, because of the RP and CEP and RFPs. That's three acronyms in a row. I apologize because we recently filed our integrated resource plan and Clean Energy plan that outlines our RFP for 2023. We are pausing the plan simply so that we don't want to develop it out of alignment with the short term action plans. And we'll have a better sense next year. But that is where potentially where you're one of, I can say, a handful of cities that have provided feedback into the development of that tariff and that are waiting to further develop it and understand how that program would work. So se Salem, Portland, Milwaukee, I believe Beaverton, those are all some of the cities that you're all looking for potentially that kind of community wide program for getting energy from renewable sources. But more to come on that. And again, we have engaged, certainly heather on this front. And any continued conversations. They participated in workshops and we've had meetings with our staff on that, with your team there. Thank you, Andy. Yeah, yeah. So one last question I have is, so what resources does PGE have if Salem is interested in expanding its renewable energy infrastructure? That's a great question. And right now, I think the microgrid one is, we're really interested in that partly because how do we expand exactly getting to council president Stapleton? How do we expand on that program and do it in a kind cost effective way that incorporates business and residents? And so those are things that we'd be looking at. Those are the kinds of conversations that we love to have to talk about areas that might make sense for potential opportunities. And I think particularly on the distributive generation side, we would love to have conversations about the city potentially investing in that program again. That is where basically you have a large battery for backup systems, for example, a police station, although we don't serve them, an alleyway kept us from serving them. Salem Electric serves them. We love Salem Electric, but you have a large scale battery that's a backup backup to your generation in case anything ever happens. Well, most of the time those batteries are there, again, only an emergency situation. So they're sitting there we have a program that we would love to talk with city Salanam is if you incorporate some more of these batteries, they're basically little many generating plants because on the hottest days of the year and the coldest days of the year, we would tap into that energy. If you're not using it, of course we would tap into that energy and it would help us with our loads. So those are the kind of conversations we'd love to have with",

        "text": "And I'm the government relations coordinator at the Oregon Department of Energy. We're really grateful that you've taken the time to join us here today to talk about the Oregon solar plus storage rebate program and some changes to that program that are coming in the near future. I'm here today as sort of our moderator for the conversation. And our plan is to discuss the program and which offers rebates to residential customers and low income service providers who install solar or solar impaired energy storage systems. I want you to know thisr webinar will be recorded. I think someone will press record now or press record soon, and I think you'll see a little message about that. And then the slides and the recording will be posted to Odo's website so that you can find it later or if you have to leave and come back, or for some reason, you can catch what you might have missed. We'll start our program today with introducing some of the other staff who work at the Department of Energy on this program or in general. And we'll start with James, who's actually leading today's conversation. Hi. Thanks, Christy. My name is James Kogl. I'm a policy analyst here at the Oregon Department of Energy. I work across several of the agency's incentive programs aimed at increasing energy efficiency or the installation of renewable energy. Great. Thanks, James. And then I'd love to introduce our two program staff. Most of you on the line, I imagine, work on this particular program, and these are the two people that you'll be most likely to talk to. They're the ones who make our program run and take really good care of all of our customers. So I just want to first introduce Dale and then Katie. Dale, go ahead and say hi on mute. Sorry. Hi. My name is D. O. Varering. I am a solar rebate assistant. Thanks, D. And Katie. Hi, my name is Katie Milton and I am with the solar and storage rebate program. Well, we're really grateful to have our program team on the line as well as James to answer questions as we go. And I think we can go to the next slide, please. In case you aren't familiar with our agency, I wanted to start with just some brief energy or information about what we do at the Oregon Department of Energy. Our agency helps Oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable energy system. We advance solutions to shape an equitable, clean energy transition, protect the environment and public health, and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for future and current generations. On this slide, you'll see our five broad areas of focus, including energy programs and activities like the Oregon and solar and storage rebate solage plus storage rebate program. So we can go on to the next slide, please. So I mentioned briefly our agenda earlier what we're going to cover today. Specifically, we're going to start with some logistics after this, and then James will provide an update on changes to the program from recent legislation, and James will then give a quick overview of the administrative rulemaking process and then present the proposed administrative rule concepts the we'll be discussing today. We really want to hear from you. So as we go through all of this, just know that we're, we're going to provide time for questions and comments, and so there'll be a time for that at the end. But I'm also happy to grab raised hands or questions and comments from the chat as we go. So feel free to contribute at any point. Just, we'll talk us in a second about how to raise your hand or use the chat, but just feel free to use those two ways to get in the line, and then I'll call on you as appropriate as soon as they can, we can go on to the next slide. So just know that the way Webex organizes us is there's panelists and that's oost staff today, and then there's attendees. That's the 19 folks that have joined us today to hear more about these administrative rule changes. And again, thanks for being here. Just know that we have some community agreements that we expect folks to take a look at and follow to the extent possible. We want you to just be respectful of others and to be ready and list to listen and learn. If you have any technical issues during the meeting, you can please text chat Patricia Phillips, and she is happy to take care of you. And thank you so much for helping us behind the scene today, Patricia. And with that, we can go on to slide five. This is just a quick diagram of what we think you're probably seeing in front of you as the Webex format. It seems like it looks different on different people's end sometimes, but we just want to make sure, you know, take a second right now to kind of look at how you can share your hand. On my screen, it looks like a little bit of a raised fist sitting side by side with the smiley face and some forms. Sometimes",

        "text": " definition in and then it would allow opt in to FSEC by a developer. That's all the battery, or that's all the legislation does. It doesn't clarify how at the local level it would be reviewed and approved. There's different thoughts on that, but I think this is the first of probably, you know, a couple of different builds related to battery energy storage. I don't think this will be the end of it. I think this is just the beginning of it. So likely we'll see more of this at the next legisl session. Next is House Bill 4090 that will eliminate sector jurisdiction on projects that are entirely proposed on federal lands, and then House Bill 1525. So the bill currently is related to the Oregon Department of Energy. Portland General Electric has added a component to that bill which would allow for standby generators to be connected to the electrical grid and dispatched to the grid in certain circumstances. Currently, by definition, a standby generator cannot be connected to the grid. It'typically would be like a data center would have a series of diesel generators that if power is lost, those would kick in or provide power during that outage. Anything that's over 25 mw, anything that is connected to the grid would not be defined as a standby generator and would have to come to FSEC four review. This change to the bill would add a component for certain standby generators to be able to connect to the grid and under certain, certain circumstances would allow how they produce to be dispatched to the grid. The bill or component of the bill makes reference to 40 CFR Code of Federal Regulations 636-6407 F. And I'm not going to go through that, but it creates sort of emergency circumstances. So power outages or ro houses or other types of situations. It provides some limitation about when those standby generators could be used to dispatch power to the grid. So the bill also indicates that the generators would have touse renewable fuels if they are available, if those fuels are available and they do not impact the warranty the generator and as most of the generators out there now are diesel generators. So I'm not sure what the availability is to use renewable or har and fuels whenow circumstances. So kind of boiling it down. What this would do is if you recall last month there was the big storm and there were power outages. This would be in that kind of circumstances it would effectively allow, you know, you know, the OHSU or intel or you know, Amazon or those kind of big facilities that have those diesel generators would allow them to connect to the grid. Andumulatively it's a ER plan. That's really what it is is in those circumstances would be providing power that then the utility, you know, either couldn't provide or would help them in those kind of circumstances. So that is so slide now than funded for the record. So we've done some recent work on stand by generator and so will we move back that require us to come back again to reress that by memory we specifically state cannot be into the grid or be connected. So we'd have to come back. We've not evaluated, I have not evaluated the bill language to determine whether or not that's going to require follow up ruleaking it. It probably will. I'just not reviewed it in that context yet and there has been some changes to it so it still I would's early in the session because we're pass the session. The language you know, wasn't part of the original those added to it so probably, but we'll follow. Thank you. Unless there's any questions on the legislation, the last item that I have is the March council meeting. So March 21 and 22nd we will need both days. We have the potential for three draft close order hearings on Thursday evening and then we'll have probably a more typical meeting on Friday, which probably should go past noon. But we also have a rul making hearing depending upon what you do today. So it'll be a pretty big meeting based on the location of the projects. We had intended to be a boardn but there is no place to hold meeting on those days boardment. So you spent a lot of time trying to figure that out. So we're going to be in Emtonford Suiteer. Just quick question is to site we that? Yeah, just because areas on the ground is sure we'look into that and get back to in terms of timing and coordination. And for the record, I would say said Boardman as far as 80 could probably attest to this. Boardman Harves and its work east and I think that's what now re than for the extra effort. But I don't think that's the bad thing spok about. And Todd, if I might ask you and I get it, the bills are to change non stop. But would it be possible have Christie send us or you send us quick the three language that you have? Yeah, do that by the end of the day I'll send you the current building.",

        "text": " one b or c rule that says you get to ignore the county's code if you want to. But the second one, so that first one, that's the one that was going on in save our rural Oregon. The second one says if the governing body tells you what their standards are, you apply it. You don't get to apply this big b standard in that situation. That's what the law says. I'm not saying that. That's what the law says. And the last one is this more than three zones business. And I will tell you, you do not have to decide what a related or supporting facility is. And we agree, it's really important that energy companies have site boundaries to work in, but you are required to faithfully apply the law that says you don't get a hall pass on county substantive criteria. Under this third scenario, more than three zones business. If you don't have related or supporting facilities that are in more than three zones. And here there is no dispute on the record. There's Jedi mind tricks you can apply, but there's no dispute on the record that there is no related or supported facility, as state law defines that term, in more than three zones. Absolutely not. What you heard is there's a site boundary or an associated area, but that is not what state law defines to be a related or supported facility. State law says it has to be a structure, and there is not one structure that is in more than four zones. So can't, you can't get to yes on applying the goals, because the goals tell you you got to comply with the acknowledged comprehensive plans of the county. You can't get t'on the ASC, the standards that the county has recommended, because the law doesn't say that you can pick and choose the goals that you want to decide local governments are implementing. No, here there's no dispute on the law that go two told the county to adopt this very regulation. They did exactly what they were supposed to do. It's required by the goals. It's really not possible to make a good faith argument otherwise. And so it's an applicable substantive criteria that there's a two mile setback. And we have an objection to the claim over here that it's just a NIMBY measure. No, it is not a nimby measure. It's a decision that the county made based on evidence it was presented, scientific studies that were presented that in Yttila county, they're going to protect property values, people's health, all these things. There's going to be a two mile setback. And most facilities can seem to meek meat it. This one seems to be having a problem with it. But the fact, the point is that you can't collaterally attack the wisdom of the governing body after going through what goal two told them to do, to adopt this two mile setback, based on evidence in the record, the two mile setback went through luva back and forth. It's been affirmed. It's not a minimi measure. It's the real deal. It's important. So to wrap this up, you can decide for the PCC and all of that if that's what you want to do. But if you're going to apply the law, you're not going to because the law doesn't support that PCC. And we would ask you not to. Thank you. Since my other coun council both made comments, I'll make just a couple quick comments. I certainly won't go for five minutes. Essentially, what the county's arguing is if we recommend it, you have to apply it. Right? Disagree. That's not what the law says. Goal two, maybe their setback is in compliance with goal two, but it's not required by goal two. And what the law says is that you need to apply the local criteria that are required by the goals. Okay. Thank you all. I think having heard the oral testimony from all parties and had some discussion and questions that, but doing a straw pull on this group three set of exceptions makes sense. I don't think we want to go through listing each of them again. It might be most efficient to start based on kind of where we left things with asking whether any of the council members have an exception here that they accept or on the contrary, if you reject them. Thanks, Hal. I don't have any exceptions that I would accept. My logic is if the setback'not required by the statewide goals, then it doesn't apply. It's irrelevant. Doesn't matter whether it crosses multiple zones, three zones. If the county setback isn't required by the goals, then must reject the exceptions. So that's my bottom line. Thank you. Other comments. Councilmember Byer, thank you. And I would concur with counselr how goal two is a foundational goal. And I think I agree with the odo counselor that it just doesn't require this activity, this setback requirement. More credit to you, Matila county, for adopting it, but it doesn't apply to our, it doesn't directly apply to our process. It just, it just",

        "text": " and make a motion to. I'm looking for my notes here. To put an easement or to go straight to the abrogation? I'm looking over at tracy. So I think both parties, Mister Calloway and Mister Gooding. Mister Gooding, can you come up for a minute please? Y'all can't abrogate it today. I understand. I just. I have a question for both of you. So you both are in agreement that once the county either abrogates puts it into a conservation easement, whatever it is, that 25 foot is going to become part. That's going to be your line from which the hundred foot. No, it's going to be included within the 100ft. Yeah, but once it's gone, it'll. The hundred foot will start from where countryside farms property line ends. Okay, so that's not any kind of a questionnaire. So my question is going to be, Mister Minter, what is the easiest way for us to vacate this easement? Put it in. What's the easiest way for us to get it out of Marion County's hands and over to Pioneer ranch? I think Mister Gooding's suggestion of the easement as an interim step and we could do that pretty quickly within the next couple of weeks and then we can at the same time initiate the process to abrogate the whole thing. Okay. I mean, if my board members agree, I think that's the best way. I do. I agree. All right, so I'll make a motion. So we'll make. Speak up if you got a question. We still have two different proposals on how to do that before the commission. And as I was trying, as I mentioned before, the buffer was imposed in order to protect countryside farm in case and when development occurs. And the proposal that we put forth said the development or the amendments, the developer agreement which would allow the development to occur do not happen until the easement is in place. And that's what I would urge for in order to protect us, give us a bit of our bargain. What's the difference? I don't understand what the difference is. The problem is there's a 25 foot gap between countryside farms boundary and the property that's owned by Mister Gooding's client. It's uncertain at this point what will or could happen in that 25ft. How do we deal with that? We don't. We feel comfortable that the county's not going to put a road there, but it could revert to the developer. Who knows what the developer might do? We don't know his full plan at this point. We just have to be protected so that there is a conservation easement in place on the 25ft plus the 75ft before any development or any change in the development occurs. So Mister Cashmere, unless we navigate it, he's just talking about the action today, mister minor, just today he's saying, let me ask mister, may I ask Mister California, may I clarify something? Unless we brought the pud back, came in front of you, made a zoning change, we can't do anything with that 25ft other than it remain an easement. Whether it's abrogated or not. There is no chance of anything going wrong with this at this point. And so I don't understand the argument between the two languages. Y'all aren't going to build a road on it. Y'all own it, give it to us. We have to put an easement on it. If you put an easement on it before we do, while you all still have it, the easement still exist whenever it transfers. There's no chance of anything going wrong that I can see. So I don't know why we wouldn't. We're not nefarious enough to go in and destroy a 25 foot strip that's on the other side of something that we have a no touch easement on. But if there's no chance of anything going wrong, just provide that the additional development cannot occur until it goes right. And so that the only thing there is you're stopping any development from occurring on the site. So for something that can't possibly occur, you're going to hold up multimillion dollar project that doesn't make any sense to do. He's being really cautious and he's being aggressive, obviously. No, I'm not in the middle. I agree with Mister Tillman, but it is a legitimate concern for you. I'm hoping that you all have given Mister Calloway a warm and fuzzy enough to where he would know that you all are going to do the right thing. But he's not a warm and fuzzy kind of guy so you know, it's up to y'all to do. But isn't there an agreement that could be a quick, honestly, a one paragraph thing between the three of us that say all of this will occur? Well, that is where I was going. A vote to approve my verge of the agreement contingent upon within a month, within a month and a half from",

        "text": " infrastructure. Like we talked about, the footprint of the facility is pretty much exclusively located on land that's used for dry land wheat production, and it's all inside the Butter Creek critical groundwater area. We've worked hard to make sure the proposed project will not impact or displace irrigated agricultural uses and we're working to preserve existing area water resources as well. Lastly, the facility has been designed to avoid what little high value wildlife habitat was surveyed in the area. And you know, we think we'll be able to completely avoid impacting those areas. And if we do have to impact any, there's some mitigation proposed with a third party to address that. So addition to, in addition to the other impacts that I just mentioned, the impact on agricultural land has been a really key consideration. This was identified early on in our engagement with local stakeholders as a key issue. So we hired a third party firm called Eco Northwest to do some pretty detailed economic modeling to determine the direct, indirect and induced economic impacts that the facility may have on the local agricultural economy. And then we took that information and we worked collaboratively with Moro county and with other ag stakeholders to come up with a pretty unique agricultural mitigation plan to address those impacts. This includes the creation of an agricultural mitigation fund and an agreement with Moro county to establish the fund and create an advisory committee to administer that. And the idea is that when we start construction the facility, we will be committed to paying money into this fund, and those funds will ultimately go to benefit dry land wheat projects in the county or the agricultural economy more generally. And lastly, we have committed in our application to continue our engagement with neighbors around the project who may, you know, feel impacts from the facility when it comes to traffic or dust control or other things, and want to make sure that we're taking their farming operations into account as we're planning for the construction and operation of our facility and make every accommodation we can to avoid having those impacts. Chris Pretty much covered this already, but just to point out again, we're currently in the public information meeting phase of the permitting process here. We anticipate receiving the site certificate in a few months, and then we'll probably spend the entirety of 2025, kind of in pre construction planning phase, getting all of our final designs, working through the final iterations of our mitigation plans, arranging financing, you know, ordering equipment, hiring contractors, etcetera. It's a pretty big undertaking to gear up a project of the scale. And then, like I said before, we anticipate constructing the project and phases over a period of roughly four years, from 2026 to 2029. And if you go to the next slide, there's just a little bit more detail. So the top chart here, and this is included in the application as well. The different colors represent different construction phases, and then the chart below, the corresponding colors reflect the estimated construction worker headcount that will go with those phases. So you can see we kind of have overlapping phases through time, construction on those phases, ramping up and ramping down, and it all kind of balances out to a fairly smooth ramp up plateau and then ramp back down sort of feel to it. And this helps with planning. It helps with making sure that there's adequate housing and that we're not kind of in a constant up and down flow of construction workers coming in and out. Also important to note that this represents the estimated construction headcount for the full proposed design, including all of the potential battery storage. If we end up not having battery storage on the project, we expect these numbers will go down by about 200. So instead of plateauing it around 900, maybe we're plateauing around 700. Again, many, many details are available in the application, but we just wanted to highlight a few key construction considerations that have been described and Dr. Addressed in some detail. Everything from vegetation management, what kind of ground cover is going to be planted, how it's going to be managed, water use and water sourcing, where we're going to get the water from, how are we going to use it, how are we going to preserve those ag water resources in the area? Dust and weed control. And, you know, working with the morrow Soil and Water Conservation District has been a big benefit for us to learn from the experience of the wheat Ridge facility, which is operating right next door and figuring out some best practices, practices that we can implement on our project. There's some going to be some limitations on working hours that we expect to be as a condition in the site certificate. Workforce housing is a key consideration, and we've been engaging with stakeholders to try to find solutions for that and make sure the housing is there when it's needed. Traffic management includes a transportation plan, a road use agreement with the county, make sure that all of those roads are well taken care of and able to support what we need to do. Safety is obviously a big concern",

        "text": ". If you're aware of any of your members that may have a project that theynna develop, this is a great time to do it. If it has these community attributes or some energy resilience attributes, or serves an underserved community within your service territory, this is a great time to come in and get some funding for these projects. And so we're really hoping that it's seen in that light, that it's an opportunity to essentially convey this benefit to your members, if you're aware of projects. And I think I'll leave it there. Unless there's any other thoughts from Christy or James, I think that sounds really helpful. And I think that Gaille Malcolm, who represented Cous at the table when we were developing this program, was really instrumental in us thinking through the role of utilities. And just want to give her a shout out, Charlie. Tracy, you have your hand up? Do you want to go ahead and ask your, your question? You should be off or maybe you took your hand down. I'm not sure. No question. Well, Keith has his hand up. Can. Patricia, can you take Keith off? Mute. Okay, Keith, you should be goody. Can you hear me okay? Yes, we can. Thank you. Okay, thank you. Hey, we're working with Bonneville Environmental foundation on a possible project out here in Forest Grove that would involve upwards up to about 400 kw ofities solar. But our project would involve us taking all the production credits and pushing them back into our low income assistance program, serving all of our customers that qualify for that program. Would that under the direction you have now, would that qualify for as part of this grant funding for direct energy cost savings to our families and small businesses? From that language, does that seem like that would apply, Rob? Yeah, definitely. So the eligibility requirements are pretty straightforward, that there's technology eligibility and that has to essentially just be a renewable energy technology. So 400 solar would apply without question or would be eligible without question. And then the other eligibility requirement has to do with the actual applicant. And so as long as the applicant was either you as the utility or some other public body, that would make the applicant eligible. And the way in which the benefits flow back to low income members of the community would help it to score points within the competitive review process. So, yeah, it sounds to me like it would be an eligible project that would do well in the program. Thank you, Rob. Thanks youith Charlotte. Let's try again. You're off mute. You should be able to speak now. Can you hear me? Yes. All right, great. Thanks. And thanks for everything you guys are doing on this. It's a really neat program of the. We've got a project, our community solar project that we're planning to build kind of late fall this year, and it's starting to look like supply chain constraints are going to make it so that we have to start ordering materials soon. We'd still like to be eligible for the grant and I'm wondering how you guys will handle, you know, any kind of costs that happen before, you know, you know, before award, I guess. Can they count as the 50%, or is it, does everything have to wait until after the award? James, do you want to take that one? Maybe. So. Eligible costs to be funded by the grant will only be those that are incurred after the application deadline. And I just wanteded to. We'll check our definition of the project costs. So the project costs will be the costs incurred by the applicant as a whole. So that is just like the whole project for the renewable energy system, but the only eligible costs will be those that incurred after the application deadline. Does that kind of make sense? I think so. So you're saying that if it's at all possible, we would wait till after it was June 10 to expend those funds for those funds that you're hoping to claim by the grant? Yes. Okay. So, yeah, and I think we have a really related question to Charlie. You can stay off. And did you want to follow up at all before I. Because Michelle had a question which was, well, projects that have already started purchasing materials or began construction prior to completing the application potentially qualify. And I think, well, I should. But is the answer to that? Yes, but those costs would not be reimbursable, is that correct? Yes. So it's kind of how the rules have been written in that cost the project'still, eligible, but only those costs incurred after the application deadline would be eligible. Costs for the grant to fund, for the grant funding to be used on. Rob, you want add that? Well, just one thing, and I think Charlie mentioned that for a renewable energy only project that's a constructive project, the grant is only able to cover 50%",

Can you hear me okay? Yes, thank you. Okay, so I'm pleased to announce this is an information item only. We're not asking council to make any decisions today on this agenda item, but we are providing an update on the Lawrence Milk Fetch mitigation project that is underway for the reitidge renewable energy facility, too. And I am pleased to announce that Jordan Brown, the head of the native plant program with the Oregon Department of Agriculture, is on the line. He is going to be my co presenter and I am going to hopefully expeditiously go through my slide so I can turn the floor over to Jordan in his presentation. And if council has any questions, we do have q and a time on the last slide. We also are happy to take any questions along the way. Just make sure you chime in and let me know. Think you want me to stop talking? So just a brief overview of the facility. It is an operational facility, 200 megawatt wind energy facility. It's located within Morrow and Umatila counties. It was created as a site certificate out of the original wheat Ridge energy facility, which was a larger facility that was split into three separate site certificates. The project that we're talking about today is pursuant to councils threaten and endangered species standard and the Lawrence Milk Vet mitigation project for wheatroid renewable too. So very briefly, I've just cited some excerpts of our TNE standard as it relates to clients and our relationship and the role of Oregon Department of Agriculture. So the bolded parts are relevant to the topic that I'm discussing today, but it is important that we be aware that under our standard for plant species that Oregon Department of Agriculture has listed as threatened or endangered, that the design construction operation of the proposed facility making an into account mitigation that's important, and then under subpar b, it's relevant to the species at hand because there is no adapteive protection or conservation program for milk Dutch. So therefore we need to work with them to determine that there would not be a significant reduction in the likelihood of survival or recovery of the species. And that's not the entire TME standard, but it is the part that relate to our project and specifically to our relationship with Oregon Department of Agriculture and TNA plants. So a little bit about Lawrence milkfatchch. Yes, it's spelled Lawren's like the name. It's often spelled in kind of another variation of its latin name, but it's a member of the P family and more importantly, it's listed as retin under Theego Organ Endangered Species act and it falls under our standard as a result. Important thing to note about this plan is that it has a narrow distribution and it's limited to four counties within the state, primarily within Uittila and Moro county, which is where our facility is looking. So as I noted earlier, there was a site certificate split. There are existing conditions on the site certificate and one of them was a pre conststruction survey condition that required that the true",

And as she said, my name is Rob del Mar, and I'm a senior policy analyst with Oregon Department of Energy and House Bill 2021, also known as the 100% Clean Energy for all Bill, established the new Community Renewable Energy grant program. The purpose of the program is to offset the costs of planning and developing community renewable energy projects, support projects, and traditionally underserved communities, promote small scale community renewable energy projects and provide direct benefits to communities across Oregon by improving energy resilience, creating local jobs, promoting economic development, and offsetting local energy costs. Next slide, please. I think Christy still can't hear me. So I will type in. There we go. All right. One of the features that distinguishes this program from previous programs in Oregon is that it's only open to public bodies, so eligible applicants include tribes, cities, counties, other public bodies, and consumer owned utilities. The bill excludes cities over 500,000 in population, which in Oregon, of course, includes only Portland. And this exclusion was done in the recognition of the Portland Clean Energy Fund, which can provide funding for similar types of projects within the city limits of Portland. Next slide, please. Maybe I can. There we go. Okay. Maybe I'll. All right. Another feature of the program is the focus on community energy resilience. The bill establishes carve outs where 50% or more of the funding must go to community energy resilience projects. And there's a second carve out where 50% or more of the funds must go to primarily serve one or more qualifying communities. And next slide. And qualifying communities are defined within the. Within the statute, and they include communities of color, low income communities, tribal, rural, and coastal communities, and other traditionally underrepresented communities in Oregon. Next slide. The bill also called for an advisory committee to work with Oregon Department of Energy on program Design and now program implementation. And this committee was instrumental in sharing on the ground experience with project development. They helped us to write the rules. They are located in communities across Oregon and continue to help us spread the word for the program. And so the committee has been instrumental in putting this together and continues to serve us well as the program continues. Next slide, please. So, since the passage of House Bill 2021, we've been very busy standing up the new program. In the summer of 2021, OO staff were assigned to the program and developed an implementation plan, including operational staffing, and it changes within the agency. In September, we recruited the stakeholder advisory committee to help guide the program design and support the the rulemaking. That effort resulted in draft rules being posted with the secretary of state's office on January 1, and those rules are now final. The opportunity announcements for the program came out on March 7. Next slide, please. Now, before we move on to the specific grant opportunities, I'd like to walk through a project that EEB, the Eugene Water and Electric Board, completed a few years ago. The city of Eugene, like much of western Oregon, could be subject to significant damage from a Cascadia earthquake. As a utility that manages both electricity and water services, EwEB recognized the importance of energy to water delivery and was well positioned to support resilience disaster recovery within Eugene. Next slide, please. EWeB considered community resilience based on the rule of threes and that was in the first three days they would like to be able to provide access to drinking water. In the first three weeks they would like to repower critical facilities, and in the first three months they would like to restore the system for regular operation. Next slide please. So as a result of their planning efforts, EweB developed the grid edge demonstration project. The project utilized an existing 50 kilowatt pv system on the roof of the Howard Elementary School and added a battery storage system and a new potable water well on site. Next slide please. So the result is a facility that can serve as a potable water fill station for the community in the event of a power outage. The school building is also provided with backup power and serves as an emergency shelter, and the system also provides value to the community. In addition to the water and energy resilience features, the school benefits from energy bill savings and EEB is also able to use the batteries to provide grid services during their day to day operations. Next slide please. This is a schematic diagram of the microgrid system showing the electric loads that can be served by the system during a power outage. The battery storage units and they're shown at the bottom in black, can be charged by the solar and natural gas generator, assuming that generator is",

        "text": " energy projects. And so this federal consistency review would apply not only to offshore facilities, but any onshore activities related to port infrastructure improvements, cable landing, et cetera. And the coastal effects that are subject to review are similarly fairly broad. They include a wide variety of categories of effects, and they also are permitted to be cumulative or indirect, separated by space and time. So it's a fairly low threshold to bring the state into the conf ##versation when we perform reviews, those reviews revolve around what are known as enforceable policies, and these are a subset of the state's suite of statutes, administrative rules, local plans, our statewide planning goals, and the territorial sea plan is an important one here as well. From all of those documents, we gather what are those most direct and substantive requirements, and we submit those to the National oceanic and Atmospheric Associate administration. Excuse me. And if they approve those for use in our reviews, they have to meet certain criteria. Those could now be the basis of an objection. And so the identification and development of those enforceable policies is really important to maintaining the state's voice in these reviews. What you see here on the screen is a pictographic map of the different sources of our enforceable policies. Currently, as I mentioned before, they include our statewide land use planning goals, our Oregon administrative rules that cover a suite of topics from water quality to fish and wildlife protection to habitat uses. We have organ revised statutes, again, that are topically based, and then we also have local policies at the city and county level that include land use regulations, comprehensive plans and codes. And I mentioned Oregon's land use system. We do have three statewide planning goals that are, or, excuse me for that are specific to the coastal space. And that would be fairly important when we consider the review of an offshore wind project. Goal 16 applies to estuaries and could relate to channel modifications or facilities that are along estuaries or the routing of subsea cables. Similarly, goals 17 and 18 relate to coastal shorelands, beaches, and dunes, and those can come into play for cable landings and other such activities. And then goal 19, ocean resources, covers those activities that would occur out in the territorial sea and beyond. And I wanted to highlight one aspect of goal 19 in particular, and that is that it gives a higher priority to the protection of renewable marine resources, that is, living marine organisms, than to the development of non renewable ocean resources. And so in the context of goal 19, renewable is more of a biological concept than an energy concept and is something that must be built into these reviews. The Coastal management program and the Ocean Policy Advisory Council, excuse me, OPAC, overseas territorial sea plant and part five specifically addresses marine renewable energy siting. It was originally developed with wave energy in mind, but there is talk about potentially revising it to make sure that the policies that are contained in there are the ones that we want to see when it comes to wind energy. And I'll note that they include some resource mapping, such as visual resources, specific habitat areas of greater interest once the state receives a federal consistency review. As I said before, it's a 60 day process, normally, where the federal agency would submit to us some documentation that describes how they believe the action is consistent with Oregon's enforceful policies. And they would also use things like an NEPA analysis to provide some additional support related to the effects. There would be a public comment process associated and we would leave that review, including our many network partners, as we evaluate what has been provided to us and what we know about the action to determine whether ultimately we can agree that the action is consistent with Oregon's policies. And again, as I mentioned previously, we're looking at three general outcomes here. And if you look at what's happened in other states, most have tended to result in that concurrence with conditions. California is a good example where they said yes, if, and they included a number of conditions, both related to protecting environments, but also to setting up some working groups that would be having conversations between now and when a construction operations plan is eventually submitted. Some years down the road. Again, the state gets two touch points for offshore wind. This first touch point we're expecting to arrive sometime this spring, and that would be the BoEm decision to issue a lease. And that would then flow naturally into a number of activities on the part of the lessees to go and study those areas that they have now leased as they prepare those documents to submit to bomb. And so that's touch point one. Touch .2 we're expecting will be some years down the road, and that would be the more specific plan of what they want to build, where and thinking long term about things like decommissioning, etcetera. So narrowing and even further on the scope of what we expect",

        "text": " of the things I learned is that oftentimes the certificate holders team shifts from construction to operations. So having those two broken out, I think is helpful, again, reinforcing that they have demonstrated qualifications and expertise to do the work that needs to be done, and having someone on site that really is or on board that is really responsible for tracking and managing those site certificate conditions, whether it be in construction or during the operations of the facility, the long term. So the next standard is the land use standard. I think council will remember that the question that came up over the addition of the 169 acres was really related to the water rights, the fact that it's irrigated agriculture. We talked to the county, the county provided, as the special advisory group provided comments that that were in support of the water rights transfer for similar use, and that as long as there was no net loss of irrigated agriculture within that county as a result of this transfer of a water right from the parcel for the area e to another existing area where we can use it for a similar use, the landowner has indicated in a letter that they will transfer that water. Right. And also that was a comment that was made during the certificate holders comments during the public hearing, was to assure that, yes, this is something that they will do, they have committed to. But to make sure that that happens, we have recommended a new land use condition number eight which basically states just that. But if they opt to build within this area e that they will provide us with documentation that the water rights associated with that area have been transferred for similar use within Lake county to ensure that no net loss to irrigated act. I don't know if anyone has any comments, questions on that. Otherwise I will move on and under retirement and financial assurance because there is a change in the facility components and also a need to update it for current $2023 values. Based upon those calculations, we came up with a number that is just a little bit higher than $38.1 million for retirement. And we do have a letter on file that says that the certificate holder should be able to acquire that $40 million bond. We didn't make any other recommended changes to that, but I see councilmb member condon has a comment. Thank you vice chair Howe and thank you, Miss Slan. Just a question. I'm curious. I probably could have looked this up, but has Heffern and insurance brokers provided a bond for us ever? Thank you. Just a point of information apparet not that we're aware of. Okay. Thank you. But they are on our approved list for financial institutions so they just haven't provided a bond before. Thank you. Thank you council member Condid and so next standard is the wildfire prevention and risk mitigation standard. I think of note is that this standard had not been fully adopted at the time that the site certificate was a appro. So there are some recommended changes in the draft proposed order to reflect the new newer, the existing wildfire prevention or risk mitigation standard. And so it's, part of it is to move what had been included under the public services, existing conditions that kind of wrapped up in an emergency response plan, things like fire, to pull that out of there and make it much more specific to this newer standard and provide some more robust language, Andommend recommended language to reflect this new standard to address wildfire risk. So the first thing was to replace that public services condition. And there's two parts to it. There's a four a and a four b. And so basically we have recommended a wildfire condition to reflect both four a and a separate condition for four b. And so they're very similar, but one applies to operations of the facility and one provides to that prior to construction construction requirement. So the language in here is similar to what we have asked for more recently in wildfire mitigation plan, the certificate holder is required to submit for counsel approval a final wildfire mitigation plan. So we have a draft in the draft proposed order, but it is subject to finalization and there will be additional information that needs to be included. And in that are some of these conditions. Just give you a chance to read it, and it keeps going on to the next slide. And again, this is to be more consistent with how we're addressing this newer standard in our site certificate condition. Councilor Cond. Sure. Thank you. Vice chair, how so? This whole wildfire mitigation plan review and approval for us is a new thing. Right. And as I was reviewing the material, it wasn't long after the Lahaina fire, and one of the things that I don't see in our conditions or really anything else we've discussed is any notification process or procedure for adjacent landowners should an ignition occur. And I'm wondering if there is an opportunity to include a condition for an alarm system or notification system that, you know, by the time the fire department is called, people come to",

        "text": " critical public service facilities where the development of alternate energy generation and storage resources will meet local energy resilience needs. The image shows some wind power and some solar power, but there are a lot of different ways that counties can approach alternate energy generation and storage resources. It could include these other renewable sources of energy. It could be backup fuel, fuel resources, generators, micro grids, battery storage, lots of combinations. And it can really be driven by your county's needs and your county's goals. Identify plans need to identify opportunities to coordinate and locate energy infrastructure development to align with and support critical public service facilities plans need to identify time schedules, priorities and potential funding sources for developing energy resilience and plans need to identify other actions and resources needed to implement the energy resilience plan. You can really see, particularly in these bottom two bullets, content requirements that these plans are pushing towards implementation. The idea is really to think through what are the community needs and then what are the ways that your county can move closer to getting these really important projects put on the ground. So thinking through time schedules, thinking through priorities and funding U and that is a really important benefit of these plans. They really do get you so much closer to being ready to take advantage of those funding opportunities and project opportunities when they arise. And so those are the plan requirements. And you know, within that there are quite broad and I think there are a lot of ways that your county can shape these plans to align with and meet other similar goals, whether it's for energy or emergency management or economic development. So, you know, within meeting these plan requirements, we really encourage you to shape these plans to best meet your local commun community's needs and goals. And the applications are available up on our website. Right now we have two applications, one for counties that are applying individually just for their county and another for counties that are applying in a cohort. And I will go over what does a cohort mean and look like in this program in a moment. If you haven't checked out our applications, please do. If somebody from OTDo could drop our program page in the chat right now, that would be awesome. And we'll also have it linked on another slide. But the applications are quite simple. You know, we really tried to keep them as streamlined as possible. We don't want applying to be a burden for you participating in this program, so I encourage you to check them out. Simple fillable PDF's thanks so much Odo team. You're the best so you apply, you submit it to us. We'oo staff will review it for completeness and eligibility. If we have any questions, we'll just reach out directly to you to go go over those, and then we ask that you submit to our program email, which is shown up here on the slide. We'll use that programmatic email for formal submissions of application performance agreement reporting forms, things of that nature. So other program requirements. So following the application process and the performance agreement, we will do a one time funds disbursement. Our intention is to get funds out to your county so that access to funds is not a barrier to you getting going on your planning. So we'll do that one time funds disbursement after the performance agreement is complete. Eligible uses of funds include county staff time, hiring, technical assistance providers, outreach, travel, and other costs as necessary for plan development. If you think you have some costs in other we can go over, you can reach out to us and we can go over what those eligible costs might be. We do have some interim reports during the program. The first will be in October 2024, the other in March 2025. These are brief reports, and really the intention is just to check in and say, what have you gotten done? What are your goals for the next time in the program, and are you having any challenges? Are there any ways that we can support you, help you through those challenges? The deliverables for the program are a copy of your completed plan and a program completion form by our program deadline line of August 1, 2025. That program completion form is a self attestation form that you've completed your plan, met all the content requirements, and then the other major component is asking how did you use your funds, how you use them all, approximately how much and which categories, and if you reach August 1 and you have not completed your plan, we do have some flexibility in the program deadline and ability to have an extension until December 31, 2025. That's laid out very clearly in our application documents and faqs, and I'm happy to go over it in our question and answer session or another time if you have further questions about it. There are two other components and requirements of our program. Counties need to formally adopt their plans, go through their adoption process within their county, and they need to incorporate these plans into their natural",

We first just want to thank the council for reviewing our application, thank the staff for the work that they put in, and we are interested in hearing the comments of the public both tonight and throughout the public comment period. We were mainly here to listen and to receive the comments. A couple of things had come up in previous. You could either ask the questions again or I can go in. The first one is about the site boundary. I just want to point out the site boundary went from just the microsyiting corridor. That's why it was 4000. The actual lease parcels were almost 42,000 acres originally. And what we've done is just gone to the least boundary. And then within there that, as Chris had pointed out, are the microsed corridors, and those are an increase of 10,000 acres. And so. So, you know, in a sense, apples to apples, it's 4600 or so to 14,600. And as, as one of the council members pointed out, it is, I would put it as very balsamic ridges, so. Or not balsamic basal, yes. Basalt. Sorry. Basalt bridges, that was, yes. I don't know if that is a slip of tongue, because I'm a little hungry. No, I'm. But that is, that's the reason you can only get up certain places, up to the ridges where, in a sense, the wind is. And that, that's, I just wanted to point that out. And other than that, we don't have any other where, where we will be providing some, some written responses to the DPO. But there's nothing particularly that. We have comments for tonight, and so with that, you",

To get us started this morning, I'm goingn pass it to Alan Zelenka. Yeah. Morning. Thank you, Ben. Good morning, everybody. Those of you not familiar with me, my name is Alan Zalenka. I'm the assistant director for planning innovation. Planning innovation is the division that's heading up this work on the Oregon State energy strategy. And we've got a great team with us working on this. So rest assured, you got your a team working on this. Our, with our consultants from Kerns and West and Seti, not that Seti. And edith bar is, is our project manager. So next slide, please, for those of you that many of you, of course, familiar with Odo, so those of you that aren't, this is our mission statement and what we do. You can go back and read that, but it is about the clean energy transition and protecting the environment and sh, shaping all of that. And so what we're trying to do here is live up to that mission statement. So today I'm really excited about this because we're kicking off the working groups of which you guys are all members, and many of you know that HB 3630 directed Odo to do this state energy strategy. And in addition, the energy strategy will help inform the second part of our climate pollution reduction grant, the comprehensive climate action part of it. We have a lot to live up to since we just, you may have heard that we have got, just received $197 million from us EPA for the priority climate action plan to do a whole bunch of climate actions. So we've got a lot to live up to. We're in the first phase of developing this strategy and that phase is focusing on the modeling. And the work groups play an essential role in all of that. We've been meeting with our sister agencies and data holders to help shape the inputs into the modeling, but now we're turning to you to help us shape and inform the modeling inputs and all the questions that we need to answer. So I know we're asking a lot of you, but we very much appreciate your time, your expertise and your dedication to this over the next couple of months, in this first meeting, we will present to you the modeling approach. Jeremy from Evolved is going to go over that along with Eileen from SETI, and it's the foundation of the work that we're doing. It is not the complete set of work that we're doing. It does not give us an answer. It gives us information. From that we will develop the the state energy strategy. So during this meeting and following each of the breakout meetings, we'll have the opportunity to ask questions and contribute your thoughts. We realize this is, we're been doing this in a short timeframe, so for this reason, we have set up an online portal for written comments, and we encourage you to share your written comments to us so we don't miss any of your great ideas. For those of you in the public who are joining today, welcome. Thank you for showing up bright and early in the morning. You're also invited to submit comments on our comment portal, and you have that link in a bit in our presentation. So we're looking forward to working with you all and learning what you have to say, sharing your perspectives, and helping us get our energy strategy in place. So thank you for showing up and now I'd like to hand it back over to Ben Duncan to help facilitate. Great, thanks Alan. Appreciate the opening and some initial grounding, which would really be a theme of today. So I'm going to do a little bit of housekeeping. We have a lot of folks in the room, and so everyone who's participating, other than folks you might see on the screen or the project team here, is participating as attendees. And that means that you're not going to be able to actively engage in the discussion unless you're promoted as a panelist. And I'll talk a little bit about how to do that. And so I'm going to walk through the agenda in a minute. But our time together is really built onboard, all of you in these working groups to the project. And so you're going to hear some presentations that will be followed by some space for question and answer. At that time, as you see on the slide, you can use the raise hand button at the bottom of your screen where it says raise hand that function. Or if you are on the phone, you can press star nine and that will raise your hand and get you in the queue. So at that time, when you raise your hand, we'll call on you, we'll promote you, and you will be able to speak, can be heard and responded to in the main session. I'll just note that with this number of folks, we may not be able to get to all the questions that",

        "text": " the amendment review process, and public participation. Next slide, please. This slide provides a quick overview of this agenda item. As I just said, I'll provide a brief overview of the FSEC process and of the approved facility, as well as the amendment request itself. Then Vice chair Condan will provide an overview of the public hearing, and we will conclude the agenda item with the public hearing itself, where members of the public may comment on the draft proposed order, the amendment request, or both. Coun council will also have an opportunity to make comments about any concerns they have related to the draft proposed order and or the amendment request. I did want to note that tonight's hearing is not the close of the public comment period on the draft proposed order or the amendment request. The public comment period deadline is 05:00 p.m. on March 29, which is next Friday. After the close of the public comment period, the department recommends that council leave the record open for an additional business day for the certificate holder to respond to any and all public comments, and so the department's recommending council leave the record open until 05:00 p.m. on April 1 or later if requested. Next slide, please. Nancy okay, the Oregon Department of Energy's siting division has one primary objective, which is to follow its mandate, established in 1975 to review large scale energy projects for compliance with applicable standards and rules. For reference, citing refers to the technical permitting review of a proposed facility against a number a proposed or approved facility against a number of predetermined standards based on site specific locational issues that may be affected by any particular facility. Please note that land acquisitions, land leases, and easements are all outside of the FSEEC process. The Oregon Department of Energy's siting division serves as staff to the energy Facility sitiding Council, which I'll be referring to as FSEEC or council. The council consists of up to seven members serving in a volunteer capacity. Council members are appointed by the governor and approved by the Oregon Senate and represent a diverse professional background from across the state, diverse locations as well. While the Oregon Department of Energy siting staff makes recommendations to FSAC, FSEEC itself is the final decision making authority for energy facilities under its jurisdiction, including the leaning juniper two, a facility in this amendment request. Next slide this slide illustrates the major steps in the review of requests for amendment to an existing FX site certificate. Nancy will you just click and see if it if there's an animation? There we go. Cool. This amendment request is being processed under the type A amendment review process, which includes a few opportunities for public review and participation, including tonight's public hearing. The amendment process itself begins with when a certificate holder submits their preliminary request for amendment and the preliminary request for amendment for the leaning juniper two. A facility was submitted to the department on September 22, 2023. Following the PAC the preliminary or PRFA, preliminary request for amendment. The department provided public notice of the PRFA receipt, and that occurred on September 28. In addition to the public notice, the department also initiated reviewing agency coordination on this amendment request. On February 9 of this year, 2024, the department deemed the amendment request complete, and on February 14, the certificate holder submitted a complete request for amendment to the department. On February 29, the department issued its draft proposed order for amendment three, as well as a public notice of the issuance of its draft proposed order. In a request for comment on the amendment request, the draft proposed order contains the department's recommendations for council on the requested amendment, including recommendations for amended site certificate conditions and new conditions. As I mentioned just a couple minutes ago. The public comment period will not close until next Friday, March 29. Following the close of the record, the department will review any comments received and will prepare responses to the comments for council's consideration. Once council has reviewed the draft proposed order and any and all comments received, the department will incorporate council's feedback into its proposed order, which is the next step in the process. When the department issues its proposed order, a public notice of the proposed order and contested case will also be issued. Because this amendment request is being evaluated as a type A amendment, it allows for a possible contested case proceeding to occur. Only those persons who have raised a relevant issue in person, at this meeting or in writing by the comment deadline on the draft proposed order may participate in the contested case. If held, the contested case proceeding would be run by an independent hearing officer. Following the deadline for the contested case hearing requests or after the contested case proceeding has concluded, the council will review the proposed order and issue its final order approving or denying the request for amendment. The final orders, findings of facts and conclusions of law are based on the proposed order and the outcome of the contested case",

        "text": " of all, we have three kind of structures in mind, three groups in mind for the energy strategy and for anybody who is there for the November webinar, this remains unchanged. So we have an interagency steering group that's already been formed that serves to ensure state agency coordination. And this group includes us. It includes the Department of Land Conservation and Development, the Department of Transportation, the Public Utility Commission, Department of Environmental Quality business, Oregon, and the governor's office and other agencies who are also invited to share their expertise, especially now that we are going to get moving with things. And this group meets about once a month, we also have an advisory group that we have not yet formed and that we envision serving as a sounding board for the energy strategy process. And so the idea for the advisory group is that it would be composed of people with diverse perspectives from across Oregon. So we would have all of those perspectives in one room meeting once a month to both get an update on the energy strategy, but to talk through difficult questions, ask us questions, and help guide and inform the process, then we also have plan to pull together working groups, and the working groups will serve to really get in the weeds. These are people interested in discussing technical and modeling aspects of the energy strategy. And when I say technical, it doesn't just mean looking at different. There are all sorts of technical expertise. And, for example, we want to make sure that when we're talking about transmission and distribution systems and we're talking about fuel supply, that there's an opportunity also for people who bring a community perspective to also engage in those conversations. These groups are, we anticipate seven to eight working groups. I'll talk a little bit more about this in a moment. And they will be meeting through July and August roughly to inform the technical analysis. So we envision more than one meeting for a working group. We. Oh, Jessica knew there'd be questions right off the bat here. Well, these are, they're not exactly related to what you just went over, but I thought this was a good opportunity to jump in. And the first one, actually, I will answer, I'give Edith the chance to take a breath and sip of water. I did get a question from wrongf about how in depth the employment impacts will be, and will they disaggregate impacts based on occupation, classification, wages, demand or displacement needed training, et cetera. So, Rompes, we understand that there's a lot to the energy jobs component of all of this, and right now we're looking into options to sort of add to what's within the scope of this existing energy strategy. We don't have, like, anything to share right at the moment, but I do think that there's definitely some need to dive a little bit deeper into some of the questions around that that might not be able to be addressed within the budget and timeframe of this particular analysis. And the second question is from Peter. Peter asked if distributed generation at the residential level, including solar and batteries or other renewable, local distributed generation strategies, would be considered in the model to achieve resiliencey and climate goals. And I think that's precisely the kind of thing that we're hoping to hear from people in the coming months as we'out engaging what things are you interested in the model trying to address? What energy questions do you have? So I'll hand it back over to Edith to see if there's anything she wants to add. But in general, these kinds of questions are exactly the kind of information that we're looking for at this time. Yeah, thanks, Jessica. And to that question on distributed resources, I'll just add that we looking at, we'll be kind of evaluating all resources, including distributed resources, in the analysis. And then when you mentioned resilience impact, that speaks to the kind of thing that we, as Jessica said, really want to hear about, which is how we can start thinking about the co benefits of certain measures. And if there is a resiliency benefit, how do we consider that in the model? So I think 'a really good question, something that we are excited to dig into. So we also plan to consult with tribes, because this is government to government engagement. It's on a separate slide here, and it's on a separate track with each of the nine federally recognized tribes in Oregon. This obviously doesn't mean to preclude tribal council or members from participating in any other meetings. That would be fantastic. But we also plan to undertake this formal government to government engagement and to engage with tribal communities and organizations where appropriate, whenever appropriate. So we also have in mind these three kinds of meetings in addition to the groups that I mentioned above, which are more established structures. So there's a difference here. The groups that I mentioned before, the interage steering group, the working groups advisory group, they require a bigger time commitment and they have kind of an ongoing series of meetings. And so what we want to present",

        "text": " And yeah, I really like Lee Collins and Nick'points a lot. Colin talked about flexibility, and I do find that in the current EI development code or code for that particular zone, there are a lot more restrictive industrial zones out there that Sherwood should really stay away from. There are some municipalities that just say no distribution. And as a developer, it's really hard to make that investment if you come across particular uses that are just outright not permitted building mean the buildings behind me, which is the Incherrwood on the southwest quadrant of T's Road and 124th, they could have been distribution buildings too. We got lucky, really. There was more demand that needed something faster in the advanced manufacturing space. Which leads me also just to another point I want to make where we should all be cognizant of that objective, of the quantity of jobs relative to advanced manufacturing, they're kind of counter to one another. Advanced manufacturing is an operation that doesn't require a lot of jobs. And so maybe one way to think about it, not necessarily exclusively, but in conjunction with, is the capital investment of a particular facility. And another thing I'll just say on the industrial zone for Sherwood, it makes the buildings look good because you have to have 15% glazing. That faces a major road. Three materials on the buildings. These sort of things, I think are appropriate rather than limiting uses to create some jobs. But again, just a caution on the quantity of jobs relative to advanced manufacturing. Okay, good point. Good. Who else would like to chat? Provide comments that we could fashion that into recommendations in the EOA'are, great discussion comments. I have a few specific code type items and then I think maybe just a broader thought about development review process. So a couple of really specific little things that have come up. One actually kind of related to employment is the parking minimums. And, and maximums are limited by metro. Well, metro sets, so they're pretty much the same in most jurisdictions. But there is sort of an ambiguity in the Sherwood code about parking for warehouses over 150,000 sqft. It's just a little bit weird. So looking at, it's kind of unclear whether the lower ratio applies to the first 150,000 and then the higher ratio applies. But so I don't know how much flexibility Sherwood has to look at their parking code because metro has set the limits anyway. But this is something that we're seeing across the region is that a warehouse today is very different than a warehouse when these parking maximums were set 2030 years ago. So we're getting, we're requesting parking adjustments are typically processed as, instead of variants for, you know, FedEx distribution facility. Some of that's maybe not quite as likely in Sherwood, but even for, so for cross doalk warehouses, or I've even had them for other warehouses where it's just a standard warehouse, but they just have more employees now than the big old mattress warehouse, they're just more efficient. And so these are usually approved because we have shift data to show that we have more employees than you thought we would. But it's like when you just keep getting an adjustment every single time, like the code should be looked at. So like I said, I'm not sure if that's how flexible that is, but parking ratio for warehouse is one. And then the variance process, it'I'm, pretty sure you have the class a variance, which is a, well, you know, there's like the smaller erica could comment, but which once you go above a certain type of variance or adjustment variance, you have to still have to demonstrate hardship. And so it's just you're getting that higher level of variance because of your percentage of variation from the code. But sometimes, I mean, again, this may not be a relevant example, but I've done a parking adjustment for an Amazon facility that was allowed 146 spaces or whatever and needed like 900. And the, because of their efficiencies and their where employ employees don't even work in the building, they work in the vans. And there's, you know, but but that would have been at the tier in Sherwood, where that would have to demonstrate hardship, which is not really the situation. It's just that we have more employees. That's why we need more parking. It's not that the site'too small or something. So looking at the variance process, and it would be nice if there was an adjustment process. More like city of Portland has an adjustment where you just focus on the purpose of the standard that you're modifying and show how you can still meet that with an alternate design. Interesting couple of nitty gritty code things for you there. Nope. That's a great comment. Yeah. And then I think the other thing is, aside from nitty gritty code stuff, it's just the process and customer first focus that is really helpful for development. In some jurisdictions, you go to a",

And what I would say is, you know, please know, connect with myself or other members of the sititing division team, and we can walk you through how that process works, how those issues can and are evaluated in an application. That way, if you're interested in participating and reviewing an application, we can help kind of get you prepared to do that in terms of what to look for and how to look for it, and then when to comment and everything you brought up. Yes. Can and should be evaluated in an application, and we want to hear that kind of information. Okay. Thank you very much for the clarification. That's all I have for right now. Thank you very much. Just a second. Councilme member Condon has a question we're going to see if it's a question we're supposed to ask, and if we can't, then Todd's going to tell us. Yes. Thank you. One, thank you for being here today. A question for you with the concern about groundwater, which I think is a huge issue across. Across the state, but certainly, as we've got a project in the Willamette Valley, a large project. Understand the concern, but is. Is your concern, um, the. A property that is currently used for agriculture, a crop of some. Some sort u converted to solar sor. Right, council. Remember, con, just as a reminder. And. And not just you, but I keep seeing people do this when they're speaking and they're blocking the microphone when they're speaking. I know it's not purposeful, but I'm just worried that people will have a hard time hearing us online. Okay, I'll hold my hands. Are you concerned about an increase in contamination to groundwater? You know, its relative increase from the current use? I'm not. I don't know much about groundwater, but I'm interested in what your concern is. The current use is pretty much all ag land around us. I've lived directly on the valley floor, and now I'm on the foothills. So the water consumpt. The water usage from the foothills down is a lot. Sorry, didn't mean to block that. It's much different now from where I was to where I'm currently at. But I'm only 3 miles away from, or where I used to be. But the water table and the water saturation, it's much higher now where I'm at, compared to just are 3 miles away. So the water flow is different. The current use is ag, and so they use a lot of nitrogen to get their, their grass seed was the majority of the process there. That has pretty much been the way it's been for years. The new stuff coming in is solar has a lot of, if you read some of the studies that's been done, has a very high contaminant rate compared to some of the other processes out there, like wind farming is different. It doesn't have the contaminants of the solar panels have. So that's going to be a new concern is how do we measure those new contaminants. The batteries that they're now going to, they're proposing to put in place, and they have in other climates, their drier climates. I don't think they worry about the groundwater as much as what we will, because they don't have that much water. Like if you go across the mountain to the east side, it's a much drier climate. They're 'not gonna be really that much concerned, I don't believe, unless they're in a high irrigation area, but we get irrigated on a regular basis. So those new contaminants are going toa be what's going toa get into our groundwater and our food supply. Now, if it's just grass seed, I don't know what it's gonna do to grass seed, but the water and the food supply is what I'main concern is for what is a daily consumptional value for a lot of residents. And because of the one proposed area, just knowing the difference in nitrogen levels in our groundwater, that varies from year to year on how that water table moves, what direction does it move. I don't know those answers. So that way water can ebb and flow, I would assume, just like any other water source. If you ever have a house that has a water, a water leak, you may not find that leak where it's dropping from. It's completely at a different location you didn't suspect. So that's kind of the, where we're sitting at now is where are those water sources going to come from? We know where the food source is going to be because everything's on top. And it's not just sheep. Wildlife is going to get into that also. And so it's going to contaminate a quite a range of animals versus just the water table. Thank you. Thank you for your question. Thank you for that.",

        "text": " changes to the narrative and we also resulted in a change in the way that we distribute the Bo between small and large utilities and down little closer here a minute. The funding for the largest small utililities are based on a share of customer sales and state and we have a table to look at that in the next slide. But the other thing we did for small utilities was REM reviewd that maximum project award, which was originally proposed at 600,000. And so we took that cap away. We want a little bit more flexibility than those projects. We also built some flexibility into the way that disadvantaged communities are described in the program. Just a reminder that this is what we've submitted to USDe as an application. And so we're waiting feedback for them to see how much flexibility we actually have with these things. But that's what we proposed to the there next slide. Please, could you des, perhaps you're going to discuss it later. The disadvantaged communities, how you changed the description or, or where is it different? Sure. So we have guidance from federal guidance at the form of the map and that, that highlights areas that are clearly defined as disadvantaged communities in the state. We have a slide for that later. Okay. But we've also in our nrative said that if you're outside of that map and you want to make a case for certain communities or populations to be considered a disadvantaged community would like to let communities make their own case. And that's where we're waiting for some, you know, see what the federal response is to that part of there. So, yeah, so this is a budget summary showing the close to 20 million that Emily mentioned, the 95% that goes to projects. We, we did the math and found that 25% of customers in the state are served by small utilities and federal definitions. And that's the minimum number we would have for funding in the program. In our narrative, we proposed a carve out 40% of these small utilities going from a little over five and a half million originally proposed to little over seven a half million small utilities. Again, weove to the cat for any Maxim war. Next slide, please. Also in the narrative, we highlight our program objectives. Number one is to mitigate natural hazard risks. Number two is deliver benefits to disadvantaged communities. Three is maximize broad community benefits that complement the r resilience projects. And finally, just to continue to learn as we operate program and these objectives as we go along with your future years of funding, are those weighted all the same or that's what we're going to work on today. Now is the criteria how wait. We're going to hopefully develop criteria today for so u in the narrat, we adopted the full list of eligible measures that are provided in federal guidance. So the next slide. This is a slightly abbreviated list from the federal guid stockt measures like utility full management, vegetation management, reconductoring undergrounding grid. Harding measures about two thirds of the way down. You'll see there's an asterisk on microgrids and batteries. Those are eligible technologies under the program. But we have another program o no, they fund those. And the feedback that we got from utilities was to focus more on the grid hardening less. And so that's going to be our focus in the first two rounds. I'd also like to point out the last measure for the last bullet here. New generation and cybersecurity are not included in this program. And so new generation includes solar, wind generation, projects that could be tied to a micro project. And now I will pass it back. First things, so, just to foster some discussion on, and we'll discuss this a little bit and then we'll move on, both in the chat and you might invol some days or in person. But as you review the eligible measures for this program, are there any that stand out to you is most interesting or kind Ofel terms projects that you run? We'go back to the list. Yeah, yeah. We'll give everyone a moment if it just coupleutes. I really like the list in general. I think. I think the development of this listing put a lot of thought went into. I'm going to speak for our system just dep because that's what I know. Relocation, reconductoring and power line very important to us. Vegetation management and fuel load management is very important to us. We have 16, 600 miles of power lines that crisscross some of the most rununded service territory. Surrounded you 30 foot right away, surrounded by 150 foot trees. So anything that we can do to mitigate that risk, it doesn't really matter whether it's fire or snow or anything goes or wind, that's when those trees go down. So I like the middle part of that lists a lot. Only speaking from, from my viewpoint, as you evaluate some of this stuff, I would think that folks in the city may go months and months and months",

        "text": " consumption. So next slide please. So that was kind of a macro level view of energy in Oregon. So now we're going to talk about why an energy strategy. So in the 2022 bio Energy report, we took a look at a variety of different studies looking at decarbonizing energy within states. And we concluded that we've got a lot of existing programs and a lot of great work we're doing, but we need to make sure everything's directed kind of one direction. We need to figure out how we're going to do it, how we're going to meet all these policy objectives and decarbonize and how can we get everybody aligned? And so we'd recommended an energy strategy because we thought it would help align policy development across a variety different state agencies, set some expectations, certainly signal to industry and business where we're looking to go, and also taking, take advantage of opportunities within technologies and say, okay, how can we make sure as a state we're investing effectively and coming up with a good, effective plan that efficiently uses state dollars on our future economy and our energy future? And we have, next slide, please. So, and this is the House bill. The House Bill 3630. The directed organ department energy to lead this work. And we want to develop this energy strategy. And it's important to note that this energy strategy isn't necessarily a linear plan of how we're going to get to a certain point. It's more an evaluation of different opportunities. And taking a look at, we're going to do some energy modeling. What could it look like and what choices do we have in front of us and what policies may inform that? So we're going on a trajectory and working together. It's also an opportunity for us to take a look at the economic and employment impacts, energy burden, affordability, and many things that we need to take into consideration with this energy transition that's upon us. This is Kent. Yeah, please. Is energy burden the same as demand? It's not actually. So energy burden kind of refers more to affordability. And so it takes a look at what are the energy costs of households and says, I'm trying to remember what's the percentages? But what is the percentage that they're paying for their energy costs? Oay. And for many Oregonians, it's very high. They have a greater burden. And there's, looking at that household, there's transportation burdens. So the cost transportation, as well as the burden for their electricity, natural gas, or their fue bills, it's important for us to take a look at that one, to look at disparity, because if you look at rural Oregonians or urban Oregonians, there big disparities there. We look at, for transportation, larger vehicle miles traveled. For a lot of people. L in rural areas, they have to travel a lot more. They might have higher transportation costs. Are there opportunities for us to address that and take that into consideration if we're going to make choices on the fuels that we have, that people have access to? You know, all of a sudd, are we making things that aren't affordable or we're increasing the energy burden for a lot of the communities within the state, it's something that we really need to take into account we're making some of these choices. Thank you. Yes, of course. Okay, next slide, please. So the energy strategy itself, we broke up into three parts. So the energy strategy will have some policy objectives. And so we want to basically create kind of a summary of what we've, what we found out when we do our energy modeling, the pathways that we took a look at the different options, and we'll talk about kind of those different scenarios in a bit, description of how we work with stakeholders. So it's going to be critical for the success and energy strategy that we evolve a variety of different communities within Oregon, not just within the energy sector, which certainly we want involve the utilities and people directly working in energy, but we want to work with a variety of different communities so we can have those conversations, let's say, around affordability or energy burden. So make sure we're taking into account the changes or recommendations we make. Make sure they take into account the impact to all these communities within Oregon. And at the end, the goal will be to provide some policy recommendations to the legislature in the governor's office on what could put us on a trajectory to meet our goals and take into account equity in our energy future and energy transition. Okay, next slide, please. So within the technical analysis, we've hired a technical contractor, SETI, and they are going to do some energy modeling for us. And so we'll kind of talk through what that looks. I don't know about you, but I'm not as familiar with energy modeling as some, and it is really technical if we go to the next slide. But essentially we're going to create a baseline, kind of baseline course scenario where we are trying to get from",

        "text": " much. I really didn't come here to intending to do this, but I have first hand experience and have thought about this and we're like, this is financially more than we would ever make for a second on dry land. Weedat. But I'm like, I can't. I can't be the generation that puts something on our soil that damages it. I don't want to. I don't want to be that. I don't want to have. I don't want to make that mistake. Thank you, mister Myers. Thank you. Appreciate it. Anyone else in the audience wanting to testify tonight, come on forward. State your name and address please. Cam don't going any want talk about your grazings. Chris Roush, Rauch seven. 2967 Strawberry Lane, Lexington, Oregon. I represent North Lex Power and land and starvbation farms, so I may be the resident expert here becausee I do live in the middle of the wagon trail solar farm. They're out my front door, in my back door, and I've had another door to be out there too. So on the issue of fire, well, first thing I want to say, if you're a landned owner, get involved with your developer, which is what I do, I take the first step. We've had all these discussions about what they brought up tonight, actually, and we keep working on them all the time. As far as fire, at least on the development that's on our place at this moment, the land, the developer has more to worry about fire from me than I do from now. Bare ground doesn't burn, but I get wheat fields to rile around it, they'll burn. And we've had this discussion of future development, what to do of some things about fire breaks, erosion, gravel roads, things like that. We can get in more detail if you need to. The other thing was go all the fire grazing weeaveds. So we do work proactively on the weeds. Weeds aren't usually an issue. Unless you let grow stuff in there. Then yeah, they could become an issue. Then it comes with a two edged sword. If you have a bunch of grass in there, not only can weeds get in there, they may not if you're doing your job, but it also increases the fire risk on both sides of the fence set. Now, I'm not opposed to havingingraass into those things, but in the right circumstances, and I do have places to do that. But you can work your developer. Lastly, I say is as your resident expert, if you got questions, fine. Otherwise, let's build the son of a bitch and go. Okay. Thank you for your testimony. Anybody else in the room wishing to testifyay, let's. Nancy, could you check webex? Miss Kelly Hale has her hand raised. Miss Hale, I have unmuted your mic. You are ready to comment? Hi, thank you. First of all, I want to say thank you to the energy sighting council. My comments tonight are in support of wagon trail solar. My name is Kelly Hale. K e l l y. Last name Hale. Hale. And I am a co trustee with my brother Russell Kilkiny on the Kilknny trust. The first year of operation after dad's passing. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. The first year of operation after dad's passing in 2016, and we just have farm ground. We basically had no return on the investment. The ground is a very fine silty loom soil. We have no access to water. No will we have any access to water. The average yield in that area is close to 30 bushels to the acre. The price of wheat in 1975 was similar to what it is this year. Land values are roughly dollars an acre for our ground versus irrigated ground, which is roughly 12,000 an acre. The first year after the turbine installation gave us roughly a return on investment of about 15%. It allowed us to eat with acreage. As a matter of fact, we let our CRP contracts expire and that increased farmable ground on our property of another 700 acres. We've seen a net gain in production from our relationship with Nexterra. They have been extremely productive partners. They've paid to clean up our property. They're incredible stewards of the land. Also, they've been very good to Morrow county. They provided additional jobs and also sponsorships to local events. I just want to say thank you in advance for any support you might give to this project. Thank you, Miss Hale. Thank you. Let us go through the rest first. Nancy, any others on the webex? There are no other hands raised at this time. Why don't you check the phone then? I have no phone inss right now. Okay, make it quick. It concerns the money that we're talking about on OSU",

        "text": "All right. Good evening, everybody. Oh, I don't know if it's on. Am I on? Okay. Excuse me. It is now 06:00 so we're going to start our meeting tonight. First, I just want to thank everybody here in the room for coming to our meeting. My name is Kathleen Sloan. I'm a senior sighting analyst with the Department of Energy, the Oregon Department of Energy. The first thing I wanted to do was just go over a couple of overview slides, but first I wanted to do introduction. So I'm Kathleen Flo, citing analyst. To my right is Todd Cornettet. He is the secretary for the energy facility sititing council. He's also the siting division manager. And Nancy Hatch is our administrative assistant who is our technical wiz for all things, setting this up for our meeting. So thank you, Nancy. I have, Amrett is in the back. She is one of our new members of staff and she is a analyst as well. And then we have one council member from the energy facility siting council that decided to attend this meeting in person. And I'm going to introduce her. And that is Ann Byer, counciler and Byer. So thank you, Ann, for being here. And that is it for the department of energy side. I'm going to turn it over to the applicant team to introduce themselves. I'm Matt Hazard with IA power. I'm the project manager for summer. Hi, folks. Sam Littlefield. I'm executive vice president of development for IPA power. I oversee our project development u pipeline and u Matt is on, on my team. Um, we ultimately have 28, uh, project developers, land agents, and government regulatory affairs personnel that, that help us see through these complex but ultimately u important projects. So thank you very much for being here. Turn o. Hello. My name is afabjay. You can call me AJ. I work with Tetratech Environmental Consulting and I'm the project manager on this, you know, the environmental consulting side that helps write the application and. Hi there. My name is John Vanderse. I represent IPA with kind of permitting management environmental affairs, some of the study work that goes into the application for site certificate and just helping to manage kind of the complex permitting process. Okay, thank you. Can you go to the next slide, Nancy? So we did our introductions. I'm going to do a little bit of an overview of the meeting itself and the flow of the meeting. I will also present on the sititing process for the state, the Department of Energy sititing process, and then I will turn it over to the applicant who will present on their proposed project, which is the summit ridge renewable energy facility. So this is a notice of intent that they've submitted with the department. It's beginning a whole process to obtain, apply for a site certificate. And then we try to keep that relatively brief, my presentation and their presentation, so that we can get to the public comment period in the meeting. Which is the purpose of us having this meeting, is to provide information and allow the public opportunity to ask questions, make comments, and, and I'll talk more about the comment period in a minute. And next slide. And I guess I would just say we asked that you hold your comments and questions until we get to the comment period. Okay, so this is an informational meeting. It is for the purpose of informing the public about this notice of intent to apply for a site certificate for this new proposed facility. We call it an NOI for short. So if I switch to acronyms, that's what I'm talking about. I'll try not to do that. It's important because the of the site that it be clear that this is not a contested case hearing. The participation in this meeting is not required to preserve issues in a contested case that comes later on in the application process. And like I said, we're asking it to hold questions and comments till we open up the comment period and the meet at the end of the presentation. And we just ask that people be respectful. Everybody's trying to do their jobs, and we just ask that people not be disruptive or rude in our meeting. Okay, next slide. So, just wanted to clarify what this meeting is for and what this meeting is not. This is the public information meeting on the notice of intent to apply for a site certificate for a facility called the Summit Ridge Renewable Energy Facility. It is not about the summit Ridge wind farm project. And the notice of intent is really the first step in the FSEEC review process. And I'll say FSEEC, that is an acronym for the Energy facility siting Council. They're the entity that has to review and approve a site certificate from the state for an energy facility that falls under their jurisdiction. And the applicant team? It is. The team is with Summit Ridge Wind, LLC and Apa power.",

        "text": " to feel free to weigh in. He's thought long and hard about this and maybe can talk a little bit about the effect that we expected to have on the energy facility siting council. One thing I'll say is, if he doesn't want to, that's fine. But one thing I'll kind of say before I turn it over to him is, you know, there's two ways to look at this, and you can go back to that slide that had the table on it, if that's okay. There's two ways of looking at, there's, there's kind of two ways of looking at this. I think our perspective has been this is like f Sec losing some jurisdiction on Cing, and, and the way that the developers, proponents of the bill, which included the association of Oregon counties, talk about it is that it creates two pathways, and so a developer can choose to still go to fSEEC versus going to a county, or these larger projects will continue to go to f, the largest projects. So I'll kind of just leave it with that and then turn it over, if Secretary Cornet has anything to say. Christy, just a couple of add ons. Nothing really new in this build this. Everything that I'm going to talk about really kind of came out from 23 29, but probably bears a little bit of repeating. So you can see there's three columns. The reason is because under House Bill 23 29, projects that were currently under the jurisdiction of the county have to go through the count, county's conditionally use permit process and what other standards they have. When House Bill 23 29 passed, it created additional capacity. So those 23 29 projects that you can see the greater than but up to less than or equal to those have to do the county conditional use permit and additional legislative requirements under the bill. And Christy talked about under 3179, there was some additional language about decommissioning that would also apply to the 23 29 projects as well. So really just, there's a couple of different paths based upon the acreage size, even at the county level. So kind of a strange nuance, but just out of interest, the other thing that I will say is in this predated house Bill 23 29. But developers can opt into FSEEC even though it's less than FSEEC jurisdictional. That language was clarified a little bit. And then counties can also defer to fseec. There's sort of a nuance about when that can happen in some conversation or coordination with the developer. But theoretically, there is an opt in for the developer and an opt in or an opt out for the county as well. So with that, this council has any questions specifically on this? Oh, and then I guess the last thing that I'll say is no emergency clause on the bill. So assuming signed by the governor, it would go into effect on January 1. So does anyone have any questions on this one? This is the bill that will have the most bearing on your work. Christsty. This is Marci. Council member buyer has a commenter question. Just to comment. We get a copy of this table? Yes, it would be really helpful just to have that shorthand. Absolutely. Thank you. And it sounds like just very much patterned after 23 or 32 29. Yeah, slight difference, but mostly the same. Okay. Just more acreage. Yes, but with the opt in, opt out provision. Thank you. Thank you. Ma chair. Yes. Remember Devlin. Yes. Just a couple questions. One, is this structured, or perhaps even the previous legislation structured so that if a proposed project is being approved at the county level, they have to meet the same criteria that we would have to state that a project would have to meet? Soer Devlin no, the answer is our process includes a lot more standards, more robust sort of analysis, and there's a lot of variation at the county level. So the way it works is most of these facilities would be located in exclusive farm use zone. Counties have the same base setup requirements established by LCDC. So they all have to meet those. Then they can choose to have additional requirements if they want. And there's a lot of variation in that county by county. And so some counties, if you compare certain standards at a county to FSex standards, yeah, some of them absolutely are comparable, but many are not. So on balance, I would say no, it is not the same thing. Are there protections within the statute for public input at the county level? That's very well defined in LCDC statutes and rules about notification and timing within that process. So that's been well established for a long time. And, madam chair, third question. Is there any perceived possibility of how this is structured that an applicant could simply divide a project into different pieces to avoid FEC consideration",

        "text": " by the federal agency, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. And as such, the state has a review authority only through the implementation of the state's federal Coastal Zone Management act, federal consistency Review authority. But the ESA project, together with the oral Windmap tool, can provide a user with an understanding about the potential conflicts or the potential benefits of a new marine reneable energy use out on the outer continental shelf of Oregon. So hello, I'm Wally Adams. I work for the Oregon Department of Energy and I was the lead for the citing procedures part of the ESA project. That's what I'm going to be talking about today. I think it's fair to say that facility sing procedures for renewable energy facilities can be confusing. You get local jurisdictions involved, the state gets involved. At times, federal government can be involved, the military even. So, that was really the purpose of putting together this procedures report is to try to provide an overview of those procedures at the different levels, really, what are the processes, what are the requirements, and to help point people in the right direction to get more information. So kind of leave a breadcrumb trail. So if you are developing a project, you can get some information from this procedures report, you can get more and more detailed information from those jurisdictions directly. And the use cases that we had in mind for this, the primary use cases is really for a developer, someone who's looking to develop a renewable energy project, but it could also be useful for a member of the public who's trying to figure out how to navigate this world. Maybe they have a project that's in their area that they're interested in. Even for people who work at agencies, you, if you're not in the renewable energy field, but somehow you get connected to one of these projects, this information may be helpful for you to understand better what some of the sititing procedures are. So with that overview, I'm going to then move to jump into the report itself and show you how it's structured and how to use this report hopefully to your advantage. So just the COVID page here. So make sure we're talking about the same thing. So the way that the report is organized is in sections based on different jurisdictions. So again, there's section for local, which is basically county procedures. There is also a section for state procedures, for federal procedures, and then last but not least, for military. And within each of these sections, we start by providing an overview of the information in here and kind of a text description of the processes. There will also be references within here to the applicable statutes or rules. Again, that breadcrumb idea that if you're trying to figure out how to cite a renewable energy facility, where would you look for more information and the specific rules that would govern that for that jurisdiction? We also within here provide process maps. So these are by and large citing processes. There's a flow and a sequence to these. And so with that in mind, we've developed process maps. Just a second, trying to make this a little bit bigger to illustrate what these processes are. These have been set up, as most people would call these swimlne process maps. So, you know, we have lanes for the different people who are involved in these processes and then what the steps are that they're involved in. So there's one of these basically for each of the major jurisdictional authorities. And you find these throughout the report. Stepping back for a moment, too, one of the things that you may find useful is on page ten, table one. This table gives you the jurisdictional thresholds for different types of projects and whether they fall under county jurisdiction or state energy facility siting council jurisdiction, or there's also this county HB 2329 process, which are these projects fall within county jurisdiction, but they have some additional requirements that are specified in statute for what counties have to do when they review these kind of intermediate size projects. Beyond that, just a couple of other things I wanted to point out about this. So within the report, there are call outs in different sections just to give a little more information on different other elements that are related to renewable energy. So, for example, this one that I just brought up has to do with battery storage and what requirements may or may not apply here. There is also information in here about offshore processes. And I'm just pulling up one of the process maps that we have in here for the Department of State Lands, their permitting process for marine hydrokinetic projects and state waters. We don't do a deep dive on offshore within this report and not really within therea project in general. But again we do give you some information here and kind of provide those breadcrumbs again where you can go for additional information. I think the last thing I want to mention, and I'll stop sharing here as I do this is that we cover a lot of different processes, a lot of different jurisdictions within the citing procedures report. We're not",

        "text": " the land use review, Patrick talked about this on one of his slides, and, you know, if you remember the diagram, talked about sort of the two paths where there was a local land use path or the FSE Sec path. So the applicant, until they submit their preliminary application, has the ability to choose who's going to do the land use review. They can choose the local government to do the land use review, or they can choose FSEEC to do that review. In the notice of intent, the applicant has indicated that they are going to be seeking FEC to conduct the land use review as part of its consolidated review. And again, I've had that conversation with the local government, Lynn county as well. So they're aware of that. The applicant can change their mind at the prior to the preliminary application and choose the local land use path. So we'll still see whether they continue to want to do that. But as a result of them choosing the energy facility sitighting council to conduct a land use review, the Lynn county board of county commissioners must be appointed as a special advisory group. That's a statutory mandate. Next slide, please. So what that means for Lynn county is today? Yeah. Really? There's no other opportunity. That's why you'll see that there's really, the staff's recommendation is a single recommendation, and council's options are really one option. You don't have the ability to not appoint them as a special advisory group because that's a mandate in statute. I've already sent them a letter, had a couple phone calls, but I already sent them a letter giving them a heads up that that would be occurring during this council meeting and what their role is as a special advisory group. We'll be sending them a follow up letter after this, but just to reiterate, what is their role as a special advisory group? So at the notice of intent stage, we're going to be seeking any issues of concern. It'their, knowledge of the project location is certainly going to be a lot better than ours, and we want to know what issues of concern they have. If they were going to be conducting the review, what would their land use criteria? B, do they have any directly applicable comprehensive plan provisions? So that would be the applicable substantive criteria? Are there any data or studies that needed to be done or evaluated to determine compliance with the land use standards? What are their necessary permits? And then do they have any thoughts or ideas on the analysis area? So I don't have a particular slide. We do. Usually when we have the public information meeting is in the notice of intent dictates study area distances based upon certain issues or standard. So whether it's the site boundary or going out a half mile or 5 miles or 20 miles, under the notice of intent, the applicant is required to do desktop studies consistent with those study area distances. So those same issues and standards become have analysis area distances in the application. They typically are the same as the study area distances, but they don't have to be. They can be greater, they can be lesser than those study area distances. And so when we're seeking input from the public, from reviewing agencies, we want to know, do you have any concerns if it's a half mile study area, is there something at three quarters of a mile that you think is really significant? And therefore, we should establish the analysis area at three quarters of a mile versus a half a mile, for example. So that's why the analysis area is listed in, or analysis areas are listed in some of the information that we're seeking from them. And then throughout the process, during completeness review, you know, once we get that application or that preliminary application, we are going to seek the Lyn County's review of that to determine, did they submit everything that's needed for us to review and make findings? And then once we issue completeness, we again go back to them and try to fig ##ure out. You know, do they have any issues of concern? If they were going to put in conditions based upon their review, what would those conditions be? That helps inform us as staff in making the findings, the recommended findings and conditions that we put in the draft proposed order. Next slide, please. So, yeah, so that concludes, really, the overview of, of the project, the role of the special advisory group. And so our recommendation is staff, consistent with the statute, is to appoint the Lyn County Board of Commissioners as a special advisory group for any proceedings related to this project. So this would not just be the application, it would be any subsequent amendments to the application or the approved site certificate. Should counsel Ul to approve the site certificate in the future. Next slide, please. So with that, I will turn it over to coun council, I'happy to take any questions that you have. If not, you have. Again, one motion really is your limitation on that",

        "text": " David, you want to just introduce yourself real quick? Yeah. David Lawler, I'm the regional director for development at Nexterra Energy Resources and I'mad glad to be part of this public meeting. All right, thank you. And kind of how our slides are gonna run. It's gonna be kind of a big picture of who Nexterra is funneling down to more project specific details. If we could just go to the next slide, please. Right. So Wagon Trail Energy center is a subsidiary of Nexterra Energy Resources, and kind of our background is Nexterra energy resources are we are one of the world's largest generator of renewable energy from wind and solar and a l leader in battery storage technology. As you can see in the map, everything highlighted green are the provinces and states where we have operating assets and projects. And then to the right, the pie chart. That's kind of a breakdown of where our energy comes from. And then just a caveat, the 9% of purple, that's other. Most of that is from natural gas. All right, next slide, please. So kind of drilling down into Oregon U. This map kind of shows on a continuum of where projects are and kind of that we're all over the state, right. So everything you see in red is kind of an early stage development project. The orange is moving into late stage U, which is what wagon trail is now, and then the greener operating assets. So just want to show that, you know, we're not just in northeastern Oregon, we're all over the state as well. Next slide, please. All right. And so for our operating energy centers, we have three wind operating currently close to this project. We have Wheatriidge one, Wheat ridge two, and the soon to be Wheat ridge east. All wind projects operating in the MOR or Wheat ridge one and two are operating wheat ridge east. We'll move into construction later this year. Additionally, we have something that's kind of unique for the renewable energies and that's a trifecta. And that's also located with the Wheat Ridge wind facilities. We also have solar and energy storage in moreing as well. And we just kind of threw up some stats of kind of our investment in the community and in Oregon based on our capital and expenditure, our taxes, our landowner payments. Right. They're all big numbers, but the biggest thing we focus on is we like to be a part of the community, sponsor local events such as Hepner Rodeo was probably my favorite of this past year. Next slide, please. All right. And here's just kind of line item that brings in more detail of the maps I showed earlier and what I was kind of alluding to of the wheat ridgenewable energy facility one and two, and the Wheat Ridge renewable energy facility three. That's all co located in Morrow county. And then we're now this project wagon trail we're looking to co locate with those other renewable projects algh so now kind of what we're here for, the wagon trail solar project. It's going to be up to 500 solar and associated battery storage technology. Our site boundary is approximately 7450 acres, all located in Morrow county. And we expect the solar array footprint to be approximately 3600 acres within that total site boundary. We're going to be connecting to the same blue roid substation just north of Strawberry Lane. And we're going to be utilizing the Blue Ridge to more flat transmission line that already exists. So it'll be no additional infrastructure there. And then obviously a project besidesnna have a large construction team as well. Kind of a rough schedule that we wanted to put out for everybody so, like Chase said earlier, we're looking at getting the site certificate, you know, around summer of this year. And from there, we're going to be moving pretty quickly to commence construction, springtime of 2025 for phase one. So that'll be about half of the capacity. And then that construction will continue throughout the year, and we'll start up phase two construction in 2026, and that should finish out the total development of the project. And we do have a deadline of the end of 2030, but we think we're well ahead of that schedule based on the pace that we're moving now. Next slide. All right, so what is highlighted in purple is the actual site boundary, and then the black outline is a half mile buffer that is added that we use for our land use analysis specifically. You'll see that called out in exhibit k. We can go to the next slide. Thank you. And then I just wanted to show how all of our projects in the area kind of overlay and play out to just kind of show the co location of all the renewable infrastructure that we're building in Morrow county. So the yellow is the boundary for wagon Trail U. The purple, that's kind of overlaid the yellow boundary with the blue dots, that is the existing wheat ridge one",

Checking in. Morning, everybody. Good morning. It should be good. I've had that problem before, too. That, but it's streaming. All right. Okay, looks like we're ready to go. So I will call to order this meeting of the city of Salem climate Action Plan Committee for Monday, March 11, 2024. Present our boy later, Philips. Zal Philips and Gonzalez virtually, and I understand we'll have councilorwen at some point, so we will just go ahead and get started. We have also a staff here to be identified. We have a time for public comment, and we did receive one minitten public comment. We're just taking a moment to silence our phones, folks. Bear with us. All right, so we did get one public comment. You should have all have that in your packets. Do we have any members of the public want to address us verbally? All right, on to item three, which is approval of the January 8, 24 minutes. Did everyd have chance to look at them? Any issues with them? Any concerns? Do you need a motion to approve? I guess that one approval January 8 24 meeting, second question by Slator, second by Phillips, and further, further discussion. All those some paper say aye. A aye. Motceion carries. All right, item number four, charg for city control parking. Julianian, did you want to kick this off or do we want to go straight to our guests? Actually, we can just go straigh. All right, we have Shee and Sarah here, community planning and development. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for the opportunity to give you an update this morning on aid parking implementation plan in downtown Salem. First of all, I just want to make sure that I for managing expectations in the climate action plan, where it references parking as a parking as a priority project, it had two dollar signs, which would mean it was between 200 500,000 as a project cost, and it had an s for short timeline, and it would not be between 200 and 500,000 do in costs and it would be longer timeline. So I just want to make sure that in order to manage expectations, we're all on the same page as far as this, we weren't a part of this, but again, it's easily something that I can update you on. So for Sarah, and I've been here over 20 years. Sarah's been here over ten years. Twice implementation of paid parking has been approved and we do not have paid parking on street. We have many, many years of third party consultant work that recommends that we put a performance based system in downtown of which the implementation of that has not happened. So the implementation is extreme than you. Just for the record, we have councilor joining us. Thank you. So for us, the implementation piece is critical to the success of this. And so council did approve us moving forward with the implementation plan and since that we have been addressing those things that we can. So the first thing we needed to do was go to the riverfront or renewal plan and do a plan amendment so that we could add the payment of the technology as an eligible use with Riverfront dollars, of which we did sincem. We've also engaged consultants to do two different aspects for us. One to look at the financial analysis piece, but the bigger one is a communication, how we are going to engage the community, get their input on how they think this is going to affect them, their customers. And again, we've just started those meetings and so we have something that we can come back with. We will, but again, just wanted to let you know we are moving forward with that plan and we will keep going with it and let you know when there's strategic tasks that are being done and when a significant piece of the plan will be implemented. Can you detail a little bit more of those engagement sessions? What did those look like? What that, what's involved there? So we just had a second meeting with, again, a consultant that has a sub consultant who's doing the communication strategy. We have our first meeting with her next week. Next week. So unfortunately, I don't have any more than that. We're going to sit down. But I know you've been very consistent in a piece of it needs to be that engagement. And so that's a big piece. If you look at the scope we're going to be talking with her about, it's going to be coming up with those questions and who are partners that we need to make sure that we meet with early on. Because a big piece of it's going to be education. I'm sure part of",

I'm also joined by Christie split from our strategic engagement team and other folks that will stay in the background from our Odo team to help answer questions and help run run the webinar as well. We opened this first round of funding on March 15, making almost $19 million of federal funding available to Oregon's electric utilities for grid resilience projects. If you are with an electric utility, hopefully you've had time to review the information and documents and start an application. If you are a utility customer interested in following this program, we're glad you're here and we encourage you to engage with your utility to be part of the process. The main purpose today is to quickly get to your questions. But first I'll run through an overview of the program and highlight the application requirements, including where to find everything on our website. Again, thank you very much for being here. Here'a quick guide to some of the features in WebEx attendees are off camera and muted, but our host will be able to unmute you for questions on the right hand side of your screen. In the participants panel, you can click near your name to raise your hand. There is also a hand icon at the bottom of the Webex window in the reactions bar. Click that hand to indicate you would like to ask a question, and feel free to use the chat function to ask questions. Please send your chats to all panelists or to everyone so that all the odo staff can see it and help with responses. If you joined from a phone, press six to raise your hand. We should be able to unmute you from our end, but in case that doesn't work and you're on a phone, then you do. We'll try star three, but hopefully between Patricia, our host'help, and you on the phone will be able to do that. It's o it's being corrected. Star three is to raise your hand on your phone if you're here. If you hear from a phone, it doesn't look like the four participants we have so far are on their phone, so I'll let's keep going. We are recording today's webinar and we will post the recording to our website along with the presentation slides. Again, please put questions into the chat at any time, but please wait to speak until I finish this summary. I promise I will make it quick and we'll get to question and answers for the majority of our time. Christy yeah? Before you get going, to start, start with your presentation, or quick presentation, I should say. I think it'd be nice if folks could introduce themselves in the chat with what organization or utility they there with, just so we know who we're talking to. Okay, great. Thank you. And we'll ask that you do the same if you are going to speak and ask a question. That way, if you just give a quick introduction to yourself after you've been unmuted and asked to to proceed with your question. Thank you. All right, I'll start the summary now. This program is funded under the infrastructure investment and jobs act, also known as the bipartisan Infrastructure law, and will include five years of funding. This $18.9 million is the first the first two years of funding and we expect about $50 million federal dollars over the life of the program. So if the first round application deadline on June 14 won't work for you, there will be more opportunities. So please continue your project and application planning for a future round. We've set aside 40% of the funds for projects from small utilities, defining those as selling 4 million or less megawatt hours annually. The law requires a one third funding match of any sub grant award to the small utilities and large utilities must match 100% of any sub grant award. All of the application documents have been posted on our website since March 15, so hopefully you've had time to start and here and are here today with questions about those documents and other aspects of the process. Our application submission portal is still being developed, but is not needed to start your application. The portal will simply be a place to upload your completed application documents and to lock in your submission with a digital signature before the deadline. After the deadline, on June 14, we will start the application review and selection process. We plan to notify selected utilities in early October. The law and the US Department of Energy's implementation of the law created this grant program to provide utilities with money to improve the resilience of the electric grid and to encourage the selection and development of grid resilience projects that prioritize disadvantaged communities. Our first objective gets right to the resilience improvements by looking at how your projects will decrease the frequency and duration of grid disrupttions. The second objective is to see how and where projects improve good resilience to benefit disadvantaged communities. In this program, disadvantaged communities are defined and identified by the climate and economic justice",

        "text": ". O now I have a hand raised. I have a phone call. I'm going to go ahead and unmute your phone. You are unmuted. Do you hear me? Hello? Hear you? Okay. This is Irene Gilbert, 23 ten Adams Avenue, the grand, Oregon, and listening to the rule changes and updates that're going to occur. I think it is important to look at rules fairly frequently. And one thing I'd like to comment on, just in terms of rules in general, and that is FSAC does have, according to the statute, their role is to protect the citizens and the natural resources of the state. And I think that rulemaking should reflect that. And part of that should be considering the cost to the Oregon citizens. If you, when you're looking at rules, require rules that are clear, provide the same treatment for all developers. It will go a long ways in helping to meet that the goal of FSAC. I have found that when rules, rules are flexible and, and developers are giving what I would call a deal on mitigation or any kind of requirements. What it amounts to is someone pays, and if developers are not paying their fair share, it's going to fall on electric users, citizens and the agencies in the state. What is given is that mitigation is never going to leave citizens or resources whole. And I can give you an example for, well, for Idaho power, there were arguments made about how they should not have to pay the same bond amount as other groups because it would affect the rates to their customers and they were never going to default. Now, since that decision, Idaho Power's credit rating has fallen into just above junk bonds. And part of the thing that really is somewhat irritating to me is Idaho power has gone now to the PUC. And when I looked at, I calculated the cost currently for Idaho powers customers in Idaho and those in Oregon for 100, well, 1250 power per month. And the cost for an Idaho power customer in Idaho for a year was $1,320. The cost for an Oregon customer is $1,390. Now, the Idaho PUC just considered a request for rate increase and the request was for 8.6% increase for their Idaho customers. Idaho power was granted 4.25% increase. But then they have also in December, requested a rate increase for the Oregon customers, which represents roughly 100,000 people in Mal here and Baker county. And the requests for increase is for 19.28% for their Oregon customers. The request, for instance, just to give you an idea of what that looks like for irrigators in Idaho, the request reflected an 11.7% increase, which they didn't get that much, but that's what they asked for. For Oregon, they're requesting over 35% increase in the cost for Oregon'irrigation customers. So I really think that when you hear arguments that, oh gosh, it's going to affect our customers, I think a better approach is just to say we treat our energy developers the same in Oregon and it's not reflected in, there's no guarantee when, when a developer is able to avoid mitigation or avoid, you know, any kind of rule or sort of sidestep the full requirements. There's nothing that says that that's going to reflect in a reduced rate to customers. And I think the example that I just did gives you a really clear idea of why it's not. It doesn't benefit anybody to shortcut your rules or to give a developer a deal. It still comes with back that somebody is going to pay. And so when you do these rules, I would really like to see some more or less black and white. You know, this is what we require of develop. We don't care who you are, you're still subject to the same rules. And I see way too many exceptions and reinterpretations. And the more the rules say that there's an option or subject to further consideration, or all those kinds of avoidance, kinds of rule language, they really end up being abused in terms of the effect on the citizens and natural resources that supposedly are to be protected. That's my comment about the rules, and it really applies to all of the rules that you look at. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Gilbert. So this is chair Grail, and I just want to say that this comment period is about the recommended rulem making schedule that Mister Jackman had had proposed. And so if anyone has any comments about that, we want to take one last call for those. I'm looking at Nancy and she's indicating there is no one else who wishes to speak. So Tom, thank you for spending the morning with us and we will look forward to seeing you a lot this year. And I'll ask Mister Cornet if he has anything else to say to close out this agenda item. Thank you, madam Chair. Just that it's an action",

That's a nice round number. So we will reconvene. And if there's anybody in the audience that wishes to address council tonight during public comment time, the yellow card, you're on the side and you've got a few minutes to do that. Thank you. Hillsboro City Council meeting. We appreciate those of you who have joined us in person, as well as those who are online or watching via TVC TV. Would you please join me with our pledge of allegiance? I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you. May we have a roll call? Mayor Callaway? Here. Councillor Martin? Here. Councillor van Bevren? Here. Councillor Pace? Here. Councillor Sinclair? Here. Councillor Alcare? Here. Councillor Sanchez Rouletto is absent and she is excused. So we have a couple of presentations and appointments. The first proclamation is for disability pride month and the second is for parks and recreation month. And I have invited Councillor van Bevern to read and present the proclamation for Disability Pride Month and Councillor pace to read the proclamation for parks and Rechmont. And I just want to say, you know, the impact of Dave Miletich still resonates and will continue to have a long presence in our community for years to come. And, you know, the fact that these two proclamations are both together tonight is very fitting because of the work that Dave did to support all people, whether it was in, whether it was in employment or whether it was at, you know, 50 Hidden Creek Community center and park and Earl the friendly giant. And so I just encourage you, as you hear the proclamations to just remember Dave, who was such a leader, and this is an important part of our city culture, but truly an important part of his legacy. And with that, I'll turn it over to Councillor Van Bevern. Thank you. Thank you, Mayor, I'd like to invite Jessica Starr, City Pillsborough adaptive inclusive recreation supervisor, to the podium helping with this presentation. So we're celebrating Disability pride Month, and I understand that there are a number of people here in support of that ish, that proclamation. So will you please stand so we can recognize you? So whereas disability pride month is celebrated in July to commemorate the passing of the American with Disabilities Act, Ada, which was signed into law on July 26, 1990, and was a historic milestone in advancing disability, people with disabilities and civil rights, the purpose of the disability pride Month is to honor and acknowledge the experiences, history, strengths and achievements of people with disabilities. Whereas over one in four individuals in the United States experience disability intersecting all races, ages, ethnicities, genders, socioeconomic status, religions and sexual orientations whereas disability is a diverse identity encompassing individuals with physical, intellectual, developmental, sensory, invisible, acquired disabilities and more whereas experiencing disability is a natural part of human diversity and people with disabilities have unique perspectives and lived experiences that enhance hills whereas disability pride Month is a time for people with disabilities to celebrate their authentic identity and for others to learn how to better be better allies to the disability community. Whereas the more disability pride month is celebrated, the more residents of Hillsboro can combat ableism, project negative perceptions, stigma and discrimination and whereas disability pride Month is an appropriate time to recognize Oregon's public policy accomplishments on behalf of people with disabilities and identify improvements to public policy that are still needed to fully include all of Oregon's residents. Now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Rick Van Bevern, representing Steve Calloway, mayor of City of Hillsboro, Oregon, do hereby proclaim the month of July to be disability Pride month. Thank you. Hello, everyone. Good evening. I was wondering if I could have Forrest Huntington, who is the chair of the Parks and Rec commission, come up and Rahim Harji, our deputy city manager, and he's the interim parks and rec director because he's got, you know, loads of time. Before I read the proclamation, I just want to say how much I personally love parks and rec, especially the parks that we get to enjoy in the city of Hillsboro. And Rahim was just talking about ARPA and all we've done, and it was something, I think it was something I was surprised at how critical parson, Rec and parks in general played a role during COVID because it was a place that our community members could go outside and be safe and who knew? Well, parks and rec knew. So let's get on with the proclamation. Whereas Hillsboro Parks and Recreation",

        "text": ". That's what. Go ahead and use the, what he calls the total termination provision that we provided. Thank you. Thank you. Just again, for clarification. I'd had people sign up for various parts of this, but they've been combined. We had a pardon. Yeah, we had 21 0902 z, which is the combined list. And we had 23 DM zero six, which are the same names as the combined list. Then 23 DM zero seven, which is 15 2.3. I'm sorry. And then DM zero 823, which is 15.2. So we're going to take all those together for comment. And at this point, I had John York. John and I also had. I think it's Lee Longfield, if Lee's here, if you want to come up and be ready, if you're going to speak. Okay. I'm sorry. Hi, my name is John York. I live at 6835 Southwest 93rd Street Road in Ocala in the countryside Farms subdivision. Can I ask a question for clarification? The conservation easement, what does that actually mean for countryside and for the developer? Is that because when in 21, at the original meeting, it was called a no touch buffer zone? And to me, a no touch is you can't do anything. You can't take down a bush, can't take down a tree, and now it's being called a conservation easement. So I'm trying to find out what the difference is. So to my knowledge, your buffer would still be a no touch buffer when they're talking about the 25 foot easement. That's a completely. That's the hiatus. That's the language that's being used for that. But nothing has changed for this commissioner to approve anything other than that hundred foot no touch. Okay. So even in the county's 25 foot, it's gonna be a no touch. Or are they allowed to do something in that? No, nobody's allowed to do anything in there except the county because it's the counties. Okay, thank you. Correct, mister Mc. We're allowed to do what we want to do. That's what I just said. If we put a conservation easement on, but if we put an easement on it, then we're good. You can't do development in a conservation easement. Okay, let me get a response from our county engineer trice, that you have any. I think the county attorney stated it well, if it's got a conservation easement, you cannot have development. You can define what can happen in a conservation easement if you wanted to, in the language such as dead tree removal versus dead trees being fallen and left for habitat. You can get into those types of definitions if you wish, but I don't foresee us, I mean, I don't foresee us keeping that. I think we're probably going to move it on along. Got to become abrogated in the future. Very good. Thank you. But remaining no touch. Mike Leonard. Mike, actually I'm here representing JB Ranch, the homeowners association. Not in legal terms, so I just have your name and address? Yes. Mike Leonard, 6352 Southwest 89th Street Road. I actually live in a complex, so there was just some questions that the residents have some concerns with. I'm not opposed, and I don't think anybody's opposed to the two terminations. It's just the amended portion which I believe was the DM 23. I think it was DM zero six. And that was. We already are dealing with some retention and detention pawn issues over in our complex and one of them was there's a detention area and retention area that looks like they're going to combine with Oz over there. So I guess my question is, who's going to be responsible if those are combined? That's question one. Then the other one, I think was clarified and that was the two entrances coming off in 95th. It was some type of easement or right away prior to on Southwest 89th Place, that's the entrance, the back entrance to our complex, which is gated. So I guess apparently at one time they may have been landlocked or something. There is that's been used for some engineers and stuff to do some site surveys previously, but I believe now construction is coming in off the 95th. So it looks like it's going to be closed off, but we're not sure. And that's from the resident side. They want to know that then, because of the developers that were originally in there. And it's changed hands a couple of times. We're still dealing with some issues with clubhouse usage and some other stuff going on there that our legal team was working on. But we don't have answers yet. Those are our concerns. Thank you. Okay, that's all I had signed up. Is there anyone in the audience that wants to address any of these items? I got you in a minute. Anybody?",

        "text": " And I think this needs to be, I don't want to say firm enough, but strong enough in order to endure that kind of public struggle in. Yeah, makes a lot of sense. Yeah, I mean, I agree with both of you. I was going to mention the equity thing because going through that and how successful it was to look at the projects for the bond especially, and the whole incorporating elements of both the quantitative and qualitative tool. I need to go back and look at your slides again. This is a lot to digest really quickly in terms of bias, I mean, even the economic impacts versus lifestyle changes. And as you said, a lot of people realize what we need to do as long as somebody else is doing it. So, yeah, no other. Thanks. So again, not making a decision today, but just so I'm reiterating what I'm hearing. Is there a thought that anybody is more leaning towards having the climate ones applied or is the thought that what I was hearing was kind of more universally like anytime it can be applied Appl and that's for me. I think that climate change is underlying every single issue that city council faces, whether it's our unhoused crisis, to our transportation system, to our planning for our future. The underlying current of all of it is climate. And I think it should be agree, you name it. So what I heard, what I'kind of been hearing is that we like kind of a third option, something that kind of incorporates the best of both worlds. Yes, I will look into that. And I will. We would like perfection room. I was just going to share. This has not been torhip. This was fresh off offer conference. What? This is a great tool we be using. So I'know, quite a bit of vetding, but yeah, let's go ahead. Yeah's Gar. Very hot. Hot. Okay, so we are. Is that anybody have any heels on that one? Before we move on, what are the next steps? What I'm guessing it now needs to go to leadership. So you kind of get veing there. They do do some more work and then take it to leadership. Yeah, we'll be trying to develop a hybrid perfection, something that can go to le yourut team for additional betting and back. So we'll just get an update our next meeting. Greate that sous. Sounds good. I'really liked your example with how you approach that proposal. Thank incorporating both and I think that's the sort of thing we need to do. All right, so we're now on to strategy e zero one greeniumuc. Oh no, we just did that one. Sorry. Climate actual plan updates on theibility study. Thanks John, for staying on this long. So we recently finished the airportar feasibility study, and what I have here is one of the tables that they provided in the report, and based off of the payback period and a couple other factors, kind of the financially viable option is for solar covered parking. And then in addition to providing some energy benefits, it could also have improved resiliency if we pair it with battery storage or some type of microgrid technology. And then either from directly the solar panels or based on having the conduit infrastructure there, we could also incorporate EV charging. And that was kind of the main takeaways from that. John, did you have anything that you wanted to add? All right. Good morning, everyone. No, I think that that's a great summary. I mean, this is a pretty stark, you know, differentiation between ground based systems and roof mounted. One thing we are asking our consultants is to extend the study out just a little bit to include the former Hertz property that we did not own when the study was undertaken. So the assumption being, of course, that roof mounted in and covered parking over there would, would be the same. So hopefully we'll have a scope and a fee for that here this week. Ande, other than that, I don't think I have too much more to add. From a sort of business perspective, I like the idea of covered parking with solar panels. I know I've seen a lot of otherports with those because not only does it provide the climate impact and the ability to offset our energy use, which is a cost savings, but it also then provides a customer service piece, you know, where people can park undercover out of the rain and out of the sun. So it's kind of a win win there. But other than that, yeah, I don't think I have too much more to add. This is certainly not my area of expertise. So thank you, Juliana, for helping me peddle through all of this. And thank you for the committee to the committee, for those of you that help get the funding for this is really, really important. Thanks. I just. I wanted to say,",

        "text": " will try to be as inclusive as possible so that we can provide some useful information for policymakers. We'll also be looking at health impacts. So there's a, there's a tool called the US Environmental Protection Agencies Cobra model. It essentially looks at air quality and health and the link between the two so we can learn about what happens to air quality and what the impact is on public health. When we reduce internal combustion engine vehicles on roads or reduce biomass combustion, things like that, that would produce pollutants that this model can measure. So we'll be looking at that. And we're also considering how to consider the geographic differences and the kind of different economic and other differences across the state if we look even by county, for example. So we haven't figured out how exactly we're going to do this. It is another area that we're going to engage with folks about. But we kind of recognize that this is really important that we need to consider the differences across Oregon. So we'll be doing that. We'll also be looking at things like community benefits. So kind of building on existing discussions in Oregon, it's not just about cost. It's also about the benefits that can come from some of these measures. So one example is, you know, there are co benefits in terms of resilience of things like weatherization, pv panels and batteries. Right. So kind of thinking through those things and how they can benefit communities. And then we'll also be looking a bit at the economic and employment impacts of different pathways if we go to the next slide. So I just want to emphasize something that Michael mentioned, which is that we'we're, not, we're not just making things up here. We are starting, we're grounding the analysis in existing policy, in existing utility integrated resource plans and clean energy plans, CPP compliance plans where reviewing Oregon energy policies with other agencies to make sure that we're fully aligned and that we're taking into account everything that's in place today. And we're also reviewing recent studies that have happened that provide data and information that we should be taking into account. And you saw that map of the region. So we're also reviewing regional plans like the Northwest Power and Conservation Council. They'll be kind of still in the relatively early stages of developing the next power plan, but there's a lot of work going into it. So we're in touch with them on that. And we're also going to consider the regional efforts that are happening. There's a lot happening right now on electricity markets, on resource adequacy, on transmission. So all of that, we're aware of it. We're taking it into account, and we're making sure that we're not contradicting anything that's already been decided that's in place, that we're considering that our starting point. So if we go to the next slide. So next we're going to talk a little bit about engagement opportunities. So I just wanted to pause to see if there are any questions on the, what we've presented so far on the kind of the modeling and the technical analysis. Councillor Devlin. Yeah. Thank you, Miss Chairman. Probably somewhat more of a comment than a question, Miss chairman, I could spend about the next 12 hours discussing this, but I'll use just about two minutes. As the speaker may know, I spent four years on the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, which I won't go into now, why it was created and what its role is in terms of long term planning for the four states of Oregon, Washington, Montana and Idaho. But just a couple of comments. One is that I would just encourage that you look as far beyond our borders as possible in terms of impacts and perhaps in terms of opportunities also because sometimes states tend to really stop their discussions at their borders. And I know you're not talking about that, but this is an area which you really can't do that. One of the areas that wasn't discussed as a resource and at the other council, what we constantly discuss is the importance of conservation. You've briefly described that, but in a sense, our power needs in the region would be much greater if it wasn't for the significant conservation efforts that we've had over the last several decades. Much different, and we're much better off. It's one of the reasons the hydropower and the conservation that clearly makes it possible, even under what we would believe our probable scenarios are to totally decarbonize the electric provision in the region by the years required by various states. The other thing is that I would hope you'd look at. You mentioned this briefly, but part of it is not just how many transmission facilities or resources we have, but how they're managed. And there are some significant questions about how our existing transmission resources are managed. Also, there's significant questions about how our production resources are managed. I think the other thing here is that it's a very hard area to plan out. I mean, the Northwest Power Council is a 20 year scenario focusing on six years. It's a very hard area to plan out, particularly given changes in technology. And the last",

We received a fair number of comments based on our own evaluation of the notice of intent as well as the comments. We issued the project order, which is the, you know, list of standards and requirements that the applicant has to submit. The applicant is currently working on their application. We should be receiving it relatively soon, within the next couple of months is what we understand. So it is coming soon, but even then, we won't have a public comment period until we issue the draft prop post order. So we're still a ways out from having the next public comment period. This is chair Grail. I think the one thing that you can, you know, there is an opportunity to acknowledge the work that has been done around communication. And even though they've been a little misguided and when they could apply, it does show that people are paying attention. And so the importance of us continuing the way we have been and always looking to do better is shouldn't be lost in all that. Yeah. And I think this is what, well, you know, obviously there's going to be a lot of interest in this project and we want to do as much as we can to, you know, not just orient people to the kind of proper way to do it, but to educate them. You know, what I didn't mention is I actually had a phone call from, from somebody who was trying to find councilmeer buyer's email address. And I let her know politely that, no, I'm not going to be providing you that, but I pivoted to how our process works. What can we do to help you better? Prepare to review the application, review our draft proposed order, and provide substantive comments that potentially could influence the council member'decision. So it was a good pivot. I had a very good conversation with her, talked to her for about a half an hour. She definitely was appreciative of that and indicated that she would be, you know, getting back to me in the near future for probably thoughts and ideas on, you know, how to better understand our process. So that's essentially what we try to do, but it is to try to limit people trying to influence you outside of the correct ways within our process. So just a question with respect to what Patrick. Oh, Cindy conded, for the record, a question with respect to what Patrick mentioned. So do we have to do anything now to specifically exclude, to acknowledge what Patrick setting. Support that position, or. I'm actually writing a note to myself right now. I'm going to look into this issue and I can get back to you as to what steps we might need to take in order to make clear. Again, I have not researched this yet. How I think, how I would like to see it resolved is, as Todd has said, we have acknowledged that it's been received. So everyone is aware as well. The applicant is aware of it, but I don, I think it should be resolved right there. Nothing further is done with it. It is not part of the evidentiary record. It is not something that you consider as part of your decision making. That's how I think it should be resolved. But I need to do some research to see if this hasise arisen in other contexts and see if there's support for that. Thank you. Okay. Unless there's any other questions on that, I'll move on to the wagon trail solar project. So we had a public informational meeting on January 7. It was scheduled to be in Lexington, and in fact, it did partially happen in Lexington. The weather precluded us from going out there. So that was clearly not a good idea to drive during that time. But, you know, luckily there was some interest on the project, and the city council members had opened up the location where we were going to have it, which was basically the town hall. They hosted people who wanted to show up in person, and several people did show up in person, which was a nice opportunity. So, you know, while from the staff standpoint, it was a virtual meeting, it actually truly was a hybrid meeting. So Chase did a great job. Chase McRaay Walker project Leade did a great job on that. So just wanted to acknowledge that we did have the meeting. We had to adjust kind of within two days before the meeting. And I think, appropriately, we still held it, and I think it went very well. If councilmber Byer attended online, if you had any thoughts. Sure. Thank you. First, kudos to staff for making that happen. Wow. Because there was a forum for people who wanted to attend. One thing that I noticed that, that Chase did and shout out to",

So I guess the next item, then, is the wagon trail solar. It's a continuation of the council review of the draft proposed order. This is an information item, and Chase McVeay Walker, a senior citing policy analyst, will walk us through this one floor is yours, Chase. Thank you. Very much. Chair, how can everybody hear me? All right. Yes. Okay, great. Thank you, council member. Chalk to. I appreciate it. And tom, let me share my screen. Chair, how can you give me a thumbs up if you can see my slide presentation? Okay, we got. Thank you very much. Well, good morning, chair. How vice chair Condon? Members of the council, for the record, my name is Chase McBigh Walker'm a senior signing analyst here at the Oregon Department of Energy and today's agenda item B is, as chair Howe just stated, a continuation of council's review of the draft proposed order for the wagon trail solar application for site certificate. This is going to be the structure of my presentation today. I will provide a summary of the proposed facility and of the applicant, as well as the procedural history and walk through what's happened to date and go through a few standards where comments and issues were raised during are on the record of the DPO by public and reviewing agencies as well as council. And at any point in the presentation, should council members have any questions, please ask away. We'll see what we can do in getting you an answer. Okay, the Wagon Trail Solar project is a 500 megawatt solar photovoltaic energy facility proposed by the applicant, which is Wagon Trail Energy Center, LLC. Wagon Trail Energy Center, LLC as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC, the proposed facility site would be located entirely in north central Morrow county near Lexington, Oregon. Proposed, related and supporting facilityone components with this facility would include 500 lithium ion energy storage system to collector substations, a 34 a half kilot collection system, operations and maintenance buildings, 0.6 miles of a 230 kilovolt of transmission line, and four construction staging areas the proposed facility would permanently occupy. Can people still hear me and see my presentation? Okay, I got it. Yeah, it looks like your videos off but we can still hear you time. Okay, great. I got a pop up that says my camera is unable to connect. This facility would be would permanently occupy approximately 3600 acres of private, exclusive farm use zoned land located within a site boundary which is greater than the permanent impacts of 74 50 acres. This next slide I've because we're digital, I threw out some arrows to show you where each of these components are proposed to be located. So the site boundary in this figure is magenta Colored line. There's Met stations throughout the facility, O and M building inverter locations, many inverter locations. This is the 230 kv line 0.6 miles right in the middle of the proposed facility. There's an existing transmission line, BPA line running north south through the facility. Underground collection lines. The 34 and a half underground collection lines in this figure, which is a compilation of a couple different ones that I put together, there's a fence line, which is within the site boundary, and it's represented as a green line. Temporary laydown areas, battery energy storage system, project substations, there's access roads, and I guess that's all I was going to call now. Any questions thus far on facility configuration? Move on. I think you can. Okay. On to procedural history. On November 3, 2020, the department received a notice of intent for this facility, and then on June 11, 2021, the applicant submitted an amended notice of intent to address site boundary modifications. The department received the preliminary application for the site certificate on August 31, 2022, and in November 2022, February 2023, and December 2023, the department issued additional requests for information to the applicant. And then in December of last year, 2023. On December 22, the department determined the preliminary application to be complete, and on January 3 of this year, the applicant filed their complete application for site certificate. Oh, sorry. The department issued the DPO on May 7 of this year, 2024, which initiated a 31 day comment period. On May 30, Chair Howe conducted a public hearing on the DPO at the Port of Moro Riverfront center riverront room in Boardman, Oregon. And the record was kept open until June 10, and it was actually. And that was kept open for the public",

        "text": " as Jen mentioned, we have a portal open for folks to ponder these questions at your own time. But really some of the key questions we have is how can the coalition reach low income and disadvantaged communities? How can the coalition serve residents in manufactured housing? Should a financing product developed? Again, this might be used to increase the volume in the program. And then how can community organizations support and benefit from these program offerings? Again, there's no urgency to answer these questions. Today we have a q and a portal open where we hope to gather your feedback in the coming weeks. Moving on to multifamily here. The objective is to support solar installations for low income households and multifamily housing developments. And again, the idea is to utilize federal funds to increase the incentive stack and help bring these solar projects onto more of these multiily housing developments. And again, we're able to leverage energy trust of Oregon and Oregon solar and storage rebate programs to both bring state funding to the incentive stack, but also to minimize the administrative burden. And we also see in the multifamily space that this is a good place to support storage installations where we may be able to provide backup power options for residents in multifamily housing units. And this backup power might be able to support a common space, heating, cooling, refrigerators, charging the types of services that are most needed when the power does go out. And so we would like to bring that energy resilience into the multifamily space. We have programs that do it in single family, but for the federal funds, we just get a lot more bang for the buck doing storage in multifamily, which is why we would like to do it in this program to really stretch those federal funds for storage. And so again, here's how it would kind of look where we have a rooftop solar program and that would deliver bill savings to the residents of multifily houses. And then finally, and also on battery storage for energy resilience. And that brings us to some questions. And the first one is, how can the coalition ensure that the benefits from a solar and storage installation are passed on to the residents of a multifamily housing unit and not just the owner? And we have several developers in Oregon that have already done this successfully. And we think that we can get this built into a program so that we have a prerequisite that anyone participating is passing these benefits ono the residents and not just the owner. And of course, this is another reason why we like battery storage in multifamily, is that those benefits automatically ask to the residents of the building because they're available as backup power in the event of a power outage. And so it's a way to ensure positive benefits. Right. To the residents. Again, a similar question here, how can the coalition reach low income and disadvantaged communities? Should a financing product be developed? And how can community organizations support and benefit from the program offerings? So that's the concept for multifamily. And I would like to just, Rob, we have a question in the chat. Sure. And if someone could read that I don't actually have easy access, multi family vendors leverage meter aggregation and only in ious. That's a good question. So the question is related to how a solar installation might be essentially spread across a multifamily housing unit, where a lot of cases, these multifamily housing developments have very minimal common loads for a solar installation to work on. And so if you can aggregate the meters from all of the residents, you bring a lot more load to the site for a solar project to be able to support. And this is one of the sort of technical questions around multifamily and solar that our, you know, developers are already facing. And so we certainly will be looking at this. And as mentioned, in IOU territories, we have some meter aggregation programs that have already been implemented, and it may be that we can come up with a program offering for investor owned utilities. For consumer owned utilities, meter aggregation is a matter for board or city council or other governing body approval. And so what we would like to do is develop a program that has the flexibility to support projects in any utility service territory and hope that the meter aggregation is one of those items that can be worked out with the developer utility partnership that's put together for these projects. But it's a really good question and one of the challenges of solar on multifamily developments. So does that answer the question? And I guess we can confir. Yes, that does answer it. Okay, great. So this slide is just a very brief thumbnail view of the two community solar programs that we're proposing. And it's brief because we will have energy trust of Oregon and Bonneville Environmental foundation presenting in much greater detail in the coming slides of what's proposed for these programs. But again, our objective is to support projects in the Oregon community solar program, and that's the existing program that is already underway. And we would do this by partnering with Energy Trust, utilizing",

        "text": " this. That is entirely what our process is about. You may not agree with the laws, but we do have the laws. We have statutes. We have rules. That is exactly what the Oregon Department of Energy, or at least my division, is here to do, is to ensure that whatever they submit is consistent with the requirements of the energy facility siting council. And if we recommend approval to the council, it's because we believe they have provided enough evidence in the process to meet the requirement. So our process is all about the law. And again, that's exactly what we're doing here today, is to try to convey that to you so you understand what those requirements and standards are. So if you want to continue to track this project and comment, you understand what those are and what they're going to be held to. And so, again, whether you understand that today or that starts to kind of become more clear in the future, please continue to participate. Chase and I are always going to be around if you've got questions, but it has absolutely has to be consistent with the law. To add to that, we did take a lot of notes, especially went the meeting with farm Bureau, and one of those was to continue outreach to the locals and have more meetings. So we did meet with various cities, try to get in contact with them to see whether or not that's something they would allow us to do, to hold town halls outside of the FSEEC process and requirements. So we do want to continue to do that, whether it's at another city in a public space, or even if we had to rent out some type of venue. That is something me and my team are actively trying to do. So we can, you know, homeowners within a certain range. So I'm going to cut people off. Please don't kind of raise questions. We have a lot of people online, they can't hear the questions in the back and forth. So we are trying to actually find more venues to do public outreach to locals within the county, but various areas so we can get more comments from everyone. Chad Higgins and then Carl Witzig is next. Chad's first. We became friends by the fridge. Yeah, I looked for beer, but there wasn't any. I actually didn't plan on commenting tonight. I just wanted to come and see what the community thought, and I really appreciate the passion that everyone has brought. I can't believe how many people are here. I'm commenting because my name was brought up a few times and I'm not commenting to Utah or to you. Accomm comment to the folks here andce the young baby here. We do have ten years of data, I should say. My name is Chad Higgins. I am a farm kid. My family's homestead in New York state still stands. I own a farm in Lynn county, and I operate. And in my spare time, I'm a professor at Oregon State University, where I do research on maintaining agricultural land and production, even in the presence of solar cells. We have ten years of data on this. We're global leaders in this space. And if you want to know more, please reach out to me. I can do my best to explain my research. My biggest fear of my research, and I've said this many times, is that it's used as an en run around land use laws and because the whole point of what I do is to protect ag lands andect rural culture and the real way of life. So u but if you're interested and you want to see us drive a tractor through purpose built solar array, if you want to see us growing melons and tomatoes and even cannabis and berries and even grass seed. Grass, not grass seed right now, please come and visit us. I have an open house at our research facility the second Tuesday of every month. That's the next open house is going to be August 8 at 01:00 p.m. everyone here is invited. It's, it's, it's at the north will Laamet Research and Extension center in Aurora, Oregon, which is a bit up the highway from here. It's on Miley Road, and everyone is welcome to come and I can show you what we're doing. I can't let you drive a tractor through unless you go through the tractor training. But we do, we do get big equipment through, not the 30 foot header that they. That I heard mentioned. But we can get 25 foot headers through our array, no problem. So, yeah, I'm here. I'm a servant of the public. Thank you. Okay. Carl's proxy. I'm sorry. My name is Joanna Witig, and I'm kind of around this area. A couple of questions for you, M train. Why is the project so large? Just from an economic standpoint, it makes more sense to build a project of the size, especially with the need in the area. We were able to find enough landowners who",

We've learned since our last public hearing that USDE consider solar panels to be a part of a new electricity generation. So while in general microgrids are allowable, grant and match funds would not be able to pay for solar panels as part of a microgrid installation. Next slide, please. Federal funds will come with requirements that apply to the whole project. These are some of the provisions that potential sub reccipients may want to familiarize themselves with. Highlights include Davis Bacon act, the National Environmental Policy act, and Build America by America. OTA will provide pre application technical assistance on these topics as appropriate, and our resources allow next slide, please. And now I'd like to hand it over to Rob Del Mar. There we go. Good morning all. My name is Rob Delr and I'm a senior policy analyst with Oregon Department of Energy. I'd like to go over some of the preliminary program design features that we've got in the program, and here we see the high level objectives of the proposed grid resilience program, and these align with what we've described in the narrative. And first, we want to focus on making investments in natural hazard mitigation projects. And you may recall from the public hearing last August that we originally planned to focus solely on wildfire in year one. We've since had a chance to communicate with more utilities and found that in many service territories, hazards such as wind and snow and ice storms actually rank higher than wildfire as a highest risk to the utility. Next is community benefits and equity. And we really want to maximize equity by supporting projects that provide benefit to disadvantaged communities. Third, maximizing community benefits, we want to support investments in projects that are ready to go and can deliver immediate community benefits. And in addition to expediency, we're looking for feedback on how community benefits should be defined and demonstrated, and how to evaluate these benefits, and how to evaluate whether or not a a project is really ready to go. And finally, we want to engage with stakeholders throughout this project to design objectives, metrics and criteria to guide implementation of future years of funding. So years three through five we will be applying for in the future. And we want to work with all of you to ensure that we have a program that continues to work. Stakeholders as evily mentioned earlier, Oregon's formula allocation of funds is expected to be just shy of $10 million per year for a total program funding of approximately 50 million over five years. In the first allocation, we expect about 19.9 million, which represents the first two years of funding. There is a 5% limitation on these funds that describes that at least 95% of funds are to be made available as grants to eligible entities and sub reccipients. And the remaining funds, the 5%, can be used to support program administration, information sharing and technical assistance. We also have a small utility set aside. The funding actually requires that a minimum amount of grant funds be made available to small utilities equal to no less than the percentage of customers served by those utilities. And so in Oregon, based on the numbers, this minimum would be 25%. That's the number of customers that are served by small utilities in Oregon. But we propose rounding that number up to 30% so that we can exceed the federal compliance requirements. And you may recall that we proposed a 40% carve out in the public hearing last August. And since that time we've gotten some guidance from USDE, which caused us to move umatil and electric co op into the large utility category. And that affects the split between the large and small utilities because they have more than 10% of the state's load, their sales. So even though we've reduced the percentage of the carve out for small utilities, we've also proposed increasing the maximum award ss for small utilities. And this is because our initial budget is about twice what we were expecting in August. And this will be spelled out in more detail in the coming slides. I believe we have a question. We do, yes, Jennifer Jolly has a question. Linda, can you go ahead and unmute? Jennifer, please go ahead. I didn't know if. Are you taking feedback on the proposal today or are you just expl. Explaining it? We're definitely taking feedback. Well, I would just say that the small utilities that I represent were really disappointed to see the reduction from 40% to 30% in the proposal for small utilities, given the number of utilities that are competing for this small pie. And so we'll be providing more written comments on that. But it seemed like the rationale that was given in August that the larger utilities were in a better position to compete for competitive grid resilience funding would still stand, and that, you know, any error in the calculation for youmatila being a large",

And so that's kind of a brief rundown, I'm not sure. Clay, do you have anything you want Toa add to that? Yeah, just one thing to wrap it up. First of all, that first part, application submission. This current round, the deadline is February 15 at 05:00 p.m. and each round stands on its own. So we compete because the rules allow the program to make adjustments and changes between each round. And so always read the opportunity announcements. Read the rules in the application. Read our user guide because there are differences from round two than there were in round one. So pretend like it's a brand new application in effect, if you're coming from round one. We also recommend that before you start an online application, and even before you watch the rest of these videos, it gets into more details on the application questions and scoring criteria is that you first thoroughly review the opportunity announcements that fit your project and the application user guide that's posted on our website, and that you take that information and you spend some time offline, either creating your project or, if your project is already set, writing your application a little bit and gathering your information before you even bother starting the online application. Then watch these videos because we give some really good clarifying information where you see overlap between sections in the application and the question. Our follow on videos will help you decipher some of that. Then when you're done with all that and you feel like you've got all your information gathered, maybe you'even started writing some answers based on the user guide then you're ready to open up an online application and start putting in that information on the online portal to complete and submit an application. That's just our recommendation. Thank you. Yeah, that's a great advice, Clay. And even if you were a prior applicant and you're coming back in to resubmit that project for this second round, we still recommend going through this entire process, reading that documentation over again, making sure you're double checking that they're on the application changes and new requirements within the application. So that's all excellent information. And I'll just. Because it is very important, I'll reconfirm what Clay started with that. For this second opportunity round. The deadline to submit your application is on February 15 at 05:00 p.m. and with that, we just want to always remind everyone that if you have a question or have some comments, please get in touch with us at community Dot grants, energy dot, Oregon dot Gov dot. And with that, justnna say thank you for joining us and we look forward to, we look forward to seeing you in the subsequent recorded videos for your project.",

        "text": " I'll ever know. But sheep are not going to just sit out there and graze all here. If you guys actually had went to that piece of property out there, maybe you have spend as farmers every day. Every day. What they don't eat is the me and what doesn't going to quite we get that come through and pick our windows up for mile am I working ground going to screw with solar panels? I mean, so I can answer a little bit of it. Like any non farm use, you're aware of that as anybody who wass paring or agricultural p or non farm, they have to sign a, you know, essentially a right to farm sort of requirement within the deed records of that property. So they can't complain. You know, if you're engaging in your regular agricultural project or practices and those impact their use, you have that right. That is, you know, if that's not already on the deed records of the property that they're leasing, it will be. So that's one thing. But again, I'll go back to it. That's exactly why we're here. We want to hear what those potential impacts could be on you because that's what we'ren toa evaluate. That's what we're going to tell them to look at and provide in their application. And that's part of what we're going to evaluate when we're looking at that land use standard on what are the impacts to agriculture when we're doing that review. I wasn't going to say anything. I was m just going to sit back and be neutral because quite honestly I'm very opinionated individual that could launch into who knows what at this moment. But truth the matter is I don't disagree with what you're doing. I'm worried about the consequences. Like I said, for me, I'm going to speak strictly for me and the people that aren't participating in the program. How are you going to take care of us when there is complications and problems? I mean, I know that that sounds a little harsh, but the truth is we make our living off the land. You don't. We understand how this works, you know, and I'll move on because I'm digressing wetlands. How are we doing with wetlands? Because that area is full of wetlands out there. I mean, don t. I mean, it's flooded half the year. Is there administrative rules that allow you to build on wetlands when the rest of us camp't? Well, I can answer that as well. There are requirements for wetlands. We have a standard related to wetlands. We work with the Department of State Lands to do wetland delineation. And if they're going to impact wetlands, they have to propose what that impact is going to be. And if there are requirements for compensatory mitigation, they'll have to deal with that. But that's, again, the big question, or the big point is we're so early in the process. We, at least at the Oregon Department of Energy, don't know a lot of the answers to your questions. We think your questions are good. They're going to help us evaluate this. The applicant may have looked at it a lot more than we have at this point, but this is the kind of information that's helpful for us. I don't know. I don't know what they're going to impact in terms of wetlands, but that's a requirement that we have and we're going to look at it. One final comment and I'll go back to the 1200 or 114, 400 acres of weeds of what we're going to have because the sheep are going to be gone, you're going to be out there spraying like crazier, or we're going to be a fire. I mean, has anybody even thought of that? So when it comes to the sheep, I've said it before, I'm not an expert, but the idea isn't that I would, you know, buy a bunch of sheep and just have it grazed. My idea is to actually have a partnership with a local sheep grazer. I t understand that. But with no irrigation and no water, there's no feed for sheep. After, I don't know what, maybe the 1 June, 15 may, there's nothing so left with stubble out there. I mean, young man, you can't explain this away. You're talking to a guy that's probably forgotten more about farming than you'll ever know. I mean, I'm not trying to be arrogant here. I'm just saying this process is flawed because you've got administrative rules cramming things down people's throwat in the neighborhood that does not want it. You know, the part that got me up here, to be real honest with you sir, is the comment was made about this meeting during harvest. You know, I'm a farmer. I should be home cal min and wheat. I've got somebody else doing it and so does a lot of the other farmers here. The problem here is, I understand for a lack of betterdroom carpet bagggers coming into our neighborhood and taking control. You work for us. I mean",

        "text": " I hope that you can see how complicated it can be, the length of time, the expertise. It's a level of detail that we really shy away from in a draft, proposed order presentation, or final order presentation, because it would make it a four hour presentation. Justly can't ask that if you, but I think it is, it's something maybe we don't get to highlight that frequently. And the mitigation obligation for an FX site certificate is, you know, this times many so know that we're working very hard and rely on our reviewing agencies to help us. And just thank you to Kate and Jordan. Thank you so much, Jordan, for being here. Really app thank you for your comments. Well, if there are no of secretary Cornet, sorry for the record talkt, I just want to kind of add on to what Sarah said and just to kind of to me this reiterates the complexity of the elements of our process, not because it's our process, because the things that get reviewed and evaluated and identified that either could be impacted or are impacted and how we deal with them. So, you know, I think this is, this presentation, you know, is a really good indication and I appreciate Jordan being here, appreciate his ability to work on this. You know, this makes our process a lot better. Obviously, we don't have the expertise to follow up on a lot of the really complex, detailed things that get dealt with our process. That's why our process is built the way it is. It's built to rely upon our sister agencies. It's, you know, built to rely upon local governments, tribal governments. You know, we have a consultant that we can go to. It takes a lot. It's not just, you know, we kind of crank through, we review it, we're done and we move on to the next one. This is still a relatively new project, but you heard the other ones, you know, that are 30 years old, you and we have the monitoring of these things through the life of the facility, which I think is incredibly valuable and important. But again, I think this presentation and the other one show, it takes a lot, it takes a lot to ensure that these projects are actually meeting the conditions that approval. And yeah, I just again, want to kind of make that point or reiterate that point because Sarah did already make that point. But just again, express appreciation to Jordan, the Orego Department of Agriculture, you know, and other agencies who aren't here today, thefw, you hear a lot about them, who were with them considerably, you know, and other agencies as well. So I think it's a good opportunity to highlight that well. So this is chair grill. I would encourage everyone to remember just the detail that we heard. When you hear people talk about why isn't it faster? I want to take it in a different way. This is what we've been charged with to protect the integrity of our state and all levels. There is no hurry up. If you hurry up, you're going to not get something that we, that we as a state of said we wanted. So that's where calls when christie referenced earlier today u some of the bills that have come out, some of the people that want faster, better, faster. This is not that eyelass commercial that we all watch with a cute little girl. Right. This is life changing permanent decision. So thank you, Kate and Jodan, for your efforts. We appreciate you being present and I'm sure we will hear from you again in the future. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks, council. Thank you. Thanks, council. One final comment on this species. The mo bench. We just had three projects this species, and there's going to be new applied science coming out, a results of this project that's kind of cool. And the fact that it's I the reason why is, you know, that it is a state listed threatened species, which means it's an important species to the state of Oregon. And so utilizing this process, our process to better advance the science, you know, I totally agree with that. But that the Bial report. Council. Council member. Chair. I and I just want to say, being relatively new council member and so much time devoted to applications and, you know, proposed orders and draft proposed orders and going through that without this context is difficult. I mean, it has been very difficult. So these presentations today and Dwayne's compliant, you know, the eqU on the equipment side all really provide just f its foundation. And that staff has done a really good job of bringing a focus on it with respect to certainly existing projects, but it certainly informs thought process about up. Thank you. Before we start our next and final agenda item, I need to make a statement, but I'm going to look at Patrick and say that I'm",

        "text": " You may regret that you told me that. That's true. My question, you know, going back to and in our packet, I didn't have a copy of, you know, the financial request. I just had the priority strategies. And I guess I'm, I'm confused as to why expanding the use of parking pricing, you know, it seems to rate higher in the score than electrifying transit fleets because it seems to me that electrifying primate buses and smart down in Wilsonville and wherever else, you know, really would have a much bigger impact than expanding the use of parking pricing around Washington county. And I had a question, another question, you know, support res, weatherization and efficiency upgrade in existing and in new affordable housing. Well, shouldn't new affordable housing already have those efficiency upgrades in them so that we're not having to come back afterwards and doing those upgrades in new affordable housing? That to me just seems like, you know, low hanging fruit. So I'm just really mystified by, you know, the scores who judged and what the criteria was for the scores, you know, who scored it and everything else. In some ways, it feels like more of a priority for spending than it does a priority for reducing greenhouse gases. Wow. So great questions, mayor calller. I really appreciate this. So those screening criteria that are reflected in that final mem, I'm happy to follow up with more information about those. Those were developed by our consulting team and shared out with this climate partners forum over the course of two successive meetings. They were designed to reflect the criteria that EPA is putting in in the implementation grant applications. We wanted to align with the implementation grant criteria so that we could be telegraphing which projects were likely to be competitive when EPA opened up these implementation grants. It's definitely more art than science in some cases, because the implementation grant notice of funding opportunity and the evaluation criteria are not 100% clear. They didn't tell us exactly how to quantify this stuff. We had to make our best guesses with respect to what EPA was looking for. But one of the reasons why I think, and I don't have the members of the consulting team on the support me and get into all the details of that today, but one of the things I do know is that cost effectiveness of greenhouse gas reductions is a criterion for EPA, and that may be one reason why parking pricing shows up competitively, because generally parking pricing and involve some small startup costs, but you can recoup those costs. So it may be that it was scoring higher. And I think there's only a difference of a point or two there, not necessarily because it reduced more greenhouse gases, but because it did so at a significantly lower cost. And as far as new housing, that's actually a really great question. New housing is currently not required to be as energy efficient as it could be. The reason that I've heard for that is because we have expensive land in our region and we have a housing crisis, and it's really important to get more units out there to make sure that housing is affordable, especially affordable units. There's a concern that if we place unfunded requirements on new affordable housing to also really get to the best energy efficiency standards, then it would ultimately result in less units being built un less being done to address the housing crisis in the region and so getting funding from EPA so that we don't have to put those costs of making a new development on developers allows us to get around those trade off and ensure that new units are more energy efficient without creating a risk that let fewer of those units will be produced. Thank you mat. I appreciate the explanations y answers. That was really helpful. Other questions I think we've got counsel Rosenthal with his hand up profess sor Rosetho than thank you chair Boinick. Just two questions. First of all, on that first list of the stakeholders, or I should say the committee, maybe I missed it, but I would think wash out would be somewhat involved since transportation is one of the big things. I don't remember seeing it, maybe I missed it. And then my other question is a little larger. In your second list that you presented of potential projects, you talked about expanding the opportunities for producing green energy, but my understanding is that we have some power grid limitations on doing that extensively. And I remember recently a visit to the PGE headquarters and one of the things that could be done would be expand their storage battery capacity so we can utilize more clean energy sources. Is that something that's being considered or is that something that could be applied as a grant? I'm just wondering where that stands. Do we need power grid? Power grid modifications? Okay, great. Thank you for these great questions. First of all, Washd is definitely on the list of partners that we invite to the forum, and in addition they sent staff to one of the forum meetings. But also I coordinate with my grant counterparts at Washot and",

        "text": " agency. So that last bullet there was energy program. That's what we're talking about. And that's going to support our ability to have a resilient and affordable energy system in this state. So you can see some really strong connectivity with our mission and our service. I think we can go to the next slide. So this slide is just a list that we put together of some principles. After the IIJA and the Infrastructure Reduction act past, we recognize that we would be receiving millions of dollars in funding to invest in clean energy, energy efficiency, resilience, among other important topics. And we held a series of public webinars. We had discussions with our energy advisory work groupoup. We got feedback online to basically develop these principles as a lens for our overall approach to federal funding. So I won't read all of these, but you'll see a focus on equity, including geographic diversity, commitment to coordinate with tral governments where possible, providing technical assistance to folks that want to apply for federal funds, a recognition that we need to do some cross agency partnerships. We work really closely with DEQ, with ODA, with DLCD and other agencies in the state, and we don't want to replicate their expertise. We just want to bring them on for the ride. And then finally, just to ensure that we're taking advantage of every high, high priority funding opportunity, but also ensuring that we have the resources and the ability to have quality work that comes from it. And we're making every available dollar go to its best use. And so, you know, this is what we apply to every federal funding opportunity. And hopefully through the conversation today, you'll see that these very principles are in our discussion today as well. But, yeah, thanks for being here and I'll pass it back to the team. All right, so we'd love to do right now just to get a sense of who's in the room, as if we could go around and do a quick round robin of introductions with your name, your organization, what brings you to the session and what you're most interested in getting out of it. And then for those virtually, if you could answer those questions in the chat, we'll go through and read them out loud at the end as well. So, Rob, if you don't mind, why don't we start with you again. Sure. Rob Delar. I'm a senior policy analyst with morn Department of Energy and I'm actually going to be the one who els to stand up this program. So that's what brings me to the table and the information I would most like to discuss is how we establish selection criteria to be able to identify the highest value projects in the program when we launch it. I'm love Davis. I'm a consultant and I'm doing research grant funding for the warm Frit Springs tribe and I'm just looking to get as much information as I can to help. Good morning, everyone. I'm Katie Tski with Hegerty Consulting. Hegrgerty is really honored to be supporting Odo with this initiative and it's privileged to meet all you this morning. Thank you for being here. And I introduced myself already. I'm Christristy Skington, but I am very excited to just be learning more about this funding, collecting all of the notes, the stakeholder feedback, really listening today and u trying to incorporate this into what the strategy is moving forward as well, Andy Fletcher, general manager of Columbia Basin Lib very a small cooperative in eastern Oregon, and I'm interested in the overall program and what it's going to end up looking like moving form and what the criteria is going to being spec making. So he good morning, I'm G and I from the Portland General Electric, I'm the infrastructure program director. I'm in charge of all grant funding applications and project development for PGE. I do work with TR here at Warm Springs on grant applications and also for all of our customers, and just see what the criteria is for the state resiliency funds. Michael Lofting, comp controller for Warm Springs Power and water Enterprises we're looking at grant funding for various projects on the Pelton ground Butte hydroelectric project, and with our 100% ownership in the re regulating dam generating facility. Thank you. Ruci Seier, Oregon Department of Energy Kathy Eli, I'm the general manager here at Warren PR Power Modern Enterprises. So we're really happy to have me here today, and so I'll second what Mike said, but we've also, through our tribal council, we've expanded our vision a bit for this enterprise. This enterprise is primarily responsible for the utility size efforts, but we also are helping the community because of limited resources. We have some of those here that we can deploy to get more of the community programs and such. So what's my most interested in discussing is that criteria and just how do you take advantage of all these opportunities? You know, are there priorities? Is there sort of a holistic effort to help us all keep track of all these so we don't miss any? So glad to be",

        "text": " so I'm just saying when people are responding to this, there's, there's probably no way that you've, that you can see like how knowledgeable is this person and how knowledgeable are people? We know more about some risks than other risks. Yeah, I would agree. Yeah, we have a collection. So the representation of folks, these could be folks that are with the government. These can be personal stories, they could be from private sectors. So we have a collection, you know, of folks that represent different organizations are just no organization specifically. So this can be based on personal experiences, it could be based on their education, any array of things. So I would agree we don't know each individual person's level of education. I would say specific to what the primary threats are. Give you another minute to wrap up these questions and then we'll move on to the next section. Since basically this is a tally of perception, not actual hazard exposure and vulnerability. Yeah, I would sayeah it cannot be considered actual hazard exposure and vulnerability. This isn't a study on the exposure. This is what the people have chosen to engage with us, what their experiences and primary concerns are. Okay, so we are now going to move on to our preliminary results for the risk assessment. We're going to start with the electricity subsector. And as a reminder, we have 41 utilities in the state and many of these utilities serve multiple regions. And so what we can do is look at each region and how many utilities can speak to that region and that can give us our sample size or n. In other words, how many utilities can actually fill out a survey specific to that region. And so we have the sample size summarized in this map. It ranges between seven on the low end, eleven on the high end. In the Willamette valley the sample size is eleven. And we had about 50% response rate from Digg, the utilities. So 20 of those 41 did fill out our survey. Important to note that the three ious did complete the survey for us. And so we have our actual sample size in this map with the pie charts. On the low end is four, high end is nine, which is in the Willamette Valley. So you guys on the higher end. And then here we have our final vulnerability rankings in the form of a matrix. So we have the regions across the top and the threats across the side. And I'm just going toa highlight a few key takeaways from this matrix. First of all, our electric utilities most often prioritize for threats. First was cyber attack. And then we had those three threats that we highlighted earlier that keep rising to the top. So wildfire, wind storm and winter storm. We have a number of threats highlighted here or outlined in boxes. These are on the higher end across the different regions, and they're largely driven by exposure and impacts. And so for the Willamette valley, you can see that for flood, wildfire and windstorm, relative to some of these other regions, your score for exposure and impact would have been higher. Portland metro drought, this one was driven largely by adaptive capacity. So from that you can deduce that your adaptive capacity was stronger relative to the Portland metro area, specific to drought. And then with the human cost threats. There are several things that I want to highlight for you. First of all, this feedback is really dominated by the smaller utilities. So while we did get surveys completed by the IOUS, they actually gave us no information, or very limited information, I should say, for human cause threats, for cyber attack and physical attack. So this is really strongly representative of the smaller utilities. These results, across these, the higher rankings are largely driven by exposure and impact. And you'll notice that there are four responses that are in bold and are underlined. They all have a value of two. They're in the eastern and Portland metro regions. And these scores are artificially low. So we actually got no feedback from any of the utilities related to potential impact of these human cost threats for those two regions. So had we had a value for impact, we know that the total score would have been higher. And so we know that those scores are lower than they would be. And then finally, you might notice that we have little variability across the regions for a given threat. So if you look at a specific threat, or, I'm sorry, if you look at a specific region and you can see that each of the threats, there's quite a bit of variability there, but across the region it's more consistent. And so what we can do is identify where the variability lies by digging into the nuances of the data a little bit more. And this is why I want to give you some information on adaptive capacity. So I'm going to walk you through how we structured adaptive capacity in the survey. Please don't be overwhelmed by this slide. You do",

That fund, 189 for public health, the active number now is 189-7030 and then for park parks, the active number account will be 433 35. Six. That's correct, yep. So the bottom line in the bottom of that page, in the budget document, it shows 20,507 80. Four FTE. The correct number is on the handout, which is 2442.63. So did you just give us the pages that changed? That's the only page that's changed. But we intended to print the entire FTE roster out as a duplicate. 431 is the only one that matter. We can reprint them for you if you'd like, the entire page or. What's important is this 431 page. We're good. I think we're good. The only other thing I need to verify the number under total health and human services and then the one after that in the published book, does the 555.66 stay the same? No, that is 431 on the handout, and 559 75 replaces 684 116. Thank you. We're going to go ahead and reprint the entire schedule because there's a couple pages in the back that the summaries didn't pick up that change, but I think will be important. So we'll just have a complete new set to give to you. That's the first document. The second document is, it's titled Washington County Exhibit A, may 17, 2020 24. It looks like a budgetary debits and credits. Looks like this. So this is a proposed amendment to the budget by staff. It's a technical amendment. It doesn't change the overall requested budget amount or proposed budget amount. It just moves some of the dollars between contingency and expense. ##endures this was discovered late and what? Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. These are the in the insurance funds premiums. These aren't claims. These are premiums. They are part of. These are just part of the expenditures. I don't know if it's premium or it's claim costs. Well, the parameraph at the bottom explains. Okay, doesn't say that proposed insurance term ye disability insurance payments, that $90,000 that doesn't tell you if it's premium or claiman payment is not specified. I would like to know if it's a premium, premium or claim or claim. Okay, let's be clear. We'll get that before. What's the payment for? We'll get that before we get to the approval. And when we go later in the budget process, do we need to get a motion on the table and then amend the motion to include that technical so the motion we can insert approve the budget as proposed plus the technical amendment presented? So we'll insert a three or four words into the motion. Got it. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. I think that was the extent of the handouts that I had. The letter will come back to later with the public hearing part I'm looking at. Miss Angie. Yeah. Let's reference the letter that's in front of you. And I apologize. I gave my letter to Miss Kyle. So member La for me being able to. Ohkay, thanks. We've got lettersion. I want to point out just what this letter speaks to. As the committee is aware, we are moving out public health and related functions out of the general fund. As we work through the budget process, there was discussion about and consideration should we have a contingency, fully funded contingency for that move. And I spoke to this earlier in our committee process and we did verify with our auditor that is not needed. Part of the concern is timing of state grants when revenues come in and expenditures. Staff will be monitoring this throughout the year. This is the same as parks, so those funds may run into a deficit during the calendar year. If there needs to be any kind of shoring. I am not a CPA or CFO, so my words shoring up of that fund, we will handle that through the budget supplemental process. That there may need to be like a one time transfer into that fund of general fund reserves to help make sure that the funds are whole at the end of the fiscal year. And we once again verified this, that this is an acceptable practice with our financial auditor. And I'd also like to note that the top of the letter says it's from the Washington County Public Health Advisory Council. So the last line in the signature block is it's not coming from our staff from health and Human Services public health division. I think that's an incorrect line in the signature. Chair Harrington, can you explain what the public Health Advisory council is compared to the Health and Human Services leadership team? So Washington County Health and Human Services Public Health Division is our staff from the public health division. Okay. The",

What they did do is tighten the reasons for denying contested cases on amendedd site certificate conditions and completely denied the opportunity for a contested case for multiple other individuals under the type b process. They also gave Odo the authority to decide whether to allow amendment requests to be processed under the type a process, which allowed people to at least request a contested case. However, the change has continued with the process. That means that all contested cases on amendments are being denied at any rate. So in the type b, the individuals couldn't even ask for or can't even askare contested cases. You well know. The result is that contested cases are denied for reasons such as lack of specificity, lack of documentation to support the issue being requested, a lack of fully describing the issue during the public comment period, etcetera, etcetera. As each of these new and improved reasons for denying access to contested cases has been used, the public has attempted to adhere to these new standards that they are being held to, but the changes in the requirements have meant for me and others is that we have resorted to basically documenting our cases in the document requesting a contested case so that there is some basis for appeal. Since the Oregon Supreme Court will only consider the case file when they do their reviews, and denying the public access to contested cases means there are no information from the public in the file supporting the requested contested cases. So it's sort of a catch 22. The requests that you are receiving include documents to make them available for appeal, as well as an introduction to the arguments for Odo and FSAC. The newest challenge is that Odo is doing one of two things. They are restating the contested case issue so that it fails to approximate the actual request that was made. Now, I've sat here and listened to council's description of contested case requests, and I quite honestly can't even recognize they ones that I've written myself. But anyway. Or the other thing that they do is they break down an issue into small segments which actually are only examples of action supporting the issue statement and they're supporting objections, then if something does go to a cont tested case, and here I'm talking about a new application that actually gets a contested case, they break down the issue, which is a single issue, into five, six, seven subues, and call those the contested case. Then when the case is heard, the developer objects to anything that goes beyond this narrow piece of an issue that has been stated as the contested case issue. So it denies the public a chance to actually present their entire issue. And, you know, for instance, re when someone, someone's arguing that, see, mitigation plans are not being addressed, byies say, like they were previous to a recent change, and the issue is whether or not odo should remove that opportunity for counties to have input. And the person lists four or five different instances where that opportunity for public input has been removed. It's not appropriate to say the issue is whether or not this mitigation plan should remove the opportunity for public. For the county to comment, whether or not this other mitigation plan should reclude the opportunity for the public. The issue is whether or not removing that opportunity is appropriate without notifying counties that their access to input on those mitigation plans has been removed. So that happens fairly frequently. Before you trust the summation of the contested case request provided to you by Odo and assumed that it accurately reflects the issue of the contested case request, I encourage you to actually read the comments or the request that's made. And I realized that at this point, those requests run, you know, 16 1720 pages because of the fact that we are being forced to include documents that we know will be necessary in order to appeal an issue, given the pretty much 100% assurance that our request for contested cases will be denied. So, you know, look at this, please look at the requests. Read what the public stated you're being told and what they're objecting to. While council members are not required to read the written comments, it seems to me that the only ethical way to perform your function as a council member is to do that, to take the initiative, to do that, and do your own evaluation, not rely on a third party and their interpretation of what the issues are. And just ask yourself, if you submitted this request for a contested case, would you be satisfied if the decision makers were relying entirely upon a 30 party'description of what your issue is? And I think",

        "text": " certificate will be granted. I know you have a question. We can go back to this later on. We can come back to this slide when we open Q and a okay, so next slide. So I did talk a little bit about reviewing agencies and special advisory groups and their role. I think that the important thing to realize is, you know, the special advisory group for this facility is Wasco county because they are the local government and they've been appointed as the special advisory group. The other reviewing agencies also have the opportunity to make recommendations. One of the key things that we look for is the description of the analysis area, what areas need to be included in the application review, and part of that is to identify the studies that may need to be conducted, any local ordinances or local government and other administrative rules that might need to be considered in the application and included, and also the identification of any required permits that might be required of the applicant in order to move forward with the facility. So I mentioned that we are a standards based project process, and this slide shows our 16 Cing standards. It is the burden of proof of the applicant to demonstrate that on the record they can meet each standard. It is the department's role to evaluate that evidence because we're an evidentiary process, and to consider all the comments received and determine whether or not the applicant has demonstrated that they can meet that standard. And then we make those recommendations to the F SEC, the council, who will evaluate all that, making their decision. Because we are at the notice of intent phase, we are seeking any type of comment that anyone wants to revise or provide. But it's important, if you do want to participate and comment in our process, that comments realize we are a standards based process. These standards apply to facilities. We have more literature on the table over there if you want to learn more about these standards. But these are the things that council has to consider with each of these standards when they consider whether or not to issue or deny or remand back an application for a site certificate. Okay. And in the notice of intent, we have mandatory study area distances that tie to these standards. And one of the things that we're consulting on is whether these need to be made bigger, smaller, based upon potential resources or concerns that reviewing agencies or the public may have, or our special advisory group. So each standard has its own kind of extent of what that study area is. This is for what had to be included in the notice of intent in the project order. These may change, they might get bigger, they might get smaller based upon available information, but it just gives you an overview of kind of like how we look at the site boundary, the resources and standards that we consider around that site boundary as we ask the applicant to prepare information to submit in their preliminary application. Okay, next slide. So as I noted before, the state citing process is consolidated review that pulls most permits, standards and requirements from local governments and state agencies into one process. And so for land use, the applicant has the option to have the land use review either be conducted by the local government, which would be Paco county, or to have consolidated into our state review and that notice of incent. The applicant has indicated they want to consolidate it within the state review at the time they submit their application. They have to commit. They can pick one or the other, but they can't change it once they've picked it in the application. And the land just as a consideration for this one, the land within the proposed site boundary is all zoned, a one Efu land. It's non irrigated and is currently used for growing winter wheat and grazing. Just if people were interested. Okay, next step. Next slide. So really quickly and then I'm going to turn it over to the applicant team. The notice of INTD is applying for a new new site certificate. A site certificate for a new proposed facility. It is going to have a 201 megawatt nameplate capacity at the point of interconnection, which is where it connects with the transmission line. And it's going to be siteed on approximately 4061 acres here in Waso county. It will have a wind generating component, it will also have a solar generating component and the solar array will be approximately 274 acres within a 474 acre fence solar area. They're proposing approximately 32 wind turbines with a maximum blade tip height of 648ft. Next slide. There are also related or supporting facilities that are proposed in the notice of intent includes a battery storage. What we call a be on would occupy up to ten acres and it would store up to 201 energy. There are other facility components such as a switching station, a collector step up substation. I pointed at the point of interconnect as intended or proposed to be with the Bonneville Power Boyd ridge switchyard. There will be above",

        "text": " comparable, but many are not. So on balance, I would say no, it is not the same thing. Are there protections within the statute for public input at the county level? That's very well defined in LCDC statutes and rules about notification and timing within that process. So that's been well established for a long time. And, madam chair, third question. Is there any perceived possibility of how this is structured that an applicant could simply divide a project into different pieces to avoid FEC consideration? Yeah, good question, council. Councilore Devlin. So several years ago, because we had seen that with wind projects, we, at the early stages of solar, created rules to hopefully prevent that from happening. So we have rules that essentially help to define when multiple single facilities are actually comb one larger combined facility. So we have rules that hopefully will prevent that from happening. Thank you. Thank you. Other questions? Comment, council member condon. Thank you. Just quickly. So that remedy, if you will, if a large company, parent company, has three different subsidiary companies and each applied separately, would those be considered as one under what you just talked about stacking up projects? It does talk about parent company. The process which the council would evaluate that I wouldn't say is incredibly black and white. There is variation. Projects could be in close proximity that really are unrelated and they could be owned by the same company or the same parent company, but they really are unrelated. So it's not just physical proximity. It's not just, is it the same parent company? It's a combination of variables that we would look at to come to a conclusion, at least to recommend to council whether we believe a staff that is a single facility. So those things can be quite complex. And so we designed the rules to take into account a lot of those variabilities. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, Christy, back to you. Or back to Todd? Todd, Sam, back to you. Great. Sounds good. So on this one, well, sort of stay tuned and see how it affects the work. And then moving on, I mentioned the citing table, an official name for a group that sometimes was over a hundred people talking about citing issues together. Last fall, there was a bill 3000 181. That is where the, it started out as a placeholder. That means a bill with not very much detail at all. There was an amendment with a ton of detail. That particular concept got moved to ways and means and then from there got amended down further into the work that you see here this past. And one of those mega bills I talked about, House Billill 3409, but this is the underlying content came from the conversation of House Bill 3181. And basically, just to kind of back up a little on the sititing table process, there were work groups and negotiations happening. I mentioned deadline day, which is the first, the bill for the date by which a bill has to move out of its chamber of origin. And that date is really very crucial for getting sort of things lined up. And this was coming together like a week before that deadline. It was all very late breaking. And somehow in that negotiation, there ended up being sort of different bills that were out there that were coming from. There was the bill from the table, but then there was these bills from the developers that included a lot of land use changes. There was a concept, I don't want to get too much into the weeds on this, but a concept that would have made it much easier to develop on exclusive farm, exclusive farm use land that was located near matter, no matter the value of it. It could have even been high value, but if it was close to transmission lines, then it could become just sort of automatically eligible for solar siding. So there was some pretty bold changes that were being negotiated on that in the end kind of went away and what got left was what we just talked about, that solar sing, that solar jurisdictional change. And so I bring all of that up as context because what in the end is going to happen is DLCD, as you know, has an exceptions process for exclusive farmland, exclusive forest land too, but mostly farmland for this conversation. And so DLCD is directed by to create rules to allow local governments and FSE SeC to permit solar facilities and prioritize solar facility siting that does not conflict with natural resource lands and areas of valuable habitats. Kind of the top line on this bill. The idea is really like, can we identify places more easily and sort of change DLCD's exceptions to make it easier for solar development to happen in these low conflict areas. And so DLCD will take the lead on this work. It will definitely have an impact in the citing process at FSEC and Aties where there are these conversations about the exceptions process. And",

        "text": " to create this program, or it's all of our other customers. And you can see immediately how it's just really unfair to say to people in any other city that we serve, you know, the Salem city council voted to do this thing, and now you have to pay. There's just sort of like a representative democracy problem right there where, you know, people in Sandy or government camp can't vote you all in office, so that's not really an appropriate option for us. Yeah. By money spent, you mean the investment in the infrastructure to provide the electricity, is that correct? Correct. Yeah. Oh, Steve, we're not on the. Oops, we're seeing your chat now. Uh. Oh, yeah, that's wor my glasses on. You'll see that. My one clarifying question was, who is the mayor? And I apologize for not that'all. Right. Our room isn't the best set up here. Now I can actually see you this better. So this is good. I'll keep going. Well, Steve gets that slide back up. So the tarafiling, like I was saying, is very universal. It's like we can slide anything through it on behalf of a community. As we discuss the commun. Community priorities. There's somethingick. Looks like Steve got knocked out. Okay, then the participation agreement, which we'll get that slide back up in a minute. The participation agreement is where we hammer out the details to say Salem was like a combination of utility scale solar and small hydro and, I don't know, some batteries at city hall or something like that, just for example. That's where we negotiate those specific items. We're doing that very intentionally because we want to make sure that communities have the space to work with PGE on their local priorities. That's also where we talk about price. We are working to get some sort of very representative pricing for communities. We're hoping that have that done in the next couple of weeks, but that's going to be extremely, let's say, directionally accurate. But it's really going to depend on choices that communities make. What does directionally accurate mean? It means that the data that we have is more or less what large resources that are sized to help meet a utilities overall demand. We have 900,000 customers. About resources of that scale, you can think like large solar facilities or large wind facilities or large batteries. That is going to be helpful as you all make decisions tor know what that stuff would cost. We are currently running an RFP for small resources, for CBR, for community based renewable energy. That's going to give us more pricing data for smaller resources. But this is the first time that we're running a procurement specifically for smaller stuff. We will have more information for you as we move forward in that process. One thing that's a little bit confusing to me about this is as I have no idea whether we'll even entertain the idea of considering this. You know, we're just right now wanting to learn. Sure. But if we were to that point where we wanted to actually consider this, how would we, given that it's an opt out possibility, how would we know how much money there would be to for investment in infrastructure when we don't know how many people would opt out? That's an excellent question. The answer is by doing collectively our homework upfront. We're never going to know exactly how many customers opt out. But we have data points. We know how many folks in, in particular city are enrolled in PGE's existing voluntary green programs already. And then it would be absolutely worthwhile doing some very careful polling and having really honest conversations with your communities about what this is going to cost and what it's going to deliver to the city. But this is a big decision and there are ways to mitigate that risk. I would not recommend that on day one you sign, or you have PGE sign on your behalf, a 20 year contract for a large solar facility in eastern Oregon. Because you're right. What happens if you get 50% of your residents opting out? Well, that's going to be a big problem. So it'probably make sense tort of start slower and build smaller things where the cost is you spread over 20 years or so is more manageable. Just to sort of test the waters and see. Okay, if we have a $2 a month bill impact, we only have a 8% opt out rate or something like that. That would be a good thing to know before you go out and do something that's going to have a ten or twelve or $15 15 a month bill impact. And again, these are just numbers that I'm giving you for the sake of discussion. They're not real numbers at all. Understood. Thank you. I have a question. Yeah. Can you give us an idea of how many people are enrolled in the voluntary green program currently? I can't, but PGE certainly can. I believe we have that data on all cities",

        "text": " to begin with, what does that look like? If this proves to be popular or whatever, how do we scale that up? So I'm curious. We can hear from PGE about what the councilselor asking. Maybe also my question on top of those are really great questions. I'll go with Counselor Phillips questions first, and then I'll go to your question, mayor. So to answer your question very directly, Counselor Phillips, there is no deadline. You know, we're building a program that can be opted into by a community more or less at any time. We would probably have some timing suggestions relative to when you would want to start something to match what other resource procurements we might be doing. But it's not to say that you have to do this by 2028 or something like that. And then to your question of scale, remind me what Salem, what Salem's number is and when 50% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. O frombo, a neutral by 2050. Okay, that's helpful. So, you know, we can take that and we can say, okay, well, what's needed on a megawatt hour basis to do that? And I don't know, off the top of my head, but it would be relatively ish. Well, it wouldn't be straightforward to figure it out, but we can get to a number, and then we would simply say, okay, well, what's PGE going to be doing already? What percentage of your city's electricity in 2035 will be carbon free or will be renewable? And then what's the incremental amount we would need to do on top of that? That's something that we would have to take back and do some math, but that's how we would figure it out. Thank you. I guess I thought of a question that might not be related, but, like, I guess, is there an opportunity for us locally to incentivize private residences to move towards solar in this? Or is that kind of a separate route from this? No, it absolutely is. And that's something we've been discussing with in terms of our net metering program and changes we're talking about making to it. We do see a program like this as an opportunity for communities that are Portland, that don't have the Portland Clean Energy fund to create a pot of money that could be used for a similar purpose. So, yes. Could some of this money go to reduce the cost of solar plus storage for residential customers in the city of Salem? Absolutely. That's the kind of thing where we can have discussions about that in the participation agreement stage. But this program is designed to create options around that kind of thing. Thank you. That was a great question, councilor. That helped me understand a little bit better as well. So I appreciate that. I wanted to. Anybody have questions? Any of our members of the public have questions, like, we don't normally do that, but seems like we have people from home builders and chamber and folks who might have questions. So I. I think one of the areas with the most known unknowns and unknown unknowns is whole category of risk allocation. Identifying the risk allocation, the balance between what PGE takes as a risk and what the city takes as a risk. You said one of the ways to address that is to start small. Several times you talked about, I think you said, a 20 year agreement. Is that just your thought, that, you know, locking the two agencies into 20 year agreement or seven year agreement or a ten year agreement of five year? Is. Is there a duration that also can be used to address or riskallocation? Excellent question. The reason I said 20 years is because 20 years is the standard term for a power purchase agreement. And those terms can vary. Occasionally you see 15 years to 25 years. But I'd say the vast majority of power purchase agreements that we sign are 20 years. And so deviating from that term will increase costs. Okay, that's helpful. It give us an idea of what we're looking to do as far as a commitment. Well, I wanna say one more thing about the risk allocation that I mentioned. Steve, can you bring that slide back up, the one that shows. Let's see. What number is it? The slide seven with the chart. The what will customers pay for? Yes, I will. Thank you. Steve, you realize you're gonna have to turnow on your camera because you're like a mystery person to everybody here. I know they hear you, but they don't see you. Yeah. Pay no attention to the guy behind the slides. Yeah. And I'm sorry, Riley, which slide were you looking for? Slide seven. Okay. And sorry, I've got way too many screens here. We are seeing your slide. Here we go. There we go. Okay. So on this question of risk allocation there's",

So realize that when we issue the DPO, we issue the notice and that initiates the public comment period. And it's open until the end of this hearing, this meeting tonight, and that the public has the opportunity during that public comment period to submit their comments by mail, by fax, by email. We have a public comment portal that's available on our website, or you can participate by providing oral comment tonight or write it on a comment card and hand it to me before the meeting ends. All of those are available and opportunities to bring up any comments. I think the one thing, and you'll probably hear this more than once, but anyone who wants to participate in our process beyond this point, as in after this meeting, you need to. Or at this meeting, actually, you need to raise an issue on the record. And that's why I said either you write, you say in writing in one of those forms, or you say it orally or here tonight, and you need to do that before the public comment period closes. And failure to raise a relevant issue either orally at the hearing or in a timely manner submitted in written comment in any of those forms, basically precludes from further participation in our process. So that's one of the reasons why you'll hear it more than once tonight, is it's just really important for us to communicate to the public that this is your opportunity to kind of. To jump in. And if you really want to ride this one to the end, this is the time to really, to get, get those comments on the record and that next slide, please. Because we are a standards based process, it's really important that your comments are relevant to our process and our standards. And so one, the first point is the timing. You know, you need to participate. You need to get those comments in, in the comment period because cannot accept or consider comments after the public comment period closes. And the second part is making sure that the content of your comments are relevant to our process for consideration in a contested case. The issues must be raised within council's jurisdiction, and they must be raised with sufficient specificity so that counsel, the department and the certificate holder understand what the concerns are and how they relate to a specific standard. So you must present facts that support your position on the issue. So, next slide. And I believe I'm getting to the end. So this is just a little bit more information on the contested case. So it's important that we put it up here. It's, you know, like I said, this is a type A amendment. There are requirements for a threshold for a contested case under a council or a type A amendment. So basically, counsel has to find that the request raises a significant issue of fact or law that there is reasonable likely, that is reasonably likely to affect counsel's determination on whether the facility meets all the requirements. Sosel must determine whether the preponderance of evidence on the record supports that position or the proportions of the facility within the area that's being added to the site boundary, and that the amendment, that it complies with all laws and council standards. And we have resources available. There's a YouTube video. It's in the public notice. We have public notices in the back of the room. It's also available on the website. That gives you more information about our contested case process. And then Coun council has options on requests for a contested case. And so they can either on an amendment, they can hold a contested case, they can remand the proposed order to the department, or they can deny because they figure they determine that the request did not really apply to the standards, it wasn't properly raised. So those are all things that the public should be aware of. And at this point, I'm going to stop. I'm going to turn it back over to chair Grail, who's the presiding officer for the the hearing, and she is going to run the public hearing and there will be an opportunity for anybody in the room to make oral comment. Then we're going to go to the phone, get people off the web if they're on there. So thank you chair grail. Kate this is the public hearing on the draft proposed order on the request for amendment one of the Obsidian Solar center site",

        "text": " just across the road and killil kids. Now, for me, that's too darn close. Now, when Chris came up and mentioned that this is where the proposal was. Atuse he's farming always ground around million gu now. Well, we were wanting it to move so to the far north end, which would be next to greeks and kill kidiess and starvation farms, which would tie to the north, excuse me, the northet west side. Your transmission line between the two would not have to go as far. And I wouldn't have to put up with a rope going within 100 yards of my house. And have to eat all the dirt, which would be right underneath the right way with the transmission line going out. I know this is not set in stone yet. So that would be my brother is Chris. And I proposed that it goes to the far end. It'd be all by itself. And it would be take up less farm ground and it'be easier for crystal farm. I wouldn't have to sit there and would. I'm tired of practicing or whatever and have to worry about what's going on next to my shop or have traffic going by me all the time. I don't have to put a fence all the way just to protect my house. Thanks. With tis talking about the noise, the only noise I get because I'm about 500, maybe 600ft away from the closest tower, I hear a moaning, groaning, like, hey, do I really have to turn? That's only when the wind is blowing in the right direction. Begin to hear it. Okay. Thank you, Stan. We will. The first thing I want to point out is there's two potential substation locations. One is actually down Strawberry Lane, further to the currently west, south and west of the existing Blue Ridge substation, right next to or very close to the existing on and m building. And. And so that is the. What we would call the primary location. The secondary location was as you described. And we will. We'll take that. It's part of the public record, and we will come and discuss those with you and Chris. Okay, thank you. And if I may add, the location of a proposed facility, I mean, specifically we're talking about the wagon trail solar project, is. Is nothing that the department and change. We review and evaluate what the applicant proposes. So it's what. What, wherever they propose their facility is where we review and evaluate. But would what would be a great, uh, or an effective comment on the record when we get to the DPO is if you had concerns about noise or, um, other impacts relating. Relating your comments to specific standards so that it can. We can follow the. Follow the train of thought as it's linked to a standard. Well, that'll probably come up in the next session. Well, one, battery storage. But you group them together, that would be. Do they take. Test the sound on all it together or is it just based on one? If they're going to group them all together, that's too. Yeah, no, it's based upon actually what we design that the number and the facilities, the design. O. I'll go ahead and ask question. There's anything else, just let me know. So, case in the outline, I believe that Chase was giving for the process and where we are now. It stated on the chart that. That the public hearing would be sometime in February. And if possible, I'm hoping that we can come up with a date, if not tonight, which would be great, but if not tonight, then definitely before the end of the month, because I make a Lexington newsletter, and I would like to put that date, whatever date in February that you do that, do have that VPO phase and the public hearing. I know that there was a lot of. A lot of interest in this meeting, and as you know, with the inclement weather and everything, and we're dealing with it right now, too. We have free rain outside. There's a lot of people that wanted to come tonight but maybe didn't because of the weather. So if I could give them enough notice and then also that there would be public, you know, the whole DPO ph. Any information that you could give me for the DPO phase would be great before the end of the month so I can notify our town people. You know, we have a sense of community that we've been working on and, and, you know, just to be involved to here and just to know that our comments are being heard as well. I think that, that a lot of people already a part of that. So I want to know that. I want everybody to know that they have that option, or. I appreciate the comment. Will keep you as informed as best I can with. With our schedule.",

        "text": "ickets. I think we have some staff here. I see Aln moving. Alan, good evening. Alan Danon, acting city engineer. The community Microgrid project, for those who don't know, is a grant award that we won from the Oregon Department of Energy, where we're partnered with PGE and it'll fund battery storage at a facility near their substation on Oxford Avenue near 22nd. And that storage will power a feeder that goes up 23rd to our new public works operations building. That work will get started probably later this year. Excuse me. Got a ro to breathe. We just got the grant agreement from Odoe and we'll be bringing to the city manager for signing. And then the work should get going with design and then construction later this year, early next year. And Alan Odoe, sorry. Oregon Department of Energy. Great. Thank you. That is a really exciting program that we have them. That's really great news. Any other questions? Member of Phillips? Yeah, this is kind of a comment question to highlight and also just to make sure I'm keeping my bearings about me. So at the beginning of this, manager, Keith Staley, you had a preamble that kind of highlighted some of the big things, and one of those is the adoption of an increase to our operational fee. And we saw some fts attached to that. Are any of those fts in this part of the budget? Like, is the park rangers under this or is it under a future section? Josh, could you help with that question? They were reviewed in the previous section. Welcome, community. So none of those positions are in this result area, but they were on the one that we discussed earlier tonight. The first one are all of those in that four so's members, two code enforcement officers and two park rangers. Eight positions were in the last results area. Okay, so I guess I'm just late, but I still want to highlight it. I think it's really important and exciting that we're adding things like to, or looking at potentially adding two essential things like park rangers. It's my understanding that prior to this potential expansion, we only have one. Is that accurate? That's correct. And we have 92 parks. 91. Yeah, 91 in the low nineties? Yes. Okay. So I think it's about time to expand that. And I think on our scoring, the parks are pretty high up there. So I'm excited by that kind of catching up to where we are in terms of service expectations for a growing community. Thank you, councillor. Each of the positions that was included in my mind has a direct relationship to the safety and security of our community. And certainly park rangers are part of that. They connect with and enhance our law enforcement function, and they help keep our community and our parks safe and usable. Thank you. Yes, member Curtis. So I just want to make sure that I heard this correctly, that any new positions that are being recommended would only be filled or if both phase one and phase two revenue options were implemented. Is that correct? That is correct. Okay, so all these new, new park, every. All that would rely on phase two, new revenue. Correct. Okay. In our staff discussions, while these are important positions, we do not want to put ourselves into a position where we don't have the revenue to sustain them. So we wanted to put this operational fee into this year's budget, and we wanted to demonstrate to the community and council and the budget committee the purposes that we intend to use it for. But alternatively, we don't want to set ourselves up for failure by not having sufficient revenues to support ongoing operations. So stay tuned. All right. Is there any other questions? Yes, member Molton, my question, it comes to mind at the moment is if we fulfill these positions that you're asking for, do any of these positions bring additional revenues down the road or future that would sustain those positions directly? No, not really. Some of the support positions that are in added with the operations fee, they could have an offset through our indirect cost allocation plan from other funds if they provide some service to those other funds. But no, not directly. I mean, you could indirectly say park rangers and parks make people want to reserve the parks more often. So more people reserve parks and we receive revenue for that. Thank you. REM member Milton, did that answer your question? You look like you're thinking, I'm thinking. But I think for now I'm good. Okay. Let me know if you need to circle back. Okay. Yes, thanks, chair. In, in this section for the last, for this year and last year budget, about $200,000 for the climate action plan. And I'm wondering, I sort of feel like I remember this when it came out, but",

        "text": " coming down from north, that's the existing transmission line that we'll physically connect the facility to. And then there's a few areas marked in red that are excluded from development. So there's a couple of tracks that the participating landowners are going to continue to farm. There's the sand hollow area that runs north south, kind of in the middle of the proposed site, and then a few other areas that are excluded as well. Sorry. Just to mention as well, up in that northwest corner where we plan to interconnect, the facility is likely where construction will start. And as it's built out in phases, it'll sort of propagate from there and get built out towards the southeast also. Sorry, one more thing. I mentioned the b two h, the boardman to Hemingway line corridor, which is proposed. So that cuts through the field all the way at the west. It runs due north south. It then comes down and cuts through the project'site kind of, I don't know, two thirds of the way down'be. Happy to point that out in more detail to anyone that wants to take a look at. With. At it with us afterwards. But again, just to reiterate, we won't be interconnecting to that line. That line is essentially an obstacle for us that we're working around, and we'll have some crossing agreements to go underneview as needed. So I wanted to provide just a really quick rundown on how a solar facility works for folks that may not be familiar. So you can kind of follow this slide from left to right. So, starting with the sun, obviously, and then the solar modules, or panels, as they're sometimes called, are really the star of the show here. These are primarily silicon based technology, about the size of a large tv screen. And these days, they actually collect sunlight on both the front and the back for a little extra juice on the backside. And the output of the solar modules is DC electricity. So that DC electricity is what ultimately feeds back into the inverters, gets changed into Ac electricity. U there's a couple of iterations of transformers to step up the voltage to get it to match the. The voltage of the transmission system that we're connecting to. Um, the modules themselves will be mounted on steel racking, which, in this case, we're proposing a single axis tracking system. So that racking will actually start out in the morning facing east. It'll rotate throughout the day, end up facing west, follow the sun, maximize the production, and then reset at the end of the day. Um, I mentioned the potential battery storage components of the facility. So more than likely, those will sit on the AC side of the inverters and will be designed to collect and store electricity that's generated by the facility so that it can be dispatched on demand if the customer needs it at a certain time or potentially moved around during the day to to more accurately meet the demand in the region. In the application, we've proposed two different battery storage technology types. One is lithium ion, which is probably the most common technology in the market right now. We've also proposed a zinc air solution that has some benefits but is a little bit of a newer technology. Chris covered this a bit already, but just to highlight again all of the studies that were completed during the development phase of the project and are included in the application. For example, the wetland delineation report is can be found in exhibit j, attachment one, economic impact analysis in exhibit k, attachment two, etcetera. So you can follow that list down. And all of these studies are available inside the application materials that are available on the F SEC website. Alongside the studies we've also ##h drafted a number of plans to address different impacts from the facility and different aspects of the construction and O and m process. I won't read all of these out to you, but they touch on a number of themes from dust control, weed control, agricultural mitigation, habitat mitigation, construction traffic, wildfire mitigation, etcetera. And again, just following the same nomenclature there that'guide. You to where you can find it inside the application. So really throughout the development process of the facility so far, we've been really focused on land use and siting considerations. And just to highlight a few of those that are described in great detail in the application, particularly in Exhiit K, you know, we've worked to site the facility near existing transmission lines and infrastructure. Like we talked about, the footprint of the facility is pretty much exclusively located on land that's used for dry land wheat production, and it's all inside the Butter Creek critical groundwater area. We've worked hard to make sure the proposed project will not impact or displace irrigated agricultural uses and we're working to preserve existing area water resources as well. Lastly, the facility has been designed to avoid what little high value wildlife habitat was surveyed in the area. And you know, we think we'll be able to",

        "text": " maybe what would serve us well as sort of an orientation is to kind of start by looking at the statute together for a minute and then I'll try to place the exceptions, uh, into sort of the proper context. Okay. So I'm, I'm looking really at, they're the same, but I'm looking at this one which presents 469504. And just, you know, at the highest level, I think it's worth kind of revisiting that the, you know, proposed facility, I'm reading the very first sentence under subsection one shall be found in compliance with statewide planning goals if, and then initially right there, there are a, the facility has received local land use approval. That's one path that an applicant can take that is not the path that the applicant took here. Sub B, the other path to compliance with statewide planning goals is if the council determines that. And here we have another fork in the road. The a. If the council determines that the facility complies with applicable substitive criteria from the affected local government's acknowledged comp plan and land use regulations that are required by the statewide planning goals and in effect on the date of the application is submitted. That is the sort I'm going to stop there because that's this essence of it. That is one way for the council to conclude that, or, you know, the council's conclusion that the facility complies with applicable substantive criteria meets this statutory provision. Here the hearings officer, the ALJ, concluded that the criterion three of Umatila counties is not an applicable substute criteria. And this is what you've already considered in groupings one and two, essentially, and that the project can be found, the council can find that the project does meet applicable substive criteria. It's just that because criterion three was not required by statewide planning goals. It is not among those. Okay, so that is the first path that you've already considered. Then we go to b. The other path for the council is to determine that for an energy facility or related supporting facility that must be evaluated against the applicable subst criteria pursuant to sub five, that the proposed facility does not comply with one or more of the applicable substantute criteria, but does otherwise comply with the applicable statewide planning goals. And here the hearings officer approach was to say, even if we were to assume that criterion three were an applicable substive criteria, this project can be analyzed here under this u large b provision because it of the language in subsection five. And by analyzing it under this subsection B, the council may conclude that even though it may not comply with that criterion three, it does otherwise comply with the applicable statewide planning goals. The hearings officer order as well as the proposed order do analyze, you know, with, and you probably saw this and reviewing the materials, the statewide planning goals and, and the question about whether they require this criterion and concluded that they did not. So I just want to look at subsection five because it is, that is sort of the hook for this second path to be the council's other finding. And the relevant language, I believe, begins sort of, it's not highlighted, but it begins if the special advisory group recommends. So I would say that the most important language starts here. If the special advisory group recommends applicable sensitive criteria for an energy facility or a related or supporting facility that passes through more than one jurisdiction or more than three zones in any one jurisdiction, the council shall review the recommended criteria and determine whether to evaluate the proposed facility against the criteria recommended by the group, against statewide planning goals or against a combination. And making this determination, the council shall consult with this special advisory group and consider a number of factors. So in the hearings officers proposed contested case order, there's a fair amount. Well, it was agreed with Odo's initial proposed order which includes the reasoning to support consideration of all of those factors. It also includes reasoning that supports the path b approach. And I don't know if anyone has any questions about all of that. Let'just to pause for a minute. So I think that for purposes of revisiting the exceptions, the important thing to note is that this finding of fact that the county raises an exception to is relevant to the question of this path B subsection five, alternative way for the council to find that the project complies and, you know, with regard to the fact, you know, you've seen what's, what was considered by the hearings officer and the hearings officer's conclusions you've heard from the county and I guess the question becomes whether you're have will go through the first sort of quasi straw poll on this one of whether you are inclined to accept or reject this first exception on the finding a effect. ##er my brain hurts a bit, but so we have a finding in the PCO that says no, this is not an applicable substantive criteria. We also have findings that say even if it is a substantive criteria, the applicant has demonstrated that the project can meet the other statewide planning goals. Okay",

        "text": " have seen that that's not enough and that there's still a subst substantial unmet demand from community groups that would like to make community solar projects work but have both financial and non financial barriers. So we're really interested in using this funding as a way to dramatically increase the technical assistance that's being offered to community groups that may want to be part of the community Sol program. And we're also considering taking a more assertive role in the program and providing sort of a matchmaking service between project developers, CBO'and, project managers. And I'll talk a bit more about that on the next slide. Next slide, please. So the way that this could work is sort of enhanced matchmaking service. Energy Trust would first establish partnerships with community organizations that want to bring community solar to their communities, who are willing to support community solar customer enrollments, and who can, who represent communities that are eligible for solar for all dollars but don't really have the interest or capabilities to be a long term manager of a project. We then use SlAR for all dollars and potentially other dollars to manage a procurement process to develop community solar projects by energy trusts'trade, ally Network, for example, on non residential facilities that might lack the on site that might be a good candidate for solar, but not have the onsite load that would make a traditional net metering installation work. Well, then we would separately procure and contract with one or multiple organizations to serve as a project manager or some of these projects. So we'd be separately building partnerships and then, and then aligning both the three organizations, the community groups that would bring the communities to the project, the trade ally contractors that would develop the projects, and the project managers that would be responsible for them. Long term, there's still a lot of dots be connected here, for example, how project ownership work for some of these projects. But we're interested in using this as a role to really identify what is the right role for community groups to play in the program and then helping bring the partners to make those projects be realized. Next slide, please. So there are a few requirements of solar for all that need to be navigated and aligning it well with the Oregon community solar program. We'll talk about a few of them here. The first is that there's different income criteria in the Oregon community solar program and solar for all. The require for the income based requirement for solar for all is generally a bit more rigid, and so not all participants that would qualify as low income customers in the community solar program would qualify as eligible recipients in solar for all. And that's one that would need to be navigated both by the program and by projects. Second is the geographic requirements of Justice 40, which Jen already mentioned. 40% of the total spending would need to benefit customers that live in designated justice fortyy areas. And we imagine that that requirement flood would flow through to any Oregon community solar projects that receive funding. And this could be especially tricky. Make sure that we're complying with it in PGEU service territory, where there's relatively few geographic areas that are identified by the Justice 40 tool. So that's something that would need to be navigated as well. Then third, there's an opportunity to use solar for all dollars, to integrate storage and it install solarplus storage on critical facilities and provide resilience in times when the grid goes down, which is something that is technically allowed within the community solar program. But there isn't a clear pathway to make it work. So some program revisions to the community solar program would be necessary to make it possible to enable storage. And that's something that we're interested in seeing if there's a possibility to make it work. Next slide. And so some of the areas that we love feedback on from the stakeholder community is. First, is the core incentive concept that we're proposing viable? Do we think that's going to be an effective way to fill the program, carve out and really deliver community solar to the desired populations? Second is the matchmaking concept that we laid out, both needed and viable. Third, what else can we do to address some of the non financial barriers that small scale community solar projects encounter? And then also what other ideas and suggestions you have? So that's it for me. And back over to rob to transition to the CoU side. Alghty. Thank you, Ryan. And yeah, we will move right on to Bonneville Environmental found Bonneville Environmental foundation and Evan will walk us through this concept. Thank you, Rob and everyone here on the webinar. Thanks for joining. I see a lot of friendly names in the chat, a lot of experts in community solar, and would value your input as we move this program forward here. Move to the next slide, please. I'm gonna start with a little bit of an overview of the Bonneville Environmental foundation and our work and how that relates to community solar and where we're gonna go from here. Just to recap, I'm Evan Ramsey. I'm the senior director of the renew",

        "text": " we got notice of this presentation. And there are probably 25 different comments about this proposal on that site. And he is the former editor of the Democrat Herald. He's widely read, an excellent author, good source of information for you, I think, and for everybody else. Yeah. And that's a good opportunity togin to remind people if you did not receive a property oner notification cause you live beyond the distance. Please, Jenny can help you sign up to receive email notices for this project in the future. You can also request to receive paper notices and we'd be happy to do that. Just to clarify, we can only take public comments if people submit them to us. So if they submitted on that blog, that's not anything we can take account of, they would have to submit them to us. Maybe I'll ask hassle if you'll submit them. Okay, thank you. Sure. Katie Glover and then Chelsea Fane is next. Looks like Katie may not have wanted to wait. Katiek, Chelsea. And then Chad Higgins is next. Good evening. I brought my visual here for you guys. I have a quick question. What's the longest running solar project that your company has done? I don't know off the top of my head, but something I could definitely find. So do you guys have any data as to what the long term impact of these solar farms and these giant projects are on the. The agriculture, the wildlife, the groundwater and human health too. Get data for that. We do have white papers on how solar and soils go with one another so that we do have those resources. Yes, but I'm not talking about soil. I'm talking about human life and wildlife and groundwater, especially. Like if the sheep grazing doesn't work out. And I'm not a farmer, but I know that the sheep grazing is not just to farm sheep. They rotate the crops with the sheep so the manure can fertilize the ground. And it's like the best organic fertilizer that you can get. So what good is just sheep grazing and doing a mowing for you? What if that doesn't work out? What are you going to do? Just mow it? Are you going to use weed killers? Like what type? What is the long term impact of on the groundwater, on human health, on wildlife? What's the long term impact? So when it comes to solar, and I guess ground impacts, Q cells doesn't have any white papers on it. But that's definitely something we dig into to we can provide sources to other white papers that have been done when it comes to solar. And then to answer your question, when, let's just say if the sheep thing does not work outquote, as Todd has already stated, there would be a compliance requirement. So if that is a stated use within the project, and we're required to comply with that and get continue use of sheep grazing on the site for the life the project. Okay, but I just wanted on the record that you guys don't know the long term impact of these things and you don't know what your longest running solar project is. I personally don't know the impact of solar on grounds, but I'm sure there are definitely research papers out there that I can probably find. And if you'd like to know about them, that's something we could do as a follow up item to try to send you some sources. And then when it comes to the longest running project at Q cells, admittedly, I don't know that. So I apologize. But that's something that we could definitely get. What was the earliest project that Q cell built? Okay, so you don't know the longest type of running project, but we're still willing to invite into our very backyards a 40 year long project. My son is three months old. He's going to be 40 years old. There's another little baby right here. It's going to be 40 years old. I know it's easy for all of us to get up in arms about this because of how it's going to impact us. But in reality, how's it going to impact the children of Oregon? How is it going to impact their future when we don't even have the data? How do we don't even know how it's going to impact our groundwater, how it's going to impact the soil? What if it doesn't work out? Is it going to be abandoned? I've heard so many things that we don't have the answers to, and so many things of like, we're going to do a six month long study of the wildlife between May and, what was it, August or September? I'm sorry that this is Oregon. Like, this is a wildlife capital of the Pacific Northwest. We have so many amazing, diverse wildlife, and six months is not going to cut it. And you don't have the data, and yet you're willing to impose this 40 year project on our children. And I just don't see how that's helpful at all. Uh, the only thing that I can add and follow up",

        "text": " also plan to undertake this formal government to government engagement and to engage with tribal communities and organizations where appropriate, whenever appropriate. So we also have in mind these three kinds of meetings in addition to the groups that I mentioned above, which are more established structures. So there's a difference here. The groups that I mentioned before, the interage steering group, the working groups advisory group, they require a bigger time commitment and they have kind of an ongoing series of meetings. And so what we want to present here are one time meetings, most likely, that are meant to enable a really us to hear from a really broad range of Oregonians on their priorities, their questions and thoughts about the energy strategy. So the first type of meeting that we have in mind are listening sessions. And as you can see, we've tried to boil down the first bullet to, like, what purpose does this session serve? And here it's tell us what you think. So we plan to take listening session, that title seriously, be in listening mode, schedule a few meetings so everyone can find a time that works for them and really sit back and listen and try to understand where folks are coming from. And that will be really important to us in thinking about how we shape the energy strategy. We also realize that we may need additional meetings with additional groups on specific topics. Listening sessions alone might not be enough. And so what we mean by organizational meetings here is really extra meetings to deepen our understand, but not to the level of detail of the working group. So this isn't like getting into the weeds on the modeling, getting into the weeds on data sources and assumptions, but it is getting to the heart of priorities, of concerns. So for example, we see the need for a meeting with environmental justice and equity organizations. And a listening session is probably not enough to really dig into some of the priorities and concerns and key questions for EJ and equity organizations. So we would organize an organizational meeting to have that discussion. And the details of this are something that we'll develop with Kerns and West over the coming weeks. And then you all are joining a webinar today. And we anticipate holding more webinars, probably one to two more this year. And they serve really to get updates or to provide updates on the energy strategy and to get a sense of what's coming next. So I'm going to try to summarize all of what I just said on one slide and we'll see how it goes. So how will these groups work and what's the difference? So here's another go at that. So I'm just going to focus here on the timeline for this year and the timeline to inform the modeling and the technical analysis. There will be work happening next year, but I just want to focus on the near term here to help keep things really clear. So in July and August, we anticipate holding, as I said, several public listening sessions to hear from folks. We also plan to organize some organizational meetings to deepen our understanding in some cases. And we will also plan to get the working groups started. And the working groups will by topic be getting really into the weeds on data sources, on making sure that we are re using the most appropriate and Orego organ specific data. They'll be talking about assumptions and really getting into the modeling. And then Odo staff are going to be working throughout this process together with our consultants to synthesize the feedback that we're hearing. We will work to post information on our website and to organize it in a way that, towards the end of August helps us share with the working groups what we've heard. And we're going to ask the working groups to help us translate questions into numbers. That's the simplest way I can explain it. So you can imagine there being some priorities that come out of the public listening sessions, the organizational meetings. And then the question will be, well, what can we do in the model about this? Or if not the model, what can we do in some technical analysis? And so the working groups are going to help us kind of make that link. And so the idea is that the working groups at the start will be meeting to work through the data and the assumptions, and then they'll circle back around and consider this feedback that we've received throughout this process. The interagency steering group and the advisory group will meet approximately once a month to inform the process. And I failed in my animation. So there's another box that I think will come up at the end. But I just wanted to signal that we also see the engagement with the tribes as an ongoing process throughout this process here. I think that. Yeah. Jessicaa. Hey, Edith. I responded in the Q and A, but I thought it was worthwhile to sor of let everybody know the answer. Again, another question from Rafes, who was asking about whether there would be an opportunity to engage labor as an affinity group, to have a deeper understanding of implications from each of the scenarios in the strategy",

        "text": "Everyone, thank you so much for being here at the Oregon Department of Energy's public hearing on our application to the US Department of Energy's grid resilience program. For those of you I haven't met, my name is Janine Benner and I'm the director of the Oregon Department of Energy, and I'm really pleased to be here today. Today's meeting is specifically to discuss a program created in the Infrastructure Investment Jobs act under section 400 101. And this is actually our second hearing on the topic. The previous hearing was held last August, and since that time, the application deadline was extended by the US Department of Energy. We've learned a lot more details from the US Department of Energy, and we've been able to receive feedback from interested parties on the initial ideas that we presented back then in August. The program narrative and public hearing today covers our revised approach to this program, and it also covers, excuse, two state allocations, providing what we refer to as our first and second year funding all at one time. So this means that we are anticipating being able to award more funds in this initial year than in the years that follow. Because of the format of this webinar and the number of people in attendance, we have everyone muted, currently all the attendees. But as we go through the presentation, we'll pause for questions, and at that point people can raise their hands and we'll be able to unmute you to ask questions. We'd also encourage you to use the chat function on Webex if you have questions you want to put in writing, and then at the end, we'll have dedicated time for further questions and public comments. So in addition to responding during this webinar, you can also enter your thoughts and feedback through an online portal that we've set up, if you would like more space to respond, more time to consider your responses, or if you don't feel comfortable speaking out in a meeting like this, I will ask my colleague Jen to put the link to the portal in the chat so that you will have it available for you and it will be open through the end of this week. We've got a pretty quick turnaround on this particular opportunity, so you'll see that in the chat in a moment. And I'm hoping Jen can also put a link in the chat to the narrative that we are going to go through today and asking people for feedback on. So in a minute, I'm going to go over some logistics on how to use Webex, but at this point I would ask everyone, including the Oregon Department of Energy staff, on the line to please introduce themselves in the chat. So if you can just enter your name and if there's an organization you're affiliated with, we'd be really happy to see who's here with us this morning. Next slide, please. Okay, so for those of you who are new to Webex, here's a quick guide on how to use some of the features. As I mentioned before, attendees are off camera and muted, but our host will unmute you if we call on you to ask questions. You can see the option to raise your hand on both the right hand side of your screen under participants. Under the participants panel, if you click near your name, there's also an option at the bottom of your screen where you can see a visual of a hand in the reactions bar. As I mentioned, feel free to use the chat function to ask questions or make comments. And if you do that, please send to all panelists or to everyone so that all of the Odo staff can see the question and help respond. We'll try to get to as many questions in the chat and through raised hands as we can, but we may not have time for all of them today. Please notice that we will keep a record of that and try to follow up with you where possible. I also noticed don't if we have people who called in on the phone, you can press star six to raise your hand and star three to unmute yourself when we call in you. So I also want to make sure that folks know that today's hearing is being recorded and that a list of attendees will also be posted to our website later today. I know it's hard for attendees to see the list of other attendees, so we'll make sure to get that on our website. All right, hopefully that is clear. And by now, people have used all these different platforms. Next slide, please. So here's the agenda. There's a lot to get through today, and the first part of today's meeting is going to focus on the grid resilience, funding opportunity in the inflation, excuse me, in the investment, infrastructure Investment and Jobs act, the way that Congress and the USDE structure the program and the requirements that fall to Odo on behalf of the state to submit an application. My colleague Emily Selmey, who is our new federal grants officer, will be leading this part of the present. The second part of the presentation will be information about the state's approach, and my",

I just wanted to understand, and I do, I mean, since I just switched jobs, I do understand what happens when a person who has been doing something is no longer there. So you and your staff are there. I can understand their concern. So thank you for that clarification. So, yeah, yeah, I think. Any other questions on that particular one? Okay, so for. It's difficult to forecast beyond, I think, at this point, considering how ambitious our schedule is, whether will be you, what 2026 will look like, I imagine at least some of this schedule will see some slippage. And so there'be some of these projects will slip into 2026. At this point, the only thing that we know for sure is that there are a whole bunch of standards that we're going to look at as part of phase three. And so as we kind of move forward and get through the 2024 2025 lists, we're going to start seeing more and more rulemaking projects that are specifically directed at various standards as part of our kind of phase three rul making effort. So that's, yeah, that's where this slide looks the way it does. Any, any other questions about. And obviously, as we get closer, we'll, you know, start evaluating which standards should we look at first? Should we group them? We do. Should we look at them by themselves? You know what makes the most sense? Yeah, but we're. That's an eternity way. But it is on. It is on the forecast. That is where we're headed. Okay, next slide. So that's rulemaking projects. This slide is just an informative slide about pending five year reviews. You can see every time we have a doc, new rules. So it's literally's just a sort of black and white. Even if we significantly amend a rul, there is no statutory requirement that we look at that. If we create a new rule, no matter how small, if the new number is generated by the secretary of state, we are statutory, obligated to review that rule within five years to evaluate whether the rule had its intended effect, whether the anticipated fiscical impact was underestimated, overestimated, whether we should repeal it or amend it, whether we needed it, all the impacts on small business. So there'there's, a list of things we have to analyze as part of that. But the next one, just coincidentally or not, is the review of the amendment rulemaking, which is, which is due on January 28 of next year. So that is the next pending five year review. So we'll essentially be doing that as part of our amendment rulemaking, just, you know, as a matter of course. And then any of the rules that we generated this last year will be due in 2028. So, which there were more than a few, but any questions about the five year view or what's coming up? Okay, well, that brings us to public comments on the rulaking schedule. So I will turn it over to Nancy to run that. But if there are any, any comments about what we've discussed so far with respect to the rulemaking schedule, now's the time. All right. For the public comment period, if you're on the line or online, I should say you're going to go ahead and click on the participants and you're going to see a little hand icon, and you can click on that to raise your hand if you'd like to comment. If you're on the phone, you're going to press Star three to on your keypad to raise your hand and star three again to lower your hand. At this point, we do have a gentleman here in the room that is going to make some public comments. If you'd like to go ahead and come up, you can do that. Good morning. My name is Randy Benz. I work for Oregon Military department as the master planner for installations and I am here to make some comments for the record on the rulemaking schedule. I'm here early in the process because we're looking at essentially rule 241, the one that was discussed for the federal agency coordination, and that's, we know that that's probably not going to come up for discussion until next year, but we wanted to put our marker down early and I typically speakemporaneously, but I've been asked to read some comments. The record the Department of Defense, through the Oregon Military Department and the Department of the Navy has had a long and effective working relationship with Oregon Department of Energy. We have worked together and have consulted several times on proposed energy projects and that have potential impacts on military training and operations. The Navy Northwest training Range complex out of WbE island and the Oregon Military Department'ground and air assets are critical to national a critical national asset that enables warfighters to prepare for real world operations.

My name is Neil Shannon. I'm at large member been here in Sherwood for about 20 years. And I kind of refer to myself as a citizen activist. I've been to council many, many times and presented various points at various times. I have been on the charter review committee in the past. So this is a rehash. And I'm Kristen Schweitzer. I work for the city. I'm the assistant city manager and I've been with the city for 22 years. I'm Ryan Adams. I'm the city attorney. I've been here for a little over a year. So I'm a new guy. I'm Chris west. I've been in Sherwood going on 24 years, raised two kids and now getting to help raise a grandkid in town. And I've been on the police advisory board since its inception, which was seven years ago. I'm Keith May. I'm a city councilor. I've been the mayor in the past, council president pass and lived in Sheurtwwood 26 years, 28 28 by nine years. And I've been involved in a wide variety of things over the years and in mysel liaison so I just will answer questions when asked this process xenmies I've been here for about 25 years and very proud represent the senior center. Marjorie Stewart, senior center. I'm Paul Mayer. I've been here 1314 years and I'm on the finance committee and also on the comprehensive planning committeeome Rick Waola. Been insuredit for about 26 years and currently I serving on the fundning commission as vice chair. Hi, Lisa Patterson. I've beenured r for three years and I am on the traffic safety committee. I'm Joy Coooier. I've lived in Sherwood about seven and a half years. Grew up in Newburg, just down the road. So I've been around. Wow. I'm here representing the parks board. I'm Deb Dairs. I've been here six and a half years. I represent the library board and I'm also the president of the newly formed library foundation. And we're going to hopefully get some money together for library improvement stuff. Great. All right. All right, thanks, everybody. Let's move on to new business. There are five items. The first item, I'm sorry, I'm looking low where it starts. Well, is there a presentation for overview, a process and review of expectations? No, sir, there's no presentation. If you'd like to just kind of lay some ground rules out for what, how you think the committee should function, what it will look like, what be like, and just kind of set some Civ rules and things like that. That would. Okay, ro, so it's very much self driven. It's self driven and on the approach you want to take. So there is a council rules or charter that this body is convened every five years to take a fresh look at the charter, see if there's anything you wish to change my recommendations to the city council to consider putting on the ballot. And they would have recommendations from staff of certain things that just needed housekeeping or needed updating or needed changes. And that is what I recall, is that what we're going to be doing this time? So staff has not prepared a specific list of things because this is the third time we've done this in ten years. If you're asking me certain at whatever point, I'm happy to give opinions or thoughts on different challenges that the charter is presented or not. Course. So you can fake whatever process you want, I don't know it before, if folks have had a chance to review the charter to kind of COVID the different sections and if there's any sections that members of the committee have questions about, would want us to staff to explain that the role of that section in the operations of the city. We can do that. Okay. And. Right. Yeah. We just need to have kind of a structure for how we're going to discuss everything and then, and then what's going to prompt us as a group to make recommendations and things that, uh, lotugh to and changed. And sometimes it's legally stuck and we're going to be looking to staff just to say, hey, this just kind of needs some, this Isric working or this isn't modern or something like that. And other than that, I think we're going to be really equipped to be, unless people have ideas in the room about things that ought be changes in the charter. I think what we need kind of is a presentation or a walkthrough of the charter as it is, and that'll give us a star. Just raise our hands, question that other. I don't know how we're going to really bring stuff at the table. Think you really know right off the top ahead these change is that. Does that sound good that we can absolutely do that",

        "text": " stations and we're adding more. We worked with the Energy Trust of Oregon and Solar Oregon on a solarized Hillsboro and Cornelius campaign to help homeowners install solar arrays and battery storage. We collaborate with cities, counties and other partners in the region to share climate action strategies. We have applied for us Department of Energy funds to add more public EV charging stations and complete H Vac upgrades at the Jackson Bottom Nature center, and we are currently working on an EPA community change grant proposal for community climate resiliency projects. The environmental Stewardship committee continues to track and adjust the city's environmental stewardship indicators and will be producing an annual report later this summer. And the ongoing Hillsboro 2035 plan update will also likely draw ideas for climate related projects. So as a reminder, I'm going to give it a plug here. Anyone can enter their ideas for the 2035 plan on the city's engage Hillsboro page throughout this summer. So please check that out if you haven't done so yet. And finally, notes here. As I wrap up, I wanted to share that Hillsboro is also leading efforts to address climate change within our city organization itself. So here's a sampling of that internally facing work. So we have a sustainability revolving fund which helps support department climate, sustainability and social equity focused projects. We've developed a new employee training about sustainability topics. Our first one is about where and how employees can charge their electric vehicles when they drive them to work. We've launched two new environmental committees, one focused on policy development and one focused on technical project implementation. The goal there is to ensure we're doing cross department coordination on our environmental work. The city has a new policy to reduce waste generated via the stuff we all get, or swag use as giveaways and event materials. And the fire department is developing a community wildfire protection plan in collaboration with the consulting firm and other city departments. And finally, the public works department is recruiting an urban forester that'll be a great addition to the city's environmental and natural resources management and climate resiliency work. That job posting is open now through July 14. Another plug. So I just want to thank you for your time today and see if you have any further questions. So, Robin, going back to the previous slide, somewhere in here, do we have, are we moving away from gas powered blowers and trimmers and things like that, say, for instance, with our parks and rec maintenance or. So if there's specific actions that we're doing within some of our departments, that'd be great to hear. Yeah, we don't have a specific policy on that, but we do track it. So annually, all of our departments are required to report to us on the types of equipment they have and how it's powered. So we're tracking it. It's moving slowly in a direction towards less liquid petroleum fueled products. Part of the problem with that is even if they add the electric, they tend to keep the gas as backup. And so it's still part of our inventory. So we don't have a great way to say what we're using on a day to day basis. But I know that our equipment managers are very, very focused on that, and they're always testing new equipment. They're working with equipment manufacturers to test out things to see what will work in our climate. The biggest problem with some of that equipment is it works great in California where it doesn't rain, but it doesn't work as well here. Electric equipment in the rain, it's not always a good mix, and it sometimes just doesn't have the battery power to operate as well as gas. So we're moving there as quickly as we can. But it's not going to be like an overnight transition, I don't think, for us. Well, you know, I think, personally speaking, I'm happy to trade off a little bit of the works as well in order to save, you know, our environment. And so, you know, for whatever that's worth. And I would love to see, you know, I guess I'll direct this more to Robbie, but I would love to see kind of a timeline for phase out so that, yes, we keep, you know, a couple of gas powers, you know, backups, but I'd love to see, you know, kind of a phase out timeline. And maybe that's done over x number of years, but it'd be good to know how many years that might be. Thanks. I want to say thanks for the briefing, Robin, and I'm very excited about many of the things you talked about, specifically the urban forester. I'm super stoked. I knew they were coming, but to know that it's posted is really exciting. I didn't know about the new swag policy, so I'm really glad to hear that that makes sense. Thank you. Yeah, I can't take credit for that, but I will pass it on to the folks who really did the hard work to design it in our communications team. Excellent. Yeah. And Robin, this is",

I know that when you presented the coastal caucus last month or earlier this month, I can't remember. Yeah, you spoke about part of my district not being within the program. I've had someal conversations. O and so I understand that you just said the deadline is today, but I'm hoping that we can still find an active partner. And so I'd love to talk with you offline. I've been meaning out, but just been buried. Y yeah, I think we might have an application in for your, for your region. So I'll find, I'll find more by the end of today, but I'll reach out to you offline. Yeah, can you shoot me an email and that'd be great. Absolutely. See? Good to hear from you. So moving us on other topics we expect in 2024. I know you've all been reading along, and this is what I was hoping. If there's people that, you know, they're running these particular pieces of legislation themselves, might raise their hand and speak up if they know more about them. We know that the governor has a really clear, top priority around housing production, and that does include an incentive for climate friendly new homes. We know there's been a big work group and lots of conversation around a bill that would allow energy facility siting council jurisdiction for standalone battery storage. We know that there's a bill out there that would, on federal land where there's NEPA review, National Environmental Protection act review, that would say that's the review there. And FSEEC would not also review on those projects. There's a concept around standby generators and energy reliability. There's, I believe this is one I hear about from Kathy. Most of all, there's a forest lands workforce study bill that might be floating around. There's a clean energy manufacturing concept, a floating offshore wind roadmap and labor standards for floating offshore wind projects. I dont know if Senator Denough is on the line today or not, but greenhouse gas emissions goals are also something that was started out in the Oregon Climate Action Commission bill last session and came out kind of at the last minute. And my understanding is hes working to bring those back. And then that would be pretty darn relevant to this group. So stay tuned on that. And then finally, one I've just kind of heard about in the ether a little bit, but there's a bill that it sounds like would require reports by utilities on their progress towards forming or joining our regional transmission organization. And with that, I just want, if there's other commission members that know about other concepts they want to share in this space or want to talk any more about anything I mentioned, now's the time. And otherwise I'm happy to hand things over and let you move on. Just a very quick mention, I've been in touch with Senator Denough and the folks that are interested in advancing the forest land workforce study to look at ways that we can make those two workforce studies, the one that's authorized out of House Bill 3409 and the interests that's more specific to forest lands work together and complement one another so that that dialogue is started and ongoing. And from what I've seen, that bill could really add some depth and value to the workforce study that we're doing and vice versa. Other commission members want to weigh in with other concepts that are being considered. I don't see any hands up. Amy Dou okay, either. Great. No, I don't see any other hands left at this time. Here's hoping it means that it's a nice, quiet legislative session and there's no surprises. All right. You're such a dreamer. Thank you. Thanks for having me today. You bet. Thank you. Moving to next steps, I just want to reinforce that we are continuing to look for new commissioners and director Benner dropped the link to the place where you can go and apply if you're interested in being considered for an appointment. I think that she dropped the link at about twelve in the chat, so you can find your way back to that and click on that link. We will be doing an orientation for new members as one or more as folks on board. As Amy shared, we are looking at setting up regular meetings so that folks can get them on their calendar well in advance for the rest of the 2024, if not longer. So those are all things. And then certainly, as Alan mentioned, really focusing in on hiring the new positions and Zac's replacement. So we are fully up to speed and from a capacity standpoint and taking advantage of that added capacity that the legislature granted us in 2023. So those are the next steps that I have. Amy, anything important that I missed? Maybe some follow up actions between with Erica and on how we should best interpret the new information that she was trying to present and some one on one intersection between Senator Brockmith and",

        "text": " not want it. You know, the part that got me up here, to be real honest with you sir, is the comment was made about this meeting during harvest. You know, I'm a farmer. I should be home cal min and wheat. I've got somebody else doing it and so does a lot of the other farmers here. The problem here is, I understand for a lack of betterdroom carpet bagggers coming into our neighborhood and taking control. You work for us. I mean, you should know this. It's our neighborhood. You know, we're relying on you to make the best judgment. You're probably not elected official, but some elected officials probably hired you. Somebody should know our neighborhood. You know, if this works out best for the community, you know, I'm the first one to say, okay, whatever it takes. If it doesn't, somebody needs to stand up and say it doesn't. And I'm just not convinced who that is yet. Hey, next is Ryan Glaseer and then Bob Bronson. Hello, my name is Ryan Glasser. A little bit echoing on what he was bringing up. Those are definitely concerns about the sheep grazing and I guess to a little more emphasis on it. It'not so much that the sheep will not eatat everything on the weeds still grow during the rest of the year and the sheep have new. My main question actually was the bon terms the lifec cycle. I'll go back to the beginning explanation if that doesn't answer your question. I mean, so application you're going to have to submit in detail what it's going to take to fully decommission the projectk. So they're going to break it down into what equipment they're going to have to hire, you know, pulling out the piles that they're talking about, decompacting the soil if they need to restore topsoil, removing roads, roing facility. All that is all detailed in what theyit us. We evaluate that in addition to, you know, so basically what we call those as unit costs. In addition to those unit costs they put dollar amounts to that. So we value ##u that based on to say that based on today's dollars or not. And if we agree with that then we also we will inflation going to terminate. We're done. And they would then submit a commissioning plan, energy siting council would really be, how do we take this thing off the landscape? So if they do that, we will hold that bond until that facility is entirely restored, consistent with that plan. If they don't, if they go bankrupt or, you know, something bad happens, we have that money in place and it could be in the form of security bond or a letter of credit. That's why I was curious. Yeah. What form will be held in, so, and is it a self funded one? Is it third party one? It's they. We have on an annual basis, the council energy facility sititing council evaluates the financial institutions that are creditortthy enough to be able to supply these bonds or letters of credit to these facility owners. So we do that research on an annual basis. So there's been some volatility in the banking market recently, and we had a request just two council meetings ago to add two institutions. We did the evaluation and we recommended that the council had one institution but not the other, because we didn't feel that they had the near term financial viability that was consistent with what we were interested in. So we look at that to make sure that the financial institution's not self bonded. It's a sort of, it's a financial institution that we evaluate annually to make sure that they actually legitimately will pay out the bond or letter of credit. And so I guess, yeah, that was the extent of, I guess I wanted to make sure that the security set aside was not backed by the corporation installing the panels. As an example, say we're going to give you 8% of the business stock as security. Correct. That's not acceptable for us. Okay. And so it has to be backed by a out of network security of some kind. Correct. Okay, thank you. Thanks. Bob Bronson on this body here. That bring a little background. I wasn't going to say anything because I might be one of the people all this. I'm currently serving on a chairman of theation. I've been chairman for probably four years. I serve at the pleasure the people county, actually commissioners. I'also serve on the Harrisburg rural Fire and Rescue district. One thing I caught my attention when agenies responded. As of our board meeting Thursday night of this week, the only reason we knew about this is because I've been collecting notes on it. Nobody the point that I would certainly know about. Chairman, can you lean into the mic a little bit? Okay. Is that better? Okay. Is that because we have to be prepared for it and, you know, for what type",

        "text": " let him speak a little bit about the history of the site. Thank you. Um, hi, everybody. Uh, John Miller. My office, the old Pringle schoolhouse in south say co I've been involved in 168 personal but this is part of and had developed over the years, did a master plan and I got a 15 acre par that I saved and rezoned, thinking that it would be a great place for Portle housing, senior housing. As I got older and things got more expensive, I realized I needed somebody better how of this than I did. So I found community development partners, and one thing that attracted me was their design team, place NlY architecture and, um, Scott Edwards. They're just some of the best there are and they're experts in this arena. So. And we had a lot of comment. So that's why they came to this site and that they did, because they did a wondered job working their way into this community, the whoodscape community that I had developed. And they themselves a real part of iting that be part of it in terms of context to the site on the north end. In the lower left is our whisy landletalianlis for green development. So we're gonn even see we have waterways and bioswales. In fact we did first Bioswil and say we're going to have to fight the city. We let me do it. But now they take people out and say this bo you should that's been a greatating on the the middle of the large one is the southern Bo border of the sing and it whichoodsc heartway weuilt and escape faces large detention moder quality piece in there and b the east side side. And um one of the things that is of interest to me is mean planned and developed and design and Salem 40 years is saying does something really well. And one the lower left you'll see the sequential paific bence plan which I was part of. It was a gridle breaking. There were Willie Nelson and we brought a lot of outside investment into Salem. It was the best bence supp plan, the greenest one around and it went really smoothly. The development Commission wanted it in Portland but they made it so hard for us to be there that we can sail a soem is a lot things really well. But one of the things that I found is um and on the lower right there is a some of the neighbors they just did wonderful job. I introduced them my vouse for them and they just took and the neighbors welcomed association welcome them. That was a real important part of the process is getting to be Wellco by community. Um a couple of snags that I think both the major homeown that we're working with the 200 project in this which is over under this. There's a couple of things that Sal could do to make things better, I think. And one is our land use process is preitionally ##ion the dividing our sou and I would guess vis probably agrees with that and gets more frustrated than we do the development then. And the other thing is the reimbursement process where you have offite improvements. The way it's it's uncertain and it's lengthy. Very lengthy compared to other cities. We want to make ourselves attractive to outside investment. We should look at a couple of those things and see if appro that. So just a couple of suggestions but these guys are the design team. Sit down. Thank you, John. So um, I think we'll go ahead and transition to kind over reviewing the design project and Lea it is nice to see a person first time realize after many months of communication. Um, so these types of projects they are. They do take a large range of teams sitting possible. So not just the vision from our clients to doordable housing, but also from making sure that we're partnering the sustainability partners all from the design side. Also Oregon and I think the relationship between, I think leading up to this conversation, this presentation today, a lot of the conversations um. Sl later really reolving what are the challenges with Landy processes. Shan indicated where is it really successful? Where is it a little challenging? All in all, I do think, uh. Working with a Ste samp a very child experience for us and I think I'mited to share through two review process and will. Um. So first, um. Whenever we get these sites, um, or early design and affordable housing projects for always buildingort fundingources before fully releasing design. Um. So generally we have about eight to twelve weeks to pull us pull together a package that is price, number of units are committed, the funding is committed. We do that in about twelve weeks. It's very preliminary and all of a sudden everybody's logkeged in. So whenever we start design, very first thing we do is evaluate areas from the preservation site constra for this particular site, it was relatively challenged from the standpoint",

We have some of those here that we can deploy to get more of the community programs and such. So what's my most interested in discussing is that criteria and just how do you take advantage of all these opportunities? You know, are there priorities? Is there sort of a holistic effort to help us all keep track of all these so we don't miss any? So glad to be here. Do we want to do a quick review of who's online? Sure. We have Jessica Rikers from Odo, Emily Salrii from Odo, Kyle Petraine from Energy Trust of Oregon. Sarah Buckwalter from Pacific for Joshua Basseafin from climate Solutions, who's interested in understanding what the options are for good resilience projects. Lee Elder from Pacific Core, interested in community benefits. Jennifer Jolly, hello Jennifer. From the Oregon Municipal Electric Utilities association, listening in on the conversation for member utilities who are eligible to apply. Emily Wagoner from Oregon Health Authority. She is at the session as power grid issues or of concern to the health and well being of people in her region, central and eastern Oregon, and hearing more about the just general resiliency concepts. Thomas Elsinga at Central Electric Cooperative, interested in where the program is going and how CEC can take advantage of the funds with shovel ready projects. Christine go lightly from Columbia River Intertribal Fish Commission. Michelle Deteiler, Renewable Hydrogen alliance in Portland interested in improving grid resilience and how hydrogen specifically can be a solution for that. Dean and Jack from the Columbia Basin Electric Cooperative interested in grant opportunities. Kip note David Evans and Association looking to learn how they can support co op clients. Apply for funding opportunities. Dave Modal from Energy Trust of Oregon interested in community energy resilience, federal funding and clean energy solutions and be aware from Energy Trust of Oregon interested in community energy resilience I know we have one additionalologants the wrong mapping. No worries ma want to get to here so I sat front of a residence for trepidationty alarm someoneably be scared. So Christine Medina, I'm the manager of stakeholder policy engagement for Pacific Corps and super thrill to be here. So thanks for having me. Yeah, thank you all. Oh, we have one more. Amy Schlessser with Odo policy analyst interested an intersection between community energy resilience grade monetization and clean energy transitions. Thank you all. Yeah. All right then. I think at this time we'll pass it over to Emily, who's joining us virtually today to provide a quick refresher on iija and for hundred l D funding. Good morning, everybody. Before I jump in, can everybody online and in the room hear me? Does Patricia need unmute her or can she unmute herself? Okay, it sounds like folks on online. I think we are having, we are having trouble hearing you in the in person session. I don't know if anyone virtually is I. Yesterday we didn't have any control in IM ourselves. Okay. O might need to unmute Emily. We can hear. Oh, so maybe we need to unmute one of ours so that we can. I apologize in advance if this causes feedback. So you'll probably have to put your, you probably have to put your computer's volume all the way down. Maybe mine is now muted. Okay, can anyone, how do we hear Emily Castine, can you hear me in the room? Okay, thanks, Emily. Yay. Love technology. Good morning, everybody. So happy to be here with you guys virtually. And we will jump into the meat of this conversation in just a little bit and talk about, you know, equity and those community benefits and of course, the scoring criteria that we really want your input on. But just to give a really quick refreshher on where this funding came from, the program was funded under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs act, also known as the IIJA. And the piece of legislation includes $62 billion for the US Department of Energy to deliver a more equitable, clean energy future for the american people by investing in american manufacturing and workers, expanding access to energy efficiency and clean energy for families, communities and businesses delivering reliable, clean and affordable power to more Americans and building the technologies of tomorrow through clean energy demonstrations. All right, and the purpose of the fund specifically for the 4101 D formula grant is going to be outlined by the Department of Energy. To improve the all hazards resilience of the electrical grid against disruptive events, generate the greatest community benefits, and reducing the likelihood and consequences of those disruptive events advance the Department of Energy's equity, Environmental and Energy justice priorities, including the Justice 40 initiative, which we'll talk a little bit more about a little bit further down the road here, and invest in America's workforce. All right? And the application was due. They've pushed the timeline a couple of times",

        "text": " more of a business contract between the state of Oregon, the energy facility siting council on behalf of the state of Oregon and the certificate holder. And then finally on this slide, we are fully fee funded in terms of our review process. So applicants pay for the entirety of our cost. That includes staffing the Department of Justice, any costs associated with the energy facility siting council, and any reimbursement to state agencies, local governments and tribal governments who help us in our review of projects. So next slide, please. So while people mostly focused on our applications and amendments, there are really three main components of what we do. And the first is applications and amendments. That's where we spend probably the majority of our time, and most people sort of see us doing that. But we have two other components as well. One of those is compliance. So from, you know, from the point that a project is approved all the way through the time that it is decommissioned and removed from the landscape, we evaluate all the conditions associated with each phase, pre construction, construction, operation and retirement. And our compliance staff evaluate each one of these projects at least annually to ensure that it is complying with the conditions of approval. And you can see in the background slides sometimes bad things do happen with projects, so. And that can take more time and more effort to kind of deal with those incidences that occur. And thirdly, we have our own rulemaking program. So the energy facility siting Council has different rules than the Oregon Department of Energy, and the authority of those rules fall to the energy facility sititing Council. So we have our own rulemaking coordinator and we have a pretty aggressive rulemaking program to evaluate different either procedural or substantive rules on an annual basis to try to make our process more clear and better for all part participants. Next slide, please. So before a state jurisdictional facility can be built in Oregon, the developer has to apply for a site certificate, but which facilities and what size of facilities come to the energy facility siting council are basically established through the definition that it is in the statute that's on the slide. So or 406 9311 defines energy facilities and the list of the facilities that are subject to f sector jurisdiction'quite, diverse. There is a lot of variation and each one of these standards or each one of these projects or types of projects has different thresholds. And I will get into some of the more significant ones that we're dealing with the next couple of slides. And I do have a slide on battery storage, which is not FC jurisdictional, but there'been some, there's some movement on that recently that's probably worth noting. Next slide, please. So over the past several years, there has been some change in the thresholds related to solar development. So you can see on the slide you have the location of where a project would be. And since the majority of projects, solar projects are located on exclusive farm usetonone land, the jurisdictional thresholds are really oriented towards productivity. So the higher productivity the land for agriculture, the quicker, the smaller the project before it comes to the energy facility siting council. So then you have high value being the most significant farmable. So think eastern Oregon winter wheat would be kind of in that farmable area. And then really non farmable ground could be based on soil type, it could be a different zone. And you can see prior to 2019, you in order to come to the energy facility siting council, the first two categories, anything over 100 acres would come to us. And then in the last one, anything over 320. There's been a significant movement in the last few years. So all the way till now, post 20,023 legislative session in House Bill 3179, not a huge difference in high value, still pretty small threshold before it comes to FSEEC at 240 acres. But now you can see on that farmable ground it's gone from 100 acres to essentially 4 sq. Mi, meaning local governments then have the ability to review projects up to 4 sq. Mi on farmable ground and then non farmable ground. Local governments have the ability to review projects up to 6 sq. Mi before it would automatically come to the energy facility siting council. Todd do you see developers following those and staying with the counties, or do they tend to default to the energy facility siting committee more often than they may be required to? Yeah, the statutes allow for opting in by the developers so developers can opt into FSEEC even though they're less than these automatic thresholds. And then local governments, primarily counties, can have some ability to defer to f sec. Thus far, none have in either circumstances. So we've yet to see that. Thank you. Next slide, please. All right, so you can see this slide breaks down kind of. These are only state",

I'm the senioring analysts for this project Yellow Rose bus energy center for the Department of Energy. So I am m work the Oregon Department of Energy. I am a sighting analyst that works on behalf of the energy facility sitighting council. And I first wanted to introduce my ono team that is also here. So Sarah Estersson is here in the room. She's our senior priv advisor's been with Odo for 20 years going on dying. Then another senioring I need this changes back out of the room. Chase McBay Walker. He's been with Odo for six years. Also a signing analyst. And then our administrative assistant is Nancy Hat. She'our call purpose go two for all things. And we'll be running the technical part of our meeting. Just so people in the room know we are also broadcasting this speing live. It is available on Webex, the webinar. And there are also opportunity for people to call in. So when we get to the comment period and'meeting, we'll open it up to the room first, the webex second, and then. But I would also like to introduce what we call our applicants from the yellow rose team and savia. And this is Jack Watson. He's going to co present with me tonight. He's going to present on the project itself on behalf of the Be applicant developer and I let him introduce his team. Ve got a team with. Yeah. Hi, everybody. Again, my name is. Push the button. Yeah. There you go. You're on. Alle's good. There we go. Hi, everyone. My name is jeff Watson. I'm a development manager at Savvy on energy and the lead developer on yellow rosebush. So I'm gonna go around the room here and introduce the Savvyion team. So starting with Mitch Taylor, who is our director of development for the Pacific Northwest and u ed m and a, we have Annica Solby, who is our director of permitting. We have, uh, let's see, Chris Powers, senior director of permitting. Adam Williams, who is our BP of, uh, excuse me, Bp of development in the west. And Gary Parker, to his right, our VP Ppc. So we also have Paul Hicks and Ash woods, who are joining us from tetrotech, who are our permanent consultant and working very closely through the, uh, photo process with us. So think I got everyone. Yeah. And that is the sav team. So excited to to tell you a little bit about the project and hear whatever questions or comments they have tonight. Thank you, j. So first couple things I might go over just general housekeeping. There are coffee, tea, lemonade, water. There were cookies. They might all got me out by the door in the lobby. And then the restrooms are passing front desk. Take a look, then take a ride and see the writing on the wall. Case of emergency, run out the stor. So that's just housekeeping. Um, let s see. Okay, so I'm going to go over our meeting agenda. The purpose of this meeting is really to give a little bit of information about the project and our process. U but it's really to allow the public to comment if they have comments or ask questions about the facility to facilities. So we're gonna keep the presentation side brief so that we can open it up for public comment as soon as possible. But there are some things I need to cover. One of them is just the energy facility site and process overview. As I mentioned, I work for the Department of Energy, the state of Oregon. We are the siting division and New York in support of the energy Facility Siting Council. It is the council that makes the decision to approve or deny an application for site certificate. So I'll go through our process of how the public can engage and participate in that process, and then we're going to go over a little bit on the project facility, and then I'm going to turn it over to Jeff, who will give more information on the host facility, and then we'll open it up for Q next slide. So, as I noted, this is an informational meeting. The informational meeting is intended to give the public an opportunity to make comments. It is not a contested case hearing and participation in this meeting. I'll get more into the contestic case when I get into our process, but participation in this meeting and making comment is not required in order preserve the right to standing or bring up ask to join into a contested case. We do ask that everybody hold their questions and comments to the end of the presentation. And then the last part is, you know, please just be respectful. We like to conduct ourselves",

        "text": " years, this would look, it would look very similar because this is at such a high macro level. But you're right, we are very dependent on that hydroelectric system, and it has made for relatively inexpensive energy for Oregon in the past. Does that answer your question? Oh, yes, it does. This is Kent. I have the nuclear that's up there. That's just because we're on the grid. Is that right? Yeah. Because none's being produced here. Yeah. So this is, so the energy flows in. So that's from Washington. And so that goes through BPA and a lot of the community owned utilities that get power from BPA. Some of it comes from nuclear. Yep. Okay. Yeah, sure. How. Yes. Could you explain a little bit more about the biomask category? Yeah, yeah. So biomass, so if we're looking at very little, biomass goes into generating electricity, but you can see quite a bit goes into industrial or residential consumption. And so. Yeah, so people heating their homes, using biomass, using, using wood to heat their homes, or some industrial process that use biomass as whether they're recycling some end use productidential. Well, I mean, there's quite a bit that goes into industrial consumption. Then if you look, see the biomass that goes into transportation, that would be something. If you're making biomass, making ethanol or making some kind of biofuel or something like that. So hopefully we're capturing all those end use fuels. Okay, thank you. All right, so we'll go to the next slide, please. All right. So even a simpler level, what are the major energy sources that are, that we're consuming within Oregon? So you can see another level, how much it comes from petroleum fuels, natural gas and hydroelectric power. And at those end resources, based on the, the different sectors we've got, how much is used by transportation, the residential sector, the industrial sector and the commercial sector, you can see transportation is the largest amount. Next slide, please. So this is the resources we used to generate electricity. Just focus on just electricity. And so this is what's generated within our state and what's generated outside of our state that's imported in. And so you can see hydropower, as we've noted, is a huge resource in the largest one, but we still use a lot of natural gas and coal to generate the electricity that we consume. So we have long term goals around from house Bill 2021, around decarbonizing. Our electricity sector. And so we go to the next slide. So that's going to require changing how we use, how we generate some of our electricity. And that could be with natural gas coming, coming decarbonized fuels incorporating renewable natural gas or hydrogen or could be electrifying or using other resources to generate more electricity. But this is just an idea of kind of the scale of the change that we're talking about. It's quite a bit of a change. And with electricity we're also talking about greater generation needing more of it as well as cleaning up the electricity that we're already using. So it's a robust challenge. Go to the next slide please. And with transportation, this is demonstrating all the different fuels we use. We kind to mentioned so those biofuels, ethanol and biodiesel. But for the most part, petroleum fuels really drive the transportation fuel use within our state. You can see gasoline and diesel make up the majority of it. So we do have goals around the clean FLS program and trying to decarbonize and reduce the emissions that come from transportation fuels. So if you go to the next slide, that does mean changing the way we use a lot of those fuels. And so this is again trying to demonstrate the big change that we would be talking about alternatives, whether that's turning to electrifying transportation or using low emission fuels or some kind of other alternative, maybe a biofuel. Okay, next slide please. And then we're talking about buildings. This is showing what we consume within buildings. And see, you can see it's dominated, as you probably recognize, bio electricity, natural gas and biomass. We talked about the majority of the fuel use we use within these buildings is critical. And so if we're talking about making some changes, there's some big changes to be had. It would have many cascading impacts if we were to electrify more of these applications or use other fuels to suppllic this consumption. So next slide please. So that was kind of a macro level view of energy in Oregon. So now we're going to talk about why an energy strategy. So in the 2022 bio Energy report, we took a look at a variety of different studies looking at decarbonizing energy within states. And we concluded that we've got a lot of existing programs and a lot of great work we're doing, but we need to make sure everything's directed kind of one direction. We need to",

And I want you guys having to sit around any longer than you need to you to turn. Can everybody hear that? Yep. Hear that? Okay. Test, test. Mike check. Mike check. Check. Check. Okay, we're good. Okay, folks, I think we're going to get started now. You're running already? All right. Good afternoon, everybody. Nancy, you got the slideshow up? Okay, well, thank you, everybody, for coming and want to echo what, what Todd Cornette said. We really appreciate everyone coming here. For the record, my name is Chase McVeigh Walker. I'm a senior sighting analyst with the Oregon Department of Energy, and I'm also joined by colleagues here. Jenny KZ, our communications director, is over there at the big monitor screen. We have Nancy Hatcher, division administrative assistant, in the back, and she's going to be helping go through the slides. And if you have any comment cards, please get them to Nancy and she'll bring them up here to us for Q and A after the presentation. Todd Cornette, assistant director of citing for the Oregon Department of Energy I'm also joined by Wally Adams, behind me, operations and policy analyst in the siting division. So today we're here to kick off the public information meeting for the Muddy Creek Energy park proposed project. Today. This info meeting, it's not a contested case hearing, but it is an opportunity to explain the notice of intent process and provide a general overview of the sighting process as well as a general overview of the Muddy Creek, the proposed facility, Muddy Creek Energy park. Next slide, please. Nancy. So an overall agenda for today, we're going to go over an energy facility sighting process overview, where the Oregon Department of Energy staff will provide overeps and process. Then we'll move on to the proposed facility overview, where the applicant will provide an overview of the proposed facility, and we'll conclude with a q and a session. This is where the public will have an opportunity to ask questions about the proposed facility and also about the review process. Next slide, please. Nancy. Okay, on May 19 of this year, the Oregon Department of Energy received a notice of intent. Let's see. I think if you want, if you want a comment card, they re over. Yeah, they're over at the beginning. So on May 19 of this year, the Oregon Department of Energy received a notice of intent to file an application for a site certificate for the Muddy Creek Energy park, which is being proposed as a 199 megawatt solar pv and battery storage project. The submission of the notice of intent is the very first step in the process of obtaining a site certificate from the Oregon Department of Energy's facility siding Council. The notice of intent was submitted by the applicant, Muddy Creek Energy Park, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of ANWa Q cells use core, who are also here tonight. I already mentioned I do want to reiterate that or request that please hold and the present material I want to get through and want to make sure that we have time for comments at the end of at the end of the meeting. Next slide, please. Nancy okay, so what is and who are the Oregon energy facility siting program? The siting division at the Oregon Department of Energy serves as technical staff in support of the energy facility siting Council review of both applications and amendments for site certificates as long as fall under energy facility siting Council jurisdiction the energy Facility Sing Council process is set forth in Oregon administrative rules and Oregon revised statutes and has a set of 16 general standards for review, citing division staff assist in the review and evaluation of all applicable energy facility siting council standards that must be met in order for an applicant to obtain a site certificate. Next slide, please. Before a jurisdictional facility is built in Oregon, the developer must apply for a site certificate from the facility siting council. The types of energy facilities subject to council jurisdiction are defined in Oregon Revised Statute 469 300, the definition of energy facility located within the Oregon revised statute. On the screen here is what establishes the jurisdiction for solar facilitiesi focus on high value farmland and is greater than 160 acres. It's subject to energy facility sign slide, please. The state Cing process is a standards based process. There are 16 general standards that every project has to meet and then some additional standards related to a specific type to specific types of projects in order to be approved. The process is s it's a burden of proof it's the applicant's burden of proof to provide",

I know just having worked a little bit with some of the USDA reap funding, and I know that various programs with certainly USDA and others have their own requirements on this question, so we'll look at that pretty closely. Ryan, thanks for bringing up the issue. So I think Rob may have some experience with some previous Odo programs, such as the red grants, and I don't know if that will inform part of what Rob has to, to say. Yeah, I was going to bring up the previous programs, and I think what you said, wendy, about scouring the bill a little more closely for a definitive answer is right for this question. But this program is a little different from previous programs where previous programs were kind of about market transformation and supporting a technology. And this program is a little different in that it's really about kind of some supporting communities, and it's a subtle difference, but it means that this program doesn't have to demonstrate that it was the sole reason a project moves forward. It's there to support these community projects. And that subtle difference may mean that projects can be in some level of construction throughout the process. But like Wendy said, we'll have a closer look in the rules or, and the statute. Well, I think we did also think a little bit as we were writing the rules that we could have a situation where a community or one of the entities, who's an applicant, eligible applicant, had installed solar pv already, but we're looking to add storage, to add resiliency. And that that would be a situation where there's a project that's combining the two. And so part of the project, in a sense, had happened earlier, but then more equipment would be added to, to the energy. Energy, I guess what facility? I'm struggling for the right word here, but the combination of solar and storage. So thank you for bringing that, that question up, Ray. And we will, like Rob said, kind of scour the, the bill and the rules more closely with that question in mind. Thank you. Next up is Spencer Meeks. And Spencer, you are off mute. Gota. Thank you. Can you hear me? Sure. Again, hey, I had a, probably a pretty quick one. And again, happy to follow up outside this meeting, too, but I was curious to know if you had any thoughts about how you plan on structuring outreach to build awareness for these funds and this ongoing project, given that the grants are going to be open. It seems to be in the March timef frme. It seems to me like that would be something better to do sooner than later. Or is it that you're beginning that outreach in March once these funds become available for applications? Really great question. And I actually met Spencer at the Oregon solar energy conference, and he was already thinking about outreach and shared some good thoughts on this topic. So we have been doing the type of outreach that Odo is kind of traditionally good at, reaching out to utility managers, reaching out to representatives from municipalities and counties. But this is one area where we need help. And we've been working with the advisory committee to help kind of sort out how we get the outreach to the communities that most need it and are most traditionally underserved. And so it's a work in progress. We plan to have outreach running continuously throughout the entire program, and we wanna start it as soon as possible. And I think we'll learn a lot from this first opportunity announcement to see how we can get the word spread to the communities that most need it. Thank you. Thanks, Spencer. It's one of the things that keeps me up at night, Spencer, making sure we do a good job of that. So we did have a question in the comment from Janess Reyes, who wanted to know if it was possible to provide captions and highlights from this meeting. Just so you know, we'll have to do a public a hearing officer report as part of our rulemaking process. Wendy will pull that together and that's something that will publish online on the community renewable energy program rulemaking page. I shared the link higher up in the comments, but you can also easily find it on our website. Thanks for the question. I don't see any of their hands up at this point. No, I don't either. They do like to come up as soon as we say that, though, so know. So we'll give it another minute or two. We're really glad to get all of this engagement and close reading of the rules, especially when we have a new program like this and we're creating all brand new rules. We really need to get a lot of eyes on them. So just maybe a couple of quick reminders. I have a few closing remarks, and if anybody else thinks of a comment in the meantime, please go or please raise your hand. So we want",

        "text": " Grail for the public hearing overview and then open up for the public hearing piece. Members of the public will be provided the opportunity to comment on the draft proposed order or the request for amendment one or both. Council will also have the opportunity to make comments about any concerns they have and the certificate holder who is also here in the room, we have representatives from obsidian Renewable will also be provided opportunity to respond to comments or provide additional comment of their own. Next slide. So just very briefly, I just want to give the public piece of the Energy facility Council, or what we call FSEEC review process. It's a consolidated review. We have a seven member body of the FSEEC council, their governor appointed, Senate confirmed. They represent diverse array of geographies and backgrounds, and they are the decision making body for a site certificate. So members of council, council, this is part of a council meeting and some of our members are here with us in person, and other ones are on the phone while citing division staff, which is me. I work for the Oregon Department of Energy. We make recommendations to our council, but council is the decision making body and I think that's the important thing to emphasize. Next slide. So this graphic shows our citing process for an amendment request. The certificate holder filed a preliminary request for amendment and we issued a public notice, and those things happened back in April, and those things were posted on the Internet, on the project webpage, and that's the preliminary request for amendment. It's the certificate holders, basically documentation that they submit to us saying, we would like to come in for an amendment. This is what we're asking for. And then it's up to us, as the department to review that information, determine whether or not it's complete, what type of review process it needs to follow. We go through completeness, and then we will basically determine a request for amendment complete, and a complete RFA will be filed. So we are in a type A amendment process. And the one key distinction in that is that there is a public hearing requirement, and that's why we're here in your community today, to have that public hearing as part of the amendment. So after we request for additional information and review of the original preliminary amendment request, we determined that to be complete and requested that the applicants submit a complete RFA request for amendment. This is their first amendment request on the site certificate at the end July 28, and they completed all their documentation, resubmitted it to us, and we deemed it complete. We also issued the draft proposed order, which is the next step as we take all the application after complete and the department puts it through our review process and we issue a draft proposed order. And that is also noticed. We had a public notice that went out. It was mailed to adjacent landowners and property owners and posted on our website and sent out through our electronic noticing system. And we prepared the draft proposed order. And that is what we are here today on is having the public hearing on both the complete request for amendment and the draft proposed order that the department prepared so that public comment period opened on August 1 and it will close at the end of this meeting tonight. And you have opportunities as members of the public to submit comments through various venues, can be through the Internet, can be through email, it's all in the public notice. You can do it in a comment card today. You can write it down on a piece of hate paper and hand it to me before the end of this meeting. You can also just make it as an oral statement. When we get to the oral testimony piece and it all becomes part of that, that process, we then issue, we take all that information and we take what comes out of the public comment period, the hearing tonight, comments that we get from council and we prepare, as Todd had explained, a draft of a proposed order. And we're, we again, that's the department's document and then we will bring it back to council for review. And during, when we issue the proposed order, we also issue a notice of an opportunity to participate in a contested case. And it's built into our process. But one thing that I want to stress is that only the persons that have raised a relevant issue in the comment period, the public comment period on this draft proposed order can participate in a contested case. So if you feel that it's important, it's important that those comments get made, they get made within this comment period, they're put on the record and that they relate to our standards because we are a standards based review process. That is the scope of our review. Once all of those things happen at the end, the very last step is the final order in the decision on a site certificate. And that decision is entirely in the hands of councilsel determines whether they will approve the site certificate and whether they will adopt the final order. They",

        "text": " again, only an emergency situation. So they're sitting there we have a program that we would love to talk with city Salanam is if you incorporate some more of these batteries, they're basically little many generating plants because on the hottest days of the year and the coldest days of the year, we would tap into that energy. If you're not using it, of course we would tap into that energy and it would help us with our loads. So those are the kind of conversations we'd love to have with you about how do we have city of Salem kind of engage in those kinds of programs and there are resources available for us to do that. Is that what I understand? Yes. And we. There is resources available and there's resources available, and we can certainly talk about that. Thank you. Any other questions for Wendy? I'm not following. The Muni tariff. And what is that? That is, in essence, it's a communityide, community wide renewable program. So every resident and business would be opted into the community wide program, so everyone would be getting their energy from a renewable source. So as I understand it, please correct me if I'm wrong, Wendy. Basically, council would set a policy that we are a community tariff community, and so you re, instead of opting in, members would have to opt out. So it basically just reverses it from. Into an opt out. So by default, your renewable energy as opposed to. By default, you're the general Max. Is that accurate, Wendy? Yes. Yes. Great. Yes. PG provided a very brief overview on the tariff program. I think it was September of last year. Was right about the time you were getting here. You were t. Not that meeting. I don't think. If you were you, does it provide some revenue for projects? Yes. There you go. I'm in. Yes, that is part of it. And the city, again, Mayor Hori is correct. The city would set up the policy and how it would identify the projects that it wanted to invest in. And I think it kind of getsse. Yeah. And then we would be able to identify, you know, otherwise, it's just planning. It's just all very nice things to say. Right. When's the timeline for that? Next year. Again, we're putting up, we were in development, but because of the IRP and, and we have our short term action plans. We're putting out an RFP in 2023. And those projects, potential projects aren't identified until the spring of 2024. We anticipate that in 2024 we'll move forward on understanding the short term, what those projects are. We'll look at the summer of 2024 for that program. Perfect. Thank you. Any other questions? Well, thank you very much, Wendy. We really appreciate it. Thank you. And just so you know, you guys are doing awesome. We love salem. You're awesome to work with and you're an awesome community. So I'm always here to answer questions. I will follow up with you on the questions that you asked, executive summary as well as how does the Willow lake play into your overall because that could slightly change that and then also the storage project. So I'll follow up on those and send those along. Sounds great. Thanks. Bye bye bye. All right, plastic pollution and recycling modernization act that just screams Ryan zinc all let's talk trash. Let's talk trash if you want to the little thing on the bottom or the top y I'll youum my notes. Well, that works. Actually, I don't think I brought enough for everyone, but I do have slides to want to follow along and again has my notes so I guess I don't need to do introductions again. But I'm ryan, franchise administrator out of the Budget finance office. So just to be upront, my intent is not to give you a thorough understanding of this, but just a very high level just to introduce you to the idea of what's called the RMA or the Plastic Pollution and Recycling Modernization act. This is the result of Senate Bill 582 from the 2021 legislative session. And so we're now getting into the again, the result of that and the intent of that bill. And obviously happy to follow up with questions and information, additional information after this. Thank you. So this also is a direct tie in to the clientimate action plan. As the client action plan was being developed, the RMA was also in its early, early stages, you might even know embryo type stage. And so we included it as waste, as materials and waste number seven under objective two. So we were including that because we knew it was going to come, page 34 on appendix eight if you're interested. And then, so I'm going toa do just a brief. Yeah, go next slide. Thank you. So big change is coming. I apolog.",

        "text": " is kind of confusing. If you're looking at it, you're like, you kind of have to stare at the legend and stare at the map for a while to kind of parse through what's going on. So here in RFA two, they're proposing a couple alternatives. So this is the Rock Rock Creek alternatives. And these are basically alternatives for them to pick where to move, where to transition the ASC approved route down into the Morgan Lake alternative. So these are, they're giving you a couple options, but then, so these are microsiding area additions. And then the yellow line is the expanded site boundary. So if approved, no facility components are going to go out here. Right here. Right. Wait, hold me from my mouse right there. No facility components, no roads, no transmission towers go in that expanded area. It's just an area that's evaluated. If approved, they would only be approved to locate the roads and the routes in the previously approved areas, microsightiting areas, which are the two gray areas, and if approved, those two new route alternatives or microsightiting areas. Okay. So I hope that helps. We can stop this council have any questions about that? Because we can talk about it at next meeting too. But I just want to make sure we're than ye Cindy Condan, for the record, just a question. You said that they're giving us. Can you go back to that slide? They're with the alternatives. They're giving us some alternatives. Really. We're evaluating the alternatives. We're not choosing alternatives. Correct. Thank you. However, if it's possible you could approve blank blank blank alternative and then if one of the alternatives didn't meet a standard, you do have an option of saying, you know, approve blank blank blank alternative. And because this one alternative doesn't meet a particular standard for such and such reason, you could not approve one of the alternatives. Right. But our job is just does it meet the standard? Correct. Right. Ye o, yeah. Not giving you, sorry. Giving you the options. Thank you. Okay. So that is separating definitions, application of definitions in council'rules, and then the second part is very similar to RFA one. We're adding on alternatives. And this is very similar to RFA one. They are adding on. They're not saying we're not going to do, you know, like we're going to remove these as options. They are re still just adding on options. So one of the ways that I like to discuss like obviously, where's my notes? There we go. Okay. One of the ways we talk about it is that it's additive. Right. They're adding on, adding on options for where to finally locate the transmission line. So it's, so, and when we look at that, we're also then adding on acreage, adding on site boundary. However, by logic, it'they're, not going to build out all those routes or ro roads. It ultimately the final design and final facility is going to be, you know, like it's going to shrink in actual impacts and acreage and ultimately only one route or combo of routes will be selected. Right. So, and let me, here it is. So I think, I don't want to misquot it. So, so if all of the RFA two routes were selected for construction instead of the portion of the route that they would be replacing. So if all RFA two routes were selected, the overall transmission line length would actually be reduced by 0.4 miles. So, like almost a half a mile. It would be shortened if all of those were selected. So that's just kind of conceptually they're adding on, but ultimately, it's only going to be one final route in a combo of routes that would be selected. This is a table. It's just a snippet. It's table two in the DPO. Starting on page 19, this lists out by county, the alternatives. Oh, I don't think. I told you. I think it's twelve transmission lines. So it's similar to RFA one, but it is. It's bigger, right? Bigger as in there's just more alternatives. Yeah. Twelve, like twelve locations, twelve route variations. And this table does a good job of identifying the route alternative by name, but then also identifies other changes. That would be micros citing area changes, like, are they moving around a multi use area, which is a construction area, or are they, you know, moving around or changing roads? And then it also provides a description for the addition, which the vast majority of these changes, the certificate holder says, are from ongoing coordination with landowners about the final placement of the transmission line or roads on their property, and a result of just final engineering as well. So they're proposing a midline capacitor station in Union county within the previously approved, what would be the microsighting area now, or site boundary. So",

If we had condition, if there were suitable conditions to speak to the land use. Land use water, not so much land use, I guess, but the water contamination, the end of life of the solar panels, those issues, conditions were applied that recognized that impossible possible solutions. The fact that it's efu conversion, is that the biggest? That biggest. That's the biggest and the foremost concern of our community, yes. We just can't keep taking farmland away. It, it is what makes Oregon what it is. The beauty of the farmland, the beauty of the timber, the beauty of the beaches. And that's our largest and most fore, foremost concern of continuing to take this and set and precedent for the entire Willamette Valley would be along that same line of thought. Once this is allowed, where does it stop? And is that up to this committee to make that determination? Where does it stop? 1600 acres today could be from it, our concerned and I don't wanna come across as. As a conspiracy theorist, but this could. This could continue on up the valley and. And take away that. That. That beauty and our farmlands in a follow up. Um, so. And I'm not sure which group. When you said you're representing a group, is that the community? Community at large, yes. So does the group recognize a solar facility that may have an end of life and council's requirement that it be returned to usable condition versus a building versus a, you know, distribution warehouse? Does the group kind of consider that aspect of it? Vice chair, cond. And we've taken that into consideration. It's a 35 year lease, if you will. And our concern there is that that land will not be. It'll take a long period of time to bring that and renew that land back to a farmable state, if there is such a word. There's a lot of theory that's going into this proposal, and we'll have to. I don't want to get too far down the weeds on that, but we don't see the practicality of what they're proposing. This is not a public. Okay. Okay. Sorry. So, to answer your question really quick, is, yes, we're taking that into consideration, but we don't see that as a reasonable return to where it was. Was 35 years. Is. That's. I live rural because I want my grandson to live rural. I'm gonna stop. Stop. And I probably went too far with my question. Is it specific? Yeah, I. We'll continue the discussion when it's time, when it's proper timing. Thank you, and thank you for your questions. I share Condan. Thank, appreciate the time. Once again, thanks. Anybody else in the room to comment? Doesn't look like it. So, Nancy, about the webinar and the phone, I do see that we have a hand raised at this time. Actually a couple. But let me go ahead and just remind everybody, first of all, how to raise your hands. So if you are on the webinar, at the bottom of the main window is a set of icons. Click on the participants, and at the bottom of right of the participant window is a hand icon. If you click on that hand, that will raise your hand. If you want to comment, and when you're finished, you can click it again to lower your hand. If you're participating on the phone, press star three on your telephone keypad to raise your hand. And when you have completed your comments, go ahead and press star three again on the keypad to lower your hand. So at this time, I see that Fujiriider has her hand raised, so I will go ahead and unmute your mic. Fuji, you are open and ready to comment. Good morning. Can you hear me okay? Yes. Okay, great. U I just have a, I have a couple comments on two different topical areas here, public comment period. And there is another person sitting next to me that will go after me, but we only have one computer hand raised, just so you know. Miss Crider, Cr could we get your address as well? Yes. Gotcha. My name is Fuji Crider. Fujikreider, 60366 Marvin Road, Lagrand, Oregon. Thank you so. Okay. You're welcome. The first one is more just a comment or an inquiry. I guess it's just a follow up from last month's hearing on conttested case rulemaking. At that hearing, I shared a few experiences going through a large contested case. And at that hearing, I told you at that point, I explained experiences. And then I told you that stop b two H coalition would be submitting much more detailed comments as soon",

        "text": " there, on the water continuum, which there is really no good source of state funding, but the water resource department at least has an inkling of an idea that you have planning, feasibility and implementation. And I mentioned that because I think with energy projects, particularly with our folks, who many of them are not as versed as folks like Les or Mark Salacher from, from three sisters, and so they don't even really know where, where to start. And for them, there may be a lot of stuff between the planning and the construction piece that they may have questions on kind of as we go forward. And I do know that for our folks, when they're looking at, for example, federal infrastructure funding, that the term shovel ready is something that can be problematic for some of them because they're like, well, we're almost ready to go, but we need x, Y and z. And I, I can get from an agency perspective where you have a time limit on the money, you want to make sure that that's being allocated. But I think as hopefully we get a lot more interest in this program and you guys start to get questions in advance of the application deadline, if there's a need for us to have some further discussions or provide additional information on kind of where that line is in that. Are you ready for a construction or, you know, what sorts of things do you guys need to have for that to be a successful application? Because I think there may be some situations where people are almost ready to go, but there may be something, let's, let's just say hypothetically, maybe there's a land use issue or something like that. Would that eliminate someone from being eligible for a construction grant or not. Jed laughs because he knows what I'm talking about, which hopefully is not something we have more of, but occasionally does does happen. So, and I want this program to be successful because I do think it's both something that our folks can use, but also something that will help further the state's goals around community energy resilience. That's a really good point. We'll keep in touch. James, we remind me, are we going toa be looking for completeness and applications like as we go or just like toward the deadline or how's that going to work? It'll be, we won't be reviewing the applications when they come in because people can always kind of withdraw them, resubmit them, amend them. So, so we were do doing that completeness review at the end. But if people have questions about what they've submitted, then we're happy to kind of answer. And if that kind of, if they questions like does this meet likelyly what you need? And like as documentation, then I'm sure we'd be happy to kind of go through it. And I could imagine a scenario, although maybe I shouldn't imagine a scenario where we like, get one and we're like, hey, this seems more like planning, or this seems like maybe, maybe project, you know, and we could then talk to them about updating that application for the next round. And since we'll be periodically doing the reviews, it shouldn't be too much of a delay. But I can also let you know as we're like, seeing them and if there's any themes that we need some work on. If I put my former funder hat back on for a second, you know, the two thoughts about that. One is, you know, not everybody knows what they're doing, right? And so being able to advise folks like, oh, you know, we see the project development processes being, you know, from a to b to c and sometimes a detour over to g and then back to, you know, f or whatever it is, you know, and it might be helpful in your application, do that to, you know, specify in your application how you're moving through these things or whatever it is. My point there is being able to communicate with people that are applying. When I was at energy trust, like, you know, we had the same goals. We want people to be successful in applying for things. And so, you know, we were very open to helping folks. Like, this is what you want to do. Like, here's how you go from a to b. I know that's not, you know, maybe an apples to apples comparison with what this program is, but just lagging that. And then the second piece is, you know, keeping that same hat on for your perspective. I was always encouraging folks to think about the process and like discrete chunks and like not try to go from all the way from a to z in one application. Think about like how do you go from a to c, make sure it still makes sense, come back, you know, and then go from d to e, you know, and see where things are going to require extra time, where stuff starts to fall apart, you know. So I would just say,",

        "text": " is like, still very early in the process. The statute doesn't become effective until the start of 2024, and our rules could not become effective before then as well. So this is kind of still early in the information gathering. Okay. One question I had is with the, you talked about separating solar and storage. I'm assuming that means application process as well. Would storage have. It doesn't actually, Trisha. No. So the application would come in the same way with solar plus storage. So if somebody's getting both, storage is not like a separate add on. They have to be sort of purchased together, but they can be installed separately. Is, is the change in statute and really it's to solve a problem we heard about with, with solar materials being more available, but storage, sometimes the battery taking longer to come in due to supply chain issues. And so not having. The idea really is to figure out how can we make it so that installers aren't on the hook, sort of waiting for that storage to come in to get paid for the solar piece of the rebate, if that makes sense. Gotcha. Okay. Yep. But you can go on. I just didn't want you to, like, you may like, go on with the assumption that was not the case. That makes sense. Oh, well, all I was going to say in that regards is if the storage applications would have its own separate queue. So that I know you were thinking about increasing the overall, like, application queue for the contractor of how many they can have at a time. And I was just wondering, you know, if they were going to be separated, if there'd be a storage queue and then a solar queue so that you can kind of separate the storage is going to be set aside and it's not going to affect other amount of applications that you can have coming in, but it sounds like it's going to be in the same queue. So if you pay out, if you do the split payment and the like, the contractor is having to wait on the storage. Typically, if I can remember correctly, because it's been a while, but an application is considered in your queue until it's completed. So wouldn't that add to if we're paid out solar, but you're still waiting to pay out storage, but in the meantime, the contractor is having to count that as part of their queue. Just something for thought. Yeah. Yeah. That's why we have the third option there. Like maybe that, that's another place where we can increase the cap or something. You might be ono an idea here with like, okay, you're waiting for storage. So maybe there's sort of a. You're moving into like a different queue or something. That might be an interesting idea for us to think about. Right, James? Or maybe even just put a different type of status that moves it out in power clerk. So it's not part of a queue anymore, but it goes into a separate status. I don't know how it works, but. Me neither, Trica. But Katie and Dale and James can talk about that, but I think that that that's what we're kind of getting out with that number three. Okay. Okay. Yep. So thanks for the thoughts. That's really great. Yep. And we had somebody in the quubue, but they're gone. Frankie G. I guess your question must be answered. So with that, I don't see. I do see one new. Oh, Frankie went into the chat. There we go. They're wondering if the vendors be different companies. Like would they be able to hire a contractor for solar panel installation and then on their own purchase of andium flow battery from a different vendor, and if so, reimbursed or would the payment go to store? And does that question make sense to you can look at in the chat too. So the. It's a little different difficult with out necessary bit more context. But them rebates are only able to be applied for by an eligible contractor. So the contractor would be applying for the rebate and having purchased the solar and the storage system together. So I need to dive into the specifics of what we say in the rule, but the, I need to kind of look back at that. But it basically would be the same company, um, that would be installing the same contractor. I think the question might be, does it need to be the same supplier for the solar panels? Is for the storage is how I read the question, which I assume different. Yeah, I don't think Frank can try again with the raised handn and we can get them off mute if that'd be helpful, because I think we are. Yeah, let's go ahead and, and bring in Frankie. You're off from you addressing my question. I'm not a contractor. I'm just, I guess one of those non LMI people, just a residential person. Homeowner who is interested in",

        "text": ", not yet constructed. They requested time extension to begin construction through 2025. It'their February 2025 will be their new time only to begin construction. Earlier this month we received amendment number four, requested to increase the solar components from 50, adding 156 battery storage. Don't have not looked at the details. I believe a lot of that new area would be on the site of the coinate cor. Next on my list is the Muddy Creek energy project. So at the last council meeting, we spent some time providing comments that were submitted directly to some council members and we talked about those comments were outside public comment period. Since they were specific to a couple of council members, it was important that we provided those to all council members as well as the applicant to make sure you know that there are no procedural te associated with project. So we did that think that was exactly what needed to be done. And then lingering question that was asked by council member was council members, was were those comments part of the decision record or not? And um, our DOJ counsel Patrick Gr indicated that he would do a little more research and come back to council and provide you with that information as to whether that constituted being part of the decision record or not. An alternative to patrickers. Follow. Thanks, DOJ. So, as we discussed at the last meeting, there's the difficulty that comments made separately to council members pos there's at least two difficulties that that poses. One, the applicant not yet. You're the decision makers. In fairness, the applicant needs to be able to review and respond and provide their input. Would need to if they were to be made part of the decision making record. And second, from an administrative standpoint, it's difficult for staff if you were to get a lot of those types of comments, whether they be provided to you separately, as they were last month, or if they were to be provided just as part of public comments during one of your regular meetings. If those comments had to be part of the decision making record, staff would then have to keep track of that, make sure they got into the record, and also allow the applicant to respond to those comments. We have a process that's in place right now for comments. Project specific comments there are two opportunities. One is through the when the notice intent is issued, the public has given an opportunity. Those comments are made part of your decision making record and then, of course, on the draft proposed order, public comments, project specific comments are made part of the record. The applicant is given an opportunity to respond. Staff evaluates and provides you their input. There is nothing in your rules that requires separate comments made, comments made separately to you, or comments made during the course of public meeting, one of your regular meetings that requires you to make those part of the decision making record. I want to point out that Oregon public meetings law requires that the public be able to observe and monitor public meetings. There's nothing in Oregon public meetings law that requires you to accept public comments during a meeting. You have a rule, FEC itself has a rule that says during a public meeting you will take comments from the public of matters of concern, except for those matters that are closed that you have indicated in the notice are closed to public comments. So the practice has been once a matter goes into contested case, we indicate in the notice you're no longer accepting comments on that matter, even during a public meeting. We haven't done that for matters that are just open, that for projects for which there's an application but have yet to go to public comment, people can come in and provide comments on those projects. The question is whether or not those comments are made part of the decision making record, meaning the record that the staff considers when they're preparing a DPO and that you ultimately consider when you're making your decision. There's nothing that would require you to make such comments that are, that are made during one of these meetings that are made separately to you, part of that decision making record. And as I mentioned just a moment ago, it would be problematic to do so from a fairness standpoint for the applicant and from an administrative standpoint for staff council. Cond thank you. Record. So just a question from the public point of view, what then is the purpose? It's not part of the decision making record. What's the purpose of the public portal? Provide public comment or I guess it's unclear to me. Step sure. Um, so for the record, talkne council, I think I want to make sure that we're talking about the same thing. So there is public comment period during council meeting. That's where, you know, outside of a contested case can provide information. It's a public meeting. You notice public meeting taking minutes for reporting it. Something comes in, we would notify applicant older hey, we got a public comment on your project. You might want to be aware of this.",

        "text": " We're talking with the legislators about it, as have several other folks. Commissioner Fi, did I miss anything that you want to cover on the last meeting? No, mayor, you did a great job of summarizing. I think the biggest takeaway for me was how the majority of the members were really ready and interested in having this conversations of the net tol revenue allocation piece and what that looked like. And I was also like, speaking of transit and the discussion when you all were just having just prior to this update, I think one of the biggest appetite for members or people participating in that meeting was how there probably perhaps should be a requirement or some type of expectation for the net revenue to somewhat be prioritized for cost effective test public transit improvements. And I think especially for folks in Clackamas county who really demonstrated their own deficit when it comes to transit, that was a big sort of tipping the hat towards them to say, we hear you, your transit deficits, and perhaps this net revenue discussion and prioritization should perhaps be focused on also cost effective public transit improvement. So that was, for me, that was a big takeaway. And, and I'm looking forward to, to be honest, how the discussion on OTC went. I didn't watch that meeting because the concert, Lois and John Isaac sort of compiled the notes from everyone and we'Renna take that summary to OTC to sort of say, this is what we've been hearing, this is what folks are saying and look forward to hearing what they heard at that table from OTC. So, no, mayor, you did a great job. And is this, is it to be continueing topic? I feel like, yeah, one thing I fort neglected to mention that they have four, they being Oda has four scenarios for tolling the Abernathy. One of them they threw out, which was basically the one that would maximize revenue because of the impact on the community surrounding because of diversion. So kind of, sort of, they know what the version is, but what really stick to one specific definition of diversion. They're looking right now at the one plan that would have pricing, would adjust due to demand and time, but would never exceed, I think, 275 each way and there will be no tolling overnight. But again, they're still doing an analysis that have. They will not commit to any one of these scenarios yet. But at least once thrown out the one that was the most expensive, the that would created the most diversion. So at least we won that one. So that's all I've got. Is Erion ready now? Stepven, I believe she is. There she is. Is look on camera and everything. Thanks for joining Uson. Hi, thank you for everyone who delayed on all the delay topics. I appreciate the buffer. So I don't know if you guys were done. I just thought I'd pop on my camera since I heard my name're up. Well, so J Pac trip first and then we'll talk legislative session. And I will say that I have not been able to attend a lot of the coordination meetings on the JPEG trip because there's also the state session that's happening. So I'm going to tag Steven and Jessica to help me in all of that. But as you all have, like we heard already, the dates for the trip this year have been moved up into May. So there May 13 through the 6th ##th which is, you know, a really fun budget time for all of us as local jurisdictions, which might make travel a little bit more challenging this year. We are trying to get a sense of how many folks are interested in coming out to the JPAC trip this year so we can set up our Washington county for success, but also talk about how we work our priorities into those conversations that get scheduled as part of the JPEG trip. So obviously, the first question is, is how many folks are interested in joining from your cities to attend that J Paact trip? And you can say, I don't know yet, but some hands have gone up already. So I'just trying to get a sense of that. So I don't know if those hands raised are I'm going, or I want to say something. So I'm just going to call on each of you to say words. Is Tim guys'hand up. I'be Tim, Steve and then me. All right, I'll say some words. I guess I was thinking about this, and do you have a sense of what the regional priorities for conversations are gonna be? Because I think it only makes sense for me to might raise my hand to go if I can help out with that conversation. And I suspect that's not the case, but I'm just trying to understand what the priorities are going to be and what kind of conversations you're looking to have. Yeah, I think we're still in the process of developing those priorities. So yes, there is. This is the",

I often travel over the mountains to go to Salem, but it didn't work out for me this week. So thanks for accommodating Zoom presentation, and also thanks to Commissioner Slater for bringing me to the meeting and getting this queued up, and to Shelby for making the technology work, at least so far. And I would like to share my screen, to share a few slides. These are slides from a presentation that I made to ASCE Senate Energy committee shortly after the small scale community based energy project study was completed. And there it's just, I think it's about six lines, and so we can move through them pretty quickly and then hopefully move into more of a discussion or, you know, Q and a if there's any, any questions. There'one piece of work regarding small scale renewable energy projects. But if you'd like to broaden the discussion beyond just what's in the study, that would be okay too. But I think perhaps the study is a good way to kick this off. So I'm going to comeempt to share the screen. My screen certainly got a different look about it. Are you all seeing a presentation? We're seeing the entire PowerPoint application, not like presenter mode. There we go. Allghty. Yes, the small scale community based study was completed last fall. And like I said, I'll go through these slides and then we can have a discussion if there are some questions of about broader small scale renewable energy development. Study came out of House Bill 2021, which directedgon Department of energy to convene a working group and cover barriers to project development, potential benefits of small scale projects, access and ownership opportunities, potential rate impacts, and also potential legislation that could hopefully address some of the barriers. And this is our representation on the work group. I won't go through this whole list. I know this is being recorded if anyone is interested in seeing who all was on there, but we had a lot of work group members. We had voices from every position within kind of a small scale discussion, including community group representatives, industry representatives from the solar, wind, andure industry. We had utility representatives, folks who are interested in evaluating rate impacts and making sure that rate impacts are not too great, that is, that these things don't cost an exorbitant amount. So I'll move on. We had four workshops and we focused basically on the areas that the statutory language directed us to look at. And that was ownership and access opportunities and barriers, benefits, costs and rate impacts. And finally we had a wrap up meeting to tie it all together. And one thing we learned was that one we brought in guest speakers to bring kind of some real life examples from actual projects. And we learned that that was very valuable for the workshop members to hear from folks who have actually been developing these projects at a small scale. And the other thing we learned was in that workshop for when it came to possible recommendations, when we have such a diverse work group, we had a really hard time getting a consensus on items. And so in some ways it was very valuable in that we had very diverse viewpoints and a lot of ideas that came out of the study. But we also, it was a bit of a detriment not being able to bring everybody together for definitive recommendations. I think that's the nature of a study that is essentially designed, have many, many stakeholders involved. You get a lot of great ideas, but maybe not cons on all of those ideas. Here were some of the key findings, and we kind of broke it up into opportunities that exist for these small scale, community based projects. And then also some of the barriers and some of the opportun opportunities of note were the opportunity to address some equity issues and have projects that bring local benefits to communities, not necessarily directly to utilities or private developers. One of the really good ones that we kind",

In addition to the water and energy resilience features, the school benefits from energy bill savings and EEB is also able to use the batteries to provide grid services during their day to day operations. Next slide please. This is a schematic diagram of the microgrid system showing the electric loads that can be served by the system during a power outage. The battery storage units and they're shown at the bottom in black, can be charged by the solar and natural gas generator, assuming that generator is available in the event of an earthquake. The water well and critical loads within the school are shown in green and the switch shown at the main breaker towards the top is a safety feature and that ensures that this microgrid is isolated from the rest of EWeb's distribution system and that's to protect linemen who are out working on disaster recovery. Now that the program is up and running, the agency has started to hire staff that will run the program from here. Pandian Krishnawami is on the line today and is our energy services manager and James KL has been leading the work on program nuts and bolts and we'll take over the presentation from here. Thanks Rob. So the program will provide grants for planning and constructing renewable energy and energy resilience projects. Opportunity announcements were posted on March 7 and there were four of them, one for each of the project categories. $12 million was made available between the four opportunity announcements, and more opportunity announcements will be announced after this round closes with additional funds. Online applications are now open. We will only be accepting applications through the online application. Next slide please. Opportunity announcements outline the minimum required information for a complete application, as well as detailing how applications will be scored during the review process. This includes required information about the project, the applicant and partners, and consultation with different stakeholders and groups following a review of applications to make sure they contain all the required information and are eligible for the program. The applications will undergo a competitive review process assessing the strength of the project and its feasibility, as well as how the project meets the program's priorities and targeted benefits. The score and criteria include topics such as the project leadership and involvement of environmental justice communities, jobs in economic development, direct energy cost savings for families and small businesses, inclusion of inclusive hiring and promotion policies, procurement of services from disadvantaged businesses, assisting with natural hazard mitigation plans, and geographic and project diversity. The grants will be awarded on a competitive basis. At this point, we don't know how many grants will be awarded and how the funding will be distributed across the four categories. How the funding will be distributed will depend on the number and strength of applications in different buckets, along with the required funding allocation, state and legislation next slide please so the online application is available now, and after we get to the slides I'll be able to kind of walk you through it, but you can access it from the Community Renewable Energy grant program webpage.

You can also access it from Oo's customer service portal by clicking the drop down and the financial incentives menu at the top. Next slide please before I get on to walking through the application, I wanted to just kind of talk about the process with applicants and this is kind of the flow charart shows. We've extended the deadline for applications until July 8 and if you have any questions about the opportunity announcements, please submit them by June 17. They gave me extendeded that deadline as well. This will allow staff time to respond and post answers online before the flows of the application period. There are resources on NREB website, the community renewable energy program website, including a checklist of information the applicants will need to gather, some q and a summarizing questions we've received so far from potential applicants and our responses to those, and also a list of resources that applicants may find helpful, particularly in demonstrating how the community fits one of the qualified community definitions or in terms of the resiliency benefits. Following the close of the application, they will be reviewed, after which the successful projects will be offered a performance agreement. While unsuccessful projects will be able to reapply in future opportunity announcements, applicants will be able to request up to 30% of the grant funding. Upon signing a performance agreement for the construction grants, the applicant must have taken meaningful steps to seek site control, filed the request for interconnection with a host utility or appropriate transmission provider and met any of the requirements provided by the department in the performance agreement to be eligible to receive that 30% following the signing of the performance agreement. Next slide, please. So thanks for listening and I'm going to brief briefly show you the application and then we'll be happy to take any questions you have regarding the program or any specific information you would like more detail on. So I will just share my screen now. 1 second so you should all be seeing the application portal where we can access",

        "text": " through our array, no problem. So, yeah, I'm here. I'm a servant of the public. Thank you. Okay. Carl's proxy. I'm sorry. My name is Joanna Witig, and I'm kind of around this area. A couple of questions for you, M train. Why is the project so large? Just from an economic standpoint, it makes more sense to build a project of the size, especially with the need in the area. We were able to find enough landowners who wanted to partner with us to size it this large. The substation itself can support that much capacity. So it's kind of just, we would size the project to how much land we can find. If we weren't able to find enough land, then we would have to either downsize the project or move it entirely. Is most electricity going to be going to Eugene Salem? Urban areas? It would go wherever the demand is needed. I assume is the urban areas. In your experiences that the urban areas. It's kind of hard to tell where it flows, but it would stay within the Willamette valley just because there's actually a demand needed, like there'actual demand in the locale. Okay. And s, you did studies with wildlife and that sort of thing, and you're aware, of course, that all these wildlife have a yearly, not a six month habitat rotation, migration patterns. And so what have you done to. Is your study going to be done in August and you're not going to do the when all the migrations? I can answer that. So our fish and wildlife standard requires. Well, I had mentioned before, but I'll mention it again. So our standard is actually references the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife's policies on fish and wildlife habitat. And we talked before about reviewing agencies. We work very closely with Oregon Department ofish and Wildlife. So we seek, at this point, their input on, based on this location, what are survey protocols? So the applicant doesn't get to decide that. It's the Oregon Department ofish and Wildlife decides that. Okay. And I have been unable to really follow, you know, may, I'm just a dumb farm girl, but I have been unable to follow what you were saying about the uses when they go to you instead of the land use law. I can read statutes happen to be able to do that. But are you telling me that for solar projects, they're conditional use and they do not have to follow if they go through you, they don't have to put any kind of agricultural use on these farmlands? What you said they don't have to do that for any project whether it's county or state. Now that doesn't mean that if they're going to take prime farmland out of production maybe if there's no habitat or no farmland mitigation plan maybe that doesn't justify approval so it really depends on the particular application so east side of the mountains where most of the projects that we've reviewed are, there is not much in the way of. There's a lot of upland wheat some of the areas are exclusive farm let me speak exclusive farm you ownwnd but they're not in active production so in that situation it's the same requirements, it's the same standard. Those may not require any kind of agricultural mitigation here if it's their argument to make it's not our argument to make, it's the applicant's argument to make and it's your also your ability review and provide comment that if they're going to take this farmland out of production can they do that and then just take it out of production or is there some mitigation requirements that are necessary in order to justify approving that? That's what this process is about so I'm not saying that they're not going to do that or they don't have to do that. The law does not require them absolutely to do that but that's probably as they've said and that's why they're talking about agrooltaics is I think they believe that that's required in order to justify this. But you're saying theoretically and I'm not talking about these cascades we all live in Lynn County. I want to know about this particular project. It could theoretically be approved without any kind of agricultural use. Is that what I'm hearing you say theoretically, yes. Thank you. So the Agar volttericss, that was done by mister. Higgins, Professor Higgins, how big was that? It was six acres. It's nowhere close to the size that you're talking about so can you. How is that go going toa work? I mean that's something you'ren have to look at and in this area and again, I'm not. So can you make spe. You make sure you speak into the mic so people on the own stupid retired attorney. So the bottom line is though, you can't tell me that six acres out of Woodburn is enough to say oh, this is gonna work so what are you gonna do? This is clay soil. It holds the water, it rots out a lot of roots on a lot of plants and, you know, grass seeds",

        "text": " expedited. That isn't intended to be a formal term, like it's an exptit, a review, or a special criteria facility. It just means that they would like the council'decision to be as soon as possible so they can begin construction as soon as possible. We have not made any changes to our public comm comment period, length or duration. And we have tried to give the council also as much time as you need to, to review the facility. Obviously, if you feel like you need more time, that is your decision. Thank you, mister secretary. For the record, Todd Cornett. We've been in communication recently with councilmb members about changing the May meeting. And so as Chris referenced expediting, essentially we were looking at what are the opportunities to try to get the, you know, this through the review process faster, assuming everything goes, no contested case, no significant comments that take lots of time, responses by the certificate holder that they then ask for additional time. So, assuming everything goes as smoothly as possible. This is also why we requested and sawght input on potential different dates for the May meeting. Because even though it extended out the main meeting by two weeks, that actually creates a little more space to get the facility potentially, or this amendment potentially a final decision by council earlier than it would have normally, just based on the way the deadlines hit. Rather than waiting until the June meeting, it allowed us to have potentially the council's review at the May meeting. So that's what Chris is referring to, than. Thank you, sor chair. ##or Counselor Grail, do you have just a follow up? Just, I do. And so, Christopher, this isn't for you, that's fine, I can wait for the certificate holder. So my question is, are they prepared to go to work immediately? If they're like, let's go, are we, are, are they ready? Council memberail? That is what they have indicated to us. Thank you. Um, yeah, I will say there, there is still pre construction compliance that will ll be on going after that, but I believe they have already started to prepare and get information ready. Thank you, Councilloorr Byyer. Thank you, vice chair Condon. Just to clarify, this is not to do away with any public comment opportunities. It puts different calendar for the council, but we have tried to build in extra time for the public to comment on all our proposals, because it gives the council a better information to make our decisions. So the word expedite is probably the wrong, the wrong word because we aren't short changing the public input, period. That's very important to us and we really value any of the comments that we get because you think of questions that we just don't think of. So thank you, Chris, for your presentation. And this is, you know, compared to our last amendment, this is a big expansion. And so it really is almost an evaluation of the project from almost ground zero in terms of the standards and the plans that are required to be updated. So thank you for your thorough review. You, Councillo Devlin, any further? No, not at this time. Madam Chair. Councillor Iams, anything further? Thank you, Mister Clark, for your presentation this evening. Thank you for Che on. There we go. This is the public hearing on the draft proposed order on the request for amendment one to Energy east site certificate I. Cindy Conden, vice chairr for this hearing today is March 21, 2024. The time is 714 pm. This public hearing is being held at an energy facility siting council meeting in person here in the Oxford room of the Oxford suites in Hermiston. This hearing is also being held via a webex webinar with a call in option for those who cannot participate in person or via webinar. Today's hearing is being recorded. The presentations, written comments and oral testimony are part of the decision record for the amendment request for the facility. The purpose of the public hearing is to provide an opportunity for the public reviewing agencies, council and the certificate holder, if they wish to do so, to present oral and written testimony on the amendment request and the department's draft proposed order. The 35 day record of the public hearing comment period on the draft proposed order includes the hearing tonight and is scheduled to close next Friday, April 4, 2024, at 05:00 p.m. pursuant to OAR 304 502703 667 parentheses, five, a and b please note the a person who intends to raise any issue that may be the basis for a contested case must raise the issue in person at the hearing or in a written comment submitted to the Department of Energy before the April 4, 2024 deadline andicity to afford the council, the department and the certificate holder an adequate opportunity to respond, including",

        "text": "All right, without further ado, thank you so much to all of you for being here for what is our second webinar for the County Energy Resilience grant program. My name is Hannah Sateen and I IMD County Energy Resilience program coordinator. And my co presenter today is Maxwell woods. And I'm going to let Max introduce himself. Well, thanks, Hannah, and hi, everybody. Thanks for joining us. My name is Max Woods. I am an assistant director at the Oregon Department of Energy and responsible for nuclear safety and energy security and emergency preparedness related to energy issues and the county grant program that we're here to talk about. So thanks. Yes, excellent. Yes. So we'll be talking about the county Energy resilience grant program today. Before we get going, I would like to do some introductions. So we have a couple other Odo staff members on the call. Alice Weston is our rural energy coordinator. You might have chatted with Alice about this program if you're in central Oregon or other Oto opportunities, but a great connection to make. As well as Lauren Rosenstein, she's our community equity and inclusion analyst'really. Happy to have these folks on the call. And either Alice or Lauren, if you could help watch the chat as we're going. I think Sarah's not with us yet, so just, yeah, awesome. Thank you so much. I would love to take this opportunity to see who we have in the room with us right now. So if you're comfortable, if you could drop your name and your organizational affiliation in the chat, we'd love to see who we have with us. Thanks so much. Excellent exc. I love seeing who's with us in the room. And also just one other ask if you're comfortable, if you can add your organizational affiliation to your name and your teams window or share it when you come on to ask a question. Just helpful context for us. So our presentation today will be about 25 minutes and then we'll save slightly more than half for our question and answer session. We will hold to the hour today, but we are available, I'm available as a resource at any point for further questions and answers. We can do phone, email, chat. It all works. Let's see. I'm trying to. Oh, if you have a question while we're presenting, if you can drop that in the chat or use the raise hand function, that would be really great. Lauren will be helping manage that for us. And then if you have a more substantive question, we just ask that you hold that until ##ill our question and answer session so we can kind of dig into the more substantive ones then. Al right. So I am going to move on to our first slide and pass it over to max. All right, well, thanks, Hannah. So before we kind of dive into the program details, we thought it would be helpful to give a, just a little background on who the Oregon Department of Energy is, who we are, what we do u this is sort of a standard slide. We put in most of our presentations just so folks understand the work that we do. We're a small state agency, about 120 fte at this point, which makes us a pretty small on the state agency scale. And you can kind of see there our mission and what we do, all the various programs and tasks and activities that we run kind of fall under this. I won't belabor at this point, but that's, that's who we are. Cann I why'you, go to the next slide, please. Okay, so here we have a definition, energy resilience in Oregon, sort of setting the stage, sort of the big picture thing. And so before we kind of dive in again, I thought we would maybe take a minute here to really think about the broader context of energy issues, energy resilience in the state, and kind of think about how the grant program fits into those broader issues. So just as a very starting point, the program is funded by the Oregon legislature. The authorizing statute, which is HP 3630 from 2023 legislative session, sort of is, is the grounding of what this program is all about, where the funding comes from. And a lot of the details are in that piece of legislation. But one thing that's not in that legislation is a specific definition of energy resilience. So we have a good working definition that we use around Odo and in state government. And it sort of there on the screen. Um, but your county can certainly choose a different definition to guide your energy resilience plan development. If you choose, you can sort of use this model. You don'really. Even need a definition. But we think it's a good idea to come up with the starting place and sort of a guiding definition is helpful when I work on various programs and projects to make sure that we're sort of coming back to the true intention of what we're trying to",

        "text": " guess I should have said this at the beginning. Hello. Ben Duncan. He, him. Pronouns with Kearns and Wests. I'm a facilitation lead for our team'm, joined by Gilly Garber. Yant is doing process support. I don't know. Go. You want to jump on screen and wave to the. Let me see your face. There you are. Hi, everyone. So Gilly's also here. If there's any technical issues, he can help support you, but he'll make sure that things are running smoothly today. Thanks. Go next slide back to you, Edis. Thanks. So, yeah, I'll jump back in. So I just want to start at the kind of the starting point, which is the bill that. Dr. The Oregon Department of Energy to undertake this project. So HB 3630 directs us to develop a state energy strategy, identifying pathways to achieve Oregon's energy policy objectives. And it's very clear from the bill, and we're taking this very seriously, that this needs to be informed by stakeholder perspectives, and it needs to draw from existing resource plans, energy related studies, essentially the existing work that's already been done or is ongoing in our state and our region. It's also important to emphasize that it's not just about identifying pathways to achieving our energy policy objectives. The benefit of this process is to understand the trade offs of different pathways and to understand the benefits that can flow from different approaches and the costs. And so this bottom part of the slide here lays out the way that the bill kind of lays some of this out. The different factors that we need to take into account things like cost efficiencies, the feasibility and availability of different energy resources and technologies. We'll be looking at economic and employment impacts. We'll be considering energy burden, affordability, environmental justice, and community impacts and benefits. We also have a land use and natural resources group. That's not a coincidence. We'll be having discussions in that group about impacts and considerations in those areas. And we'll also be looking at energy resilience, at security, and some of the work that's happening around the region, very important work on markets. I just want to pause here for a second, because there was a question in the chat on kind of what the working groups role is here. And I think it's important to emphasize that the working groups play a really important role here. So the working groups are essentially helping us make informed decisions. So in any given group, as Ben pointed out, it's very likely that we won't have full agreement on any one decision. But what we hear and the feedback that we get and the conversation that we have in those groups and the information that you can share will help us ensure that we have the best information available, that we've listened to all perspectives. And then ultimately ODA will take that on and present a recommendation for how we move forward. And that's something that we'll talk about in our August 22 meeting when we bring all the working groups back together. We'll do some synthesis. After we've broken out in little groups, we'll all come back together and have an opportunity to see the big picture, since there's a lot of overlap, obviously, between the topics. So they're not really separate. They're all interconnected. And we'll also, we also have an advisory group. The advisory group met for the first time last week. That meeting is recorded. All of these meetings are open and available for folks to join live or watch a recording, view presentations afterwards. And the advisory group will be another place where, again, after we've worked through this with the working groups and we've had our August 22 meeting, we'll take on board what we hear in that meeting, and we'll present it to the advisory group for their feedback. So we've designed an engagement process with kind of multiple points of engagement, multiple points of kind of feeding back what we've heard, synthesizing and collecting feedback on what folks think about where we've landed after we've taken on all of those comments. So I hope that that's a helpful explanation to describe a little bit in more detail how we plan to, to take on board what we hear in the working groups. If we go to the next slide, please. So the bill talks about pathways to meeting our state's energy policy objectives, but it's not defined. And so I just want to lay out how we're thinking about this here. So the focus here is on clean energy and climate policies, since those are really driving a very important and fundamental transformation in how we produce and consume energy and interact with the energy system. So we have an economy wide target set by executive order 200 four of at least an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. HB 2021 sets a 100% clean electricity standard for our state's biggest ious by 2040. And we have the climate protection program, which we're following the rulemaking for closely, which sets a 90% greenhouse gas emissions reduction",

So we don't go to the trade shows in the Bay Area or do recruitment trips to see site selectors in Atlanta or what have you. We're just not in that business. But Greater Portland Inc. Has to be much more selective. So we are really, I'm going to use the term more agnostic. I don't know if that's the right term or not. We are very pleased to see food production, manufacturing. We now have a company that's in the machinery production for Frito Lay, for example. There's a company that's doing work for Frito lay, produces some of the machinery that's used for them and for Quaker oats. We've got a company that's doing work for SpaceX that's gonna be growing another 35,000 sqft right very soon. And that's just the beginning of what we really want to see. So we'd love to see some batteries. We don't have batteries. And cleant tech all that much in Sherwood at this point. So we're really very much open when we see a project list or a project inquiry coming from either business. Oregon for Greater Portland Inck. If it generally looks like it's gonna meet our land ability, which in most cases it doesn't, we just have to turn away a lot of stuff. But we're gonna submit. We'll spend time submitting for it and with our development partners and try to see if we could qualify. And it doesn't have to be semiconductor and that type of thing, as long as it's some kind of traded sector. We're very much open to clean traded sector companies. So maybe Nick. Nick has some. Nick has some thoughts on that. Quick thoughts though, I will go ahead and say as, as a proxy member of this meeting, I will also loop back around with Brett Bruce and make sure that he sends his notes to you as well. I know, but uh, certainly agree with, with uh, Collins comments and do appreciate the comments of, of Kirk and Suzannea as well, I think. Especially as they relate to land availability and site readiness in, within my purview in the business attraction space on a regional level. You know, I don't have any, any suggested edits to the language there on some of the, the goals and deliverables. I'll think on it. But I do want to emphasize the, the importance of time to market as a, as uh. A meaningful and compelling way to keep Sherwood sites on site selectors and on companies lists as they evaluate Sherwood and the region, um, for, for future investment. And that comes down to how quickly, um, you know, you can get a site annexed or how quickly you can move through a permitting process, because time is money, as we all know. Um, so I, I think that, you know, priorit prioritizing those things make sense and I think we'll stand the test of time. To Collins s comment about trends and. Yeah, I think. Let me think on a little bit more, Bruce, and get back to you, if that's okay. I'mean to put you on the spot. I just started to think I d start calling on folks to see what their thoughts are. Who have I not called on yet? Who would maybe like to comment? I'll jump in. This is Lee from DLCD, just following up on Nick's comment. There is a requirement that cities in metropolitan planning areas keep 25% of their employment, land supply and short term supply. But I can tell you from my desk that I don't see a lot of cities who are actually keeping up with that. And the more that you can emphasize continually moving through that cycle of bringing these sites to market consistently, the better position you'll be in to benefit from all of the economic opportunities that are coming, both through state and federal investments on the horizon. So I think that. I think that would be an excellent policy to make sure is included in your EOA, but also one that maybe has some enforcement chops in it locally, because that's where we often see a slowdown. Okay, good. Yeah, that's a great point, Lee, because that's what we run into all the time, is people always underestimate how long it's going to take them to actually get a site truly online and available. And even the pros developers underestimate it. So a company where it's not their core line of business. Absolutely. And yeah, I really like Lee Collins and Nick'points a lot. Colin talked about flexibility, and I do find that in the current EI development code or code for that particular zone, there are a lot more restrictive industrial zones out there that Sherwood should really stay away from. There are some municipalities that just say no distribution. And as a developer, it's really hard to make that investment if you come across particular uses that are just outright not permitted building mean the buildings behind me, which is",

        "text": " makes sense. Yeah. So that one, we could potentially move forward sooner. Great. Okay. Ian, 30 and en nine. These are the two that, although they're worded slightly differently and they actually had different timelines to start, I did confirm they're the same task. So work with PGE to design and adopt a community wide clean energy program, or a green power rate, as Hean 30 says. So PGE actually came, and I think it was the same meeting that energy trust joined. And they gave a very high level overview of what is a new potential umbrella green tariff program that's actually kind of baked into Housevill 2021. And that's the bill that set pretty stringent clean energy targets for Pacific power in PGE. So this community supported renewables tariff program is in that bill language, as well as an option for the utilities to come up with. And what that would be for communities is it is a higher rate. If a community is interested and we sign, we go through and sign a participation agreement with PGE that's pretty detailed, then we would potentially have a higher rate across the city. That would be an opt out for folks. So it would require, again, a lot of communication, a lot of discussion up front. And then there were, you know, folks of low income would not be. They would be automatically enrolled without the extra fee'my, understanding. But there's a lot of details that PG is still working to work through. So we met with PGE recently, a few of us, and they confirmed that the program is still under development. They're still working through the bones of what this tariff might look like. The next step, as I understand, PGE submits to the Oregon Public Utilities Commission their clean energy plan, which outlines their plan forward to meet the targets in house Bill 2021. And I think it is supposed to include kind of the basic framework for this new tariff program as well. So once that plan is submitted, and they'd mentioned March. So I need to keep my eyes open, see if that gets submitted. I think it's going to be several months, is what they're expecting before the PUC would approve that plan in a program. And then they would start having conversations with communities, individual communities in PGE and Pacific Power service Terr territory to see if, to gauge interest in this tariff program for their community. So would need to be approved by city council before it would even need to go forward. Okay, so we'll stay tuned to see what that work looks like at the PUC level. Yeah, I'm going to start watching and see when that gets submitted and checking in with kind of other folks. Other cities are watching this as well. What would the money go? Green energy efforts. Yeah, there s. There would be, again, it's still being fleshed out, but basically to support local renewable energy projects. And I think that could be like hyper localcal, potentially like in Salem, some small scale projects, maybe like with battery. I think we could, you know, depending on the agreement, we could potentially work with PG in kind of focus areas of where they might go if we so choose. Otherwise, money can just go to kind of more regional projects. It's really, I think right now, sounds pretty darn flexible. That's how I understood it as well. Yeah. Something we'd want to work through in pretty good detail. So interesting. Thank you. All right, so, Ian, 14 3rd from the top. A weatherization program prioritizing low income. And that was low income renters, homeowners and businesses, per the full language. This one was on our early implementation list. I didn't pull it over to our work plan, primarily because the city's not really the lead in this one at this point. So development of a new weatherization program, kind of. At least the way the strategy was written, really hinges on healthy homes program funding, which the Oregon Health Authority will be administering that program. They're still finalizing the program details. Looks like they anticipate having grant funding available later this year for local agencies that are interested in administering local programs, but it's not yet available. When I spoke to Midlamette Valley Community Action Agency last year, they were interested in a ##ly I haven't touched base with them for several months, but this information was also forwarded to the housing authority as well as Marion county, and they've kind of expressed interest. I don't know if they have capacity as well for this kind of program, but it's not presently something that, at least right now, that the city is planning to kind of administer on our own. So it's hopefully moving forward soon and we'll keep checking in with our partners in the community, but it's not something that we're taking the lead on right now. Hei, this is Jose. Yeah, this one here. I know that CD is not taking",

Pioneer wiping cloth does try to glean for donations, but if you have a box, a bag full of jeans, goodwill is probably a better place to take it because it's more likely to end up back in circulation and on the store shelf. It's an option for things that are past their life or torn or ripped. And it's a local market, it's a local business's been a place for a hundred years. So it's just now kind of building these partnerships with the solidway system more. And it was usually working on the back end of those donations systems and then these other facilities likeartt they've been around a long time. They process the electronic waste from the Oregon e cycles program. And so they have a big state contract for that. So they're a big reclaimer. And a lot of that kind of filters down into the steel and scrap industry once it's separated and captured. So markets have been there, they're fluctuating, maturing. They have really strict requirements. And so this program are designed specifically to meet those requirements and get those materials in. And most of the time that can happen easier at the depot where we're asking community members to separate and bring it in. But this is basically bringing the depot to the curb. Well, thank you for that work. My colleagues know that I was away again last week back in New Hampshire and my cousin Tony, Tony Sapienza is on the city council in Manchester, New Hampshire. And so we geek out occasionally on policy and public programs and they don't have the level of markets that we have here. So right now their commingled recycle bin content is going right to the same wheelabator incinerator that garbages. Yeah, they feel good because they put it in a different cand ends up same place. Yep. It's not what we want. What's the cost? I can of the recycle plus program. So 250 a month for being a member of those or you know, entering enrolling in the program. I'm not sure what word is the right word. And then when you need a pick up it's nine do hundred 25 per pickup. And we're seeing from the data that folks are getting picked ups like every ten weeks. So it's like we thought it's a little bit less frequent. I think everybody brings the bin in their home and they're expecting to always need it. And it takes a little while to accumulate these products and materials. And then about every ten weeks they subscribe for a pickup. We got to figure, it's just my opinion, got to figure out how to make that a free service because I would bet that especially in senior communities and others that're going to say why do I want to pay for an extra bin and pick up? I'll just throw in the garbage. And it has to be some incentive. Do the right thing. Yeah, I don't disagree with you. It's all about paying for the cost of the service. Right. And we are closely watching the development of the Recycling Modernization act. And the state is inviting these producer responsibility organizations into the state to help fund these systems. Many of these products are ending up on what they're calling a pro, which is producer responsibility organization depot list, which means that organizations will have to develop a network of depots where folks can bring these products. And we're talking about, there's a section in the state law that says the pros must work with local governments to arrange a depot network or an alternative method for collection. And we're seizing on that or clause and asking the state if there's an opportunity for us to say, hey, you could build less depots in Washington county. If you support financially these types of programs, we can bring the depot to the curb. And how can we get support from the pros to pay for that extra cost and make it available to all of our communities? So that's what we're really hoping for in the long run. And I think getting these programs in place positions us well to have an established process in place versus kind of building it from the ground with what's it cost them to extract certain things like batteries. It must be the haulers must be paing separate. There'separate bags in the bin. No, no, but I'm saying if they just throw them in the garbage can, I mean, people throw a lot of stuff in the garbage, as you know. And so if there was some incentive to the hauler, I would think that maybe they could make a. But the haulers just take it to the transfer stationsump it off. Right. And it's somebody else's problemah. Right. Right. So there's very little checking. And for the municipal trucks that come in on the wet sides, like if they go to metro south, it's just a huge pit because they repurposed the pit. Whereas if we go in as commercial dry side, then they do have some staff that try to pick out of the pile that you dump onto the",

        "text": " things that have to be evaluated, and what they did is they went through what the hearings referee had decided as far as limiting everybody to limited party status, and they said she had evaluated the ABCD issues and that she provided justification. It wasn't just the carte blanc. Everybody is going to be a limited party in these procedures, which is what these rules, that's what they do. If you read very carefully the language. So anyway, that's a big issue, I think. And actually what the order says, this is a quote. The order states, FSAC had the authority to grant limited party status and considered the factors that it was required to consider in making that determination. That's different than just saying nobody gets to be a limited, or everybody has to be a limited party. So as it now stands, the only people with full party status are going to be the developer and Odo. And given the limits that that creates for the public, I think that's an issue that will no doubt cause some serious issues down the line. The other thing is the deal, the use of raise it or waive it, and the definition of specificity. What you run into with that is there are, in fact, I provided with my comments during the RAC, 21 pages of litigation and decisions, and it lists the litigation in a paragraph with what the decision was, 21 pages of court actions related to this issue of what can be required, what can't be required, and when you're looking at the comments that are made. And what I found is that the comments, the request for comments, are asking for a given set of information when it comes to the council. The council is evaluating those based on the comments, but then they are going further and making decisions that the public is not being informed of, and that, according to the statutes and the court decisions, there are limits on what the public can be required to say or address in these public hearings. I don't know if I hope that's clear to. There's a conflict between the evaluation criteria and the requirements for what is included in a public comment. And right now, I think, I believe that the language that's being proposed for what it must be included in public comment, beyond the list of three items that you were told you have to comment on what the issue is, why it is anything beyond that, it appears to me, conflicts with court decisions, because court decisions say things like, the person cannot be required to be more specific than identifying their issue. I mean, that's one of the court decision. So you really need to look at many, many court decisions related to raise it or wave it. So that's what I have to say about that. Let's see another comment that I had here. It looks like you covered a couple of other things, but there's a lack of timely notice being provided to the public when there's a decision along the way that removes them from being allowed to have a contested case. And according to the statutes, ORS 183.470, and also ORS 183.49, the public has a right to have timely notice when the counsel or the hearings officer takes an action that removes an opportunity for them. And so in your contested case proceedings, when counsel decides not to allow someone party status or not to allow an issue to be heard, the rules say that the public has a right to timely notice. It also says that anybody that you refuse access to that has the right to go to the county courts and they can mandate that the person be provided a timely notice. That's what ORS 183.490 says. So when counsel makes a decision, or a hearing officer makes a decision to exclude someone's issue, or to exclude somebody from having access to a contested case, like in BQH contested cases, it was months before that final order came out. That's not consistent with what the statutes require. So we need to look at this thing about notice and when it's provided, and the rules really should address timeliness of notices when these decisions are made, because the decisions are acted on and immediate. The people who are denied a contested case issue are immediately removed from the process of contested case. So anyway, the other concern that I have about the amendment rules, and this is not something that was changed here, but it should be, the rules say that contested cases are only allowed on division 22, 23, three and 24. And I'm sure that will ring a bell with you, that they were denying requests for contested cases that were not addressed by those three rules. There are a lot of other rules, all the procedural rules, the requirements for what has to be included in an application, all those things are outside of division 22, 23, and 24. And I remember when this was added to the amendment rules, and it hasn't been that long ago, and time I had a question about. Now I really have a",

        "text": " by anybody else. Thank you, Councilloorr Byer. On this particular issue, the reasons exception, as we get larger solar facilities being proposed on agricultural land, I think just being mindful of our findings and know that once the council issues a certificate with certain conditions, accept certain evidence, that kind of becomes the touchstone for other developers. So I know I get hung up on precedent, but it's a thing and just trying to make sure that how we articulate our findings and what kind of evidence we rely on to make those findings will be pretty important, especially when we have no real specific guidance in our administrative rules or our standards. So it's just something that we as council have to be paying attention to and how that information is portrayed for us just is a big deal, because I think this will become a bigger deal. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah, and just for clarity, in. At the public hearing, I believe the applicant just reiterated what was already provided on the record in exhibit k, like agricultural mitigation fund and how they got there and like the dollar amounts and where it was going, and specifically to the Morrow county grain growers and Oregon State's agricultural research program. So I thought that that was like, it was a summary of what they had already provided. Um, well, we will continue to evaluate the conditions proposed by the applicant and their analysis provided by their third party consultant to determine if there are any information gaps or additional conditions that should be imposed to ensure that this reason can be realized during implementation. So I guess with that and with your feedback, there may be changes to the goal three portion in the proposed order. Thank you. Yeah. By. Please, Mister McVeigh Walker, I had to. If we go back to the locational dependence factor, and I know with the west end, there were no transmission. New transmission lines required, if I recall, and that. But we did have an interconnection agreement that we required on that to help make the case of local dependent locational dependency being one of the four reasons. And so that's the same situation here. No new transmission lines really required to connect into. Or is it here for the wagon trail facility, there would be 0.6 miles of 230 kv. Right. But that would then connect with the Blue Ridge, an existing blue ridge substation. Yeah. Which is in the southern. Yeah. So on that map it's right in the center. So there's that big blue rectangle, that's the battery center, but the dark blue is the Blue Ridge substation. And going laterally to the left is the approximate half mile transmission line that would be. That's being proposed. Okay. And so we'd kind of do the same condition of approval for an interconnection agreement. Okay, great. Thank. Yes. And there is an existing umattila electric line that runs north, south. And on this figure it's in the middle of. In the middle of the. The figure itself. The blue line that bo. Me. Yeah, I mean, well, yeah. That is bombing range road. Yes. Yeah, correct. Okay, I think we can go back to the standards portion. Unless there's other questions, comments, instruction for land use and goal three. Okay. Mister Chairman, can I a clarification? Yeah. Councilloor Devlin. In terms of that, we may be addressing more in the draft order. Now, all we're doing today is a review. And how does that mean we would review the adequacy of the justification that we have in the draft order for the goal three exception based on the Morl county concern, and obviously taking into consideration the applicant'response. The reason I'm asking is because that would imply that there's perhaps some, perhaps not significant, but some change to the draft order. So in the next committee, would we be making a decision to approve or not approve the draft order, or would we be reviewing it again? Yeah. So record Secretary Cornet, Councilmber Devlin, and really just everybody kind of is sort of a procedural point. Can you go back to the procedural slide? Yeah, that one. So where we're at now is the draft proposed order. So I always like to say it in this way. Is this is staff document. It is staff's first recommendation. We've evaluated the application and made our findings of fact, conclusions of law, conditions of approval based on the information that's in the record, the complete application that allowed for then a review by the public and the applicant, and the ability to comment on the record. Pub. Public'commented. The applicants commented and responded. Council commented at the last council meeting, you know, and this stage is, this is your review in terms of, okay, you've looked at the draft proposed order, you listened or read the comments. Basically, this is your opportunity to tell us",

Well, I guess I still do need to officially hit the gavel instead of just letting it fall down on its own. Welcome, everyone to the Tuesday, April 25, 2023 Washington County Board of Commissioners meeting. Commissioner Pam Trees is excused as she is representing clean water services along with Mark jockers at the National Water fly in to Washington, DC. We have four commission members here today, myself, Commissioner Chair Caatherine Harrington, Commissioner Vice Chair Roy Rogers, Commissioner visaify and Commissioner Jerry Willie. First item on today's agenda. We do have some items that we'll go for approval later, but first we'll start with board communication. Who would like to go first? I will go first. Good afternoon, everyone. Last week I to remember to put this on closer. Last week Commissioner Ro Rogers and I completed the COVID after action report interview. That was a really long interview. I didn't think it was going to last that long, but it was 90 minutes and it was really good. It'good to I was in here during the pandemic, so it was really good to hear. Wait a minute. You started in January of 2021. You were very much here. She didn't get in on the early stage. Oh, I see. You were in chapter two, chapter chapter one, chapter two and three of the chapter book. Yeah. They started asking questions in February of 2020 to August 2020. And I was like, I don't know what to tell you. I can tell you about the contact tracing side of it, what the board went. Yeah, not so mucheah. It was really humbling to hear what you all went through during that time and the decisions and the conversations you were grappling with, from science to budget, everything. So I appreciated that perspective. So thank you. I made it up. You made it all up. No comment. It was very believable if you did, Commissioner Rogers, I would say. And last week I also had a JPAC. The carbon reduction fund allocation was the big conversation and it was interesting to hear other. There was no decisions made. TRD agreed to match 5 million on both 82nd and tv highway projects and WCC feedback was to go with option e. But at JPAC we weren't discussing which option to move forward. It was sort of what questions do you have? And I think we expressed our staff'feedback and concerns. So what will be the next steps? Do you recall? The next step is to refine furthermore and to come back, I assume TPAC or not JPAC yet, but the technical group will decide and then refine for further conversations. And then there will be a decision to JPAC. Okay'we'll? Bring it back, definitely, because I think there will be a significant implications for our board. So we definitely need to have a robust conversations and land on a package that we can live with and feel comfortable for Washington county. So yeah, definitely we'll have a further conversation. Thank you. But we'll have plenty of time. I will engage the board online before it comes. And then there was a high level analysis of project list for the RTP. So that's still happening. No decisions. And then one of the really exciting things I got to do last week with the staff and the community was attend the Hardwood Commons opening, also known as the Aloa Inn opening. It was really well attended. So congratulations to Washington county staff, to the massive community engagement that you all did, because it was really cold, yet we had ten full of people. So congratulations. And it was really good to see the design work that went into that building. If you ever get the opportunity to tour, I would highly recommend because the hotel rooms turn into a highly utilitarian one bedroom apartment. So that was heartwarming to see and just the sheltering that we're providing with dignity and respect. So that was really good housing. As you know, it's the solution. So I'm really glad to see this in Washington county, how we're using every tool in our toolbox. And then this week, yesterday was our tech, the regional toll advisory committee. And we heard and EMAC, the equity group, did a report out on how they are advancing equity for the Oegon Tol program. And that was a really good conversation to center, to say, we don't want equity implications to be afterthought. We wanted to center and as we're building the tolling to infuse equity. And then Trimet and Odad presented sort of like a high level. A draft of. A draft of a draft is, I think, how it was being framed, but initial screening criteria for the public transportation strategy, because people are really interested that",

Pursuant to Oregon administrative rule 345-011-0080 any person who engages in unacceptable conduct which disrupts the meeting may be expelled. Our next our first agenda item is approval of the minutes and I would ask, did everyone have an opportunity to review the minutes? Are there any comments about the minutes? Chair Grail? Yes, councilor Condndin here. I had some computer issues so I did not review the minutes and we could put them to next meeting. That would be helpful. I'llain we have a request from council member. Thank you Counciler Condon to hold off on voting on the approval of these minutes. And if there's no objection from council or mister secretary, I would ask that we hold these off until next meeting. Madam chair, I made note of that. We will include that on the November agenda thank you. Then the next item would be the council secretary report. Mister Secretary. Thank you, madam chair. I'll first start with staffing updates. So we have initiated the recruitment process to replace Wally Adams. He position is the operations and policy analyst. Two. So we just. It was Tuesday maybe. So it was earlier this week that the notice went out. So will probably be, you know, in that five weeks time, five to six week timeframe. So I'll keep council members updated on that progress. Next I will get into some project updates. So the first is the yellow Rose Bush Energy center. So o you you can go back a notice of intent was submitted on September 1 by Yellow Rose Bush Energy Center, LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Savvon LLC for the Yellow Rose Bush Energy center. The project is a proposed solar pv generation facility with a capacity of 800 related and supporting facilities on 8075 acres. So 12.6 sq. Mi on private Le owned land zoned for exclusive farm use in both Blasco and Sherman counties. The majority of it is in Waco county, but the transmission line would go over into Sherman county. The department issued a public notice last week. You should have gotten that notice as well. This is for the notice of intent. We've established a public information meeting on the evening of November 2 in Mappin and there is currently an open comment period that will conclude on December 1. If'any. Questions? On to the next update. The next is the Umattila Morro County Connector project. Similarly, we received the notice of intent in mid September on the 13th by Umatila Electric Cooperative. For this project. They are the project applicant. The project is a proposed 14 miles 230 kv transmission line with portions located in Moro and Umatila county. Just as a reminder, the threshold for FSE jurisdiction on transmission lines is at at least 230 kv more than 10 miles and in more than one jurisdiction. So it's not greatly over that, but it is over that and so it is your jurisdiction. So the department also issued a public",

        "text": " sites in whatever sense that makes. But I think adaptability as the economy shifts, as we have growth around the renewable sectors, things around manufacturing for tied to EV's, lithium ion batteries and future technologies, hydrogen technologies, etcetera. I'm not talking about a science fiction novel, but just saying as long as you'as. Long as the goals and the zoning allow for flexibility to capture future growth, that's very key. And then the other, you know, I guess I'll go back to the personal size and I think Kirk, Kirk could chime in on this, but I think it tends to be easier to develop parcels that are a little bit larger versus orphan parcels. And I know over the years there's been lots of sites around metro, you know, twelve acres, eight acres here or there, kind of infill. But if you have some nice sized rectangular or square parcels, that would be something to strive for. But, you know, I like your idea of shifting towards higher wage jobs where you can attract some of the residents of Sherwood. I like, I like where this plan is. I like where you're going. And I don't have any, you know, my feedback for any community in the region is just to be as flexible as, as possible, provide flexibility, because we never know where the market is going to be. Five years, four, three years ago, I think I was in meetings and people had no idea Covid was going to do what it's done. So I just. The more flexible your plan can be. And then I would also just one, one comment. You know, there's think back to the trendiness of things. The semiconductor task force, it's a great, it's a great vessel or engine, but it's a bit more of a thought generator. They're throwing ideas on the wall that are going to the legislature and the new governor is creating a budget. These things will all come together and they'be sausage making. Oregon still has our tax base that cannot afford a New York state type of plan. We just can't throw billions of dollars at one specific industry. And I just want to put that reality out there. I think there will be some very positive things that you'll see that. That's my guess, and I'm putting that out there. Know publicly. I know this is a recorded session, but there will be progress and there will be new tools, maybe new tax credits, who knows? There's a lot of things on the wall. But I think I would not develop your plan around this one specific industry in this one specific point at time. But having a broader advanced manufacturing perspective, you know, to where you might want to grow. That sector of the economy would just being more flexible and more open minded because we don't know how the tools and policies will really pan out. I think there'll be a lot of positive energy and activity. But I'm not, I'm just a staffer, you know, I'm not making. I'm not. I'm not an elected official. And I think, yeah, I think there's just going to be a lot of debate and there'll be new policies, new programs, but, and those will be coming in over multiple years. And I think the tendency, what I'm hearing is that this focus on high wage jobs and manufacturing that offer jobs or have a career path for non majority populations is going to be a focus. Right. So obviously semiconductor has started to do a pretty good job of integr integrating women into the workforce, integrating black indigenous people of color into the workforce. So yeah, I think being flexible, being adaptable, and that's, you know, maybe I pass the baton to Nick. But you know, one day we might get a lead from a biotech firm, the next day it could be a semiconductor, the next day it could be a warehousing, the next day it could be a pet food company, the next day it could be a crraissantka. It'just it's never, you know, there's just keep your tent big enough that you can capture those opportunities that make sense for your community. Yeah, I think that's really good, Colin. And that does then relate to Nick because Nick may not have been telling me this, but I know, I think even before Nick got to Greater Portland Inc. Greater Portland used to tease me about the number of types of industries that are our target industries re much. They're larger than GPI's target for the Inc'target, because frankly we don't have the funds to go to trade shows. So we don't go to the trade shows in the Bay Area or do recruitment trips to see site selectors in Atlanta or what have you. We're just not in that business. But Greater Portland Inc. Has to be much more selective. So we are really, I'm going to use the term more agnostic. I don't know if that's the right term or not. We are very pleased to see food production,",

        "text": ". So again, these are not necessarily examples of what we will test. We will be looking to the engagement process to help us decide that. And the scenarios will help us test uncertainties and see the impacts of policies, of actions, of customer behavior, like in the case of heat pump adoption on energy needs and on how energy is supplied. So to deepen your feel on how the model is structured. Sorry, I'm actually going to go up one over here. So we're here in the left hand box. So we're looking at the first step, right? So we have our residential, commercial, industrial and transportation demands, and then we're going to look at the demand kind of buy appliance. So in the residential sector, we'll look at air conditioning, space heating, water heating, and we'll look at how much we have today, what the energy demand is, and make assumptions about how much energy we'need. In the future, and how many of these appliances will be in place and what their characteristics will be. And we'll do the same for end uses in the commercial sector, in the industrial sector, and in transportation. In total, there are about 70 subsectors. And by subsectors, I mean these bullet points here that the model will look at and define. So it's pretty detailed stuff. So now I'm going from the micro to the macro level. So Oregon, as you saw, operates as part of a larger energy system. And so it's important, when we're looking at the Oregon energy strategy, to understand the other kind of forces that impact costs in Oregon, resource availability and things like that. So here are a few points of how we're going to approach that. The model will include competition for fuels, including biomass, renewables, and hydrogen derived from renewables. And that's to reflect that there's not an infinite amount of these resources. There's some competition out there, and that is something that's important to take into account. We also are aware that Oregon is part of an interconnected electricity system over a pretty large and diverse region. So we're going to take that interconnectedness into account and also capture transmission line and pipeline flow and build constraints, not just in Oregon, but in the region. It's also important and really interesting to think about how the variety of resources across this whole region, the variety of different kinds of demands and time zones, can actually contribute to helping us meet our goals. Because of kind of complementary resources. The sun may not be shining here, it might be shining elsewhere. Same with where the wind is blowing. And the bigger the system, the more resources we have to draw on. There will be areas that don't plug into the model directly. We can't quantify everything, but these things are an important part of the analysis. And so here are some key areas where we will be conducting additional analysis, often building on what we learned from the modeling, but then applying it. And so these are just a few examples. We'll be looking at the energy wallet of representative customer groups to examine the full energy costs. You could think of it as the energy budget of a household and how those costs shift between petroleum, electricity and gas, because ultimately the energy strategy is looking at the trade off with different pathways. And those pathways kind of change the balance, maybe within the energy wallet. For example, if you buy an electric car, your gas bill for that car goes to zero, but you're paying more for electricity. So we want to make sure to reflect that. So the energy walllet helps us see that picture. We'll also be looking at health impacts related to the effects on air quality of decarbonization measures using a model called Cobra from the US Environmental Protection Agency. And that might be the effect of reduced diesel and gasoline powered vehicles on the road and reduced tailpipe emissions resulting from that, or reduced biomass combustion for heat. So we want to make sure we can reflect some of those benefits. We'll also look at different parts of the state to identify differences in impacts across the state. And that can also be applied to look at some of, and think about some of the land use considerations that we may not be able to fit in in the full economy wide model. But we might want to look at more closely. So we'll also be using some of that kind of differentiation around the state to look at effects of different pathways at community level. We'll look at effects on employment and on the economy. So the starting point for the technical analysis is really looking at existing models and plans. So we're going to ground the analysis in recent utility integrated resource plans, clean energy plans, CPP compliance plans. We'll also be reviewing Oregon energy policies and document how the modeling accounts for them. So I've already mentioned a number of those policies. We also will be reviewing from a regional perspective. So it's important to take into account the Northwest power plan and also to follow key developments as the Northwest Power and Conservation Council develops the next plan and works",

        "text": " Marion county, and they've kind of expressed interest. I don't know if they have capacity as well for this kind of program, but it's not presently something that, at least right now, that the city is planning to kind of administer on our own. So it's hopefully moving forward soon and we'll keep checking in with our partners in the community, but it's not something that we're taking the lead on right now. Hei, this is Jose. Yeah, this one here. I know that CD is not taking the lead, and community action has for years had this program, but I think it'd be nice to sort ofssentially start gathering all the players together to know what's happening. I mean, just this morning there was a report, I'm not sure which european country, I forgot the low income. A lot of people's heating bills have doubled and they've had to create warm zones for people. So 300 sites around the country just's for people to be warm during the day after their kids get out of school and before they go to bed and because they just can't afford to heat their house. And a lot of it was, if you just hear them, it was weatherization related. One lady was saying how a draft comes through her house. They can't stop it. They haven money to fix it. So I think whether, you know, whether or not we're taking the lead, I think this checks out the boxes and this one's really important because there's people struggling today. Absolutely. Yeah. Thank you for that. Yeah. So right now, I kind, you know, I have plans to continue to check in with these folks, but I think you're right. I think bringing folks together to kind of talk through and maybe see if there's other options and just kind of get a better sense on the programs that would be offered, maybe some of the, the gaps that would still remain and other things that we could do to kind of step in and help even if we're not the lead perhaps on that. Yeah. I've been really interested just in this idea in general because going green is really for the privileged. It'so expensive. Yeah. To do these things. So I see folks, you know, and in homes that I would really struggle to be in. Right. Because of, you know, non operable windows or, you know, just really, really hard. Yeah. It's really hard to do that. So how do you, how do we make going green become more equitable? I think is an interesting thing. And this is one of those things that hits on that. And I don't know what our role is with this, like you said, but, and maybe my homework is to understand, you know, house Bill 28 42. A little bit better to see for myself, like how we could maybe, but yeah, just maybe an update at some point whenever, I don't know what this looks like. I guess I'm struggling with that. Yeah. So I could maybe, I don't know if maybe somebody, staff from Oregon health Authority might. You willing to come to one of our meeting talk? Yeah. Find out if there are other ways that cities can play, you know, help push this along or play a lead role or something. Yeah, sounds good. This is, this is really helpful to me as I look ahead. So. Thank you. Okay. Almost done with this list. So ian 36. See, I one my two different mouses here with my notes. So I don't forget. Ian 36, implement incentive program for residents and businesses to switch from natural gas. This one was listed as a short term, so one that we might start within the first couple years. But it does also identify others as the lead. It doesn't necessarily say that the city is going to take the lead role on this. I'm still learning. I know that there are, as I mentioned, a ton of different incentive programs out there that the energy trust is kind of consolidated. But I did hear, I think we've had in place at least over a year now from Department of Energy heat pump program. But it sounds like that's been maybe expanded because there's new information coming through. In fact, there was just a webinar this last week asking kind of for the same thing as the healthy homes program. Local administers local, local agencies to administer this community, community heat pump deployment program, which is just getting started and rolling forward. So that information, again, I wasn't assuming that that would be a city, a city program that we would manage maybe down the road or maybe we want to start looking at that. But I did forward that information to housing authority, Mary county as well, and they expressed an interest. So I think there's going to be an expanded number of options for folks to transfer over to heat pumps in the coming year. And I think that program as well was looking at low income folks.",

So, Edith, now I'm going to pass two. Thanks, Ben, and thanks for kind of setting that groundwork. I think those are really important points, and I really appreciate you walking us through them. So, my name is Edith Bayer. I'm energy policy team lead here at the Oregon Department of Energy. Very excited to be here. Thanks, everybody, for making the time in your busy schedules to join us today and to join us throughout the next few weeks as we work through the technical, what kind of assumptions and questions that we'll be looking at in the energy strategy. So this is just a quick snapshot to give you a sense of the names behind the work. As Alan said, we have a really great team. Alan Zelenka, you've already met as our assistant director for planning innovation, Jessica Rikers is the manager for the policy and innovation team, and you can see her up here, too. And then I'm the team lead, as I said. And we have here, we have eight working groups, as you can see here. I think by now all of you have seen the list of working groups. We have direct use fuels and industry, electricity generating technologies, transportation, transmission and distribution, but both pipes and wires, buildings, energy efficiency and load flexibility, equity and environmental justice and land use and natural resources. And I just wanted to familiarize you kind of visually. I'm not going to run through all the names here, but just to understand that we have a lead from Odo's staff, a lead and co lead for each of these topics. And you'll be hearing from your leads in advance of each of the breakout topical meetings that we'll be carrying out over the next few weeks. So some of you might already have heard, and some of you might have meetings that are coming a little later and you might be hearing from them soon. But please consider us to be kind of accessible here for you, willing to answer questions and really excited to be working with you all. And with that, I'm gonna hand it over, I think, to Eileen to present the Ceti team. Thanks. Good morning. My name is Eileen Quigley. I'm going to ask Jeremy if we could switch presentations here. I think, Gilling, maybe you will stop sharing and then Jeremy will start sharing his our hours. And Eileen, this is just the introduction for your team. So we'll do the study presentation down low. Next you, Billi. Okay, great. Yeah, we do want you to introduce your folks there. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. Had I had side for that in my presentation, but I'll be so here. No problem. So, Ruby Moore Bloom and I are managing this project. I am the executive director of the Clean Energy Transition Institute, and we are a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization whose mission is to accelerate an equitable clean energy transition in the northwest. So I'm the overall project lead, and then Ruby, on my team, who's a research analyst, is the technical project manager. We have a technical team modeling team that includes a variety of people from the evolved energy research team. And Jeremy Hargreaves, who is a principal there, will be presenting to you today. We're also joined with our technical modeling team by Elaine Hart of Moment Energy insights. And Elaine is based in Oregon. And then we also have an equity team, and this is comprised of Mariah Cavallera on my team and Angela long at Rockrest consultant, who is argan based as well. Thank you. Very muchay. Thank you, Eileen. Go next slide. And I'I guess I should have said this at the beginning. Hello. Ben Duncan. He, him. Pronouns with Kearns and Wests. I'm a facilitation lead for our team'm, joined by Gilly Garber. Yant is doing process support. I don't know. Go. You want to jump on screen and wave to the. Let me see your face. There you are.

        "text": " government. And it sort of there on the screen. Um, but your county can certainly choose a different definition to guide your energy resilience plan development. If you choose, you can sort of use this model. You don'really. Even need a definition. But we think it's a good idea to come up with the starting place and sort of a guiding definition is helpful when I work on various programs and projects to make sure that we're sort of coming back to the true intention of what we're trying to do here. We also have a little cutout here about the Oregon energy security plan. That's a cover page from our 2023 plan. Our agency in my division is working on a 2024 plan, the energy security plan for the state. And sort of as we look at risks and threats to Oregon's energy system on our statewide, statewide plan, we look at natural hazards primarily, but there's other things, too. We look at cybersecurity, physical securityity risks. Even the COVID pandemic was a impact to energy issues in some ways. So however, you look at sort of what that shock means, what that impacts your energy system, and then how an energy system can be resilient to either maybe consider like deflecting that shock, sort of a shield, or how quickly you can bounce back and restore energy services to your communities. Sort of. That's the consideration around resilience. And the plan that we hope you all jump into and take the money and put together will include a lot of that information specific for your counties. Okay, let me go to the next slide. I think there's one more with even more specific definition around community energy resilience. So what does that mean? Well, kind of the same concept as energy resilience, and then just brings a community centric idea into it. And so you can sort of see this little graphic here and really sort of thinking about a community and government service not being a utility, not being a private energy company, not being a private fuel company or electric provider, natural gas company. What's the role of government? Well, the role of government in many ways is to help put all the pieces together, to help focus on public service, to help communities that need help in the event of a power loss or a shortage of energy in some ways. And to try to help, as I see, I try to help the energy companies pull the pieces back together, provide service back to, whether it's the state or the county or your local community, sort of other ways to look at sort of mitigation measures for how to reduce that threat, reduce that impact, reduce the severity of it all. An example here is a microgrid, sort of a common concept in the energy planning world about how if there was a loss of grid power, little icon there on the screen, has a break between the utility grid and the example, micro grid. How else power could be provided to critical facilities. Typically microgrid being a small, providing power to a small, either facility. And you can even see from the example here, example, microgrid, there's a little icon for a generator and then maybe some energy storage and kind of depends on where that, where that power might come from and then providing the service until the grid power can come back online. So anyway, those are just a little example of what a mitigation measure might look like at the local scale. I think with that sort of introduction and sort of setting the stage, Hannah, I'm going to pass it back over to you to dive into the program details. Excellent. Thank you so much, Max. Yeah, I think that's really helpful context for some broader energy resilience work on the state scale, and then thinking about that coming down to our communities, which is an important piece of that larger work and also a complimet to it. So we're going to be talking about the county energy resilience grant program. As Mac said, the legislation that this program was created out of is House Bill 3006 and 30 passed in the 2023 legislative session. And this program hopefully, as you know, provides up to $50,000 per Oregon county to develop an energy resilience plan. And really, the goal is to create that community energy resilience that Max just defined for us, making sure those critical public service facilities have energy when there is a disruption to those larger energy systems. And we're going to dive into what that looks like it means a little bit more in a moment. In terms of eligibility for this program, the program is open to all Oregon's 36 counties. The only other eligibility requirement is that a county does not have an existing energy or energy resilience plan that meets the content requirements of House Bill 3630, which we will go over in a moment. If your county is one of the counties that has an energy or energy resilience plan, most likely you're going to be able to access this program and these funds to update that plan",

        "text": " community because that's kind of an untapped resource that we haven't got to and it also satisfies some of the requirements from the federal level with regard to justice 40 I can talk more about that at the end of this webinar. But just so you know, we Odo will hire a contractor for you to work with. And with that there'll be lot less impact on your community to roll out a program for audits, assessments and that sort of thing. As indicated before there'the next one is energy savings performance contracts. This will be on you to go out and identify a contractor to do work on your municipal buildings. I think many of you have done this before, so you know the path for that. And then also you can break out and just do building efficiency and electrification campaigns on your own and you use your funding to hire a contractor to go do that work. Under the renewables category, we're focused on solar installations with battery storage, and you can work with your utility on that. That would be the best way to do that. So you're meeting all their needs for how to contact the power from the resource to their lines to go back and forth. That gets to be a pretty heavy lift if you try to do that sort of thing without their involvement. Also on the transportation option, we're including electric vehicles for municipal fleets. That means go out and buy an electric vehicle for your municipal fleet. And then the other option is for EV charging infrastructure for the community. So some, really some good options here and I think you can easily choose one and develop a proposal under the implementation plan. You need to have a list of the project team members, the roles, lines of authority and that sort of thing. The experience with similar projects, just something brief. It doesn't need to be super comprehensive. A detailed construction plan and project schedule with major milestones including the target operational dataate of the system. That's where you'd want to have a little more detail. The schedule there must show construction beginning within twelve months of the execution of the performance agreement and will be completed within 24 months of the execution of the performance agreement. So it's got a shorter window than a lot of other projects. But these aren't really lengthy projects either to install next bullet a description of how the applicant will manage planning, construction and start it system startup. Include a commissioning plan if developed. If there is one developed, I think having something that just to describe what your quality assurance will be, how you might follow up and make sure the project was completed as designed. Next bullet a description of material availability and whether the materials are on hand or readily available. Include an approximation of timeline for availability. Materials yeah, it's been an issue in the past getting those materials, so that's why this bullet lays in there. Supply chains have been an issue a detailed description of the project operations plan post construction the applicant should show how the project will be operated, the estimated costs, and how maintenance and operation will be adequately funded. So those are the things in the implementation plan we'll be looking for. I don't think you need to be heavily descriptive, but I think you need to cross all those dots, cross all those t's and dot the dots. There's also a community benefits and equity considerations that you'll need to fill out. A description of qualifying communities involvement in project development and operations this could include, but is not limited to, descriptions of surveys of the local community attendants or participation at public meetings and community ideas and recommendations incorporated in the project plan. Also a description of any equity framework used by applicant in developing the project a description of the level of direct energy cost savings to families and small businesses that will result from the project a description of the level of economic development that will result from the project and information on the number and types of jobs directly connected to the awarding of the grant that will be created by the project, as well as sustained through construction and operation of the project. So there's three categories there, and then, if applicable, a description of how the project would integrate with broader community, energy and environmental goals. And just so you know, we've been working with the larger cities that got a direct grant from the federal level and asking them, did you connect with your local cities or the, the tangential cities around them to understand what they were doing? So we're all sort of rowing the boat in the same direction. We know what each other are doing and we can play off of that and actually benefit in greater dimension. So also we have identified program process metrics. This is a key the EECBG program requires quarterly performance reporting, which includes capturing metrics available to your project. Please review the process metrics here at this link and identify which metrics item will be collected to report on should your project be selected. And also metrics should be selected from the third column and should pair with your appropriate project selection, meaning the home energy score should select metrics from metric area number eight, such as",

        "text": " speaking, press star three again to lower your hand. And at this time I do not see any hands raised by chairous. Let's give another 30 seconds or so and see if anybody is scrambling trying to get it to work. Okay, it looks like no more additional public comments, so we'll move on to the next item, which is the Obsidian Solar center. Amendment one we have this is an information item. We've got Kathleen Sloan, senior sitighting analyst, to present an overview of the approved 400 megawatt alternating current solar voltaic energy facilities and the changes proposed in the request for amendment one. Miss Slan at yourry. Thank you. Vice chair Howe for the record, my name is Kathleen Sloan. As stated earlier, I am a senior cing analyst for the Department of Energy. I'm going to try to share my screen all that techie all right, so for this agenda item, this is an information item for counsel. It is to cover the council review of the draft proposed order and the public comments received on the record for the Obsidian Solar center request for amendment one. So just as an overview for the agenda item, I will give you a basic overview of the facility, the components, and the amendment request. I'll ll also go into a summary of the draft proposed order with the focus on the condition language that actually changed from the original site certificate. As far as recommendations, we'll also do an overview of the public comments received both during the public hearing, which was held in Christmas Valley on August 24, and also in through the comment portal or email written comments received on the record during that public comment period. And then it will go to council for discussion and deliberation. There's no decision or action required at this time, but Coun council may have the opportunity to ask questions, make recommendations for changes to be incorporated into a proposed order, or you can just advise us to prepare the proposed order. But we will prepare a proposed order and issue that proposed order based upon council's review today. So just really quickly, an overview of the approved facility. Council approved the site certificate on February 25 at 2022. The certificate holder, Obsidian Solar Center, LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Obsidian Renewables, LLC. The approved facility is for 400 solar 50 battery storage related and supporting facilities and the approved site, boundari, is approximately 3921 acres. It's located in Lake county, about 8 miles northwest of Christmas Valley. So that map there is the approved facility, the solar center request for amendment one the purpose of the amendment request is to add this 169 acres additional acres to the site boundary so that the certificate folder has the ability to construct an inner tie to either the BPA line, which is on the side of the proposed amended area, versus what has already been approved, which was to allow for an intertie to the PGE. They want to construct one GSU substation within that area. They will also be increasing the voltage of the transmission line from 115 kilovolts to 138. Similarly, the collection system from 34.5 to 138 and some modifications in the length of the transmission line and the collector lines, particularly how much was above ground versus below ground. So this map shows you the requested amended site boundary. On the left hand side of the map you're going to see the orange cross hated area, which is I think I can use my low pointer right in here. That's the amended 169 acre site boundary. Within that is this 84 acres which is in pink. That is the proposed micrositing area. But the certificate holder did want some flexibility on where to siteite those components within that pink area. So just a refresher scope of council review for amendments. This is adding a new area to the site boundary. So it is requirement that council approveved that all the applicable laws and standards for the original site certificate that the amendment can comply with all of those conditions and then also and meet those standards, and then also that the bond or letter of credit is adequate for the changes proposed in the amendments. Of course, all of the draft proposed order is open for comment by coun council. We can talk about any of these standards, but I am going to try to focus this presentation on the standards where we actually recommended a change in condition language or an additional or new condition. So based upon our review of the request for amendment, we prepared the draft proposed order. And in that draft proposed order we did not make any recommendations for substantive changes or condition language changes for any of these standards that are listed on this slide. Again, we can talk about any of these if you want, but I'm not going to cover them in my presentation because we're not recommending any substantive change or new language for conditions. So the standards that we are going to focus on today are the ones that we actually",

        "text": " water services, EWEB recognized the importance of energy and water delivery and was well positioned to support a resilience and disaster recovery within Eugene that could address both the energy and water issues. Next slide please. So EWEb considered community energy resilience based on the rule of threes, and that is, in the first three days provide access to drinking water. In the first three weeks, repower critical facilities, and in the first three months, complete system repairs and restore restore service. Next slide please. So as a result of their planning efforts, Eweb developed the grid edge demonstration project and it's pictured over on the right hand side of the screen. Some of the elements. The project utilized an existing 50 kilowatt pv system on the roof of the Howard Elementary School and added a battery storage system and a new potable water well. Next slide, please. And the result is a facility that can serve as a potable water fill station for the community in the event of a power outage. The school building is also provided with backup power and serves as an emergency shelter. The system provides value to the community in addition to the value of the water and energy resilience features. For example, the school benefits from energy bill savings and EEB is able to use the batteries on this site to provide grid services during their day to day operations. Next slide this is a schematic diagram of the microgrid system showing electric loads that can be served by the system during a power outage. So the battery storage units, and they are shown as bess, they are the black ones on the bottom battery energy storage systems. Those are able to provide power to the water well and the backup loads within the school. And you can see that there's a switch shown at the main breaker, and that's to ensure that this microgrid is isolated from the rest of EEB's power grid in the event of a power outage. And that's to provide safety to their line workers. And so now that the program is essentially up and running, we've got staff to implement the program. Pandiian Krishnawami is on the line today. He's our energy services manager, and James Kogl has been leading the work on the program, nuts and bolts, and we'll take things from here. James. Thanks Rob. So James Kogl, a policy analyst, the orgon Department of Energy so the program will provide grants for planning and constructing renewable energy and energy resilience projects. Opportunity announcements were posted on March 7 and there are four of them, one for each of the project categories. There's $12 million available between the four opportunity announcements, with more opportunity announcements we'll announce later after this round closes with additional funds. Online applications will open shortly and we will only be accepting applications through the online application. Next slide please. Opportunity to andcements outline the minimum required information for a complete application, as well as detailing how applications will be scored during the review process. This includes required information about the projects, the applicant and partners, and consultation with different stakeholder and different stakeholders and groups. Following a review of applications is to make sure they contain all the required information and are eligible for the program. The applications will undergo a competitive review process assessing the strength of the project and its feasibility, as well as how the project meets the program's priorities and target benefits. The scoring criteria includes topics such as the project leadership and involvement of environmental justice communities, jobs and economic development, direct energy cost savings for families and small businesses, inclusion of inclusive hiring promotion policies, procurements of services from disadvantaged businesses, assisting with natural hazard mitigation plans, and geographic and project diversity. The grants will be awarded on a competitive basis. At this point, we don't know how many grants will be awarded and how the funding will be distributed across the four categories. How the funding will be distributed kind of depend on the number of strength of applications in a different buckets along with the required funding allocations stated in the legislation. Next slide please. Kind I going to take you through kind of a quick introduction to what the application portal will look like so you'll be able to once it's live, it's not yet access it through the Oregon Department of Energy Community Renewable Energy grant program webpage. We're expecting the application to be finalized and available in April so you can see the Red Arrow points to where it will be available soon. So next slide please. You'll also, if you are familiar with Odo's customer service portal, be able to access it from there. You just click on the financial and incentive tab at the top and it'll be available in a drop down menu from there. Next slide please once you access the application, you'll be able to apply for a planning or construction grant. You'll able to change information you've submitted or withdraw an application using the drop down menu on the front page. Next slide please. If you haven't already signed in to the customer service portal, you'll be asked to sign in. This is your first time accessing the customer portal. You",

        "text": " look at and in this area and again, I'm not. So can you make spe. You make sure you speak into the mic so people on the own stupid retired attorney. So the bottom line is though, you can't tell me that six acres out of Woodburn is enough to say oh, this is gonna work so what are you gonna do? This is clay soil. It holds the water, it rots out a lot of roots on a lot of plants and, you know, grass seeds kind of maybe it's where it adds'Lynn county. So what are you gonna do about that? Are you gonna try to mitigate it or what? Wants to deal? I can say what we're working on right now is working on a plan to address that, and that is part of, you know, what we're looking at. As Todd had said, part of it is going to be not only addressing standards, but also addressing, you know, making sure the preponderance of the evidence supports what can be accomplished with this project. And so it's up to, you know, our team to be able to clearly articulate that. And that's something that is still, like, we're still working through it. So whether it's six acres or more or the size of the project, we have to demonstrate that plan to be able to justify what we think, you know, for this project that it would work, and that's a work in progress. And so that's why we've got a ways, you know, we're at the very beginning again, we haven't developed or in the process of working through this, and that would have to be articulated in our out. Yeah, I guess my concern is you take all this farmland and to me, you know, I'm from eastern Oregon and I come from much larger spreads. But when you talk about 15, 1600 acres in Lyn county and you're taking all that out of production and you don't theoretically have to put it back into some kind of agricultural use, no matter how much you want to, that raises a red flag for me. And I also wondered, when you put these solar panels in, are they concreted in? How much concrete goes in that earth and how is it removed if you have to, if it's abandoned and how can it be restored back to something workable, is that feasible? Have you done that in the past? So for how panels are installed, they're actually pile driven. I'm sorry? They're pile driven. So no concrete'actually needed for the instation of those. So the applications you want to take. So the, the intent, we try to be, you know, provide flexibility when we're addressing, you know, what materials will be used. So at this point, there's still, there's final engineering hasn't been done, but the anticipation is that piles can be used. And so, but we still have to plan for, because in these applications, you have to identify all the materials up ##n so if there is potential for concrete use, we want to be upfront about that. But also note that prior to construction, all these plans will be finalized with the intent that it's pile driven. But, you know, as a contingency, a lot of the application materials will also provide, like, what's the maximum case scenario if it has to be used? So that's why you'll see some things like that that contemplate, if that's why. Okay. I would also like to add, when it comes to concrete for the piles, typically, projects don't use concrete for the piles. Only in, like, really extreme cases of really terrible topography would you need something like that. But given that this side is pretty flat, if not entirely flat, that's not something that we're expecting, that's needed. The piles or the panels themselves, they'll be pile driven. And then we do something called a geotechnical study that measures how far down we would have to go. And it of, like, it measures the tolerance for piles, and that dictates what size and what length of it would be needed. And then if it can't be supported just by pile, then there would be alternatives that may include, like, concrete. Okay, so is this the largest project that you're involved with, your company? Okay, thank you. Ryan Glazer is next. And then Kurt Ker is after. Ryan Glazer. Okay, Kurt ker. Hi, my name is Kurt Kainer. I farm in the donut hole that you guys are creating. I have some direct questions that nobody's been able to answer yet. The first one is for you guys. Oregon's known for being a right to farm state. A lot of complications go. When you are mixing industrial with or residential with farming, what kind of complications are you going to see by doing the sub midle farm ground? Like I said, I chose not to succumb to $800 an acre or the 30 $40,000 signing bonus",

Just public hearing that we can put it the other aspect of that I'm really interested seeing from who living here working here because something could be onpreneurs too at some point and and there could be ways of growing startup tech companies. You know, an early stage that could come from is it game go wherever what worth renalw or whatever you don't know. Okay. Just that and kind of ask the question that u this is about with all the changes of and again, you know, I know a lot of companies are are there either hybrid. You know, some are remote but a lot for one reason or another, you know, want to try to get back to um a location center um workplace or workforce. If if there's significant amount of our residents who are remot work like does does the effort to bring higher wage jobs into Sherwood it's still it still matters in a post pandemic world. Right. Because there's still tits. Yes. Oay I just wonder it's mainly it's certainly because you don't know how long companies are going to allow much. Yeah. Right. And and so there's two method. One is that you're starting to then capture doesn't mean they're going to but without opening up land you can't read thatity number one. And number two, the city is in't care oper but it has a fiscal balance or a fisal a fiscal base that is very residential based. So the property taxes for services are fund primarily by one source which is the homeowner that that property tax say it'you want diverse tax that still will benefit the city. We oay all. And that's a great sideway between both your comments here for the next like we ra ahead. So more residents actually commute out of Sherwood for work and the city has recognized this back to even in the report that you have in front of you it talks about Sherwood as being a bedroom community and the council one of council's main goals is economic development and how can we have a better jobs to housing balance in Sherwood? Because we know that I don't want to say industrial, but having a better employment land based ratio. Yeah. It's going toa balance out the tax base here in Sherwood. So as city services increase in cost for, you know, police, library and all the services that we love here in Sherwood as those costs increase that those employment based companies or those employers can help balance the tax rate. So it's not all on single family. So one of the comments that I heard recently, an open house that we had was why are we specifically inuredood west why are you putting jobs or why are you building so much commercial out here? Sherwood is a bedroom community and should stay in a bedroom community and we should put mostly houses out there so that we keep this bedroom community feel. So when we are presenting this to the public and against the council for hearing I would like a slider a point that explains how much it costs per residential unit compared to a commercial or an industrial unit. So that someone who's looking at us making these decisions especially when we go to the sh west side of it that we are making this conscious decision to divide our land so that we are fiscally responsible and we don't have to continue to bond or burden our community. And I don't. I just want to make sure I realize that maybe it's buried in the details here but when we're doing presentation here and get coun council if that slide can be presented like here's what house costs, what conduct, you know per acre or something. I know there's numbers like that and it doesn't have to be services cost. Yeah. Because I heard one sign that it's like one dollar thirty two dollar thirty two for a, for every residence. But when you go into the commercial and the industrial side it's all less than a dollar. Cities generate more revenue and pay for less services. When you a manufacturing company you always resurface the local streets. You know that kind of man. And, and so it's, it's, it's um. You know that's, that s just fact. It is a factor and I want the citizens who are going to be hearing this either on our live stream this evening or when it comes to the council hear hearing to understand and as we go through the sugest process why we're focusing heavily on changing our job. It sounds like it's should probably be something of like financially where we are now compared to where we'd like to be. And I think um a way to think about that would be or highlighting that what do you call it the deficit of what what it costs. What it costs to service a residential home insurerwood compared to what it, what, what that home provides in fiscal revenue. And if we could show say how much commercial or industrial development would help offset to get that ratio equal I think that is probably a good, that'll be a good number. Local level. We've had've had cover session. We've seen study that another bedroom community did the finance director in North Qu little different from",

        "text": " economic maturity or lack of maturity availability of various clean energy technologies? And then I guess not necessarily hand in hand, but from mark, do you have good projections about future data center AI crypto usages? And there's a lot of unknowns there. So, so on the, on the technology opportunities, this is one that, that we have, have tried to limit that, with a couple of exceptions, to technology that is commercially viable and therefore has price forecasts already. And so this is, this is not pilot projects or lab projects because we don't know whether those are feasible at scale or what they would cost in the future. So that is a caveat to the analysis to say that in 2040s, it's probably quite conservative because there are likely to be other technology options, potentially cheaper technology options that are not being considered. The exceptions to that are that we do include direct air capture options, both liquid solvent and solid sorbent options, because when we, particularly when we are going to net zero targets that some other states have, it is not possible to meet those targets without some kind of CDR technology. And so those are included there, but they're not showing up until later on. Our technology price forecast come from public studies. So a lot of those are coming from NREL forecasts about what technologies are going to do over time. And then for things like batteries. Batteries. We rely on vehicle forecast models because, in large part, lithium ion has been driven down by vehicle adoption, and then we have electrolyzer costs and other supply chain components for different fuels as well. What was the second question? I forgot the second part of it. It was projection around data centers, AI, crypto usage. Yeah. So, so this is a large uncertainty that is, that is going into the model. It is a difficult thing to characterize because it is a, a very mobile market. It's something that, depending on conditions, you could switch in a six month period as a data center developer to go from one place to another place. And so it's hard to capture that. But we know that the market is, is large across the US. We've done our own modeling, looking at regressions against different factors and find that existing data center activity, pools of labor, are the things that are drawing people the most to developing in a particular place and also proximity to, to information networks. In this analysis, we've, we are proposing to use the forecast that the Northwest Power and Conservation Council has come up with for data center adoption over time. That'll be one of the things that we discuss in the working groups. Yeah, that's great question from Martha. Will we be using any of the climate tools like carbon offsets? So, yes, so, in, and that's something that we will get into more detail in the working groups talking about the options for, for meeting the emissions constraints. So there, I think they'there, will be differences between the scenarios that we're looking at. So in the 80% scenario, then I think the options there will be limited based on that policy. If we stretch that to looking at 95% or net zero, then we are, we are now in a place where we will need to have, have some type of offsetting technology or NCS options. And so that's where some of that will come in. And the discussion for that will be in the working group for that. Thank you, Jerer. We probably have a time for a couple more. So, for Michael La, how would you model a potential scenario that includes the development of a statewide, quote, smart grid and distribution system, upgrades and improvements to facilitate community level and household level electricity cost control, peak demand management and resiliency, especially with respect to the cost for such an option and how those costs would be addressed and by whom, and how to navigate opposition by ious that may not see this approach to be in their business interests, so that the realistic feasibility, potential for such a scenario can be evaluated. That a mouthful, Michael? Jeremy, do you track that? Yeah. Yeah. So the, this is, it's getting into the, the, the types of implementation policy that could achieve outcomes for the state. And many of those outcomes will be modeled in, in our, in our model. So the things that that would facilitate, would include demand participation, both in terms of building technologies and, and vehicle technologies, and that demand participation could be used for grid scale services, but it also could be used for local distribution services. And we'll be picking up the grid scale part and to a lesser extent, the distribution part. So, distribution, if we think about the distribution of, of avoided costs for capacity investments, it's probably average about $50 a kilowatt year, but there'll be peaks across the state, maybe up to like $400 a kilowatt year. And those",

We'll now move on to topic 520 24 state legislative wrap up hi, good afternoon commissioners. You have your full set of Gr F interspersed. People do chair rotations as necessary. We are happy to be here this afternoon. I am Earon Doyer, senior government relations manager and I am proud to say I will be talking the least out of all of us today because the team is ready to tell you what happened. So today we are going to go through a wrap up of the 2024 legislative state legislative session, first House highlighting what happened on the priorities that the board adopted in preparation for the 2024 session. And then we'll go into the legislative hot topics, those big issues where there's a lot of impact on county and then highlight what we expect the interim work to look like and then planning for the 2025 session because, you know, it's never too early to start the plan. So just as a reminder and then I will step out, the legislative priorities were adopted by the board in December of 2023. For the 2024 session, the county had three priorities and clean water service had more and they're highlighted here just to remind you what they are. But really looking to maintain our ability to do the work that we need to do as a county through resources workforce and then focusing in on the courthouse and how we serv serve those justice needs. And then in clean water services, of course, always looking for opportunities for infrastructure investment and protecting our ability to do the financing or financing that you need to do water quality as part of their mission and their resiliency work. So with that, I am going to step away from the chair and turn it over to my colleagues to talk about priority one. Thank you. Arion Pabloz Valzuela Government relations manager for the record so the first topic I want to touch on here is just community corrections. We were able to obtain $16 million in funding for statewide for community corrections programs. So that funding was included in HB 5204 and it's intended to back bill funding that was cut at the beginning of the biennium, which you all are aware of. And just so you all know, the amount of funding that we expect to get out of that is about $.4 million. And that is specifically to make sure that we do not have to lay off folks and we can mitigate personnel action as a result of that. So yeah, with that, I'll go ahead and pass it over to Carl. Sorry, sorry. Just because I'm trying to keep track. Do we have. And maybe I should be waiting, but on this topic of community corrections, is there either some workgr or interim work with regard to revisiting actual cost study or the whole reimbursement system? If it's listed later in the slide, I'll just. It's actually not. So that's a great question. Thank you. Yeah, there is a cost study that's going to be happening later on this year in partnership with the Department of Corrections. Thank you. Wonderful. Chair Harrington, commissioners, for the record, my name is Carly Silva Gabrielsson, one of your GR members, and I'd like to cover land use planning, which is 4063, House Bill 4063, which set forth new requirements for housing production in the metro region. It also requires the Department of Land Conservation and Development to seek funds from the legislature to provide technical assistance to the counties. We don't currently know the implementation timeline, but I will cover what spec ##ific included in the measure later in the presentation. Wish us for the record Zaker Khan, government relations manager here at Washington county. The board set a priority on workforce recruitment and retention tools. I you want to talk about one success that we had during the session, and that's through HP 5204 and HASL 42 or zero. Two, the policy language includes that we can use the deflection funding for workforce development. That was a really key win because if there's further authorizations of that funding in the future, we can continue to use that pot of funding or further workforce development in future sessions. Some items that were not successful were pay equity reform efforts, licensure reform efforts, and additional workforce funding. Work funding. The bigger pots of funding in regards to behavioral health funding. I can't remember if it was from my reading of House Bill 4202 and 5204 or a media article, but it sounds like PSU at least, and maybe some other players in higher ed received funding towards the specific purpose of building up the behavioral health workforce. So that's not even tied to deflection, correct? That's correct. So in house 50,204, Portland state and a series of other public universities received funding for scholarships and other program development. Good. Well, whereas",

        "text": " that storage was serving some community resilience function. And so, yeah, definitely. I think that we'll probably see more and more community solar projects adding storage for exactly that reason. And within the competitive reviewing process, you, there will be an evaluation of just how much resilience benefit is brought to the community through the project. And so, you know, a project that's powering a community space, a library, a fire hall, things like this are really clear examples. But if it's a you, a small battery that's just providing, you know, enough backup to charge some cell phones in one location, that probably won't score as well. But certainly adding batteries to community solar brings a project over into the resilience side of the projects, and that's a 100% reimbursement under the statute, then. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Jennifer. All right, Tucker, I'll let you know when you're off mute with where Jennifer was taking that, but we can hear you now. Tucker, can you hear me? Yeah. Okay, better. I'm just trying to follow up with where Jennifer was taking that, that question, and just trying to better understand the resiliency side of this is I'm in the community working with community partners, and they're going to ask questions about kind of what resiliency means. And I know that interest, too, and things like electric vehicle chargers and that sort of stuff is that rolls out kind of from the federal side. So if you solar into an ev charging station or stalled, is that, is that something that would qualify here, too, just from the transportation sector and kind of the importance of that for resiliency and whatnot. By the way, I appreciate you guys entertaining that. Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem, Talkucker. And I owe you a phone call, too. I catching up for my vacation, but I saw that you're in my voicemail. Rob, do you want to take that one? Sure. Yeah. So again, if there's a. If you can make the case that the solar part of the system is able to provide power to those charging stations in the event of a grid power outage, it would be providing resilience benefits. And we recognize the value of transportation, you know, in the event of an emergency, that could be very valuable. Resilience benefit to a community to have a fleet of vehicles that don't need refueling when all the pumps at the gas stations are down, you know, that' potentially a very good resilience benefit, but it would just have to be designed and constructed in such a way where the solar was able to provide, you know, charging the, to the station when the grid was down. One follow up to that, just to understand what this project covers, you're, if you're to do a project with multiple components like that, where you're, you know, you're including ev charging or anything of that nature, does it just cover the actual power production itself, you know, in the solar array or wind energy or whatever, or does it also cover the cost of your electric vehicle chargers and that, and that piece of it, electric vehicle charging infrastructure is eligible. And I may kick it over to James if there's any specific reference to that, but within the statute, it calls that out as an eligible cost. And so charging stations, yes, but thinking the vehicles, no, yeah, yeah, makes sense. Okay, thank you. Great. Thanks, Hooker. Anybody else have any questions for us? James put into the chat some existing follow up on the staff costs. Yeah, you wanted to kind of flag that was the language I was searching for in the rule. Yeah, and it's in statute too, just so people know. It's not just that we came up with it. It's good to always be clear about that. So we have, I've left this page up here and will, and just so people can see how to email or call if you have questions. There's a number for the program staff and an email address for program staff. And then it's easy to just search for our incentive page on our website. You can even just search community renewable energy grant and Google pops STR to our incentive page for that. So hopefully that is a place, a resource for you and some updates. We, for those of you who know, we also got an energy efficient wildfire rebuilding incentive program handed to us in 2021 last year. And that program is going live like as we speak, I think today or tomorrow hopefully. And then we'll be working to, after that we were able to have our it folks working to get our application portal online. So we have everything online that you need to know to apply or to give to a community member so that they can plan to apply. And then what we're doing is when the application portal goes live, we're emailing out, this is I think our fifth or 6th of these types of",

The solar components would impact over twelve acres of high value in arable farmland and for that reason required that council take an exception to the statewide policy embodied in goal three for agricultural lands order to be cited in the proposed location. So this was part of the request to hold the record open and during council'review in May of 2022 and the applicant submitted additional information on June 15. Andsel reviewed that information when they resumed their review of the DPO on June 24 of 2022. And in the draft proposed order, the department had recommended that under the reasons exception, which tends to be what the goal three exception falls under in our process, that the applicant had met two reasons, one being minimal impacts to agriculture and the other one was local economic benefit. However, we did have council comments received that questioned whether or not there had been enough evidence in the record to support a third reason, which was locational dependency. And that is the basis of the additional information that the applicant submitted in 2022 and also the basis for additional findings of fact that we included in the proposed order. So in the proposed order, we proposed additional findings of fact. The department. Oops. Next slide, please. I don't want to get too far ahead. Okay. So this map here shows the fact that it's all an exclusive farm use, and then the goal re exception area is that yellow area included in a smaller map on the right, which is the footprint of the solar facility. Next slide, please. So based upon the comments that we received and also the additional information submitted by the applicant, we did as a department make some changes from the draft proposed order in the proposed order to add additional findings of fact to support locational dependency as another reason for the goal three exception. And in based upon that information, there's a couple of things that we incorporated into a new recommended condition. Next slide. And it really has to come down to the, the fact that the solar facility, the proposed solar facility that requires the goal exception is in close proximity to both roads and other infrastructure that would support a finding that this location for the solar facility was cited and selected in support of the win components. And one of the comments that came from council had to do with wanting assurances that if the goal exception was approved, that the win components would be constructed as well. And it wasn't just a way to get the solar facility approved. And so how the department recommended we achieve that is really in subpar b of this new recommended condition, which is on the next slide, which basically requires the certificate holder. If council approved the goal three to demonstrate that it would construct what we estimated to be a minimum of 50 turbine string, and it's the 16 turbine to believe that we're in closest prox ##ity to the solar area that needed the goal exception. So in this subpar b, it says if commencement of wind energy generation components will occur more than twelve months after solar energy generation components, certificate holders shall submit to coun council for review at a regular scheduled council meeting, facility design documents and executed contracts. Example, given construction contract, power purchase agreement, or other evidence that demonstrates to council satisfaction that the turbine strings, with a minimum of 50 megawatt generation capacity, will be constructed in close proximity to the solar site, and that the wind and solar facility components will share the northern project substation and any existing roads during construction and operation prior to construction completion deadlines. And this was additional information provided by the applicant and in response to comments made bysel. So, based upon that new recommended condition, we felt that in our proposed order, we made that new finding effect, we supported it with a new proposed condition that we just reviewed and feel that that satisfied council comments and demonstrated that the facility could also add that third reason to the other two reasons that council had accepted as being met for the goal three exception. So at this point, I believe we're back at the straw poll or discussion. It looks like cindy might have a comment or a question then. Thank you. So, I'd like the addition of this. I just had a hard time putting together how this, how this is work. It's pre conststruction and so there's some thought that, okay, we're going to add wind later, after twelve months. And so can you kind of go through how the timing would work, like in the 11th? When is the presentation? At a regularly scheduled council meeting. Could it be five years, five years from a date? I was not certain that construction absolutely would be done. Or could they, could it just be kept? Well, if, if you go back one more slide, Nancy, I think maybe the opening language of this condition might",

        "text": " stakeholders involved. You get a lot of great ideas, but maybe not cons on all of those ideas. Here were some of the key findings, and we kind of broke it up into opportunities that exist for these small scale, community based projects. And then also some of the barriers and some of the opportun opportunities of note were the opportunity to address some equity issues and have projects that bring local benefits to communities, not necessarily directly to utilities or private developers. One of the really good ones that we kind of pleaseased out of the work groupoup was efficient land use and the ability of a local community to identify brownfield sites, other sites within the community that are likely to get community support for project development. There is a lot of nimbyism where people don't want to see them, they don't want them in their backyards. And if you work at the local level, you can identify the correct site that works for community members. For developing some these projects. Another big opportunity was improving local energy resilience. You're developing renewable energy. If you add energy storage, most typically in the form of batteries, you also have the ability to have emergency backup power systems. And that resilience component brings a lot of value that you don't see in the large scale developer turb projects. We've seen a lot of projects around Oregon, including, I mean, Salem has been a leader in this with the Saleem Smart Power center. And I know there's a project with PGE to look at, expanding that into a micro grid. These types of benefits that enable communities to continue to operate in the event of a prolonged power outers. We're one of the, um, great opportunities for development, increase local economic value. And that is the. Not only during construction, when you have these projects, essentially trade and commerce to the community, but once it's up and running, they can bring cost savings to publicly owned facilities by, you know, the benefit of the on site generation of electricity. We found that there's really opportunities in every community, but some communities face more barriers. And this really gets to the point that we saw that a lot of small communities just don't have the capacity to envision a project and get it over the finish line. There's a lot of administrative burden to getting these projects going, going, including grant applications, vetting contractors, permitting. Not every community, especially when you get to very small communities that may have just a couple of staff representing the municipality, it's more of a barrier for them. And some of those specific barriers are relating to financing and insurance for these projects. Regulatory hurdles like the siding and the permitting, and that local capacity and knowledge in the absence of hard recommendations. We came up with these guiding principles and this is what we found that all of the stakeholders could agree on, was these small scale projects can assist in meeting some of the state energy goals. I think it's important to note that the state energy goals, it's just as likely to meet them with large scale projects. They're based on essentially getting, getting carbon emissions out of the electricity generation sector in Oregon. And it doesn't matter how large a project is, they all, you know, contribute to those goals. But if you were able to develop projects with less local resistance, there's some value there. Equitable outcomes, again, bringing value and benefits to these smaller communities, maintaining affordable energy and rates for all Oregonians. That was an important component throughout the discussions. And a lot of the projects that have been going on in recent years, especially solar projects and projects are now coming in competitive or even cheaper than traditional fossil fuel generation. Just recently in Idaho, there was a solar project that was developed. It's going to be selling its energy to Idaho power at a rate that was lower than what they were paying for cold power. So these projects really have at the large scale reached parity or even lower cost than gas and coal. But at the small scale there's still some, there's still a financial hurdle where you don't get those economies of scale then the equitable distribution of costs and benefits. Project transparency we found that it's, these projects are, that are developed at the community level have much more transparency than when a developer from out of state comes in and develops thousand, hundred acres. And we just found that with the perspectives of so many stakeholders that you get a lot of buering ideas and that doesn't always lead to consensus, but it does give you a good canvas of what all the different concerns and opportunities are. By citing these projects within Oregon at the small communities scale' supporting economic development. We heard a really nice story about small wind project was developedside. Some of the larger wind projects forge and able to have a kind of a sybiotic relationship where several small projects together create an industry and facilities. So there really is an ongoing economic f for these community projects. Sometimes they leverage larger projects nearby, but not always. And then again, these unique contributions of small scale projects,",

        "text": " and installation of storage and want to hear whether they're still occurring and which of the options I'm going to go through in a moment would be the most effective at reducing the impact of those delays within what we can do with the program and how the program runs. So the options being considered include permitting the solar incentive portion of the rebate to be claimed separately from the storage portion following the installation of the solar system and proof that it's all complete. This would include passing any inspections from the authority having jurisdiction. It would also mean we'd have to tweak to how rebates are processed in power clerk the software that contractors used to place their reservation requests. Another option would be to extend the time that a reservation for peired solar and storage is valid for. This would allow more time for the storage to be installed. And a third option could be to increase the number of reservations that a contractor can have at a time for systems for residential customers who are not low or moderate income. This could allow contract to have reservations waiting for that installation storage to the storage to be installed while having a greater capacity to complete other projects at the same time. Are there any questions on this proposed potential rule change? Let's give a moment for people. We wait to see if anybody puts their hand up or has anything to say in the chat. I'm just going toa kind of ask for a clarifying question, but I know the answer to just to make sure everyone's clear. So we're trying to figure out different ways that we can make the new statute work. Right. And we want to hear from contractors their thoughts on how would be best for this to work, whether that's splitting payment. So if solar goes in first, but storage goes in later, we can pay out for part of the solar, whether it's extending a reservation so that you have longer to complete the project, or increasing the cap so that folks aren't waiting for that storage to come on before being able to pick up another application out there. Right? Does that sound like the approach? Yeah, exactly. We're going to align the definitions with what was'changed in the legislature. And then we'Renna need to see if there's other tweaks to be made to the rules to make that change in the definitions kind of more effective throughout the rest of the program and how contractors can install the solar. It looks like Angela has a hand up so we can hear from Angela on this idea. Anyone else that has thoughts on this, it's a great time to share. We'll also have time at the end so you don't have to chat now, but we can talk. Talk it through and then we'll call Trica in a minute after Angela goes. Should be up. Yeah. Angela Kly Cook withia I don't have any question at this time, but I have some comments. Is this the right time to comment on those ideas? If it's not like what we're talking about on this slide, that'd be great. That's fine. Go ahead. Okay. Well, thank you, by the way, if for thinking of these ideas, I really like options A and B. Having both of them, I think would be ideal. I think it would be helpful to the contractors to have those payments split since timing can be uncertain of when the actual product will arrive, and extending that reservation as well, when there is need for it. I mean, nobody wants to extend their reservations too long because they'd like to move on to the next projects. So it doesn't seem like that would be something that would be misused or something like that. I think those two are appropriate. I'm not sure on c. My kind of first reaction is that that's not needed. And there, I think some of my members would have concerns that if more reservations were allowed for non income restricted reservations, that it could make these funds be depleted faster. But I'm not sure. I'd like to get some feedback from folks and be interested in what others have to say. Thanks. Great. Thanks, Angela. And then we can go to Trisha. And Trisha, I'll let you know when. Looks like you're off mute. You're off mute now. So my name is Kisha, I'm with Prostat electric and solar. These, are these proposed changes or are these changes that are the set rules now? These are proposed just kind of flowing out options to kind of get feedback on right now. And there'll be another comment period after we draft up some rules. So this is like, still very early in the process. The statute doesn't become effective until the start of 2024, and our rules could not become effective before then as well. So this is kind of still early in the information gathering. Okay. One question I had is with the, you talked about separating solar and storage. I'm assuming that means application process as well. Would storage have. It doesn't actually, Trisha. No. So the application would come in the same way with solar plus storage",

Okay, it's now 944, and I'd like to call the meeting back from recess and continue with the next agenda item, which is public comment. So this time is reserved for the public to address the council regarding any item within council jurisdiction that's not otherwise closed for comment. And Nancy, I'm going to need to ask you if we've got. I see you gave me one person here that's in the room that'd like to provide public comment, so we'll do that one and then we'll check the webinar and the phone after that. So Mister Jones, we're ready to hear your comments. Welcome. Thank you, chair. Is this on? No. Push that button. There you go. You're on now. Thank you, chair Hal and fellow council members. I want to first thank you all again. Don't think for a minute I don't see this opportunity to address this council as a privilege, and I always want to make sure that we do so in a respectful way. Myself and my fellow community members have spoken before and I just want to ensure that all of our concerns are communicated clearly and concisely with, with all due respect. So I've attended a number of the last. I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. My name's Troy Jones. Thank you. My name's Troy Jones. My address is 22335 Gap Road in Harrisburg, Oregon. I've attended a number of meetings in the past and I've spoken about my concerns specifically to the inequities and some of the Oregon state statutes related to land use. I don't want to continue that same conversation today. I think I've made myself clear on that matter. A couple of my neighbors and myself came to the meeting, I believe it was in February, and we spoke to the concern of water contamination and also the lack of an end of life policy for solar panels in the state. That concern is still a legitimate concern. The reason we're here is because there's a proposal for a large solar facility near our community. It's nearly 1600. The notice of intent indicates it's nearly 1600 acres and it's on zoned efU, or exclusive farm use properties. That's high value exclusive use farmland use properties. And while this hasn't been formally applied, the application hasn't been formally applied for yet. We're trying to stay ahead of the pitch count. We're trying to be proactive in our approach and our communication. So the council is well aware of the concerns that that exists within the community. A main and primary concern is the potential loss of that Efu property. I've spoken before in regard to the amount of properties EFU properties have been lost over the last number of years. There's records that show as of 2022, up to 660,000 acres of farmland has been lost to urban growth boundaries and industrial sightings. There's a multitude of other concerns that we have specifically to wildfire concern, wildlife impacts, and the loss of wetland. Most of this property is considered farmed wetlands, which is also a huge concern to us. What we hope is, our hope is, is that our presence and our continued communication with FSSEAC will have a positive impact on the council, and the council will take these considerations into, into their process as it evolves. And again, all we're trying to do is stay ahead of this. I personally believe that if nothing was spoken of and it just comes about, it'll be too late in the process. And that's why, that's why we're here. That's why we're present. A lot of my neighbors in the community that I live in, they're not able and capable of coming to these meetings. I know that Webex is available to them, but they're not always very good on the zoom and the webex type format. So I come and I speak on behalf of the group, and I appreciate that, that your patience and your thoughtfulness in regard to this particular project. I hope that you strongly will consider our concerns as this goes along, as the process evolves. We understand the entire flow process very clearly. We understand how it evolves, the public comment periods and that type of thing. So it's, again, we just want to make sure that we're doing a good job of communicating our concerns before we get to those processes. So with that, I really appreciate your time. Thank you for your comment. I just ask a quick question for you. As you know, you know, we get both side, the developer and certainly the people they're working with that want the project and others might not. So is the EFU issue overriding? If we had condition, if there were suitable conditions to speak to the land use. Land use water, not so much land use, I guess, but the water contamination, the end of life of the solar panels, those issues, conditions were applied that recognized that impossible possible solutions. The fact that it's efu conversion, is that the",

        "text": " it's important that those comments get made, they get made within this comment period, they're put on the record and that they relate to our standards because we are a standards based review process. That is the scope of our review. Once all of those things happen at the end, the very last step is the final order in the decision on a site certificate. And that decision is entirely in the hands of councilsel determines whether they will approve the site certificate and whether they will adopt the final order. They might want more changes. So there, there's a process in which it's fairly iterative and the intent is that it builds in the public participation and the input that we get from review ##ing agencies and the public as we proceed in our review. Next slide. So I'm going to jump into the facility as approved and also the amendment. The site certificate was approved by council on February 25 of 2022. So this ISN an t approved, but not yet constructed facility. The certificate holder is Obsidian Solar Center, LLC, which is a subsidiary of a parent company known as Obsidian Renewables LLC. As approved, it's a 400 megawatt capacity solar facility with related and supporting facilities, including transmission line and a 50 megawatt battery storage in a site boundary that was approved to be 3921 acres, located about 8 miles northwest of here, and it is within Lake county. And again, this is the first Amendment request. So I know that map is not all that easy to see. But to the right of that slide in the orange is the solar array. Then there's an orange line that goes to the left, and that would be the transmission line as approved. There's a little wedge, and that little wedge is the point of interconnection as approved, to attach to an existing PGE transmission line. Next slide. So just a little bit of the procedural history, I went over a little bit. We did get the preliminary request in April. We had additional requests for information that we issued in May. We got all of that information back from the certificate holder, and we deem the PRFA complete. So we call it a complete request for amendment July 31. That's when we received that complete request. And then we issued the. The department's draft proposed order on August 1, along with that notice of the public hearing. And all of those materials were made available on our webpage and, you know, per review. And then tonight we're here to do the public hearing next slide. And all the other steps are TBD based on what happens tonight. So, in short, the request for amendment one is requesting Coun council's approval to make a series of changes. And the way I would frame it is, as I explained in the one map, there's that wedge that would allow them to run the transmission line and connect to the PGE line. This request is basically to add additional area and components and little reconfiguration of the transmission piece and the collection lines to allow for the option to tie into the parallel transmission line, which is BPA. And they would have to go at it from a slightly different direction because they can't go underneath. And there are s some upgrades that need to be made, changes in the voltage and the configuration to allow them to tie into the BPA line. And the way that it has been proposed by the certificate holder is that their intent is to do one or the other, not both, but it gives them some optionality on how to connect and which line they would connect to, depending on, you know, their power purchase agreement. So there's a few things they're going to add and expand the site boundary to add this additional 169 acres. I'll show you on the next slide. They're going to construct one of the approved generation step up substations in that location. And this is if they pick this location for the innertie, they will increase the length in the voltage from 115 to 138 kilovolts. And that, again, is the upgrade required to intertie to a BPA line as opposed to a PGE line. Similarly, the increase of voltage for the collection system is so to integrate into that 138 kb. And there's a minor, some change in the structure type and height. I think it's a ten foot change in the height for the above ground transmission. And it's already approved for a combination of above ground and below collection system. So. Okay, next slide. So this slide, hopefully you can see on the map, there's the approved facility, which is in the black, the orange square that's off to the crosshatch, and there's a better map. Behind us on the wall is the area that they're asking to add to the site boundary. That's that area e, that's the 169 acres. About half of that is in kind of pink. That is their proposed actual microsing area where the actual components would be cited at",

We're really glad to get all of this engagement and close reading of the rules, especially when we have a new program like this and we're creating all brand new rules. We really need to get a lot of eyes on them. So just maybe a couple of quick reminders. I have a few closing remarks, and if anybody else thinks of a comment in the meantime, please go or please raise your hand. So we want to thank everybody for attending. Written testimony again will be accepted until the close of business 05:00 p.m. on Friday, January 28, 2022. No other comments or exhibits will be accepted after this date unless Odo decides to extend the public comment period. Excuse me, for everyone. We will review all comments and summarize them in a hearing officers report the Oregon Department of Energy will make the ultimate decision regarding what is in the permanent rules. And we plan to file the permanent rules in February next month. And the rules will be effective upon filing. And we will issue the first opportunity announcement shortly afterward. And as Robin mentioned, our plans were to do that in March. I't, I think Ray had one more question about in the chat about priorities and the opportunity announcement. I don't know if there's anything that you want to say about priorities and the opportunity and announcement. Rob, are Christie anything that we would add about, about that at this time, or is that a topic for this Friday's advisory committee meeting? That's how I see it, yeah, that we'll have more information on that as we develop the scoring matrix. Yep. And also part of the reason we don't put all those details in the RUl is so we can be responsive to situations as they arise. And we have two more questions that I saw in the comments. One from Ray and one from Angela. I'll start with Angela because she'first, she wants to know if leased systems are eligible for funds. U. I will look more closely at the bill. I know I was looking very closely the other day about ownership of the systems, and I believe that the language in the bill is very clear about benefits, what types of benefits and who benefits. But there's not a lot in the bill that I was spotting about ownership of the projects themselves. So it, as far as I saw in the bill, it did't not say that, for instance, the applicant had to own the energy systems, but they do have to benefit those communities that are named in the bill. So again, we will look at that very closely because I know other, at least one of the comments we received on the comment portal did also mention something about ownership of the systems. So thanks for raising that, Angela. And I think that maybe you got raised question. I just didn't hear the whole question, but it was about favoring smaller projects over larger ones. Is that the one you were talking about, Wendy? At first, yes. Okay, great. Okay, so, yeah, that's something we'll be talking about at the advisory committee, which has a meeting Friday. I shared the link. It's open to the public. Public comment can be made. The materials are there and you're welcome to email me with thoughts. So even if you can't go, want to take a look at the materials and let us know what you're thinking? Please feel free. Is there anything else in the chat that you see or. I'm not seeing any other hands raised. So if anybody has any process questions, bring them up at this point. U. But otherwise, I think we're getting ready to wrap up the hearing. The time that I see on my computer is 1010. So without any other questions, I will conclude the hearing. Close the hearing at 1010. Thanks you for everybody for coming and for providing comments. And again, this concludes a public hearing. Thank you very much. So sty, I think, have you ended the recording or you can end of the recording now? I think I will end the recording.",

So we would like to request some flexibility when it comes to specific modules and specific battery type until we're a little bit closer to construction and when we can actually secure all the equipment needed. So you wouldn't actually be locking yourself into using the panels from the Georgia plant? That's pretty much our biggest advantage. So we would most likely be going with Q cells technology when it comes to panels. Yeah. And this is Todd cornet from the Oregon Department of Energy. I'll respond to that a little bit. So, typically, because the timeframes are, you know, somewhat far out in terms of the application submittal to the point in time where projects get approved and ultimately constructed, we do not lock specific technologies in. So our process is meant to look at sort of the proposal, what are the impacts of that? But if the panel is the same size, the dimensions we've looked at, all the same information, we don't lock it into a specific same thing with the battery storage. Now, if ultimately something gets approved and the applicant comes in or at that point, the certificate holder come in and want to do something very different. And we haven't done a proper evaluation that would require an amendment. But that's typical with wind facilities and solar facilities, because there is so much change in technology. We do not lock into a very specific, in this case, battery storage or solar type of panel. What we see in the industry, as I understand it, is that things are so back ordered that you sort of have to order the stuff two years in advance. So you're almost required by the market to pick your technology, you know, on the same timecale as you're making the applications. So you'll actually have to have the stuff when you want to start building. So that would't provide a basis for, you know, allowing technology changes at the last minute. But let me move on. Try and cover some other things that maybe haven't been covered before. Another aspect of the notice that's sort of vague is the business about whether they're solar cell are going to be fixed. Or whether they're going to be on some axis that rotates and be associated with a whole lot of machinery, gears and gearboxes, moving them around. Will the FEC at least require them to figure that out before the, you know, in the application process? Yeah. So for ours, you know, other solar projects have either come in and said that they're going to be fixed. Or typically what happens is the applicants submit something bigger than they actually could produce. Just to make sure that they get flexibility. So again, I'll let the applicant kind of respond to that. But you know, if they have some option where it could be fixed or it could be on an axis and rotating. They would likely submit the kind of rotational version because that's more significant. And then later on if it makes sense for them to do the lesser, build a lesser kind of components, they would do that rather than vice versa. Submitting something lesser and then having to go through an amendment process with us. So I'm just anticipating that. But I'll let the applicant kind of respond. That's what we've seen in prior applications. And this is Paul Hicks again with Tetra Tech. One of the things that would be included in the analysis is it's, you know, at this state proposed to provide some flexibility as those choices need to get made. So what we'll look at is like let's take example an analysis of like glare for you know, potential glare for a facility. We would look at that differently in the modeling for like a fixed tilt as opposed to one that's rotating on single axis. So the analysis would be able to contemplating and take into account both if those options need to be maintained open or if, you know, the applicant chooses that they want to go with just one or the other. That's what would be reflected in the actual application. When that's, when that's prepared. Thisraan applicant to add to that U at Q cells. When we're designing projects we. Our standard is to go with bifacial module with single access trackers. The reason why we wrote in the NOI whether like, you know, to accommodate for whether it's fixed tilt or singlexis tracker. It's again, for flexibility. We're not typically that be for areas that have challenging topography or there might be some other site constraints that make us, might need to actually have some sections or if not the whole entire thing, fixed tilt. But our standard is to go with bifacial modules and a single axis tracker because it's our most efficient setup. Thank you. That's helpful. There were some suggestions in the notice that there wasn't really any water use at all. How do you keep them clean? Without water, the panels don't need to be cooled. It's not about cooling, it's about cleaning. It's a flyover. The birds do what they do on them. The dust",

        "text": ", chair. Chair how so good morning. We are going to talk about the energy strategy that Odo has been directed by the legislature to engage in, and Odo is going to be leading this work, but it's going to be a combined effort with other state agencies as well as we're going to have working groups and a lot of other engagement and listening sessions with the public. So ll, hopefully we engage a lot of communities to contribute to the energy strategy, which we're really excited about. And so it's going to be related to the FSET work quite a bit because we're going to have a lot of land use conversations and conversations around natural resources and make some of those decisions, or I guess the strategy itself won't make those decisions, but outline some of the future decisions that the U, the state's going to have to make around energy policy and hopefully we can provide some recommendations so l, later in the governor's office in that process. So we're just at the beginning of development and energy strategies. This is a great opportunity to provide feedback and start getting engaged. So hopefully, we're obviously enthusiasts about the energy strategies. Hopefully we can get you excited about it. If we're successful, maybe we'll have us come back. We talk to you about what we've found in some of our energy modeling and some of the recommendations we have. So if we go to the next slide, our agenda. So we're going to, we're going to talk about an organ energy landscape to kind of give a broad overview of what we're seeing and what's happening today and we'll talk about the energy strategy and why we're doing it. And the technical analysis that will inform the strategy engagement opportunities. And hopefully we'll leave some time at the end to have some discussion. But please don't mind stopping us along the way because we've got a lot of interesting information in the slides. And if you have immediate question, I don't want you to forget it. So let's dive in as we go along and we'll work with the time we have. Okay, we'go to the next slide, please. So this is a Sankey diagram and this is trying to show how energy flows through the state, how it's produced and imported into the state and how it's used at the end use consumption. So it's showing the energy flow. And so all of the different energy uses we use been converted to btus or british thermal units. So we can kind of compare and contrast the different energies that Oregon uses and basically tell Oregon's story at a really high macro level. So I would highlight the energy produced within the state. If you're looking over the left, what's imported and certainly the small amount up in the upper right that's exported as well as if you look to the right, the residential consumption, industrial consumption, transportation consumption. So we have some robust goals within the state to decarbonize. And so a lot of the decisions we're going to have to make going forward are going to need, we're going to make some decisions around how we want to use some of these resources, generate electricity, orate fuels for transportation or some of these end use consumptions. And a lot of those are going to be some challenging decisions and it's some big, big shifts for us. So we do produce a lot of energy within the state, but there's still a lot that we import into the state. So I do want to pause because a lot of people have questions about this sankey chart, so I want to see if you have any at this time. No, Mister Chairman, I have one question. Councilr Devlin, in terms of some of the resources, I'll give you a particular reference to the resource of hydropower. Is this a snapshot? And it is a snapshot in time just for 2020, right. In the sense that hydropower is very beneficial to the region. Obviously there are environmental impacts, but it's one of the things that makes it possible for us to move away from fossil fuels. But at the same time, hydropower varies from year to year and can vary quite a bit in terms of the availability. Yeah. So it certainly can vary quite a bit. So it, it is representative of this year, but even in that variance, I would say the proportions here are going to be comparable, even if it year to year. You see that change in hydro, the proportion of kind of hydrogen, natural gas to petroleum. If I showed you a chart over the last five years, this would look, it would look very similar because this is at such a high macro level. But you're right, we are very dependent on that hydroelectric system, and it has made for relatively inexpensive energy for Oregon in the past. Does that answer your question? Oh, yes, it does. This is Kent. I have the nuclear that's up there. That's just because we're on the grid. Is that right? Yeah. Because none's being produced here. Yeah. So this is",

        "text": " an opportunity to make comments. It is not a contested case hearing and participation in this meeting. I'll get more into the contestic case when I get into our process, but participation in this meeting and making comment is not required in order preserve the right to standing or bring up ask to join into a contested case. We do ask that everybody hold their questions and comments to the end of the presentation. And then the last part is, you know, please just be respectful. We like to conduct ourselves in a respectful manner. We have a lot of material to cover and we just want to make sure that everybody has time to make a comment. If there are a lot of people who want to comment, you may have to put a time limit, but we'll just play it by yours. We don't want. So, as I noted, the siting division, we serve as technical staff to what we call it energy Facility siteing council. We use a lot of acronyms, but we call it FEC for short. So the FSEEC process is a state process and it's set in Oregon administrative rules, in oregonised statutes. And we have 16 general standards, which I will cover in a minutes. And as I said, the Cing division staff really works in support of council and our job is to put applications through technical review. So to make sure that these facilities can meet the requirements of those standards that need to be met in order to havesel be willing to approve a. And then it also has conditions that certificate holder has to to commit to in order to have that site certificate. Next slide. So this slide is really just to explain our role and why we're involved. We're not involved in all energy projects. We're limited to those that are defined through the ORS 406 9300, which is what defines a state jurisdictional energy facility. And there are different rules that apply. This is basically the actual reason why we're here tonight is that this proposal falls under the definition of an asset jurisdictional facility for a solar facility. And it's really defined by either 160 acres of high value farmland, 1280 acres of land that's predominantly cultivated, or at least meet the capability classes for agriculture, and then a limit of 1000 920 acres or larger for in other land. So we're, you know, this proposed facility covers 8075 acres, approximately 12.6 mil square miles of private land. That is z for exclusive car. So that is why it's an asset jurisdiction facility. And for that reason, the proponent, the applicant needs to apply for a site certificate. And in order to obtain that site certificate, they must demonstrate that that facility could meet these standards that we're going to talk about tonight. And the first step in that process is submitting what is called the notice of intent. We issued a public notice on the notice of intent in October and scheduled this public information meeting as part of our outreach on the not. This is kind of my favorite slide is at a glance. You can see next slide the process laid out kind of in a bracket. So we set, we have seven major steps in the srificet process. And as you can see with the red box, we are at the very beginning, we're at the notice of intense bees. And those purple boxes, they're supposed to be green, but projectors not projecting the right colors. Those purple boxes are the areas, the ones that say public notice, comment period inting and across our areas where the public has the opportunity to provide input and engage in our process. So at the notice of intent phase, an applicant will submit a proposed project, and the information that they submit in that notice of intent is basically a desktop level analysis of the, you know, the idea, the concept of their facility, what they want to do, where, and then the known information as it applies to our standards. We then issue a public notice. We hold a public information meeting, and when we issued that public notice on October 10, we opened up a public comment period. And so until that public period closes on the noticingent, which is disown first, the public has the opportunity to provide comments on this proposed project. It's the first step of getting public input on this project, and our council is very interested in hearing what the public has to say. So if you have thoughts or opinions about a facility that's under our sector jurisdiction, I highly encourage you to engage in our process because it will help our council make a decision. So we are at the very first step of a notice of times after the public meeting and the public comment period closes. And during this time, we are also coordinating with what we call reviewing agencies. Reviewing agencies are local governments, local, effective governments, the state resour agencies like we have ODfw here tonight, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. We as a department at division",

        "text": " abandonment we talked about. But the other thing is, I wanna know how the federal government can take zoning and just change it. Because if that's a fact, can I go to my property, which is six acres right now, subdivide to six? Cause I'd love to do that for my family if I can, but really, you know, so they can all put them on, but I cannot. I'm just an individual. Nobody. Okay. And then fire mitigation. We live in an area that is one of the worst fire areas. We had to have our own people in our town by a truck. The city, the state, the county, no one's helping us, we're helping ourselves. You know what, and so when you look at that and I have that solar, and we know for a fact there has been fires from solar panels before it hits those hills, how are we getting there? How are wenn survive? Those are my questions. So there are a lot of comments in there which I appreciate. Many of them did tie to a council standard. So I'm gonn hit a couple of those. But then you guys can feel free after that. And if we haven't answered all your questions, please ask again. Sure. So one of them was on decommissioning. So, and I think that's a good opportunity to bring this up. We had it on the slide that chase brought up with our standards. One of our standards is decommissioning, meaning that the applicant in terms of their application, has to submit to us how they're going to decommission the facility. So they have to show all of the details of what they're going to do ##m and then how much it's going to cost and then we review that. And if we agree with that, then there's two things. One is they will have a condition that says at the end of the useful life the facility, they will return the site to a useful non hazardous state. Meaning they will have to come back to the energy facility siting council, assuming it gets approved, assuming it gets built, and then ultimately, you know, gets retired, they would have to come back and say, okay, we're done, we had a good run, now we're going to take it out. Then they will to show us and the we hold prior to them beginning construction, they submit to us a bond in the full amount. So, you know, some of these solar farms, you know, could be 810 million dollars. So we hold those in perpetuity and those are updated annually for inflation. So if for whatever reason they're unable to decommission the facility, we have it, the bond and the amount of money in order to make sure that that happens. So that's a big deal with our process. We spent a lot of time and a lot of effort and you know, councilmb member Condon raise your hand again. She makes a big, big deal out of this and we've been looking at this very significantly in the last couple of years to make sure that we get this right. So again, you brought it up and I thought this was a good opportunity to kind of raise that we have a new wildfire mitigation standard, so we will look at that. We also have. One of the points you brought up I think was important is whether it's state doing it or the county's doing it. The use a solar use is allowed in the exclusive farm use. So the Department of Land Conservation and Development Commission has rules and statute. It is an allowed use subject to a conditional use. So even if it wasn't the state doing it, the county would have to review that. They would have an opportunity to request that county level. So that doesn't mean that they're going to submit a good application. That doesn't mean that we're going to approve it. I just want to be clear. This is an allowed use, and not just in eastern Oregon, it's in the Willamette Valley as well. So I don't know if you had any other. Feel free, if I miss anything. So if I miss anything, feel free to ask it again and I'll happily answer it. But one of the things I hear a lot is that we're taking farmland away. It feels like a lot of people think that we're purchasing this land, but we're not. We're leasing 100% of the site. The original owners who we signed this deal with, they still retain their land much. Your use is taking that away. The use might change. And that's why we want to propose an alternative. Because again, unfortunately, we can't grow rye grass under solar panels. But that being said, we don't want to take the land completely out of production. I understand that grazing isn't the same, and I understand that grazing could be done elsewhere, but I think it might be a good compromise. That's something that the project can support in the sense that cheap in solar panels can coexist",

        "text": " siting committee more often than they may be required to? Yeah, the statutes allow for opting in by the developers so developers can opt into FSEEC even though they're less than these automatic thresholds. And then local governments, primarily counties, can have some ability to defer to f sec. Thus far, none have in either circumstances. So we've yet to see that. Thank you. Next slide, please. All right, so you can see this slide breaks down kind of. These are only state jurisdictional, these are not local government. So I can't tell you exactly what the amounts would be for local government, but for f sector jurisdictional facilities, these are the numbers. So the first state solar project was approved in 2018. And now, really that's mostly what we're seeing. There's not entirely what we're seeing, but mostly what we're seeing are new solar projects. So you can see the total of active projects. And this is, you know, under, either in operation or currently under review, about 4.7 gigawatts of projects that are currently active for FSEEC. And then just for information, you know, what does that equate to about 73 sq. Mi of occupation? You know, the difference between, they say wind facility and a solar facility is solar facilities are basically a fence line around the entire project. And so it's entirely converted. Whatever it was, it's now largely, you entirely fence line around a solar facility, whereas wind projects, you can farm right up to the base of the wind turbine. So quite a bit different in terms of the footprint impact, and then you can see the inactive one. So since we started seeing solar projects, we've already seen a couple either withdrawn or expired. And in fact, the very first project that was approved that I referenced in 2018 that was approved had a three year timeline to begin construction. They didn't begin construction. They requested a time extension. They didn't build the project or begin construction within that second three year timerame, and that project just expired. So under their amendment, after three years of approval, they had indicated in their justification that they didn't have a power purchase agreement. And then at this point, they've just let their project expire. So some projects move forward, some move forward very quickly, some don't. And there's an example of one that didn't move forward. Next slide, please. All right, so getting to the wind and transmission thresholds. So for a wind facility, it would be 150 mw nameplate capacity before it came to the energy facility siting council. So, and that's really, you know, each wind turbine has a maximum output on it. So it would be the cumulative maximum output listed on each wind turbine. So, for example, turbines are getting bigger and producing more power. And so if a project was proposed at four turbines, at 4 mw each, at 38 wind turbines, it would become f sector jurisdictional, just to give you an idea. And then transmission. So it's all three of these. So for a transmission line to be jurisdictional, it would have to be greater than 10 miles, equal to or greater than 230 kv, and then also in more than one jurisdiction. So all three of those have to be hit before it comes to FEC. Next slide, please. So I like this graphic because it kind of shows you going back in time, know, the size increase of wind turbines. So back in 2001, you know, turbines were about 242ft tall. Now they're 650ft tall. And you can see that sort of related to a couple of, you know, the US bank tower in Portland at 536 and Multtena Falls at 620. So these are quite, quite significant projects in terms of the size or they are increasingly, but just sort of of interest. The energy Facility siting Council actually approved the first state jurisdictional wind project in 1983. So the review of renewable energy projects, a lot of people think it's a fairly new thing, but it's not. So FSEEC approved its first wind facility in 1983. This was in Curry county. There were a lot smaller wind turbines at the time. It was never actually constructed and the approval expired. But, you know, the history of it goes back quite a ways. So now you can see the total amount of active projects, about 3.5 gigawatts of wind. And then over the, you know, primarily since the early two thousands, the number of projects that have either been approved and let their approvals expire or withdrew or built less than what was entirely approved almost equals what is actually active, about 3.5 gigawatts of wind energy. So that gives you an understanding. Next slide, please. So getting into the battery storage question. So battery storage is not f sector jurisdictional by",

As I mentioned, the applicant for this proposed facility is Wagon Trail Energy Center, LLC and it's a project specific LLC and a wholly owned indirect subsidia area, Nexterra Energy Resources, LLC.

I don't know if it's as strong as a guarantee, but just establishing that relationship. So if you could just check the conditions for organizational expertise. Thank you. Regarding organizational expertise and comments received on the record of the DPO, there were multiple commenters that expressed their support for Nexterra as a company, as well as for the wagon trail solar project. And those commenters and comments with those comments, the department doesn't recommend any changes be made to the proposed order. It just was their support for for the company. Next slide please.

So going back to the slide, so the end of 2019 is a while ago, so'curious to see if the numbers have grown or lost based on the facilities. So that's something we can do as well is make sure that we get the a more current number rather than 2019 175, correct? Yep. Okay. The soil protection standard. This is on the DPO pages 43 through 49 and this standard requires that council find taking into account mitigation that the design, construction and operation of a facility are not likely to result in a significant adverse impact to soils. Taking into consideration soil risks such as erosions and chemical spills in the application, the applicant'evaluation of potential adverse impacts considered the entire area of the solar array, approximately three 3641 acres to be permanently disturbed. And so this is going to relate to a comment we received including the O and M building substation areas. In the battery storage areas, the total area of disturbance would be 3684.9 acres. At the public hearing, a commenter, Mister Krebs, commented on the record both in oral testimony and the written handout, and his comments related to differing approaches to vegetation management within the solar array, where one site appeared to use chemical application and a second used a vegetative management approach for long term soil impacts. The department agreed that the applicant did respond, and the applicant's response was provided in the staff report. And the department agreed with the applicantsonde that vegetation management applies across multiple standards, fish and wildlife habitat, land use, and the wildfire prevention and protection standards. But the department disagreed that the vegetation management requirements of these plans is designed to protect soil and erosion potential within the facility fence line. So as a result of Mister Krebs's comment and, and our evaluation of the applicant's response, the department is going to coordinate with the Department of Environmental Quality and Department of Agriculture on a vegetation management approach that would address impacts within the solar array that are not permanently disturbed areas. And so I think right now we would be recommending a new or an amended condition to be incorporated into the proposed order to ensure that long term vegetation management, that a long term vegetation management strategy be designed to ensure that site stabilization and soil protection for areas within the fence line that are not occupied by permanent infrastructure. So we would want to like, we foresee additional coordination with DEQ and AG to come up with these strategies for areas within the fence line that were designated a permanent disturbance but aren't occupied by actual infrastructure. So like the areas between solar arrays, like in the rows specifically. So that's like our, that would be our recommendation in response to Mister Krebs's comment would be further consultation with our sister agencies to come up with a strategy for these areas of non infrastructure and permanent disturbance. Okay, please. Yeah, Councilloor Byer. So there'll be an, excuse me, but I hope I have this right. There'll be an explicit condition requiring that ongoing consultation with the department of AGGG and Department of Environmental Quality. I think that we",

        "text": " certificate holder a reminder email that their certificate was going to expire unless they submitted another request for a time extension. They responded about two months later indicating that they did not intend to pursue a time extension. Rather, they intended to let the site certificate expire and then propose the project at the county level based upon changes at the legislature giving the county'larger amounts of acreage in terms of what their jurisdictional thresholds or their jurisdictional abilities were in terms of solar projects. The one thing that's in the staff report that's not on the slide is that in their original application, the entire project was in the record. They had indicated that entire project location was high value farmland. By definition, the project is located within the Columbia Valley AVA, and then based upon certain slope and aspect ratios within that geographic area, properties are high value farmland. So they'd indicated in their application materials the entire project was high value farmland. Now, they've indicated, well, they've done more evaluation, more research, and it is not. And so the current threshold for f sector jurisdiction on high value farmland is 240 acres. So if they want to proceed with the project at the county level, they have to justify that it is 240 acres or less of high value farmland. They have submitted a jurisdictional determination with more details about the slope and aspect. We have not conducted that evaluation. You get regardless. So that's more, just more information for you to be aware of. But has, it's not germane to your evaluation today. That's just if they want to move forward with this project, who would have jurisdiction? So, and then the last thing on. Sorry, can you go back once. So again, going back to the deadline, they did not begin construction, as that's defined in statute, by February 23, 2024. Therefore, the site certificate has expired. Next slide, please. So, the applicable rules related to this are on the screen, and as you can see, based on rule 0313, as well as the condition in the site certificate, Gen GS Zero one. So, general condition, and that's of the first amended site certificate, because the certificate holder did not begin construction by the established date. As I just indicated, the site certificate has expired. Now, based upon the other rule 0110, when a site certificate has expired, the council shall issue in order terminating the site certificate. So that's effectively where we're at today. So they have lost their ability. It's expired. So they cannot begin construction. They cannot move forward with this project. Really, what remains is the council's term terminating the site certificate. And you can see the options that are on here. So the first is to approve termination of the site certificate. Attached to the staff report is a draft order which does that. And so if you approve through a vote today of the site certificate termination, e, the chair or the vice chair would sign that draft order. We would make it a, take the draft off it, and that would be a final order. You would sign this, the termination order, and that would conclude it. Option two would be to vote to terminate the site certificate. But if there are additional changes in that draft order that you feel are appropriate to make, you could do that as well. And then thirdly, if there is more information that you need, you can defer termination. Voting on the termination today. Again, that doesn't change the fact the state certificate has expired. They cannot move forward. So at some point, even if you would like to defer it, that you will need to terminate the site certificate. And last slide is your deliberation, or certainly, if you have any questions of me, members of the council, any questions, comments before a motion. I just want to clarify something with respect to your comment about the review that will be made. If that review comes up with the different, you say, no, no, this is high value, then is there anything, does that affect our timing with termination at all? No. Okay. No, those are. Again, it was, I think it was important to raise, just because they had indicated to us the reasoning behind it that they intend to go to the county level. Wanted to express that to you, but also let you know that we've not come to the conclusion that actually the county is the appropriate jurisdiction. It may well be. We have just not conducted that evaluation yet. So, I mean, the two options are, we determine that yes, they're correct in the information they provide. The site does not include more than 240 acres of highv value farmland, in which case it would be appropriate to go to the county for review. And if not, then it would remain ex jurisdictional. And if they wanted to continue with the project as it is, they would have to come back and submit a",

        "text": " partnering with our sister state agencies as well as federal agencies who manage lots of land in Oregon where our threatened and endangered plants occur. Our permitting and consultation is written into Oregon law and requires consultations for projects on non federal public lands that have the possibility of impacting listed plants. Recently, our budget was increased a little bit. We had in the past struggled to keep up with consultations and permitting at times due to lack of state funding. But a recent funding increase has allowed us to kind of fulfill our obligations more fully, which is why we are working with Odo more often. Next slide, please. So in this case, we were working to come up with some ideas to help mitigate for losses that Kathleen mentioned. And I want to just highlight a couple of our goals was to preserve the local diversity of the species through seed banking. So some rare plants have special traits and adaptations, depending on you, how isolated they may have been. From other portions of the species. So at'times important to conserve that diversity, which we do through seed banking. We also wanted to learn how can we reestablish these plants on the landscape? Is it possible? And so we decided to conduct a trial which has the potential to better inform and expand our capabilities to recover the species on the whole. And a bottom line goal was to try to get those 428 impacted plants reestablished on the landscape. So when we broke it down, it had a fair few number of tasks in our proposal was collecting seed, getting that seed out of the fruits, and preparing it for long term storage in the seed bank at Portland State University, figuring out how we can germinate those seeds and grow them, and then doing that enlar scale. Additionally, we monitored the actual impact site to see if plants were able to naturally recover from the temporary impact. And then we picked transplanting sites in the vicinity of where the plants came from to know that it was suitable habitat. And we conducted transplanting last fall, and we'll be monitoring this year. Oh, sorry. That was the next slide. I gotug it great. Thank you. And, yeah, so now the next one. Observations and findings, these are just some things that came to mind, is that, in fact, a small number of plants can establish following temporary disturbances. One of the major problems is those temporarily disturbed areas are often overrun with weeds. So the long term prospects for those plants are low. We did find that we can grow these plants and return them to the wild, but we have yet to figure out how well those plants can survive, which is why we're gonna be checking them this year, monitoring those transplants for survival. Next slide. So we started with seed collection for seed banking and also to have seeds for us to grow for transplants. We got involved in seed collection after one of our partner contractors ended up kind of having bad luck in 2020. So one thing we found was that seed production is highly variable for this species. Not only is it subject to annual variation in precipitation and other conditions, but grazing can be a serious problem. That can take. Yeah, that can remove most of the seed production from the population. In 2021, we had a fairly successful seed collection trip, but did not quite meet our goal for having enough seed for banking, in addition to our germination and transplanting trials. So we ended up collecting more last year and we were able to meet our goals, which was great. And another reason why we had to do a little bit of extra collection was that we found that a good portion of the seed that is produced is of poor quality, and it's not really usable for our purposes. Next slide, please. We did various tests on the seeds. Sometimes seed production can be a limiting factor for endangered plant. We did some staining testing, which you can see here, and viable seeds stain red. This is a standard practice used with like crop, crop seeds as well. That was interesting information. There's been very little research done on this species. So pretty much any tidbit we could glean from this work is valuable to scarify our seeds, which is a common requirement for seeds for members of the family, especially these kind of more arid landscape plants. Scarifying is kind of starting to break down, is a process that kind of starts to break down the seed coat and allows them to take in water. So we used an interesting technique, a little tumbler, to get those uniformly scarified for our germination studies. Next slide, please. Yeah, we tried a variety of different treatments. Scarified and non scarified seeds, different lengths of time in cold stratification, which is also pretty important for a lot of our native species. And it ended up scarification and cold stratification improve germination compared to treatments without those. There was very low rates, much lower rates of scar",

        "text": " through the Oregon Military Department and the Department of the Navy has had a long and effective working relationship with Oregon Department of Energy. We have worked together and have consulted several times on proposed energy projects and that have potential impacts on military training and operations. The Navy Northwest training Range complex out of WbE island and the Oregon Military Department'ground and air assets are critical to national a critical national asset that enables warfighters to prepare for real world operations. The NWTRC includes training and testing ranges and training routes throughout the Oregon and Washington, which are connected to the restricted areas over naval weapons systems training facility in Boardmeman within Oregon there are approximately 13,000 military personnel presently in this state, including the army and Air National Guard. The Oregon Military Department manages and trains Oregon and Army Air National Guard and provides facilities and institutional support for them andonds to the governor's orders during peacetime and during natural disasters to sustain the military mission and associated required training. The military is dependent on the support and cooperation of land use authorities and that includes ODo. We have worked with the Oregon State and county stakeholders for years in support of compatible land, air and c uses. Utilizing DoD funding. We recently completed a $1 million initiative to create an interactive mapping tool to facilitate notification and coordination with renewable energy and transmission stakeholders and associated qualitative assessments. This is known as the Oregon Renewable Energy Site Assessment, also by its acronym or RA, and another initiative looking at potential location for transmission infrastructure in support of offshore wind in southern Oregon and northern California. In 2019, House Bill 23 29 included notification to the DoD for energy projects permitted at the county level. This is good, it is necessary, but it is in and of itself insufficient. We believe notification by itself will not ensure early collaboration in favor of a win win, nor are there any assurances of addressing any potential adverse impacts to national security. Currently, we don't have a rule, a rule, or a viable process with ODOE to ensure early notification of the DoD for projects that are located in and around our critical training testing operational areas. The lack of notification has in the past resulted in additional time, contested cases and outright removal of a project during construction. As Todd mentioned earlier, with the vast majority of projects, the implementation of a viable early notification policies in coordination with the military ensures that future land uses are compatible with military operations while fostering renewable energy and support of state regulations and policies. The process is in place or ad hoc and create challenges with normal staff turnover, and they don't provide a clear and transparent coordination process. DoD is engaging early in this rulemaking because proper development of these processes is critical for ensuring the optimal balance between commercial development and military readiness. Compatible renewable energy development is critical to preserve military operational capabilities, safeguard our military missions, and protect the overaul, the overall health, safety and welfare of the public living near military installations for training in operational areas. And we do look forward to continue coordination with the Oregon Department of energy and to include the federal agency's rulemaking that is currently docketed for 2025. So I thank you for your time, and I'll take any questions if you have some. Thank you, council member Condon thank you, chair Grail. Thank you for being here today. And I'I'm not really familiar with how the counties and state work together. So in your statement, I think you said in 2019 statute was passed requiring notification from counties that we rece received notific. Yes, that counties notify, I believe. I'm not sure how the chain works. I'll pass that one over to Todd. Excuse me, for the record, Todd Coordnet the House Bill 23 29 created sort of a carve out. So there were previously f sector jurisdictional projects that changed the threshold that then became county projects. So there were then really three versions of jurisdiction, county projects that were smaller than the House Bill 23 29 projects. Those do not require notice to the DoD. Then there are the House Bu 23 29 projects built into statute that requires those projects that fit within that subset do require, in addition to the DoD, other early notifications, including the Department of Energy. So, so that subset of bigger projects at the county level currently do obligate counties to provide that notification. Okay, so my follow up, my question is really? So we're certainly reviewing our rules and doing rulemaking on this. I think you said that the requirement in 23 29 was insufficient for the county. So how our rules don't impact the county, and so how does the DoD work with the counties versus the state for that sufficiency? I guess currently we work with counties on a case by case basis. As we learn of projects, we will go and talk with the county commission and attend their commission meetings either in support or with concerns. And to date, it hasn't been",

        "text": " slide before this one? Yes. So for consumption, are we. These things are things that are being considered in the workshops, are we. Well, is consumption also, are we prescribing diet changes that people should consider making or should start making? And I'm, I'm, I'm not against this, but I'm just reluctant to say that without, like, USDA present. No, the city will not be. Yeah, we're not. Yeah. So there won't be any prescriptive diet recommendations from the city. The idea is to help people understand the carbon footprint of their various food choices. So what we know from all the research that's been done and all of the calculations that have been done is that there are certain foods that have a very high carbon footprint, especially if we are importing them into the community. So, for instance, production of beef is extremely energy and water intensive. It requires a lot of inputs. And so that's one of the things that we want to show to people. Now, that doesn't mean that if you're buying your beef locally grown here in Washington county from, you know, a grass fed pasture, that's gonna have a very different footprint. So we're talking about kind of that grocery store beef that is coming from the midwest. It's got a different impact. Or if you're eating meats or dairy that are imported from outside of the US, it has a. It has a big footprint. So the idea is to help our community members understand that and do things like promote our farmers market and, you know, various ways that you can actually eat these foods grown locally that have a lower footprint. So there will be no prescriptive diets. I wish I had that kind of power, but I don't think I do. I want to be mindful of the fact that some people may be able to make those choices because their income supports that, but some people won't have. And so I want to be mindful of affordability, what that really means for food consumption, and then also have some consideration about cultural differences with regards to food. And so I think it would be important to understand that while identifying what foods might be more less healthy, let's say, I think it's important to give some consideration to culture differences. For sure. We had some wonderful input in our workshop from folks from Adelante Mujeres, who talked about the cultural importance of eating meat in their diet, because they grew up in countries where they didn't have access to meat. And now that is, it's very important for them to have that as part of their diet. And so the idea isn't to shame or, like, point fingers at anyone for doing the wrong thing or to take away what people need to be healthy. The ideas just give people that information. And also, we are thinking about ways the city can lead by example. So, for instance, for city events, we can host that we. That we host that include food. We can focus primarily on plant based options. That tends to be a healthier option for a lot of people, and it helps people understand different ways of eating. And that's sort of lower on the food chain and lower on the carbon scale. Does that help? Yeah. And I don't want to spend a lot of time on this, but what I see is not a lot of folks in my ward who were shopping at farmers market. I do see a lot of people shopping at Winco and buying all kinds of different, you know, different sorts of food. Plant based is a challenge because it's, it's something that's very specific and I can't say that it is affordable for people. So again, I just want to caution and be mindful of cultural differences with regards to food consumption and where people get their food. Sure. And I'm happy to continue this conversation with you. I did a year of Americorps and we found that eating vegan was the only way we could stretch our dollars. So there can be different approaches to learning about how to cook with scratch materials. But yeah, this should be probably an offline conversation. Happy to continue that with you. Should I go ahead and move us forward? Okay. Okay. All right. So I just have a couple more slides here. So in addition to our work to develop a climate plan, the city has efforts underway already to tackle climate change and promote environmental stewardship within our community. So I've listed just a few examples of those projects. So we do maintain more than 35 public ev charging stations and we're adding more. We worked with the Energy Trust of Oregon and Solar Oregon on a solarized Hillsboro and Cornelius campaign to help homeowners install solar arrays and battery storage. We collaborate with cities, counties and other partners in the region to share climate action strategies. We have applied for us Department of Energy funds to add more public EV charging stations and complete H Vac upgrades at the Jackson Bottom Nature center, and we are currently working on an EPA community change grant proposal for community climate resiliency",

As of our board meeting Thursday night of this week, the only reason we knew about this is because I've been collecting notes on it. Nobody the point that I would certainly know about. Chairman, can you lean into the mic a little bit? Okay. Is that better? Okay. Is that because we have to be prepared for it and, you know, for what type of materials on hand and emergency response coordinating with that. And so I'm certain that's. And the purpose of the whole hearing is addressing subjects like that. Oh, some didn to notify them. Know I sa in your position. I've run a lot of hearings over the years and being able to, a lot of times people say, well, this is the final thing. No, it's bringing information. It's very important to listen to what these people here say and their concerns because they live in there. I live in Harrisburg. I've been there for, since 1970. My family's been there since 1916 and we came out longer than that. So I'm deeply ingrained. The people in this room. I don't know how many of in my, I spent 20 years as a grass seed farmer running sheep. So I'm quite familiar with a lot of subject matters and I had to take another 28 years of the insurance business to recover from my farming experience and a lot of you can understand that. And so I feel very comfortable with the people here because a lot of folks here have been clients of mine. I know quite their families and what they, but what they're concerned about is dealing with things. We had a ten acre parcel and I think you were famil one. It was the last fall. I think it was the solar panel. Did you look up for that one went through the county. Well, you should. It's out by highway 20 on it. And that was limited because of the condition. Some of the things we put in there as conditions of it that you had to be dealing with drainage, your runoff and some water runoff, the effect on it facing the pan stuff from other neighbors and there'no mentioned up here but farm you'got mowing anything. I mean that's you use the sheep operation you said for but you're going to have to mow and control weeds particularly noxious because can and grow wild all over there. Everyone here will on that. So those things when you're putting your plan together and for example using livestock for vegetation control or you may use something else but you can't at this stage in the game you can't sit down. We're going to do x, y, z. The energy sighting council has a real difficult job. My youngest son is in the power game. He builds power lines, transmission lines and the ugly truth is people are saying that and he works with the big stuff, the 300, 500 kiloww stuff. And when he told me about four years ago he said, dad, we're going to make a lot of people unh. Happy and said what's going to do? And we're going to dump the grid in parts of California. I said, how much notice? They're going to get 30 minutes notice. They insist that no more fires be started by Santa Anand winds. And I called him up a couple days. How's it going? He says, well, I'm sit in the hotel room eating a can of cold chili. It affected me because this trailer was another area, because we have the growth and stuff here. And that's part of the thing is planning and sing and looking at is what we're dealing with people's property, but also we're dealing with something that we can't argue away. That's the laws of physics. You can only shove so much energy through a wire so far. When people talk about where is at. We have people in this northwest that want to pull dams out and they don't have an alternative. And you, as all individual citizens, let us know the craziness that is because. Because I don't want to be here. My children growing up, grandchildren now that in an area that we do not havely sustainable power in one of the best hydroelectric areas there is now, these are things that we have advantages here and energy sitiding council. I realize you have a difficult job, but my son is the one who works those lines. I said, well, how long does it take you to get a new line? They figured bring a new transmission line in is a minimum ten years. I'm pretty close to the process. It just rebuilt one into Seattle. They took it up, the power up, they put it in and took it 140,000 to 240,000 because the neighbor and the population, nobody would expand that. I can see why you want that power line out there because you got a substation there on Pricebo",

        "text": "Hi, and welcome to this video series with the Community Renewable Energy grant program. My name is Jason Knanaaus. I'm a program analyst in what we call the C rep program. And hello. My name is Clay Ecker. I'm also a program analyst with the C Rep program. Thank you. Clay and I put together this series. This is to cover the key application sections and questions. We're not going to be going through every single one, just the kind of the key questions on the application for both planning and construction grants in the video series for each. And this is more focused on what you'll find under the competitive review scoring criteria in your particular opportunity announcement. But first, what we wanna do is just kind of do a brief overview of the C rep program, and we'll go ahead and just jump right in. House Bill 2021 established the C Rep program, and its intent was to offset costs of planning a developing community renewable energy projects, to support projects and traditionally underserved communities throughout the state, as well as to promote small scale community renewable energy projects and provide direct benefits to communities across Oregon by improving energy resilience, creating local jobs, promoting economic development, and reducing local energy costs. And next, I'm going to let Clay talk about the program's budget priorities. Okay. The legislature gave us two main budget priorities in the CP program. At least half of the funding must go to projects that have a reliance aspect under the program definition and rules. And we'll cover this in details later in the presentation. And the second priority is that at least half the funding must go to projects that primarily serve members of environmental justice communities. And we'll get into those details as well as we go through the presentation. All right, thank you, Clay. And you'll see this particular graphic published on our website. This is a breakdown of our particular programs and the maximum grant award for those programs, as well as the maximum eligible cost percentage for the reimbursement of a particular program. I just wanted to pay one particular note to a construction project that is a renewable energy only. That is still the maximum grant award could be up to a million dollars for that project, but only 50% of those eligible costs up to the $1 million. And additionally a couple of really important program notes, and that's that grants will be awarded on a competitive basis and will include performance agreements and time limits for, for both starting a project and completing a project. And that's within both the planning grants and within the construction grants, and then that competitive review basis. We will get into more details in the next video about the importance of that competitive review process as it relates to you and your application. Another item that we really wanna point out at the front end here is that grant funding, if awarded, grant funding is paid to the grantee or the applicant and may include up to 30% advance, with the rest reimbursed to grantee after the project is complete and the final report has been approved. On construction projects that would also include a site inspection, the grant may cover eligible costs incurred by the applicant, as shown via paid invoices as part of the final report. And Department of Energy payments are made to grantees only. So grantees should follow their own procurement and finance policies when working with any partners. And next up, I'm gonna go back over to Clay. He's gonna talk about some of our program definitions that are very important to pay attention to. Okay, I've got a sample definition up for our main definition of a community renewable energy project. And this is right out of the House bill, 2021. I put this one up. I'm not gonna read it. I'm just gonna point it out as all of our projects need to fit into this definition. And this also includes those projects that have a resilience component. And then we have more detailed definitions for the resilience components, which we'll get into next a little bit. So here we have what community energy resilience is in general, and then what a community energy resilience project is. The summary of that is that the systems must provide power in a grid outage, and the system must support critical public services to the community, must support facilities essential to the public welfare. And so, as you can see, CRP has very specific definitions. And I want to take this as a reminder that you go through and you read the Oregon administrative rules for this project. The links are on our website. You can go back even and read the whole section. There's only like three sections in the bill that covers the CRP program. Read those, and you'll see how all of them are related and condensed into the opportunity announcements. And so, knowing the definitions is key to having an eligible and competitive application. So that you aren't speaking to some generic industry definition, but you've actually dialed in to these program definitions. Excellent. Thank you, Clay. And you'll find during the course of these video presentations on either either",

        "text": " part of today's meeting is going to focus on the grid resilience, funding opportunity in the inflation, excuse me, in the investment, infrastructure Investment and Jobs act, the way that Congress and the USDE structure the program and the requirements that fall to Odo on behalf of the state to submit an application. My colleague Emily Selmey, who is our new federal grants officer, will be leading this part of the present. The second part of the presentation will be information about the state's approach, and my colleague Rob Del Mar from our planning and innovation division will be speaking about the specifics of Oregon's program. Then finally, we will look for your feedback on the state's approach, so we'll try to stop and ask for questions during the presentation. But please know that many of your questions may be answered as we go through the material, so feel free to hold those till the end. My colleague Jen center, our other grants officer, will be helping to keep an eye on the chat as we go through the presentation. And finally, my colleague Linda Ross is our host today and we will be helping also to keep an eye open for questions. We are joined by some team members from a consulting firm called Aggrity Consulting who are assisting Odo with planning for this application and program launch. And we'introduce the project managers for Hagerty at the end of the presentation. Next slide, please. Okay, before we jump into the good resilience fun stuff, a quick introduction to the Oregon Department of Energy, or Odo, as you might hear us referred to on this slide, you see our vision, mission and what we do. Our mission is to help Oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable energy system. We advance solutions to shape an equitable, clean energy transition, protect the environment and public health, and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for current and future generations. Under the what we do section on the slide, you'll see the services we provide and how we achieve our mission. And this funding opportunity that we're discussing today will certainly help Odo support a more resilient and affordable energy system in Oregon. Next slide, please. So before I turn it over to Emily, just to highlight the three objectives that we have for our time together today. First, we want to make sure that you understand how this grid resilience funding works and the parameters that Odo has to work within when designing the state's program. This is a huge opportunity to bring federal dollars to Oregon to help make our electric grid more resilient. Second, we want to share with you our revised approach for this funding and what we're planning to put in our application to the US Department of Energy. This approach has been developed over the past nine months in close consultation with the Oregon Public Utility Commission, and it's informed by outreach with experts working in this space. We want to especially thank those of you that submitted information through our previous public hearing and comment session last August and our request for information conducted in December. We've considered that feedback and made adjustments to our approach from last summer. But even with those adjustments, we still want to hear from you on the program design and application and get your ideas for how to improve it today. Remember the draft proposal that we're sharing with you today is just that. It's a draft. We do want input and feedback to make it better to align with work already being done by utilities and others, and to better meet the objectives outlined in the federal funding opportunity. As I mentioned earlier, we will have time for verbal public comment at the end, and we also hope people will submit written comments through our online portal. If you don't want to or don't get a chance to speak today, or if you have more to say. Again, that portal will be open to the end of the week. Our application is due to the US Department of Energy at the end of the month, so we are working to get this all wrapped up pretty quickly. Next slide, please. All right, and now I would like to turn this over to Emily, Sal, Mary who will share more information on the federal bill that created this opportunity. Emily thank you Janine, and good morning everyone. The program that we're talking about today is specifically funded funded, excuse me, under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs act. This piece of legislation includes $62 billion from the US Department of Energy to deliver a more equitable clean energy future for the american people by investing in american manufacturing and workers, expanding access to energy efficiency and clean energy for families, communities and businesses, delivering reliable, clean and affordable power to more Americans, and building the technologies of tomorrow through clean energy demonstrations. Additionally, this program, like other federal energy programs, is covered by the Justice 40 initiative. This federal initiative directs 40% of the benefits should flow to disadvantaged communities. Back to EU gine thanks Emily. After the passage of both the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs act at the end of last year and the inflation",

        "text": " long study of the wildlife between May and, what was it, August or September? I'm sorry that this is Oregon. Like, this is a wildlife capital of the Pacific Northwest. We have so many amazing, diverse wildlife, and six months is not going to cut it. And you don't have the data, and yet you're willing to impose this 40 year project on our children. And I just don't see how that's helpful at all. Uh, the only thing that I can add and follow up to the comment is that groundwater, um, stormwater, specifically, how it hits the panels, runs off, impacts the soils, will be studied. Um, just because we don't have an answer tonight doesn't mean we won't have one. And so there will be, there's a very robust, um. I think Todd has alluded to it all the standards, what they look like up here. Um, I can tell you what that translates to is, is binders full of information, and so not all of it is prepared right now. So what we know is what we've assessed based on what we call it desktop study, but that's just publicly available data. So a lot of the study that is going to go into this, especially with regard to soils, has yet to be done, or is in the process of being done, and will be a part of this very robust application. So it wouldn't do anyone a service to come in and not have these things fully vetted before that application is present before the SEC council, because it does have ramifications for commitments and conditions down the line. So those things will be assessed. So I don't want there to be the implication that because there's not an answer now tonight that there can't be one or won't be one, but it is something that will certainly work towards and would be incorporated with the application. Okay. But even that data that you can provide is still going to be your best guess because we don't have a 40 year long project to refer to to see what the impact is going to be. So it's still just going to be your best guess I can speak to. I mean, there's probably not a project in Oregon that's been around for 40 years. So there are projects that have been constructed, are successful, and have been in operation, and those are kind of what we look to moving forward as far as, you know, kind of models for this development and will continue to be for, you know, I'd imagine for the industry, but, yeah, as, as to your point, it's like, is there one around for 40 years? I'm not. I'm not sure, but that's something that we can certainly look to as we're continue to evaluate the materials. Okay, thank you. And then I have one more question for you guys. So, Oregon, the Pacific Northwest, is pretty rainy and pretty overcast. So how do the six to seven rainy and overcast months of the year help support 35,000 homes with electricity? And are these things even going to be functioning from November through may with minimal direct sunlight? Sure. To address your question about the lifespan of this project, the 40 years, that's not a number that we just kind of threw out there. It's more of like an industry standard. So when it comes to solar projects, the lifespan, that's projected, 35 to 40 years, that's a pretty standard thing in the industry. As for the energy production, we do something called a pvys or an 8760. And essentially that uses historic data, weather data, could be from five years, it could be ten years, or whatever is publicly available. And then we use that, and then we map out the site, basically the layout of the project and any potential restrictions or things of like, I guess we call them constraints, and then we do a projection to see what would be the energy production. And that is also a factor in us when we try to siteite these projects. Understandably, it is a little bit cloudy, a little bit wet in Oregon, just a little bit. But even with that, using the weather data, we still have good enough production to make this project viable. I have solar panels on my house in between November and May. They're not worked, and they're good panels. And they may not be your panels from your company, but they're still good panels, and they cost a really pretty penny, and they don't work six months out of the year. So I'm just wondering, are they just going to be an eyesore for half the year and only providing, like, energy for half the year? Because that seems like a really big project and a really risky thing when we don't have the data to go out, 40 years to put upon the people of this area, when we don't even know if it's going to work year round, and we don't even know what the long term impact is",

Do we have a mister chairman appro. I move to approve the May minutes as presented. Thank you. Councillor Devlin, do we have a second? This is Marcy Grail. I second that motion. Thank you, Councillor Grail. Okay, we've got a motion in a second. Mister Secretary, could you please call the roll? Kent how yes. Richard Devlin? Yes. Katie is yes. Perry Choctute? I'm gonnastain Cindy Condon if you said yes. Sorry. No problem. And Marcy Grail? Yes. Motion carries, mister chair. Thank you, Mister Secretary. And I guess we'll move on to your report. All right, a couple of project updates. So the first one is the Mads solar energy facility. That's an approved but not yet constructed solar pv power generation project with a generating capacity of 63 mw on about 284 acres with an integrated battery storage system. The facility is proposed by Madras PV one LLC, which is a subsidiary of Ecoexus Incorporated. Project is located in Jefferson county, approximately five and a half miles west of the city of Madras. On June 25, the department received request for Amendment one, which is to begin to extend the beginning construction deadline from June 25, 2024 to June 25, 2027 and the construction completion deadline to December 28, 2028, as well as to change the parent company. Because the wildfire standard has been adopted since the project was approved, theificate holder will have to do that one as a new standard. We are currently reviewing amendment number one for completeness. As part of that amendment request, the certificate holder requested that amendment one be reviewed under the type B process as they submitted an amendment determination request. That request has been posted to the project webpage and earlier this morning the department sent a letter to the certificate holder with the determination that the type B review is not justified and the type A review will be maintained primarily because, as I just stated, the council must evaluate the amendment, really the entire project, not just the amendment, but the entire project against the new wildfire standard. So that was enough to justify maintaining the type a review. For this type of amendment determination request, only the certificate holder can request counsel'review. So on other types of amendment determination request, the department could send the determination for counsel for your concurrence, modification or rejection or, you know, upon hearing about it could also do that. But for this type of amendment determination request, only the certificate holder can make that request. And that just went out this morning, so we'll wait to see if that is what they ask for. Next is the Sunstone solar project and that's a solar energy facility. Proposed solar energy project with the generating capacity of 1200 mw, it would occupy about 11,000 acres, or 17 sq mi of predominantly cultivated land in Morro county. The facility is proposed by Sunstone Solar, LLC, which is a subsidiary of Pine Gate Renewables LLC. Project is proposed in Morro county, approximately 15 miles south of the city of Boardman. On July 12, the department issued the draft proposed order with a 42 day public comment period, which is proposed to conclude at the August 22 public hearing in Hermiston. And that will be the next regularly scheduled council meeting will be both Thursday and Friday. So the 22nd and the 23rd, and that will be held the evening of the 22nd and we'll provide that information to council shortly. Nancy, do you want to bring up the advance, the slides there? We go. Thank you. All right, so I've got a couple of incident updates. On June 20 of this year, Montag wind facility experienced a riser pole fire from an avian interaction that caused a portion of the collector system to trip offline. The ABM carcass was found at the base of the pole. The incident was reported within the 72 hours timerame that is required under condition 23. The fire was contained to only the pole. The incident is now closed, and Avvengrid is the parent company to the site certificate holder, which is Montag Wind Power Facility, LLC. Next, leaning Juniper two B also experienced a similar riser pullifier, similar type of avian interaction, and also the avian carcass was found at the base of the pole. The incident was reported within the same 72 hours timeframe, consistent with the condition requirement, which is condition 23. But with this one, a total of five acres of grassland around the facility was burned. The incident is still under Oto's review. And then, similarly, Avenggrid is the parent",

        "text": " income households to projects that wanted them to be enrolled in their projects. So we already have a lot of infrastructure that we can use to build towards and meet some of the solar for all goals. Next slide. Within the program, there's a feature called the carve Outs, which is essentially for projects that go above and beyond and serving low income customers or invol in communities in the design of projects. So there's a few different ways to qualify for the carve outs within the Oregon Community solar program. First, any project that reserves 50%, again, the program minimum of 10%, any project that reserves 50% of project capacity for low income subscribers would qualify for the card out. Second, any project that's managed by a nonproit or a cooperative would qualify. And then a project that partners creatively with a community based organization in the outreach of a project would also qualify for the carve outs. The program is a limited capacity program. There'one hundred 60 mw that have been authorized by the commission, and about 25% of that, or 40 mw, is reserved for projects that meet carve out capacity. Now, where we are today, nearly all of the program capacity that's not part of the carve out has been allocated to projects, but very little of the carn capacity has been. So we have 47 mw remaining in the program, of which 36 mw is reserved for carve out projects. So primarily what we're seeing, the opportunity in solar for all, is to use the substantial amount of funding to fill up the program, carve out, and make sure that we're delivering really considerable benefits through the Oregon community solar program that are in line with the priorities that EPA has outlined. Next slide. So our two goals are, one, making sure that we able to we go, one is making sure that we are able to get more community led community solar projects built and realize through the program and second, making sure that we're able to make more low income subscriptions available to participants in the program. And there's really two different strategies that I'm going to talk about that we see as useful here. One is addressing financial barriers with a strong and stable incentive for projects that meet those carve out criteria that I was just talking about. And second, by addressing non financial barriers like program complexity, by providing enhanced technical assistance and potentially project matchmaking services to community led projects. Next slide. So for strategy one and here we're really talking about financial assistance and incentives. The problem that we found is that many carve out projects will require additional funding to get across the finish line. And while there have been passed incentive offers available through energy trust, through ODO, through USDA, PSF and utilities to provide grants and upfront assistance to projects, many of these are kind of temporary and ad hoc. And there's not a long term consistent statewide incentive source that's available to help get carbon projects developed through the community solar program. And so our core concept would be to put together a stable incentive that's available to any project that meets both solar for all requirements, meaning that 50% of the project would be available to eligible residential participants, and also CSP car back criteria, which would be 50% low income participation. We're interested in targeting a mix of small community led projects as well as larger, potentially private sector projects, and would be intending to offer an incentive to any project that's able to meet that 50% low income participation threshold while delivering those mandatory bill discounts. We also know that to enable some of the smaller community scale projects, there might need to be an additional incentive that helps address some of the higher construction costing incurency. You go down in size. So we're looking at a long term stable incentive offer that would help build part with the community solar program. Carve out next slide the second strategy that we're looking at getting away from strictly financial assistance is thinking about how to overcome some of the non financial barriers in the program. So we do know that the Oregon Community Solar program is a complex program to navigate, especially for a community based organization that is not a professional solar developer and who might not be well suited to be a long term owner and manager of a project. So as energy trusts, we already have a few different technical assistance tools we've put to use, such as early stage community solar development assistance, as well as project specific coaching and technical systems, which we partner with BEF to deliver to help some of these community led carve out projects come forward. But we have seen that that's not enough and that there's still a subst substantial unmet demand from community groups that would like to make community solar projects work but have both financial and non financial barriers. So we're really interested in using this funding as a way to dramatically increase the technical assistance that's being offered to community groups that may want to be part of the community Sol program. And we're also considering taking a more assertive role in the program and providing sort of a matchmaking service between project developers, CBO'and,",

        "text": " technical analysis. Because in the end, at a high level, what we're going to be doing is engaging with folks over the next few months to understand what the priority questions are that we can answer with this kind of tool. So essentially we can pull a few levers, but we have a budget. We can't pull every lever. And so we can test out if we have more or less transmission. What does that mean in terms of how much resource build we need in the state, outside the state to meet our goals, that kind of thing. So, but to bring you along the journey, I think it's helpful to look a little bit under the hood of what we're looking at here. So essentially the whole process, the technical analysis, starts with where are we today? And so it looks at Oregon's economy across, split up between residential, commercial, industrial, transportation. And we just kind of see, you know, many, how many houses do we have, how many apartments, how many, you know, just the what do we have in place today? And then we project that out over time all the way out to 2050. So we'll be looking at a 2050 timef Frme. And so, you know, there's a trick to that. We don't know, but we're going to try to make some reasonable assumptions on what that might look like. And then that determines how much energy we need to meet that demand across the different sectors. And we're really interested in how much electricity we need, how much we need in terms of transportation fuels and direct use fuels. And that might change what we see today in terms of that breakdown might change, for example, if we do a lot more electrification. That first diagram, the, I always call it the noodle diagram that Michael showed you, the electricity slice might grow, for example. And certainly if we're decarbonizing, the resources will change. So we might go from natural gas to renewable natural gas for some uses, for example. And then finally the model kind of takes all of that information, know, what's the demand, what's the energy need to meet that demand? And then it sets some rules and cranks out some results. So we have to maintain reliability on the system we're testing out, meeting our energy policy objectives. So that's built in. Cost is really important. So we need to make sure that we're minimizing cost wherever possible. And there is the possibility to introduce some constraints. And I mentioned that here specifically because we can build in some constraints that take into account our land use rules as they exist today, for example. So the model won't say, you could build anything everywhere, no constraint. So we can build that in as well if we go to the next slide, please. So what, what goes into a scenario? Essentially, a scenario is where we test questions and we'll be able to do a few different scenarios in this analysis. And there's kind of two ways that we can test different questions, and one is by having more or less of something. So imagine, here are the examples. Heat pump adoption. So imagine that more people adopt heat pumps. That'll have an impact on where we're getting our energy from and where we need to get it from. And we can reduce it. And that'll also change the picture and it'll also change costs potentially. So we'll learn something by moving that lever up or down. And then there's the option to just turn something on or off. So we could say no new transmission is built by a certain year. What is that going to do to everything else, to what we need to build and how much we need to build in Oregon versus outside of Oregon? So this is kind of looking a little deeper under the hood, the types of levers that we can pull in the model to come up with what the world would look like if these things were to happen. Essentially, we're testing uncertainties because there's a ton of uncertainty that we're dealing with and trying to think through how we meet our decarbonization objectives. And so this whole process is to come up with a lot of informed projections, reasonable projections, and then test things out if we go to the next slide. And this is just to show you how we look at the economy. So we split things up, as I said, by residential, commercial, industrial, transportation. And then there are 70 subsectors. So I don't think, I haven't counted these bullets. I don't think it adds up to 70, but this is just a flavor. So you can see it's kind of, you know, I mean, we really get down to almost the appliance level in looking at these subsectors to understand what's in place today and what we can expect over time across each sector. And then if we go to the next slide, it's also really important to remember, referring again, back to that noodlely slide at the",

        "text": " install their own sub met, but it wouldn't necessarily be necessary, would be needed in order to comply. There's other pathways there, too. So then it becomes just an investment decision for the owner. If they want to put in a meter to comply in that pathway, then that's a possibility to. So then there's this other scenario, too, where you've got multiple buildings and only some are covered, say someere under the size threshold or summer tier two. So those buildings would have multiple options as well. So, you know, one, an owner could choose to include all the buildings gross floor area. So both uncovered and uncovered building space and their energy use to meet a weighted average UI to meet their target. They could install multiple, you know, energy conservation measures at uncovered and covered buildings to meet that EUI target if they're all grouped together. So essentially treat treating it kind of as one building, but, you know, key, and I'm the one covered building as its primary compliance schedule and pathway. And then there's another option, too, where, you know, if that option to group them all maybe isn't the best strategy for the owner, they could choose to install sub meters to separate out the covered and uncovered buildings, and then, of course, only comply for the COVID buildings. And then there's another pathway, too that where the owner could just choose the investment criteria for the pathway without sub metering and perform an audit and install measures only for the only applicable for the covered building spaces. And then just a note here, too, that, like the other requirement for energy management plans, operations and maintenance plans would still only apply for the COVID buildings, too. So maybe I'll take a moment here to see if there's any, any discussions or questions after having kind of talked about these couple different scenarios for, like, buildings behind the meter. So I think the key thing here maybe, is that in all these scenarios, it's, there's flexibility for the owner to either comply as an aggregate building or as an aggregate group of buildings, or install the sub metering to be able to comply for just on individual covered buildings. So, yeah, there. Let's see. I'not seeing any. There we go. Clark? Yeah. Are you proposing that all three options would be listed as a menu in one rule, or are you asking which option we like the best or which o. Yeah, sorry. Sorry if that wasn't clear. So kind of as we're, we're proceeding for as if all three options would be included in the rules and available to a building owner for compliance and in our, you know, discussions and you work with, with Washington. This is, has been the Washington approach as well. Okayight, I follow up question on Washington, which was, can you remind us what was, I guess I care less what was originally in the Washington bill, but what legislative fix did they do with regard to these buildings that got us to this place where these are the three options, just so we can understand. Okay. Yeah. So other folks that are maybe a little bit closer with the entire Washington process start to finish might know more, but I believe that, that some of these options to be able to like address these campuses of buildings were part of their legislative fix. In my, the discussions I've had with Washington, it was mostly centered around like, what's the current pathway? I'm not exactly sure when these pathways were put into place, but I think that these pathways were part of the legislative fix. So. Great. Thank you, Kevin. I think you're muted. Thank you for that. It seems like this is a great way to deal with this. I don't know what else you could do. Unless you want to be unfexible and require sub reader and you, there have to be some other alternatives. So that option one and three, I think, accomplishes that. And then an owner can weigh the cost and disruption of each and make a choice. But otherwise, I don't know how you would get there without those, without these groupings. Yeah, thanks for the, thanks for the coming Givenv. See, I don't see any other hands raised or comments in the chat right now. Make sure I'll add something like just in Portland. And yeah, I agree with Kevin. I think that this is, seems like it, it gives flexibility to folks sen to all sub meters, and then they can figure out the different advantages of doing that or not. A couple scenarios you will run into is natural gas versus electric. And so we have cases in Portland where there'be a gas meter covering four buildings and then an electromeer covering two, those four plus two others. And so I think you just want some way of describing that scenario that that could be considered one on campus. And we actually designate that with a special, like campus id so we can kind of track thatk reporting",

Just give us a little bit of time because, Nancy, I'm going to pass it back to you. Okay, just a little bit of technical stuff here. Just, there we go. And Vice chair Howe, you have the floo weather the purpose of tonight's public hearing is to provide an opportunity for the public reviewing agencies, counsel and the certificate holder, if they wish to do so, to present oral and written testimony on the amendment request and the department's draft proposed order. The 34 day public hearing comment period on the draft proposed order scheduled to close at the conclusion of tonight's public hearing. Next slide, please. At the conclusion of the presentation, I will call on each person interested in providing oral testimony, starting with a certificate holder in people in person, then on the webinar, then on the phone. Tonight's hearing is being recorded. The presentations, written comments and oral testimony are part of the decision record for the amendment request for the facility. Next slide. Pursuant to OAR 304 5027-0367 sub five a and b, please note the a person who intends to raise any issue that may be the basis for a contested case must raise the issue in person at the hearing or in a written comment submitted to the Department of Energy before the July 18 deadline and with sufficient specificity to afford the council, the Department of Energy and the certificate holder an adequate opportunity to respond, including statements of fact that support the person's position on the issue. In the type a review amendment process to justify a contested case, issues must be determined by FSEEC, the energy facility signing council, to raise a significant issue of fact or law that is reasonably likely to affect coun council determination of compliance with an applicable standard.

Vice chair, council members, my name is Joe Stipple, st I p P l. I'm from Idaho Power. I'm the principal project manager in charge of B two H. Thank you to staff for taking the time to review our request for amendment. A lot of the work that we've been doing with outreach with individual landowners and as we're moving towards construction is basically the result of this amendment. We'worked with a lot of landowners and the transmission line changes are really a direct result of working with those individuals to minimize the impact on their property. So we've spent a lot of time in the field vetting our route, and some of the access rows are a result of that as well, to make this a constructable project and move forward towards breaking ground this fall. And I just want to thank staff and council for taking a look at the amendment question from council. Okay, thank you, Mister Sybil. Next slide, please. Oh, it's coming. So are there individuals in the room that wish to provide testimony? Maybe you get a show of hand, so we get an idea how many might testify? Any idea on the people that are on the webinar?

        "text": ", founded in 2016. Our headquarters is in Asheville, North Carolina, but we're kind of spread all over the country where actively developing in 30 plus states. We have close to 300 full time employees, extensive experience developing, financing, constructing, and operating facilities of this type, and we have a legacy of success in Oregon as well, with 17 operating facilities here in the state. Next slide. So, throughout the development process, we've been really committed to being a good community member and engaging early and often with a variety of different groups. Some of those are represented here on the slide, and we plan to continue those engage engagement efforts throughout the remainder of the permitting process and as we move into construction and ultimately into the operational phase as well. As I mentioned, Nikki is our stakeholder relations lead, and she'd be glad to meet you if we haven't had the chance to connect with you already. So we'going to spend a little bit of time on this slide, and some of this may be duplicative with what Chris already covered, and apologies for that, but we'll just run through it one more time. So we began developing the project back in 2021. It was previously called bombing range solar, and then Echo Solar, and we ultimately landed on Sunstone Solar, which is after the state gemstone of Oregon. We don't plan on changing the name again. This is a solar generation facility with potential batter battery energy storage component as well. The maximum facility output will be 1200 megawatts. The largest anticipated footprint will be 9442 acres. And we're going to be interconnecting the project to existing infrastructure owned by Umalla Electric op Co op and Bonneville Power Administration. So we'll have some maps to kind of point out those infrastructure points here in just a minute. But important just to note that the project is not going to require any new transmission corridors outside of the project boundary. We'll be able to interconnect right on site, and also that we will not be interconnecting the project to the proposed boardman to Hemingway project, even though we're in close proximity to that corridor. The project is expected to be constructed in phases over a period of about four years, from 2026 to 2029. So we'll talk a little bit more about what that looks like when we get to those slides. And once the project is interconnected and operating, the power that's generated is going to flow to the umal electric co op and, and BPA regional transmission systems, and will help meet the rising demand for clean energy in this, in this region. Also wanted to mention that we do have a pilot agreement which stands for payment in lieu of tax. We negotiated that with Moro county couple of years ago now, and it provides for $7,000 per megawatt per year of payments to the county in lieu of normal taxation. And that's for a period of 17 operational years. For the balance of the 40 year life of the facility, it will be taxed under the normal tax regime. And when you model all of that out, we anticipate that it will generate approximately $376 million to the county over the life of the facility. So I'm going to show three maps here. These are available in the application in exhibit c. First one is kind of always zoomed out, showing the site boundary inside the purple there, located just on the southeast corner of the bombing range, and it's roughly halfway between Hepner and Boardman. Great. This map is a little more zoomed in and shows all of the existing and proposed energy facilities within a ten mile distance of the site boundary. So you can see there's a lot of existing and proposed wind and solar and other types of infrastructure in the area, as well as a lot of existing and proposed transmission lines. So this project kind of fits right in into that mix in a corridor that's already pretty active with this type of development. Now all the way zoomed in to see the proposed facility layout, including the site boundary, some of the key components that Chris mentioned early on in his presentation in terms of fence lines, o and m areas, lay down yards, etcetera. We do have a copy of this map over here on a board if anyone wants to come over and take a look at it with us after the presentation. The point of interconnection with the UEC system will be in the northwest corner of the site. If you see the dotted blue line coming down from north, that's the existing transmission line that we'll physically connect the facility to. And then there's a few areas marked in red that are excluded from development. So there's a couple of tracks that the participating landowners are going to continue to farm. There's the sand hollow area that runs north south, kind of in the middle of the proposed site, and then a few other areas that are excluded as well. Sorry. Just to mention as well, up in that northwest corner where we plan to",

That's going to be a problem. No, I don't. I have notes. I have little notes here, but I clearly have issues that I intend on taking to contest the case that we're not in writing, because I also ran out of time. So you are denying me access to any kind of new process if I don't get an opportunity to come back. That's what I'm saying. Okay. Thank you, Miss Gilbert. Sam Myers. Hello. Could you please state your name and address? Sam Myers. 68453 Little Butterc Creek Road. Ke or you. We are at the edge of the site boundary. If I had this diagram shows b two, h is the red, comes across. Morrow county designated this in 18 survey of the county as a. Oh, sorry. As a wildland or y wildland urban interface. Right. So at the time this thing was cited, this thing was on the map. The line comes away from the green energy corridor that everybody fought for. Gott have the screen after that, nobody cared. Zoomed right over to this wildland interface. Right. That's the next place to headed to. They're supposed to be citing constraints that that designation carries as far as projects like this. So apparently that didn't happen. Now the site boundary wants to expand, potentially impacting this even more. Now I have a couple options, a couple things I want to drive home. To me, this expansion and the complexity tells me that Idaho Power doesn't have the operational, organizational expertise to pull this off. And this is a step because they couldn't figure it out before. It's very confusing. Can't figure out what's going on. Now we have what appears to be a different amendment appeal process, this type a, which is like even easier to get. Citing approval for more amendments, I'm like, where's this going to end? So this is close enough to my house. It kind of makes a difference. And Idaho power hasn't talked to me in any way, shape or form since OPUC ended. So they have, in my opinion, a lack of interface with landowners. And I see that. I heard Kelan talk about a little interface. I don't think there's enough because I think it's out of their wheelhouse. They don't have this the manpower. They don't have the dedication to deal with landowners in a real way. Why would you have so many options up on the board? I'm going to go here. I'm gonna go here. We got this site boundary bubbles off on the this side or over here. What the heck? There's no way they can just like talk to people, figure it out months ahead. I've been talking to Nexterra for over a year on a rogue revision. We were able to figure it out. We stayed with it. But this group likes to do this, use amendments. So what am I to expect ultimately? At some point this thing crowds into this 500ft and then they want to go more. I don't know. So someday I wake up and they're like putting a line, what, 500 yards from the house or something? And they're like, well, we got another amendment that we did and we got that pushed through. And so here you are, Mister Myers. We need to carve out some space here. This is going to be, you know, it's kind of close, but you'll be all right. I don't know. This is so confusing. Miles and Miles. Okay, I'm going to. I got like minute left here. The other thing is, okay, Helen, you talked about a road being like 50ft wide. I talked with the Morrow county weeds guy and he was having a fit because there's all these roads and Idaho power doesn't care that just dump responsibility on Morro county. Just dump. Hey, you take care of all these roads we're going to make, but now in some places we're going to make them even wider. Okay, what, you just took a road, made it 40, 50ft wide. Really? How's that going to impact the noxious weed control. You just double or tripled the miles. You make them wider, they, they're way harder to control. You turn an area of the edge of the road from three or 2ft maybe on each side. Now you'got to control what, how much. Okay, where's the plan?

        "text": " we know, the state of Florida has experienced a significant amount of growth, with only Texas outpacing the state and the number of new single family dwelling cos issued in the last year. The building safety department has witnessed our fair share of that growth within the last year. In fact, in the month of May, we received more single family dwelling permit applications than we have in the previous 21 months. We received 673 in the of May. That report is in your handout as well as in the agenda that was presented to the commission the last meeting in June. The remote video inspection program, which we started during COVID has expanded and enhanced the ability of the department to provide inspections. The average amount of rvi inspections we completed from June 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023, is 26,787 inspections, which is roughly 10.25% of our actually our inspection load. Our inspection load currently sits at 256,462 inspections, which equates to 986 inspections each day. The department as of May 31, 2023, completed obviously the 256,000 inspections, which is 29, with 29% more customers served in our office by a staff. That equates to 21,563 customers walking in the building department door to be seen and serviced by the staff. We issued 36,629 permits in a twelve month period. We have received applications for 5465 single family residence permits in the electronic media for plans and review and permitting. We process 26,181 permits, that's single families, and every permit we issue with 2476 permits were processed through e plans. Obviously, we like to see the eve side of the business continue to grow. It allows people to do it remotely from their office or even in the comfort of their home. 23,705 permits were processed through e permits. Paper submittals only account for 9518. So as you can see, the overwhelming amount of those permits are actually coming in in an electronic format. And lastly, we had 18% fewer advanced property searches processed through our property search division, which came out to 12,098 property searches in the last calendar year. Now, to preserve our level of excellent customer service, as you can see that we're trying to give to the citizens of Marion county, the budget does have a few small changes in it but we are requesting to maintain the level of contract services noted in account number 534,101 that you will find on page 355. That amount of that contract services is $1,358,428. We're not seeing that go up. We're trying to keep that exactly where it is now. Contract services funds the department's government service agencies who provide plan reviews for us, and hopefully in the future, they will provide some of our remote video inspection operations when we get into the new intergov platform and the contract positions that we have on the team. We currently have several contract positions, mostly phone operators, that actually take the work off of the permit techs, so the permit techs can concentrate on issuing and processing applications which funds okay. These positions have been the utmost importance in pursuing the customer service goals. We serve the construction industry, and I'm actually happy to report the last several customer service surveys we've been receiving have had, actually a 100% positivity mark. We had no negatives on the last two batches coming through, so that work that's being done seems to be working very well, and I'm very happy for that. Now, the department is showing an expenditure of $430,120 in line item 564101, and that's to replace eight high mileage vehicles. Those vehicles will be sent out to other departments. Mileage is high, but we're actually going to send those to other departments, which we will do through that disposition process. And then lastly, our reserve for contingencies is expected to be $327,145, and the maximum for contingencies is 10%, which is adjusted by the budget department. All in all, this budget shows a $4,367,127 reduction in the budget that was presented to the board last year. With that, I'm happy to take any questions, just a quick question. On the remote inspections, how many of those, if any, have been a problem? Of the 20 plus thousand that we've done, I've only heard complaints on about three, I want to say, and that's in the. We started in 2020, and that's been since 2020. I've only heard complaints about three. Now, do inspectors like doing them? Inspectors like they're tactical people they want to touch. They want to go on jobs like they want to see. But it has actually allowed contractors to stay on schedule and sometimes even gain a little bit of time in their schedule because they're able to do those inspections very quickly. Does that include roofing? Yes, sir, it includes",

        "text": " to the US for review by the US Department of Energy. And just another reminder and a reference back to the schedule. Even after we have selected the projects we would like to put forward, we have to submit all of those project details to the US Department of Energy for their final approval before we can proceed with a performance agreement. And that's referenced back on the schedule. But I just wanted to mention that again here. And that's it. That's the whole summary so we can get to your questions. Now I'm taking a look around for either raised hands if you wantna come off mute and ask a question. We are also looking in the chat for any questions we have so far. So far, no hands up and no chats. Hey yeah, that's what I'm seeing as well speak. We sit here in awkward islands, we'll get them here. We got a question. So are projects that integrate existing renewable generation into a microgrid with battery storage eligible for the program? Yes is the short answer. The devil's always in the detail, and so we'd have to take a look at that. It would also have to be a microgrid design specifically to support the resilience and reduce the effects of grid disruption. So as long as that was built into the design and planning of it, what's not allowed is new generation. So if it's a microgrid where the resilience generation is from solar. The solar aspects of that are not eligible funding, but aspects of the microgrid would be great. The next question is, could you please repeat what is not allowed that you mentioned previously? So I don't know if it's easier to just go back to the slide. Thanks. Joshua GL Glad we yeah, I'd like to put up a the eligible whoops, there we are. And what's not allowed is cybersecurity measures and new generation of electricity. Just those two things. We can just maybe just leave this up for a sec. The other thing that's discouraged but not specifically disallowed are routine maintenance and that can be a little bit subjective. So we'll sort of address that project by project, detail by detail. And I want to point out that I got that information from the US Department of En Energyies frequently asked questions, website or document that's on the federal website link. And Emily just included a link to the faq in the chat for those of you interested. Next question. Joshua and Lisa, thank you for the question so far. This is from Brenda. If we have applied for grip in the past with different project scopes, is the letter still required? I believe they still want the letter so they can confirm that, that the scopes don't apply and they have some background information. So they go look up your, your grip application. Our directions are anybody who has a grip project should give us the letter just so that the US Department of Energy can beonlicted. Great. Thanks Clay. And if anybody has joined the call and hasn't yet introduced themselves in the chat, please do. I know, we had some folks join a little bit late, which is great. We're so glad you're here. And then Tegan has a question. If our utility is a sub recipient under another organization's Grip grant, but not the direct applic or recipient, what are the grip letter requirements? I would assume still have to put the letter. Yeah, yeah. And just making that distinction about what parts of the project and scope fall under your entity, under your organization. And then again, we'll have a period. We'll be able to go back and forth with our project officer at the US Department of Energy to get anything like that sorted out. If it comes up, great. And then last for now is Janine, what is the period of performance for this round of funding? They have some concerns about supply chain delays for certain equipmentct, right? Yeah. Ive heard some other national chatter about the reclosrs and other equipment in the shortfalls, but our period will be in May, April, April 2028 will be the end of the period in any performance agreements we signed to start, but there are a few ways to extend projects beyond that. But for now, what we're going to go with is April of 2028 for the end of the performance period. And of course, the concerns or the things that come up with supply chain would end up being, in most cases, a legitimate reason for a no cost extension to a performance agreement from what we're seeing so far. Great. Well, we'll just sit here until you have more questions for us. And if the silence gets to me more than a couple minutes, I think we'll move on, I suppose. Yeah. And I'll just say, if you're thinking about a question but don't want to do it now, you know, please, I'll put up my phone number and my email at the end before we say goodbye, but please email or call anytime. And I can set up other technical experts. We",

It's you know Christina brings up a lot of great points and there we probably do have some members that want to be involved in some of the things that may be like a or not these very large three gr and do that. We just don't have the kind. Yeah. But is something we recognize and then we are working those directions to, to get better at that. We don't fall, we don't fall under the same guideonents either. Yeah. I think I mean they go through a very rigorous process and in some cases the I use blaz the trail can learn from some cases that just doesn't relate some'keep, that in mind. Scale and then partners. I mean as far as we love in our local office in Roseburg, half of our line there work here and vice versa. We love working with Paific. Great work with we work together and Sam Carter down Rosary work with him for great folks. I don't want anybody. It's just we're just different. So I know that Gail Malcolm is with us and she had a really great project that I was hoping to hear from Gail and we'll move this along to get to the actual criteria, two other people. Okay, so let's go for three more stories, five minutes max, and then we can move on. This is bar, can you hear me? Yeah. Oh, good. Okay, so I will drop into the chat how PGE has taken a look at the CBIs'that Christina was talking about. This is an iterative process. So, you know, as we continue to engage with our community and the PUC and other stakeholders, this will continue to evolve. But I think to the point that some of the cous we're talking about in terms of scale and scope and how do you operationalize that? There are some good, I think, lessons in terms of, you know, some of those smaller things that may be able to be incorporated as smaller utilities are looking that aren't, you know, big, large scale, monumental things that take a lot of staff time. So I will drop that into the chat. And just for kind of awareness purposes, I wanted to briefly touch on the workforce development side of things. And that's something that we've really taken as a priority for us and really looked at ways in which we can help build the workforce pipeline and really leverage, you know, the projects that we are doing. So for projects, obviously, our own workforce is doing some of the projects. When we contract out, we're looking at things like requiring prevailing wage and looking at apprentice utilization, thinking through ways in which we can partner with pre apprenticeship programs. We have our own pre apprenticeship program for linen and then looking at other partnerships with other pre apprenticeship programs. So thinking a little bit broader beyond just the actual project that you're working on, but working in a more cohesive way for how we can build the workforce pipeline, because that benefits community in a broader and a more long term way. So PGE also convened a statewide coalition last year around building the Clean Energy Workforce coalition. And I'm happy to follow up with anybody who would like more information on that. We, some of you on the call and in the room are participating in that, but I'll put my information down as well. So I just wanted to throw that little plug in about kind of thinking broader about workforce broadly. Thank you, Bret. Can you guys hear us? Hear. Yes. Sty, what if be possible to pivot over to Gail and give her an opportunity to speak to the. On this? Hi. I was hoping to be there in person, but I ran into a car accident and I got turned around. So I'm on the side of the road someplace safe. So in terms of central Lincoln's, one of the projects we had thought about was something we call the Cape Perpetua project, and it has, it's a 14 miles stretch of distribution and fiber line that runs on the ridge above Highway 101. So it gets a lot of wind in the winter, and it's in the Suslaw National Forest, and it's in the Cape Perpetua scenic area, and it's high up. And to get to most of the sections of the line, we have to helicopter in or get there by foot when we have an outage. And we do have outages on that particular line because it's so exposed. So we're wanting to do a joint project with Pioneer, who is also running fiber and uses our poles and moving all that infrastructure down to Highway 101 underground. So it's an undergrounding project on its face, but there's lots of community benefits. And first of all, we'd be moving the distribution and fiber lines out of the national forest in the scenic area. It returns where we do have roads, it returns that habitat and public lands to its original use",

So if you don't want to be on recording, might not be the best space for you. And our presenter just showed up, so I won't Portland traffic. So Max, I just mentioned that we're being reported, but we're good to go. Are you presenting? Let me introduce the team real quick. My name is Tom Cecilia. I'm the Hanford hydrogeologist and fuel specialist at Dono. I'm joined by my assistister director Max woods and our contracting team, doctor Casey Steban and Andrew Eiseber. Okay, thanks talk. Thanks everybody. Thanks for bearing with me few minutes here. I live in Portlandon saym. So we'll talking about the Oregon energy security plan. I know you already know that because that's why you're here. And so I'got a brief agenda and I go through tell you what we're gonna tell you about, and we'll tell you those things and we'll tell you what we told you, kind of that typical pattern. We'll talk, start a little bit about what the project is, why it matters, talk about the timeline, the structure of the project methods. Take quick breakick and then we're gonna dive into preliminary results. This will be led by ourct case Stedman and the our team contracting team and kind of see what we'renna get through there next steps. Talk about theview strategy, which is a separate project that Oto has ongoing micro frees from our shop is here to talk about that a little bit, do some Q and A. And I'd like to say at the beginning, we're gonna make this an interactive time here. To get an interactive, we're really looking for feedback. We're looking for input from people here, from people online to talk about, sort of give us input on the results that we're gonna roll out here. Um, you know, you probably sit through in your days many, many, many PowerPoint presentations, someone like me telling you information. There's a little bit of that. We're also going to make it a little more interactive. We have a program called Slideo, which you can access on your phones, your computers. I think we also have some hard copies of the. If you don't want to use your phone or it just feels a little cumbforersome. If you're in the room here, we have some hard copies of the document. If you're online, using your computer is a good way to do it. It it's pretty easy on a laptop. It's a little more tricky on a phone. We'll get to that. So, before we get really div in, let's talk about who we are here. You are in the building. The Oregon Department of Energy. Thanks for coming. You re online watching me talk. I work for the orgon department of Energy. About o no, we got a couple things here about all the stuff we do, and the under security plan that we're leading here fits right into our strategy. And so there's another sort of wrap up of a wider here shared project progress. Discuss risk assessment results led by doctor Stedman, as mentioned, and trying to make input on mitigation measures to reduce those risks. It's regional. We should note that. I think Tom mentioned this very beginning. This is our La Valley regional meeting. Um, the state. We have a map. Well, we got a map somewhere in there. U the state, uh, we've sort of divided it up into six regions just for purposes of, uh, sort of coordination on our project. U the regions that we use are also used by the Oregon department of Emergency Management. So it's consistency with other state agency. Six regions in between last week and this week, we're going to every one of those regions for a similar meeting like this, where we'll talk about, there's some general information we'll talk about, and we'll talk about some specific results for the region here. The Lima Valley region is Marion County, Lane County, Lyon County, Douglas County, Polk. Yeah. Is that right? I think that's theing list. We have a map. I'll show you that. Uh, there's also a northwest region, Portlandentro region, cascaded region. Yesterday, you guys were in bend yesterday talking about the Cascades regions were the central part of the state, east of the Cascades, eastern region. Last week, Tom and I were in Pendleton. Uh, we were also until the one last week in Portland. And then after this meeting, we're driving to Medford and having a similar meeting. So, trying to get out across the state. The best week. Oh, and on this slide, oh, this is a who we are again. So, led by the Department of Energy, our contracting team from CNA, they have a partner with subcontract called Halio Alalddrich",

        "text": " to touch briefly on how we're going to do this from a regulatory perspective. And then we'll talk about how we do it from a cost perspective. So all business that PGE does pretty much has to be done via a tariff, which is a document that we file with public Utility commission that it approves. That explains what things cost and how we charge for them. This is no different. So currently, Steve and I and many others of PGE have been working on a community green tariff. That's going to explain how this works. We expect to file this within the next couple of months. And it's really high level. We're trying to make this effectively a carrier for whatever policies that our local communities would like to implement. With this. We have some communities that just want to talk about emissions, period. We have some that want to talk about developing resources that provide significant local economic benefit. We are trying to do something that allows for both. This slide is really helpful because it shows that its the general umbrella provisions about, you know, how customers get charged. The program mechanics in terms of, you know, how decisions are made. And then that last one, risk allocation is really important. I'll pause here to see if there are any questions with what I've got so far. Question so far? I don't think we have any so far. Okay, great. So to talk briefly about risk allocation, I want to just explain how that works and why. One bedrock concept of any voluntary utility program is that the customers that are choosing to take on additional costs bear the risk. Because it will be not fair to, let say, the Multoma County County Council make a decision that could increase costs for customers in Salem or Hillsboro or anywhere else. Right. It's just. It would be allowing one local government to make decisions on behalf of folks that are outside of its jurisdiction. And to clarify, in this context, when you're saying customer, you mean the city, the county, whatever the jurisdiction is, you're not talking about individual households or business. Oh, thank you for that clarification. In this particular example, we are saying residential and small commercial customers in the city of Salem or anywhere else. So if Salem moves forward with this, we are talking about costs that will be paid by residential and small commercial customers in the city of Salem. We have other options. The city of Salem. If we're talking about just meeting the city of Salem's own demand at city owned buildings. But that's not what we're talking about here. We're talking about a tariff that would be broadly applicable to all residential and small commercial customers in Saleem unless they opt out. So that's the part I was not clear on when. Because you were talking about it being optional, and I understand it's optional for jurisdictions. I didn't really realize it would be optional for individual customers within that jurisdiction, yes. Yeah. And that's required by the law. What HP 2021 says is that for this, this is an opt out program. So you customers would get a letter in the mail and probably plenty of other communications that say, hey, you know, the Salem City council voted to create this program. You are automatically opted in. You have some number of bill cycles to let PG know that you don't want to be in. But that's how it works. Thank you. Okay, one follow up question, if I could. I understand that coun council have a choice between opt in or opt out programs. Is that the case, or is it mandatory opt in? It's mandatory opt out. And that's something that's in HP 2021. We have no flexibility there. Thank you. Okay, that actually is a really helpful intro to this risk allocation question, which I've already started to touch on. Fundamentally, if any local jurisdiction in our service area says we want to do this, it means that the costs of doing this, of implementing a community green tariff, are on that community permanently. There is no off ramp once the money is spent. There is an off ramp for money that hasn't been spent yet. But once we sign a long term contract for a new resource to serve folks in the city of Salem, to help Salem meet its climate goals, there's no way to sor. Turn that off. And let me tell you why. The answer is because there's only two places to put costs. It's either on the people in the city of Salem after the city of Salem votes to create this program, or it's all of our other customers. And you can see immediately how it's just really unfair to say to people in any other city that we serve, you know, the Salem city council voted to do this thing, and now you have to pay. There's just sort of like a representative democracy problem right there where, you know, people in Sandy or government camp can't vote you all in office, so that's not really an appropriate option for us. Yeah. By money spent,",

I'm going to turn it back over to chair Grail, who's the presiding officer for the the hearing, and she is going to run the public hearing and there will be an opportunity for anybody in the room to make oral comment. Then we're going to go to the phone, get people off the web if they're on there. So thank you chair grail. Kate this is the public hearing on the draft proposed order on the request for amendment one of the Obsidian Solar center site certificate. I'm Marcy Grail, FEC chair, am serving as the presiding officer for this hearing. Today is August 24, 2023. The time is now 06:57 p.m. this public hearing is being held at an energy facility siting council FSEEC meeting in person here at the Parks and Recreation Community hall in Christmas Valley. This hearing is also being held via a Webex webinar with a call and option for those who cannot participate in person or via webinar. Today's hearing is being recorded. The presentations, written comments and oral testimony are part of the decision record for the amendment request for the facility. The purpose of the public hearing is to provide an opportunity for the public reviewing agenciessel and the certificate holder, if they wish to do so, to present oral and written testimony on the amendment request and the department's draft proposed order. The 24 day record of the public hearing comment period on the draft proposed order is scheduled to close at the conclusion of the hearing tonight. Next slide, please. Pursuant to oAR 345-027-0367 Subsection five A and B, please note the A person who intends to raise any issue that may be the basis for a contested case must raise the issue in person at the hearing or in a written comment submitted to the Department of Energy before the August 2423 deadline with sufficient specificity to afford the council, Department of Energy, and the certificate holder an adequate opportunity to respond, including a statement of facts that support the person's position on the issue. In the type a review amendment process, issues eligible for a contested case must be determined by FSEEC to raise a significant issue of factor law that is reasonably likely to affect coun council determination of compliance with an applicable standard. To raise an issue in a contested case proceeding, the issue must be within the council's jurisdiction. Raised in writing or in person prior to the close of the record of the public comment period. August 24, 2023. Raised with sufficient specity to afford the council, the Department of Energy, and the certificate holder an adequate opportunity to respond. To raise an issue with sufficient specity, a person must present facts that support the person's position on the issue. Next slide, please this slide presents the order for tonight's hearing and testimony on the record of the DPO. Members of the public will be called on in the order presented here. If attendees at the meeting wish to comment, please complete and submit a commenter's card prior to testifying. If attendees wish to submit written comments at the hearing to staff, they may do so by completing and submitting a comment card prior to the end of the hearing. I will call on each person interested in providing oral testimonying, starting with the certificate holder, then members of the public here in person, then on the webinar, then on the phone. Next slide, please. For any individuals wishing to provide oral testimony during tonight's hearing for the record, please stateate the following with your testimony, your full name with spelling, name of the organization or group if you are representing one in a physical or email address. So I go to the next slide. I first would ask, is the certificate holder here? Hello, would you like to provide testimony? Thank you. Thank you for traveling to Christmas Valley. I acknowledge you guys all traveled a lot to get here, but several people from Lake county also drove at least 2 hours to get can I get you to state your name and you're with, please? Yeah, I'm Laurie Hutchinson, l a u r I e. Hutchinson. H u t c h I n s o n with obsidian Renewables. So, yeah, I just want to acknowledge. Thanks. Thanks to Lake county participants for coming from far away. The amendment to the site certificate is pretty basic. I've gotten around to many people in the room to discuss it, and while I know the council can only hear comments on this amendment, many of you know that I'm the main liaison to Lake county. So any questions that don't have to do with the amendment, just take those up with me. I'll leave my cards around. And I think that the main thing to address is that we have added some irrigated land, which we know is a sensitive thing to do in Lake county. There's not a lot of private land, that is, and there's not a lot of irrigated land here",

        "text": " you realize you're gonna have to turnow on your camera because you're like a mystery person to everybody here. I know they hear you, but they don't see you. Yeah. Pay no attention to the guy behind the slides. Yeah. And I'm sorry, Riley, which slide were you looking for? Slide seven. Okay. And sorry, I've got way too many screens here. We are seeing your slide. Here we go. There we go. Okay. So on this question of risk allocation there's an assumption on this slide that PGE's cost to serve all customers over the next 20 years is dollar 60. But that's a forecast. It will not be right. Like, it might be 50, it might be 70. It might be some other number. So PGE and all PGE customers are bearing the risk of that forecast being wrong fore the risk that you are all wearing is that incremental cost. And also the possibility that a ton of customers opt out and costs on a per customer basis increased dramatically. However, we will know at the beginning what folks in Salem are going to be paying for over the life of the program. So there will be certainty around total program cost. We will not have certainty around per bill cost because we don't know how much electricity is going to be sold. And sal them. Exactly. We certainly have forecasts, but they're not going to be perfect. And we will not have certainty around the number of customers that choose to opt out. But that bigger question of risk of, well, what if PGE's forecasts are wrong? That's a risk that all PGE customers wear, not folks in the city of Salem. So along those lines, I know that you're currently going out or you're requesting another rate increase which is kind of on the heels of another rate increase. Do you have any long term forecasting right now? Like, when do you anticipate doing that again? After the one that's coming up, because that would impact whether or not, you know, obviously, we can't just keep asking people to pay more and more and more and more and then us asking on top of that. So I'm just curious, like, do you have any indication when what that looks like right now? You know, I don't. I don't. I wish I did, but I don't. So another question. What would happen if, you know, we come up this idea to do a solar farm in eastern Oregon and it's 20 million, and you calculate the cost of what everyone would pay and that project then doubles in cost or the costs go up. What happens to the customer that opted in for $5 a month or $20 a month and there's not enough funds to then create that project? Well, so let'let's sort of step it back a little bit. If something like that happens, the first thing that we need to look for are what are the contractual protections in the contract with the developer of that wind farmar is in Oregon? Because we're not going to simply say, oh, your cost doubled here we'pay you. That certainly has happened on contracts in the last couple of years where because of inflation and because of supply chain constraints, costs have gone up significantly. But we would look in the first instance for contractual protections. But, you know, again, like, because folks in Salem bear the risk of. Of this program if there's a cost increase that can't be mitigated or that the city chooses to take on to make the program, program happen, people in Salem would be on the hook. But in that example you give of a resource cost doubling, almost certainly be an option for Salem to sort of just say, no, thanks, we're out, and to reassess the program. Got it. Thank you. Counselor Phillips, I saw your hand go up and then down. Is it. You have question? Yeah, I think I do. I think I've asked this question before, but I forgot what the answer was. So is there a program now or in past where individual rateayers for power in our community could kind of opt to something like this? Yes. Okay. Because I think we individually did that. Is that program still going? Yes. It's called our green Future program. It allows individual customers to opt into a green power purchase where, and I won't get into the details of it, but during this meeting, one of the benefits of remote is that people can kind of ask questions elsewhere in PG on the side. Wendy just sent me a message. About 25% of Salem residential customers are opted into that program. Right now, which adds a couple bucks a month to bills. Okay, so that was my follow up question is like, is it okay to know what the percentage is? So that gives us a sense of how many people are already doing. Now is it, as. I'm failing to find a better synonym for aggressive, is that",

        "text": " we'll move into those on the phone line. Uh, last and on this slide, I have instructions on how to participate via the webinar or via the phone. And I'll keep this up through the Q and a session. Okay, so we'll just go around the room here, and I'll start with our guests here and see if they have any comments. And one with Mike. I just have a question, because I have the solar panels behind our house and the battery storage, is there any standards or regulations on distance from residents? Because they do have a drone sound? So I'm just wondering because he's going to have some behind his house, so if they're going to be on one spot. Yeah, I can answer that question. So, a part of our exhibits, I believe it's exhibit y. There's a noise sound decibel level analysis. So once we choose a vendor and all the components that go into the solar and energy storage site, we'll then do another noise analysis to determine what the decibel levels are at all noise sensitive areas. So that would be like a residence. U but short answer to your question is yes, there is a standoff from residences distance that has to be from a residence. Like when they set them up like a half a mile or something like that. I'll take that one. There's not specifically a exact setback like that far. There's the normal county setbacks, et cetera. But it is the noise, or, sorry, the sound levels that dictate the next. I think you had a second question in there, and that is these will be located further to the west than the existing facility, and they will be located in a grouping and will be, as Ryan said, we'll be doing all that sound analysis, you know, prior to construction. And as a landowner, as you know, we will be coming to. To talk to you about those results. Okay. And noise. The noise standard actually follows the department of environmental qualities, noise rules. And that's U. That's what determines the thresholds and noise levels, is DeQ. Noise rules. Wellm, really didn't really, really realize the noise level until they're built. And you're actually dealing with it. The worst of it'when, it's cloud cover. It is a drone that I hear all the time, but, you knowah, I signed off on it, so I can't say much. And do you know, around, like, how long it would be until those decibel tests are performed? Is that going to be, like, in the next year? Is that going to be when the whole, you know, construction of this project is completed. And if so, can we do, like, something in the meantime? Like, you know, just on that Bess site, you know, maybe do a decimal, you know, test and adjustment if needed. Yeah, I mean, Ryan or I can take that. You do the analysis as per the citing rules. Pre construction. As part of our pre construction. Because as of right now, as Chase said, the layout is preliminary. And as we get into further design and we actually start ordering equipment or start knowing what we want to order as far as equipment, like the precise equipment, then we update those and we come around to the landowners and discuss those. So rather than a specific time from now, it would be within that pre construction. Usually the months and more leading up to construction to address exhibit. Why the applicant has. Has conducted predicted noise levels in exhibit y like already. So. And they. The applicant. Exhibit y goes into potential measures to reduce noise levels. And explains its compliance with the noise regulation. So exhibit y, which is on the project webpage. Is where you would find all of the data to date on noise, including evaluation of acoustic modeling. Yeah. And will we will, you know, hearing this as we will come to you and your neighbors, which are all family members. And we' we'll have a further discussion, you know, by all means. Okay, I got one. I'm Stanley Ral and my house is right in the middle of. On the north unit now. And right next to the main power line that goes out to the river. Now, after looking at the map, it within. It's within 100 yards or sol of my house, the main and the transformers. And it'snna be just across the road and killil kids. Now, for me, that's too darn close. Now, when Chris came up and mentioned that this is where the proposal was. Atuse he's farming always ground around million gu now. Well, we were wanting it to move so to the far north end, which would be next to greeks and kill kidiess and starvation farms, which would tie to the north, excuse me, the northet west side.

        "text": "Hi, I am Todd Farmer, the director of installations for the Oregon Military Department. We support the Oregon army and Air National Guard here in the state of Oregon and have been supporting this Orsa project since it began. The partner here with me today, Kim Petacher, she'll speak to the navy aspects of this. But just, just from OMD's perspective, this has been a very exciting opportunity to work on a needed endeavor of the intersection between renewable energy and military training in Oregon. And I think this tool is really bringing together much cleaner situational awareness on the military equities in Oregon, some of our needs, and certainly bringing the conversation together about our needs as well as the renewable development in our area. But very excited to see this thing progressing. And there's been a lot of hard work and it has really been a privilege to work on, on this project. Kim. Yeah. Thank you, Todd, for the introduction. And hello, everyone. My name is Kim Peer. I'm the northwest training range complex community planning and liaison officer. Bottom line is I work for the Navy. The other hat that I wear is the Northwest Department of Defense Regional Coordination team lead that brings together all of the services in Oregon and Washington to be more cohesive and unified as we work on various challenges and initiatives. So this grant has been a great opportunity for us to fund a proactive measure to really look at the sing of renewable energy and transmission as it relates to the military and look about how we can kind preemptively address any potential conflicts or challenges as renewable energy moves forward and as we look to sustain the critical training, testing and operating areas, both on and offshore for the military. So, really, this grant has allowed us that opportunity to facilitate additional transparency about where we operate, as well as bring in additional parties and stakeholders to further implement co coordination. So, again, couldn't emphasize early notification and coordination and the benefits that this tool has brought for us in trying to find that win, win, win between the military, economic development, streamlining proposals, and moving forward with green energy. And I'll pass it back to Todd. Yeah, everything that Kim has brought forward has really been important to us as well. Starting from little information that was available, consolidated information about what military equities we have in Oregon and where it intersects with renewable energy. This tool really brings together that, that awareness and starts the conversation when it should, when it should be at the beginning of a project. And we're very excited to see that, that happening in the engagements that we have from a DOD perspective here in Oregon. Thank you. Yeah. And we look forward to that continued implementation of this tool and fostering relationships and identifying conflicts early on to, you know, work through those as much as possible. So happy to work with you on. Look forward to continuing to work with the state team, both DLCD and Odo, and appreciate the opportunity to work on such an initiative. Thank you, everybody. I'm John Jennings. I'm the community Services specialist, the Department of Land Conservation Development. I'been fortunate to be in a position to assist with the renewable energy siting assessment project. I'been co lead for DLCD on that. Our agency has been interested in this project and in a couple of ways and for quite a while. One, we've had contact with the military and their concerns about preserving airspace and being able to complete their mission and, and types of operations in Oregon as well as the sing of renewable energy projects. You know, our administrative rules promulgated by LCDC have a role in determining how and when projects like solar and wind can be established. And there's a growing interest in that. And this project has really helped us learn more about the landscape and learn more about where things are and aren't. Obviously, we haven't tried to identify locations that should be or shouldn't be developed, but we're hoping that this information will help policy makers, decision makers make, make some informed choices. I mean, I think that the information we've gathered here that has been enriched and benefited by speaking with our local planning community and a broad host of other interested parties''we'll help things out. Know, our planning directors have, have frequently said, yes, this is really good information. This should help us understand the types of things going on. Energy developers have said, you know, this will help us in our prospecting efforts. That is, you know, being able to identify early the types of things out there in the landscape to look out for less high value farmland or sensitive species and then also who to contact that might have an interest, like counties, obviously, of the military. And so I guess that's what we see is our, our primary benefit is that, again, helping us understand what's going on out there. You know, our role in, in the project is helping to facilitate one of the three assessments, the natural resources, environmental",

So just from a general standpoint, that is something that this project would have just because all other solar projects. And when projects happen, it as well. And then. So the answer is yes. But that's a standard thing that happens with all solar projects and wind projects. Okay. Because earlier you're saying, and it shows back on your signs, too, that it'll be bringing in 1.6 million to Lynn county in property taxes. So when you break that down by the acreage that you say it's about $1,400 per acre that it'll be bringing in, which is something, I mean, it's not like it's that much more or more even than agriculture would produce in a year, but when you take into account the subsidies and different things that you guys will get will actually be a greater good or is it actually going to cost the taxpayers money in the end? So we're not, that 1.6 doesn't anticipate, you know, reduction or anything like that when it comes to tax payments with the county. That's something we have not had a conversation about. So that 1.6 is just general projection of what we're looking at for increased, like, tax revenue on. For property tax. But I also like to reiterate, like, are we all also like to propose a community benefits package outside of just general taxes, you know, and that's something that I am looking for feedback from the community to see if there's any pet projects or any special type of funds that, like the county itself and the community would like to see and see if that's something the project can support. Okay, thank you. Okay, last call. All right. Thanks, everybody, for coming out tonight. Those of you particularly, who stuck it out to the end, you know, we appreciate your time. We'definitely going to take your comments as we evaluate the notice of intent. And if anybody wants to stick around and ask us or the applicant questions after this, we'll be here as long as you want to ask us questions. So thanks, everybody.",

As I stated, we're at the notice of intense stage. There are seven major steps in this process that goes all the way to a final order in a site certificate at the end. There's a couple of things I want to cover on here. The notice of intent submitted by the applicant. The department issues a public notice and it opens up that comment period. The public comment period is open and it closes on May 3. And then we hold an information meeting. And the whole purpose of that is in all of these green boxes is that there's opportunities for public participation. And then we are also coordinating at this point with those reviewing agencies that I talked about, about the proposed facility, about the notice of intent. And all of that information will get summarized in what Odo prepares, which is the next step, which is the project order. And the project order is something I will prepare as the signing analyst and gets reviewed and approved through our department. And we prepare that project order for the purposes of giving it back to the applicant. And that project order will contain really specific information about what needs to be included in their preliminary application. So the applicant will be working on the materials for their preliminary application, and they will submit a preliminary application, should they choose to, based upon what they're required to submit. And it will be in the project order. And that project order is underway, and it will be issued in the middle of June is the deadline to issue that to the applicant, and then it become starts the application process. So the first step is a preliminary application the applicant submits to the Department of preliminary application with all of the required exhibits that cover all of the 16 standards that we have, and we as a department have to review that for completeness, it has to have sufficient and adequate information for council to really reach a conclusion on whether or not a standard is met. We also issue another public notice that says we've received a preliminary application. It gets updated on the webpage. We will also hold an informational meeting then and open it up for comment. And then we go back to those reviewing agencies and coordinatedon. No, oh, no comment. Okay, I'm sorry. Public notice information meeting, not on the preliminary. Okay. And then the agency coordination is ongoing throughout, so we're going to consult once we've deemed complete. That's what we call an ASC. It's the full complete application and we can move forward with drafting the draft proposed order, which is the next step. So the department will prepare a draft proposed order. Once it's issued, we issue notice. We posted on a public website. We have a public hearing. The public hearing will be an opportunity for the public to participate and make comments on the record for the application. And that makes, that's important to know because it ties to the contested case. So in order to participate in a contested case, you need to make comments at the draft proposed order public hearing stage before that public comment period closes on the draft proposed order. Once we're done with that, we take all of those comments and we incorporate that information. We may make revisions and we issue what is called a proposed order. Both times. Council review. We'll take the draft proposed order for council review. We'll make edits, changes, revisions as recommended Bysel or in response to comments, and we'll issue a proposed order. That proposed order will be issued by the department along with another public notice. It is not open for public comment at this time, but that notice will also include the notice of contested case. So it's your opportunity at that point to request a contested case. Once the proposed order is issued, that notice goes out. That notice on the contested case goes out. You can ask to participate in that contested case, and then at the very end is the final order, final decision by the energy Facility siting Council. So council is involved in all of these stages, but the decision is ultimately theirs, and they make that decision on whether to issue, deny, or, you know, I don't know what the other issue options would be. Amend. Amend. Okay, they'll approve a final order. We will issue that final order. The chair will then sign a site certificate and the site certificate will be granted. I know you have a question. We can go back to this later on. We can come back to this slide when we open Q and a okay, so next slide. So I did talk a little bit about reviewing agencies and special advisory groups and their role. I think that the important thing to realize is, you know, the special advisory group for this facility is Wasco county because they are the local government and they've been appointed as the special advisory group.

        "text": ", but as the report said, the way to get it was not particularly well defined. So they commissioned a study done last year to see how can they get to that goal. Just as a bit of a side note, and this is a quote, they call it a state preemption disclaimer, but Florida's state legislature basically put a prohibition on local governments dictate certain types of energy USS in buildings. So what Taba did, the first part of their work is an assessment of their power usage. Wastewater is a big one. I looked at their system. Similar to our primary secondary treatment, they discharge into a river. As I recall. The second use is basically everything else includes. They operate a convention center as well as other public works. Parks and recreation was a big power use source. And then third in this pie chart is water. They have a more power hungry water system. We looked at it. Gravity is our friend. Slow sound filtration. They do more very flat. A lot of pumping costs, vivid scenario planning, a lot of intriguing modeling. We looked at three different scenarios, firstarily called a business as usual, that looked atumed historical usage, historical consumption and trends currently on the books. Looking at their goal of 2035, in the second of three scenarios is this moderate scenario. They looked at specific different initiatives, some installations, some upgrades, in some reprobatess. They ran their modeling and they came up, interestingly, that if you did the moderate scenario, it created a little over 200 new jobs. Good news. It cost $185 million between I think this year and 2042. And their analysis that by 2042 they would hit 50% of the clean renewable energy. I remember they were looking for 100% by 2035. So they said, let's check out the ambitious scenario. So they did everything. They again, the consultants do the modeling, everything moderate. And then what they call the harder to realize targets and initiatives. In this case, they did all the installations, all the retrogrits, all the upgrades. They added a 20 megawatt offs site solar farm. And this energy efficient rooftops. I didn't recognize the name of it, something called simlast. But it's a covering that goes on roofs, reduces as efficiency system. This scenario added almost 500 new jobs. It was expensive. And even with this, they hit 85 clean renewable energy by 2042. So in less than 20 years, spend somewhere between a quarter and a third of a billion dollars and you're still falling short of their goal. So they said basically you want to reach your goal of 100% by 2035. You need to buy renewable energy credits. And the conclusion for the report was that the city is well positioned to reach its goals and do all those good things. So again, Tampa, which is the closest template to what we're thinking of doing, they the council has set a goal tr to find a way forward to get that goal. Did the analysis and found that to do it was expensive and they had to renewable credits. But that's good to know how to get to what their goal is. So basically, if I'm understand correctly, because the said did not make any changes and just buy their like buy the feel good renewable credits. I mean, it doesn't seem. It seems like. I don't know. I mean, the report was just completed this year. I don't know if they. Okay, yeah. The way the report was that you can do this, I don't think a decision has s been made. You can do business as usual and make up a difference, a lot of renewable energy credits or you can do various scenarios. If you do a little bit, you fall short this much, you do everything, you fall short that much. And make up the difference with renewable interview credits, but you could not do it without reable ent cred is one of the less okay, so what our proposed scop is. Do have a question? Oh, I think it's base. So I will wait till the end of this presentation, then I will ask my question. I'll even make a note. All right, well, I have a way cool question slide coming up. So what the energy master energy plan that we're intending to pursue follows along the model of the Tampa study as well as the mentoring you've got from the National Renewable Energies Lab. Do a baseline. We'll model future demand and we'll look at different initiatives, identify potential projects, programs and policies. I think we'll try to do the same scenario based analysis. The study will recommend goals and then develop metrics for tracking and reporting. Although the city has goals for greenhouse gas reduction, we don't have goals specific to energy efficiency. And whether the results of this study will lead us to recommend goals or not, I don't know. Tampa did not have",

I thought I'd just raise my actual hand. I just wanted to chime in and say I think it would be great to have an opportunity to hear from other agencies who are new and old members of the committee, especially in terms of the work that their agencies are doing on climate change and as they relate to the roadmap and going back to something that Christy mentioned earlier, with existing programs that are running out of funding or need to be reauthorized, I think it'be really valuable to hear about the progress of those existing programs, especially those that were highlighted in the roadmap, so that we can sort of track how things are going and be a venue to share the successes. Because the conclusion of the roadmap is we've got really good, strong programs in Oregon that are going to get us to our goals if they are implemented as envisioned. So I think this commission has a really big role to play in making sure that we do what we need to do and we can help communicate that to the legislature and others who may not realize the importance of existing programs. So I just wanted to offer my support for that idea. Absolutely. Yeah. Really important. It was our number one recommendation. So thanks for emphasizing that. Other comments? Okay. Well, with that, I will close the March 19 meeting of the Oregon climate action commission. And I want to just thank all the commissioners and directors, legislators, and the public for the attention that you're giving the commission and input that you're providing to the important work that were charged with helping to advance.

        "text": " what this map summarizes for us here. So we have a pie chart for each of the regions. They're size based on the number of threats that were cited. And then the color or the slice of the pie chart represents the type of threat that was cited. And this is where we start to see a trend emerging in our analysis and the feedback we're getting. You'll notice that the pink, red, and purple slices of the pie tend to be largest across all of the regions. These represent red for wildfire, purple for windstorm, and pink for winter storm. These three threats tend to rise to the top with regard to priority on a very frequent basis. We also asked which subsector tends to be impacted most. The bar chart on the left left, summarizes this. Fore us where electricity was cited most frequently, followed by liquid fuels, in this case specifically petroleum and then natural gas. Something important to note about this figure is that we did have more engagement from the liquid fuels private sector relative to the electricity or natural gas subsectors. And so the references to disruptions in liquid fuels might be disproportionately high. The bar chart on the right informs us of how long it takes to restore service. And what we can see is that across all three of the subsectors, the most common response is that it's a matter of days. So really less than a week's time for service to be restored. Now, we asked a number of questions around preparedness. All I'm summarizing here is the presence of backup generators, and you can see that this pie chart is roughly divided into thirds. The dark blue are responses where a generator is present, yellow, a generator is not present, and then gray is when it's unknown. Something important to note about when a generator is present is that there is a lot of variability with regard to the operational capacity of that generator. So there, there were some instances where the generator could offer full operational capacity, but could also be as limited as just providing a safe shutdown. Our last category of feedback is related to environmental justice issues. The pie chart on the left highlights the types of communities that are of highest concern with regard to impact. The most frequently cited community is low income, that's the dark blue, and that's followed by rural communities in the dark yellow. The bar chart on the right shows us what these areas of concern primarily relate to. So the most common concern is a power supply disruption. This aligns well with what we saw earlier, where the most common disruption is noticed in the electricity subsector, and then that's followed by toxic fume exposure. So these are a high level summary of what other folks are telling us thus far. And what we want to know from you guys is, do you agree with what other people are telling us? And so question two in your slido is asking what, from what you just heard, what if that resonates with you? You're saying, yes, you guys are on the right track. You're hearing the right thing. This aligns with my experiences, my understanding of the situation. Question three is the opposite. What do you disagree with anything that does not align with your understanding, your experiences, or anything that's missing and you think needs to be on our radar? Let us know in question three. Questions four through eight all relate to environmental justice. So just requesting more insight here. Anything that you have knowledge on, we would love to learn from you there. This is the largest section of questions or collection that we'll be asking of you at a single time. So we'll give you a couple of minutes to work through these and then we'll move on to the risk assessment preliminary results. Oh, yeah. If we have any questions, also, please feel free to speak up in the room or online. Put something in the chat or just come off me. Yes, we have one. How much do we know about your respondents awareness of the possible hazards are toxic fumes or other hazards that people don't know much about? How much do we know about their awareness of different respond. I'm sorry, I don't know the qU, understand what they. Can I speak to that? Yeah, please do. I'm just saying that we may all be really aware that there's a flooding risk or wildfire because I know I live in the middle of a forest, but really, people don't know very much about toxic fumes or what could blow up. I know Multtnomah county has just done some research on this, so I'm just saying when people are responding to this, there's, there's probably no way that you've, that you can see like how knowledgeable is this person and how knowledgeable are people? We know more about some risks than other risks. Yeah, I would agree. Yeah, we have a collection. So the representation of folks, these could be folks that are with the government. These can be personal stories, they could be from private sectors. So we have a collection, you know, of folks that",

        "text": " something like emergency response and communications. That's probably an instance where this program could look at batteries and put them in a positive competitive light within the matrix. That's what the group decides we want to do. So that's an example where standalone batteries that bring a lot of value outside of the discussion of microgrids and solar and stuff, but just batter red Dec to as well. I think at times as a utility, you know, electric utility, I we had a tendency see a littleer tunnel vision. But one thing at that snow th us was all the othertil these ry us as well for clean water, wastewater treatment, firefighting, all those without electricity in work. Right. So having resilient grid is beneficial, but also then having the ability to to standone for short periods of time while things are being rebuilt I think is very important for for folks to consider as well. So could the resilience help concept be supported by this or like a community center? It's not an individual, but a community center would be able to support the essential services that would probably go through our c rep program. But resilience staff much more likely go through that that fund path because this does not, for example, find the solo or energy generation for the site. Um, and the feedback we've had pretty overwhelmingly for new to resist to focus on the more traditional river lifebility we measures. And there's other lots of funding that are focusing on res own bos and so we've got good opportunities from those, just not through this program. I think most, most utilities are our headquarters. We have backup generators to keep things online. The one not this Po but another grant on will be is solar with battery storage to limit having actually start the generator. We can run for short average times off of our battery stores and not have to start gener that's great. Or to provide and then we also as part of that and provide a community gathering place for folks near us because we have near low income houss and some little mobile home tradeer parks and things and be a place for folks to town stay warm and or stay cool and get water and those kind of things. Not this program. It another we have a couple of questions from folks participating virtually want to make sure we too. So we've got a question on resources to help rural counties plan so they can participate in these programs. I know something that we've talked about is potential technical assistance and we've also corafd a number of written documents that will be available like guance but any additional thoughts on that? My understanding is that this does not provide planning funds construction grants. Emily know otherwise it my understanding that it really is construction projects plus a piece around workacece and so planning that's another thing that we can do through the CRA program. We've got play funds which also build this session that passes fundsies for planning. So there are resources heading in that direction. But again not could this program and then a follow on on vacup power. Would programs for any custom or own backup generators be eligible? And I think we've covered this some of the previous questions. Yeah um customer own resources know this program. The only eligible applicants are electric utility. Can you speak to, you know you're seeking our feedback. You know what jumps out at you from this list? How are younna use this input from this open house? Because you've already submitted your application and presumably so are you just trying to get some of the fine details or are you trying to rank based on our comments what you're going to say is the highest use of these types of projects. You're going to say, you know, for example, Douglas lights, you know, reconductoring. So we should move that up on the list in terms of the projects to be funded or how are we going to use this open house information that you're gather? I guess, yeah. So we're starting with these sort of broad discussions to get an idea of the types of projects that we're going to see and we'll actually talk about some specific projects in a couple of slides. And we want to focus that as we go through today so that in another hour or less we're actually creating a list of selection criteria with the weight for how the competitive review process has been go in this program. So that's what we want to build today is the competitive selection criteria. Get a hierarchy for how that looks. We've got some proposed broad categories for those criteria that we'll look at and talk about. But really right now is our blank page for criteria. And that's where we're going with all of this, is to establish that competitive review process. So, Rob, can you. I'm terrible ma here. So can you level me here? So we have, as I understand it, we have $9 million. Right. Year 119 million dollars. The year one is right now 9.9. We get both years in the first. Okay, but years. All right, so hear me out.

        "text": " storage or wind? Based out of kansas city of missouri U operating in 33, excuse 33 states across the US U Saion is a portfolio company of and wholly owned by Shell Energy. Savion effectively functions as shells renewables arm in the United States. So while we are owned by shell, we do operate as our own entity. And the benefit there is that we get to utilize any sort of connections or existing structure shell may have in re nobles energy, et cetera, while still, you know, pursuing our own development efforts on their behalf. And next slide, please. So just to give an overview of our U, you know, sort of experience in the, in the industry. I know that's a lot of numbers up there, but over on the left, we have, you know, about 2.5 to upwards of three U gigawatts of projects that are contracted. So you don't have a contract to Ce selll energy under construction or in operation. We are also developed a significant solar and energy development portfolios U again, across 27 states. So one thing I will mention is that, you know, Savion is a new e entry to the Pacific Northwest. That being said, I feel like at this point, we have a very good foothold in U, you know, Oregon, Washington, even Idaho. And Shell as a company has a significant investment in Washington. So we at Savvion, we have a local team here across the, the western seaboard, and Shell has a pretty significant presence in Washington with a trading desk and other other teams based out of Spokane. And because of that investment in the Pacific Northwest, particularly within BPA, which this project is interconnecting into, there's been a lot of ways that, you know, I guess all that is to say is that, you know, we have a vested interest in succeeding in this part of the country and are very much here. Here to stay. And next slide, please. So that's a bit about savvion, and so I just wanted to give you an overview of the project. I know that Kate already went through this, so I'll just try to, you know, walk through this quickly. So we are 800 solar pb that is going to be developed and constructed in phases. So divided into half. So two, think of it as 2400 megawatt projects divided up phases. This may include up to 800 battery energy storage. That number is yet to be fully determined, as EPA does provide us some flexibility there. But at most it would be a one to one ratio of solar panels to battery storage, as I mentioned, that it's on the BPO excuse, the BPA system. So v allows us to choose two pois, or point of interconnections. Our first is along the bucket grizzly 500 kv line number two, which is directly adjacent to the project. We would effectively be what's called tapping the line. So, constructing a new substation on site and having our point of interconnection be on site with the project. The other option we are exploring is running about a four a half mile gentili north into Buckley substation in Sherman County. U. This is something that is not yet. It is something we're looking at. It's something that we're doing our diligence on. It's not something we fully yet secured. So we'll continue to look at this as an option. But for now, we do have an initial point of interconnection secured at the project site, and then quickly, just on permitting and site control. So, site control being u, you know, the land that we have under control, we have the full amount of land, 8075 acres there about, and our interconnection secured. And this past summer, we completed all of our field surveys and studies in preparation for the F pering process. So just a way quickly touch on project milestones, our timeline, some basic stats. So, at 800 mw, we are looking to power 182,000 homes with renewable energy, 8075 acres, all in Wasto county. The expected life of this solar project is 40 years of operation. And at a product of this size, we expect a capital investment of a billion or more by the developer, by ourselves. So we were able to get all of our land under control earlier this year, and field studies wrapped up at the end of fall. And as all you know, the reason we're sitting here, our notice intent was issued at the beginning of October. So that kicked off the ext permitting process, the ASC, or the application for site certificate. That's really, as Kate mentioned, that is the full site permitting application, and we're aiming to have that done by the end of January next year, hopefully sooner, but there's a lot of information to gather there. So that is about a two year process.",

        "text": "Hi, and welcome to this video series with the Community Renewable Energy grant program. My name is Jason Knanaaus. I'm a program analyst in what we call the C rep program. And hello. My name is Clay Ecker. I'm also a program analyst with the C Rep program. Thank you. Clay and I put together this series. This is to cover the key application sections and questions. We're not going to be going through every single one, just the kind of the key questions on the application for both planning and construction grants in the video series for each. And this is more focused on what you'll find under the competitive review scoring criteria in your particular opportunity announcement. But first, what we wanna do is just kind of do a brief overview of the C rep program, and we'll go ahead and just jump right in. House Bill 2021 established the C Rep program, and its intent was to offset costs of planning a developing community renewable energy projects, to support projects and traditionally underserved communities throughout the state, as well as to promote small scale community renewable energy projects and provide direct benefits to communities across Oregon by improving energy resilience, creating local jobs, promoting economic development, and reducing local energy costs. And next, I'm going to let Clay talk about the program's budget priorities. Okay. The legislature gave us two main budget priorities in the CP program. At least half of the funding must go to projects that have a reliance aspect under the program definition and rules. And we'll cover this in details later in the presentation. And the second priority is that at least half the funding must go to projects that primarily serve members of environmental justice communities. And we'll get into those details as well as we go through the presentation. All right, thank you, Clay. And you'll see this particular graphic published on our website. This is a breakdown of our particular programs and the maximum grant award for those programs, as well as the maximum eligible cost percentage for the reimbursement of a particular program. I just wanted to pay one particular note to a construction project that is a renewable energy only. That is still the maximum grant award could be up to a million dollars for that project, but only 50% of those eligible costs up to the $1 million. And additionally a couple of really important program notes, and that's that grants will be awarded on a competitive basis and will include performance agreements and time limits for, for both starting a project and completing a project. And that's within both the planning grants and within the construction grants, and then that competitive review basis. We will get into more details in the next video about the importance of that competitive review process as it relates to you and your application. Another item that we really wanna point out at the front end here is that grant funding, if awarded, grant funding is paid to the grantee or the applicant and may include up to 30% advance, with the rest reimbursed to grantee after the project is complete and the final report has been approved. On construction projects that would also include a site inspection, the grant may cover eligible costs incurred by the applicant, as shown via paid invoices as part of the final report. And Department of Energy payments are made to grantees only. So grantees should follow their own procurement and finance policies when working with any partners. And next up, I'm gonna go back over to Clay. He's gonna talk about some of our program definitions that are very important to pay attention to. Okay, I've got a sample definition up for our main definition of a community renewable energy project. And this is right out of the House bill, 2021. I put this one up. I'm not gonna read it. I'm just gonna point it out as all of our projects need to fit into this definition. And this also includes those projects that have a resilience component. And then we have more detailed definitions for the resilience components, which we'll get into next a little bit. So here we have what community energy resilience is in general, and then what a community energy resilience project is. The summary of that is that the systems must provide power in a grid outage, and the system must support critical public services to the community, must support facilities essential to the public welfare. And so, as you can see, CRP has very specific definitions. And I want to take this as a reminder that you go through and you read the Oregon administrative rules for this project. The links are on our website. You can go back even and read the whole section. There's only like three sections in the bill that covers the CRP program. Read those, and you'll see how all of them are related and condensed into the opportunity announcements. And so, knowing the definitions is key to having an eligible and competitive application. So that you aren't speaking to some generic industry definition, but you've actually dialed in to these program definitions. Excellent. Thank you, Clay. And you'll find during the course of these video presentations on either either",

        "text": " 25 34. So m should t have ve douted myself, but this particular bill relates to a biennial energy report recommendation. As you know, the Oregon Department of, of Energy puts out a robust report on the state of energy, and we put that out last November, and it included a recommendation for a statewide energy strategy. Washington had just gone through this process, and some of the folks listening on the line, if I remember correctly, chair rails, familiar with that process, just happened a year or two ago and was kind of fresh on the mind of many people around the state. And so advocates had, meanwhile, kind of unrelated to our biennial energy report, worked with legislators to introduce a bill this session that would have Oregon create that statewide energy strategy. The idea, really, the way that I think about it, is to put together all the various policies that we have around energy. The data that we have, the information we've already put together, kind of put it all together. I imagine it like a puzzle. And you put the puzzle together and then you can see where there are gaps. You can see where there are issues that need to be resolved. You can also see where puzzle pieces overlap, and maybe that's not the most efficient. So really getting the right people together to have that conversation and figure out big picture, where are we going? How are we going to get there? And there's been a lot of work that's relevant to that. So it's not starting from scratch. Everything from utility irps, integrated. Oh, I'm having a moment. Thank you. I was going with research. The word research wouldn't get out of my brain, but anyway, so we don't have to start from scratch with the research because we have the integrated resource plans already from some of our larger utilities, is one example. Have work product that we have. We have a roadmap that's being released next week by the Oregon Global Warming Commission. So we have a lot of that information we need. So it's just putting it together and figuring out where do we go from here. So that bill moved out of committee unanimously and is in ways and means now. It's kind of an interesting one. We think that there's federal funding out there that could fund the work, but that federal funding won't be available till after session. So the legislature will have to make a decision about funding that. So we can move forward with a now or perhaps waiting, doing it later if that timeline works out with federal funds. So we'll see how things go with that bill. Does that help? And, oh, by the way I should add, one of the things that could come from that statewide energy strategy is really a true up of how much energy this electricity, for example, the state needs to meet clean electricity goals and that relates to sing. And that could help to inform conversations about possible changes or needs within sititing or renewable energy development with a more sort of, you might have heard me say earlier, a solution sort of in search of a problem. And so I think it would help us to understand, well, what problem are we trying to solve with work like what you see on this slide here and having a more clear idea of what the needs are for the state would allow for a more informed decision. Thank you. I think this is chair Grail. I think we've heard from the public more than once members citing what they think were the previous governor's goals. And people pull portions of information out of different spaces. So if that we're in one location, that certainly would help our work as well as other agencies, in my opinion. Yes, sure. Grail Cindy Cotton, for the record, thank you for the presentation. I am just curious, given what chair Grail said about, you know, conversations, people saying different things, the testimony that was given by the department, where's, where would we, we be able to see that, you know, you like from a talking point? Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Coun Councilr Condon, Chairric Grail, if you go to, there's a, if you Google Olis that pops up the Oregon legislative information system, and you can make sure you're in 2023. It's really, sometimes it likes to open to different years. And then if you put in House Bill 3179, that's where we, you can look at testimony on that bill. And last I saw, we were kind of the only testimony on it was us and our documents that I mentioned earlier. So you can see those there. We can also send links out, I'm sure, to the council if that works for Secretary Cornet. But how the public accesses that information is on Olis. Yeah. For the record, that was going to be also, it is available on Olus, which is available to anybody. I will also make a note",

Very good. Thank you. We have no second readings. We have no new business. So we will move to our city manager. Thank you, mayor. Good evening, mayor and council. Two items I wanted to share with you all tonight. First, I want to highlight a very important new project on the city's Engage Hillsboro webpage. Our community's biggest engagement project, the Hillsboro 2035 community plan, is ready for an update as we do every five years. With more than 90% of the current action plan already implemented or underway, our community is asked to provide new ideas to make Hillsboro an even better place to live, work, learn, play and visit. We want to hear from the community. Thanks to the 2023 civic Leadership Academy graduates and their support and recommendations. We'll work to engage everyone in part in every part of the community to be a part of this planned update now through September. You can share your big ideas on the Gage Hill, or you can talk to our 2035 team who will be gathering community ideas throughout the community, events, presentations, surveys, discussions and on social media. And finally, I want to congratulate Mayor Callaway on delivering yet another outstanding state of the city address. And thank you to the entire council for participating in the event as well. It was great to see so many youth in attendance, from the YAC members here on the dais to the Hillsboro High School drum line, to the kids in the audience. And if anybody could not make it last week, you can watch the state of the city online on the city website. Thank you, thank you. And also, I'd be remiss, Robbie, not to thank staff. We're here because of audio equipment damage and we had a burst pipe, and yet we were still able to do the state of the city in the Shirley Huffman auditorium. And so thanks to so many people who work behind the scenes to set up food, to set up the equipment, you know, put the PowerPoint together and help with the speech. And so thank you to all this. So with that, we are done with our meeting and just remind our community members who wish to be informed and engaged on city council matters can sign up for happening in Hillsboro newsletter, which comes out on Monday nights before every city council meeting. And the spanish language updates are also available through our Casiendo Muntos email newsletter. So with that, our city council meeting is adjourned and we will go.",

        "text": ". I don't believe there's any limitation of you doing this on a kind, a project by project basis or a time basis. You know, I think that's your call to make. But again, we were sort of following the direction from last time we brought this to council. I guess this is Ken, I guess I was thinking last time that that was maybe an exception to the rule or it seems like that there's a pattern this is going to continue. It's kind of the new standard. So I'm wondering, should it be lim? Are we limiting ourselves so that it's going to make more work for having come back and kind of thing? So I'm just throwing that out there. Yeah, I mean, it could be, we could come back on a yearly basis and reset it and just build it into, you know, every January or every December, you know, and then not be project specific, but we would sort of reset it. You could give us the discretion to decide when we use it, really. I think it's all over the board as to how you want to go. It's more about your comfort level, I think, than ours about this. So our system is designed for us to work with state agencies. They are a reviewing agency. We're required to provide notification. We will continue to do that. It's really your comfort level about our use of a consultant in this, and we don't intend certainly to cut out the state of so preservation office. We would rather rely upon them because that's how it's designated. They just haven't had the capacity, don't currently have the capacity, and for the foreseeable future, don't look like they will have the capacity either to be able to timely review and comment on our projects. Counciler Condon, thanks. Just curious, does the process require the request and the request of the agency before you engage a consultant? Like for, does there have to be an affirmative and we can't do it. Or from Shippo. Does Shippo have to? Not Shippo. The statute kind of related to this essentially says if a reviewing agency is unable to comment within the timeframe, that's required, that they can hire a consultant to conduct the work for them. Doesn't practically work very well, because by the time we send them the notice and then they don't respond, we're already running behind. We've done this in a preemptive way. I think it still meets the purpose, intent of the statute, but it's not, in this case, shipp or parks department doing it. We're doing it on their behalf, with their full knowledge and understanding and agreement, I might add, as well. So, yeah, I think the way the statute is written sort of would do it on a case by case basis, but that practically doesn't work. And I would just offer that the rules require the lead analyst to send review requests, and we would still attempt that coordination. And so this is a backst. And because contracting could take three months, you know, it's just. We're just getting it in place. I think we're going to need it. But if not, because the above ground resources is a different group than archaeology, so it could be a hybrid, and it's. It's insurance if we need it. So, thank you. For the record, this is Marcy Grail. I. I am not a pessimist. However, I'm a realist. And I think anything we can do to not have a built in delay is going to benefit all parties involved. And I'm in favor. I think having it specific is great. And obviously, if you need something different, then someone's going to bring it to the council, and we'll address it at that time. But at minimum, I mean, we just went through this a couple years ago. That seemingly got us to this point. We have that again. So I don't think we should try to build anything hard. I think we should see what occurs. But I think the intent is that we don't allow something that we know we must have to stop progress. Any further comments? Questions? Vice chair, how. Oh, okay. Yes. You're anticipating, please. So if there are none, then this is an action item, and I would ask if anyone is prepared to make a motion. Madam chair, I move that the. Well, let's see that the appro. Well, I move approval of the department's use of consultants for review of exhibit s for the lone pine to Whetstone Cascade renewable transmission line and Muddy Creek energy park projects, as presented and recommended. By staff. Thank you, vice chair, how I hear a second from Councilmeer Devlin and, oh, we modify the list of projects. Okay, so you said, you said Muddy Creek and Lone pine. Did you say cascade renewable. Yes, Whtone. So I think I need to add, I think just summit Ridge wind farm and wheat",

Okay, so moving on to the of this project, we didn't start from. We didn't kind of just throw a dart and just land in where we are today. There's a lot of extensive research that kind of went through this to get to where we are today. We'know that there is a need for generation of electricity west of the Cascades. This projectelf would be able to power approximately 35,000 homes in the valley. We cited it here mainly due to the close proximity of the substation. That means that it's right next to the existing infrastructure. We want to have to build miles, a mile of infrastructure to get there. And it just makes there's capacity already on the substation. So we had it through extensive list of criteria, which I could talk about our process in a little bit. There's definitely need for. And then again, we. So we had to find our landowners to lease us their land in order get here where we are today. So if you don't mind moving to the next slide. So this is kind of like a more type of same thing that our counterparts on the over here have shown us already current is that we are going to start, or I have already started on our environment clin field studies, and that was going to be started in spring and we'll continue. But if you would, your attention to theiting Fe and siting how we got here today. Is that a grid electual grid analysis? We have a set of criteria that we look for when it comes to substation side effects. So we have a bunch of engineers kind of run that for us in whatever state or area that we want to potentially build in. And then they go ahead and give me a list of stations like l sheet. This could be anywhere from 100 or couple thousand. And after that we had to go ahead and for just look for any, whether threatendingred species, wetlands, things of that nature. And then, so we go from a list that's maybe about 2000, and we go downund to maybe five. And then after that we actually do landowner outreach. That is us getting a list of contacts and mailing addresses from the county, doing a lot of mailers, phone calls, and then doing a lot of door knocking. The entire process takes about two years. It could be anywhere from six year or six months to two years. And then at that point, we had to assemble a team. Then we submitted the NOI. So it's been two years in the making to try to get to this point where we are today. But even then, we are still rightite smack dab in the middle or in the beginning of it. At this point. We're doing a lot of community outreach, trying to get to know the community more, see who the key players are, can contact with them, have face to face meetings with them, get some more opinions. But as Todd and Chase have already reiterated, we are at the beginning of this and we're here for public comment and we want to hear your opinions. Sir, when you talk about. Please hold. Please hold your comments. We have a formal q and a plus just to recognize we have a lot of people, or at least some people online. So you're gonna have to come up to the mic when you're ready to comment so people online can hear you as well. So please hold your comments, but we will take all of your comments and questions. Okay, next slide, please. So I was talking about some studies that we didn'need. To do. This is a list of the field studies that we to do physically on the land. Some of them started earlier this spring. Some of them will start in a few weeks or just in the summer. And these are expected to be done by the end of this summer. Next slide, please. So this here is the study area boundaries. Todd and Chase had one similar, but just to reiterate that our field studies were kind of focused more so on the black outlines. But outside of that immediate area, there are more things that we need to study through desktop. This is a lot of historical review, and it ranges anywhere from half a mile to 20 miles outside of where the proposed project would be. Next slide, please. Here'some of the stakeholders that we've already started outreach or have already contacted a few of them to note would be Lynn county itself, as well as the tribes. And I did want to emphasize that we have met with ODFW. We have been talking to them about the methodologies prior to the start of our environmental studies. We're going to continue coordinating with them throughout this time process, including for the review of the results, mitig",

These are the announcements that I'll share with you for the upcoming, of course, today, this meeting at 09:00 a.m. and then on June 11, we have a 01:30 p.m. public hearing for the adoption of the resolution for Deer Path North Municipal Service benefit unit for general maintenance and capital improvements. Immediately following that public hearing will be the second public hearing of the day for the adoption of the resolution for freedom crossings preserve phase one and phase two, municipal service benefit unit for general maintenance and capital improvements. The third public hearing immediately following on that same day, June 11, for the adoption of the resolution for Greystone Hills, phase one and phase two municipal service benefit unit for general maintenance and capital improvements. On June 18, we will have our second county commission meeting of the month, which is on the third Tuesday of every month, again here in this auditorium at 150. On June 18, we will convene a meeting of the Marion County Community Redevelopment Area Board, and then at 02:00 p.m. on June 18, we will hold our zoning portion of the county commission meeting that takes place on the third Tuesday of every month. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is our announcements for today. I'll move us on into the first item of business is proclamations and presentations. So move. Second motion by Commissioner Bryant, second by Commissioner Zalick. All in favor, signify with aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. The very first one is presentation of our recognizing the 2024 Citizens Academy graduation class. So, commissioners, if you would like to. Well, Bobbie, do you want to take the microphone for a moment and give us our presentation? And then we will congratulate those when you tell us to come around. Yes, ma'am. Bobby Perez, Marion county public relations director. Today I'm here and happy to present to you the 2024 graduating class of the Marion County Citizens Academy, marking our 14th class here in Marion county. But before we get started, if we could take a moment to watch a short highlight video. Sadeena, as you can see in the video, our 18 participants had quite the experience learning about county budget, how each department operates, and the tools used to get the job done, all while getting to know the men and women of Marion county. Taking place over the span of three months, the Marion County Citizens Academy teaches Marion county residents how their local government operates. For Marion county, the academy is an invaluable tool for highlighting the work that governmental employees do on a daily basis. The academy is a means to show our citizens how their taxpayer dollars are put to work and how we improve the lives of residents and visitors in Marion county. While public facing departments such as parks and recreation or the Ocala, Marion county visitors and Convention Bureau may be familiar in the eyes of a citizen, people may not know exactly what other departments are, such as the MSTU, municipal service taxing unit, our 911 management, or a facilities management team, and what they do on an average day. Now, if you come around the front,",

        "text": "ame from plan to construction has just now been put into the legal system and, you know, drawn out. So where does your benefit go to? You know, you need it, but we're letting everybody come in and, you know, stop it. Well, isn't the public good factor come in as a waiver as to getting something implemented? I don't care if it's coming through your neighborhood or not. That's called eminent domain on it, you know, but there's processes really under. For years. Tom Thomas asked a question, listening to the comment about permit timing, will there be a time period for when to spend the money from Odo on a project? I only ask because sometimes federal permits like in forest lands for underground and can take a year plus. Emily, we'll pivot over to you for a response on this. Thanks, guys. Yeah, absolutely. So at the point in time when we have our negotiations with the Department of Energy finalized, whenever that might be, and we have our finalized award, our period of performance is going to be initially five years. And once we get to, you know, running our sub granting process, we'll be looking at probably about a four year project period initially. And although we have mentioned that there are allocations that will, you know, further this funding and so we could get extensions on that initial timeline and it could be up to ten years, but the initial period of performance we're looking at will probably be around four years. So, Andy Fleter, Point Bas Electric. Again, another question along those lines, but then the next step on that is going to end up being. And I, I realize I'm jumping way ahead here is the reporting criteria that ends up happening. And I'm sure you've heard numerous comments across the board that it's not just the application process. We u we have 16 total employees U and, and the burden of not only the application process is internal, the reporting is also internal and that's just adding to the job responsibilities on that side. So the only request I've ended up making it the countless meetings and it doesn't matter if it's from Rod ban grants is, is the reporting requirements. We have to hold people accountable. There's no doubt about that. If you have the grant, you need to be held accountical for what you're doing. The depth and breadth of that though can be burome to the point of debilitating where you don't want the award or you don't want award because then you're spending all of their trying report. Yeah. Or having to review and go through steps. Yes. Okay. I'll give you an example. We power Empise got aw wor era award. Okay. This was six, seven years ago or so or maybe even. But the reporting requirements, you know, is based on the agent that you get at the agency also, you know, and they can make your life, you know, rather unpleasant as to requirements and detail and, you know, on stuff that is like a no brainer as to the expenditure that you had, you know. So I do understand that in that involved a law of my time which is also needed for a lot of other things. And up here we have a staff of threee. So yeah, we are going to try to one build all of those reporting requirements very transparently into these performance agreements with our subardees or the grantees. We have a couple of really excellent grant, federal grant staff in our office right now. And we are going to really strive to streamline all the strings attached to this money and hopefully come up with ways to minimize the burden of that reporting. Maybe we can create templates that are easy to fill out. And, you know, one of the things with these federal dollars is when you get the award, there's a certain expectation for what you're going to be doing with it and it's checking the boxes and if you go off the rails in any way, it can raise these flags and it just, everything go grinding to a halt. So we're going to work to help with that reporting side of it with our agency and we'll have our growing pain certainly as we go. But we're going to try to fill it into our contrasts and help with that as much as we can because I hear you be real. One of the major ones for reservations is the Davis Bacon milut. And the reason why I bring that out is because usually reservations do not like unions. Okay. So the labor force on reservations aren't union. And so then when you're trying to help a a remember the justice 40 area, you know, well are you excluding them from the workforc? Because then you're. Because that's aimed at unions. Okay, so now you say, well you don't have to belong to the union to get paid. Well that's correct. But now you still have the reporting requirements as see the weekly payroll and blah, blah, blah. And then having to look at the wage for your",

        "text": " could do another microgrid, maybe at our airport in associ with a solar. A solar fire out there and then. Because we know that in the event of the Cascadia, our airport could become really a critical asset that we need to keep up with running. Yep, exactly. That's exactly right. So then it has a resiliency aspect, it has an economic aspect. So it's like multiple benefits to the entire community. Great. I guess my last question, if I could, is one of the challenges as we kind of wrestle with this is the difference between net metering and selling power back to pg for a facility. So, for example, you know, at the airport we could put in some solar, it would be net metered and that would reduce the airport's overall cost for their electricity. But we're not then contributing to the overall grid. That's truly just a reduction to sale and it's not a community wide benefit. Whereas a larger facility that would sell directly to PG, it would't be a net metering operation. That's right. And there are, there are statutory limits on how big a net metering facility can be that significantly reduce the. That might be regulatory requirements. I d have to check. But either way, there are limitations on how big a that being facility can be and sort of how that can serve to offset any particular facilities usage. And I think that could potentially be part of the solution, but it by itself can't be. Full disclosure, some of you may have seen in some media coverage that we have been talking about changes to our net metering program. That work is also in my shop. And sort of pause for the moment. I just want to flag that because that just came up and I don't want to not mention it. As a current net metering customer with solar panels on my roof, I definitely am paying attention to that. Well, good. Well, mayor, I can guarantee you that whatever we do will not change the deal you have right now. We are not looking at making retrospective changes at all. Great. Good to know. Thank you. I want to make sure everybody has a chance to get all of their questions answered, whether it's committee members or staff. So if anybody has questions, please now the time, because I think this is a really important kind of foundational conversation on whether we're even going to go down this road. That's why we asked PGE to be here, just to kind of get, make sure our understanding level of this program is established so we can even talk about whether or not we want to have this conversation, because that'it's, certainly something we've been talking, a few of us have been talking with Wendy about, but it's fairly complex and so now is a great time to get those questions answered. Have. So I want to check in online with Counor Phillips or Councilor Gonzalez. Make sure that you're having an opportunity. Questions. Thank you, mayor. And definitely a lot to take in. Great information, but no questions. Thank you, counselor. Councilor Philips, are you good? I mean, I probably have questions. I just may not be able to phrase them right now. I mean, I guess, like, what I'm looking for is like a sense of scale in comparison to the goals that we as the city of Salem have as set as our aspirational targets in terms of reducing the carbon emissions that we're doing and what is needed to actually move the needle. So, like getting a sense of perspective. And then broadly speaking, my question would be like, what are the deadlines? I mean, I think what I'm hearing, I'll paraphrase what I think I'm hearing is that this is an opportunity to partner with our local stakeholder in providing energy to go above and beyond what PG is already going to do. They've got their own targets that are set by the state of Oregon, but we can now go above and beyond. So just like a sense of scale and then a sense of, like, are there deadlines? Like, when do we need to make this decision? Ye, thank you, counor that, and I would just add on to that kind of compound that question a little bit because I'm curious about this kind of conversation about scalability or compounding. Like, if we start small, what does that look like to build? You know, if we enter into like maybe just a very small, discrete program to begin with, what does that look like? If this proves to be popular or whatever, how do we scale that up? So I'm curious. We can hear from PGE about what the councilselor asking. Maybe also my question on top of those are really great questions. I'll go with Counselor Phillips questions first, and then I'll go to your question, mayor. So to answer your question very directly, Counselor Phillips, there is no deadline. You know, we're building a program that can",

And now the council secretary report. Secretary Cornet. Thank you, Madam vice chair. So, first, starting with counciler updates. So at the last council meeting, I had reported that counciler Chalkt too's first term ended on March 15 of this year and that he had requested to serve a second term. Unfortunately, it was my mistake. His term actually ends March 15 of 2025. So I had incorrectly had his information in my tracking tool. And so he doesn't come up for reappointment until next year. On the positive side, he's already put his information in executive appointment, said he doesn't need to redo it, so he's all set for next year. So while it was an. An unfortunate mistake, didn't have really any, you know, time ramifications. So just a question on that because it was in the minutes. No, this will serve as. This will correct the. I mean, the minutes reflect what the minutes wereutely're unfortunately incorrect, but now we'll have it on the minutes. That. That's. That's why I wanted to put it on this minutes, these meeting minutes to correct that. Okay, thank you. On to project updates. As I had reported at the last meeting, we received the notice of intent for the Summit Ridge renewable energy facility in northeastern Wasco county. This would be a 201 megawatt wind, solar, and battery storage facility. Public notice was issued on March 14, and a public comment period is open until May 3. We will be holding a public informational meeting on the project on April 3 at the Dooer K through twelve school gymnasium starting at 05:00",

A member of our planning commission. So he is joining us now as a full member. Uh, it's. We have time for public comment. No. Hi. Thank you, mister mayor. My name is Phil Carver for 350 Salem. And, um, and I thank you for the opportunity to make a public comment. Um, we're pleased with many aspects of the climate action plan u PGE and the progress on renewable electricity. And the agenda item. I won't go into detail, but we're concerned that u this committee is not the right structure for doing the detailed analysis for meeting the goals. There needs to be a assessment of the, the GHG reduction potential, which did not get really a good analytical analysis and original climate action plan. And for the three sectors, the electricity sectors aren't on track, um, even without the community program. But that would accelerate it. Transportation is going to be a big challenge, but the natural gas sector really remains unanalyzed in terms of the ability to meet the greenhouse gas pols. So we would, we really appreciate Michael Slater being added to this committee, but we believe that in the summer, a commissionike the planning commission with his citizen, with citizens to take the time to really dig into the analytics of meeting the goals. Thank you. Thank you. Any other public comment? No. Okay, on to item three. Approval of the 3623 meeting minutes. Approval of the minutes. Second I absostain. Well, we'll just put those up to next time, then. Oh, sure. Since we don't have enough votes, all. It's fine. And then on to item number four. Portland General Electric clean energy plan and communityard renewals. Good morning, Wendy. Thank you again for joining. And I have your slide deck. So whenever you're ready? I can go ahead and get started. Thank you so much, Heather. Thank you. Mayor and climate action Committee, city councilors, a new member. Michael, really happy to be here today and give you a little more information about the recently file integrative resource plan and clean energy plan. And so I'm going to get through it through the slide deck. Feel free to ask questions. There's a lot of information, but we'll get through it. So the second slide, Heather, would be great. Can you hear us? All right. Okay, perfect. Second slide. Wendy, can you hear us? All right. Yes. Can you hear me? Yes. Perfect. Okay, hold on a second. There's this weird thing that's happening for me right now. Okay, there we go. So that's a little bit about PGE. For those of you who don't know about Portland General Electric, we have been around for over 130 years and what this slide doesn't. And we have 16 generation facilities across Oregon and Washington and Montana. What this slide doesn't share is that about 46% of Oregon's population lives within our service territory. And for those of you who are unaware, in Oregon, electric utilities have designated service areas. So we do not compete with each other. And we cover about 51 cities. 75% of Orgo organ's commercial and industrial activity occurs in our service area. Next slide, please. I'm going to go through some information. And at PGE, we like acronyms, but I thought I would just take this slide to walk through it with you so that it gives us all the same foundation to work from as I go through the slide deck. So we recently filed our integrated resource plan and our first clean energy plan on March 31. A little bit about the difference. Our integrated resource plan basically forecasts our system energy and capacity needs. It's giving it a long term view on how we're going to meet our customers energy needs. It also provides, in addition to that, our integrated resource",

So it basically says, like, we'll still give you an incentive, like a rebate incentive in addition to your tax credit, but, like, you're going to get more than you were going to get before from a different place. So kind of leveling that out. And then the other piece is that we want the incentive to last longer, to go further. And so if we're continuing to incentivize at the same level, despite the federal tax credit adding to someone's, you know, off the bill in the end, that's called it a coupon overall, like how much different they'd pay with the combination of the rebate and tax credit kind of went from this to this. So if we kind of ramp it back down and keep it, keep it more in line, about the same benefit, we can then give more people rebates overall. O nice. Yeah. I knew there was more to it than that simple, simplified link that I came up with. Thank you. That was exactly the answer. Oh, sorry for adding another question. This is actually not related. So you could just say pass or no comment. But I was wondering, can people after this program do. Are people allowed to sell electricity back to. Oh, shoot. This is Oregon Department of Energy, but here in Eugene, I'm serviced by eweb. Is there any more, or maybe I should ask broadly, does anyone sell electricity back to their public utility? Yeah, most people that have solar are producing that solar, and through what's called net metering, that power kind of goes back and then you get a discount on your bill o. Nice. Cool, thanks. I will. You can google net readering. It's kind of complicated to explainah, but then you can learn about it through, like, a video that somebody made to help you understand versus me doing a bad job of it. And you call it net metering. Is that what it is? S right. Okay, cool. Thank you so much. Yeah, no problem. All right, so next up was Lara, or Lara. We will see. You're off mute, administrator. I submit the rebate applications. I work with Dale and Katie on a weekly basis. All right, and thank you for this opportunity to share some feedback and our experience with this program since it's begun. What I first want to say is that Andr would support increasing the number of reservations per contractor, but only if we reduce the rebate rate. So what we really want to emphasize here is that we fully support reducing the non income restricted residential rate for both solar and storage. And since the beginning of the program, ANR has expressed that the non LMI rate is unnecessarily large and wasteful. Since 2020, we have experienced stressful cliff events and significant uncertainty regarding what expectations to set with potential customers. And this has led to some Oregonians to not move forward with solar. So we find this policy hampers with the state's ability to meet climate targets and our ability as a contractor to train and develop a workforce that is ready to tackle the energy transition. So reducing the incentive rate and cap is the single most effective way of achieving the department's stated goals and expanding access to more Oregonians and increasing the life and stability of the incentive program. We call this a cost effective approach, and it provides the biggest bang for the state's buck, effectively doubling the number of non LMI customers who can actually use this program, doubling the amount of clean energy deployed, doubling the amount of CO2 offset, and creating more jobs. So we don't. We just want to make that clear that we fully support reducing the non income restricted residential rate. Thank you. Thank you so much. I feel like you just added the answer to Frankie's question, too. Thank you. All right, I don't see any other hands up. I answered a question in the chat. No changes to the LMI rate. At this point, we are applying for a federal competitive grant that could have us revisit that conversation in the not too distant future. So stay tuned on that. And then I was just writing in the chat, but to Matthew's question, we'll post the slides, and we'll also post a record copy of this recording on our website, right where you were looking after this meeting today. Thank you. All right. I don't see any other hands or comments other than the ones I've just addressed. You can go on to our next slide. And essentially, this is more of, like, an open time. So while we asked you to specifically comment on some of the changes we're already thinking about, there's something that didn't come up. Or if you have general questions, this is a chance to ask those. So feel free to raise your hands, say something in the chat, and then you'll see some of the",

And we've had a clarification with council member condom, just to be clear what she was asking. And vice chair Hal has identified that I indee did chair the meeting, not him. Are there any other themes related to the minutes? And I'm going to keep trying to look up with the screen, but if anybody that sees our peers wishing to speak, like, throw something at me. Okay? Sure, girl. Yes, sir. So moved than. We have a motion to approve the minutes of January 26, 2024. With the changes that have been identified. May the second motion. Thank you, member Byer. We have a motion a second. Any additional comments hearing that, mister secretary, please call the rol. And madam Chair, just for normally I mix and match the order of the votes. Just make sure there's variation. But today, since we have this issue, what I'll do is call everybody else first and then council members Chute and Devlin, happy end. And I will look to you so you can unateat them so we'll minimize the amount of feedback. And out and buyer Katie is. I'll recuse myself. Cindy Condon. Yes. Marcy Grail. Yes. Richard Devid. Yes. Okay, thank you, Councilman Devil and Grer. I able to hear you. Perry Choc to. Yes, thank you, Counciler Chocku. We were able to hear you as well. Motion carry chair. Thank you that appreciate everyone's involvement on that. And with that, we will now look to mister secretary for his council secretary report for Geor Scott. Madam chair. First are councilme member updates. So, Katie, I was confirmed by the Senate on February 9 and her first term of the energy Facility Society Council officially started on February 16. So welcome, council member, as on behalf of the staff, we thank you for volunteering your time. What we do is incredibly important and your role is at the decision making side of that is incredibly important as well. So welcome. Thank you, Todd. I appreciate that. Chair, vice chair, members of the council, I just want to take this opportunity to my, okay, this opportunity to say I'm very excited to be here and I look forward to serving alongside you and I understand I have a lot to learn and, but I look forward. It's been a very welcoming onboarding. Everybody's been very gracious and so just appreciate that and leave with that. Thank you. Thank you and welcome. And we look forward to working with you also. Counciler updates Counciler Choct too'first term end on March 15 of this year, councilor of Chocu has submitted request to the governor's office for reappointment. So moving forward on that process, as you know, you know it ultimately result. The legislative process has to go in front of the Senate rules committee and be voted on by the full Senate for confirmations outside of a legislative session. They schedule those at varying times. We believe the next legislative days would be in April. That and thank you, Counciler Chaku, for your continuing service and your willingness to continue into a second term. So we very much appreciate, yes, on behalf, this is chair br on behalf of all of us, we appreciate it and you bring a unique perspective to us and we are glad that you're staying on. Thank you. Okay'going. Move on to project updates. First is the summit Ridge Wind farm. So this project is an approved wind energy generation facilities located in northeastern Moco county. It's been approved for 72 wind turbines with a peak generating capacity of 194 mw. It was originally approved in 2011. Since then there have been five approved amendments and there is the 6th, which is currently under review. These amendments have related to varying things, including change of ownership, time extension, beginning, ending construction, time extension requests, as well as the current one, which is proposing to add solar pv and battery storage to the project as well. The project has been appealed in a couple of different ways by the Friends of the Columbia River Gorge to the circuit court. Those have been going on for some time and those relate to the denial on test a case on one of the amendments as well as sort of the status, whether the status project is actually active or not active. So on February 14, we received request to decommission the facility, terminate the say certificate, as well as withdraw amendment number six. So the decommitioning request requires a notice and a public comment period. We have not yet sent out that notice to the public establishing a public comment period. So that will be in front of you.

        "text": " thing that I'll flag is that we'll use both chat and raised hands during the q and a part. Either one is fine, whatever is more comfortable for you. So, with that, I'm going to hand things over to Rob Del Mar and James Kogl, who are the certified smart people when it comes to this new program. Rob, you feeling ready? Yep. Sorry for the slow joint. I had a login problem, but I'm ready. Great. Well, it's nice to see you. Likewise. All right, so thank you, Christy. And House Bill 2021, also known as the 100% Clean Energy for all bill establish the new Community Renewable Energy grant program. And the purpose of the program is to offset costs of planning and developing community renewable energy projects. And those are projects up to 20 mw in capacity to support projects in traditionally underserved communities, to promote small scale community renewable energy projects and provide direct benefits to communities across Oregon by improving energy resilience, creating local jobs, promoting economic development, and offsetting local energy costs. Next slide, please. One of the features that distinguishes this program from previous programs in Oregon is that it's only open to public bodies, and eligible applicants include tribes, cities, counties, other public bodies, and consumer owned utilities. And the consumer owned utilities are specifically called out. Within the statute, the bill excludes cities, over 500,000, which in Oregon, of course, includes only Portland. And this was done in recognition of the Portland Clean Energy Fund, which can provide funding for similar projects in Portland. Next slide, please. Another feature of the program is the focus on community energy resilience, and the bill establishes carve outs where 50% or more of the funding must go to community energy resilience projects, and 50% or more of the funding must be for projects that serve qualifying communities. And we'll see more about what qualifying communities means on the next slide. Next slide, please. So, qualifying communities are defined in the bill, and they include communities of color, low income communities, tribal, rural, and coastal communities, and other traditionally underrepresented communities in Oregon. Next slide, please. The bill called for an advisory committee to work with the Department of Energy on Program Design and now program implementation. The committee was instrumental in kind of sharing on ground experience with project development. And this is a list of the committee members. All through the fall, they were helping us with the ruleaking, and now they're gonna be helping us with outreach. And we had central Lincoln pud helping us, Gail Malcolm, representing consumer owned utilities on the committee, and she was a very vocal and helpful member of the group. Next slide, please. So, since the passage of House Bill 2021, we've been very busy standing up the new program. In the summer of 2021, OO staff were assigned to the project and developed an implementation plan, including operational staffing, and it changes within the agency. In September, we recruited a stakeholder advisory group, which we just saw to help guide the program design and support development of program rules. And that effort resulted in draft rules being posted with Secretary of state's office on January 1. And those rules are now final. And the opportunity announcements for the program announcing the grants came out on March 7. Next slide, please. So before we move on to the specific grant opportunities, I'd like to walk through a project that the Eugene Water and Electric Board completed a few years ago. The city of Eugene, like much of western Oregon, could be subject to significant damage from a Cascadia earthquake. And as a utility that manages both electricity and water services, EWEB recognize the importance of energy to water delivery and was well positioned to support resilience and disaster recovery within Eugene. Next slide please. EWEB considered community energy resilience based on the rule of threes and that was in the first three days provide access to drinking water and this is the first three days following a natural disaster. In the first three weeks, repower critical facilities and in the first three months complete system repairs and restore regular water and electric service. Next slide please. As a result of their planning efforts, EWEB developed the grid edge demonstration project. The project utilized an existing 50 kilowatt pv system on the roof of the Howard Elementary School and added a battery energy storage system and a new potable water well to the site. Next slide the result is a facility that can serve as a potable water fill station for the community in the event of a power outage. The school building is also provided with backup power and serves as an emergency shelter. The system provides value to the community in addition to the value of the water and energy resilience features. The school benefits from energy bill savings and EEB is able to use the batteries to provide grid services during regular day to day operations. Next slide this is a schematic diagram of how the microgrid system is put together,",

        "text": " time, something like this for the first time. So, yeah, just underlining and putting an exclamation point next to these projects are going toa need a lot of flexibility in the planning process, most everything is feasible if you have persistence, but it will take time. Thanks, Laurie. Do we have anyone else? It looks like Ray might have his hand up again. Sorry. Yeah, I read in there, in the document some language regarding Odoe's ability to recover the grant funds in some circumstances, and I wonder if you can expand a little bit on what those types of circumstances might be. And I can think of an example where a project, a small project, goes through the planning phase and all of the. And the grant money is awarded only to start going into construction, and then something happens that is completely out of control of the project that essentially makes the project non financially viable or whatever, and the project is canceled before it gets constructed. And so if money's already been spent, how is the entity, the applicant expected to then refund those monies back to Ode? I'm just trying to understand how this would work. Thank you. I'm happy to take this one. If no one else wants to jump in, the clawback provision will be related to the requirements set out in the performance agreement. And so your example of a planning grant, so long as the planning that was proposed is completed, there would be no clawback of funds, even if the planning determines that the project is not feasible. And if that project is feasible and they move into construction, that is a whole new round of potential funding. They could come back to the program for a construction grant, in which case, if the project was not completed, the construction grant would not be paid, or if there were prepayments that could be clawed back. But there would be no clawback of planning funds related to the construction of a project. There are for the planning components only, and that'll be reflected in the performance agreement. And they'll be different potentially for each project because the performance agreement will be based on essentially what is laid out in the application as the intention for the project. Thank you. Thanks, Ray. Do you have any additional comments or anyone who would like to offer comments before we wrap it up? We're almost at an hour, so we're again, very thankful for everybody who's joined with us today. I'm going to go ahead and put in the chat the information to. We have two more people that just raised their. But I'll put up some information for people to submit written comments, too. Jou by Friday. U Ryan S. If you are off mute, this is Ryan Ky. Go ahead, Rian, but we can hear you. Okay. I. I just want. I read the rules, and I didn't see this anywhere in there, but I just thought I'd make a comment. I don't see if there's any restriction on project developer starting to use its own monies to purchase equipment or even begin constructing a project even before a potential incentive is awarded. But I just bring it up because the REAP grant program has that catch to it where you can't even start on your project while you have an application in or you can't use the funding for that. And I think that just given the timelines and, you know, like right now, a transformer is a 50 week lead time. I've just, just to state that I think that if a project wants to start spending money and they're hoping for an incentive, but if they get it later, there wouldn't be any restrictions on the use of that fund because they started building the project early, it'd be nice to make sure that that's safe for them to do. Does anyone know the answer to that? I've never heard us about that prohibition on starting the project, so I don't think we have that. Okay, thanks. Because a lot of us would be, you know, that have shovel ready projects or pulling all the finances together and the grant or the incentive from a program like this would be super helpful, but we may still try to build the project anyway and just we'd want to get going on that. So thank you. I don't know if Wendy has thoughts on that for specific rule language, but Wendy, do you have any comments before? I have one thought about it that I wanted to share, but. Well, I think that certainly I d need to look a little bit more detail at the bill with this question in mind just to see what it says. I know just having worked a little bit with some of the USDA reap funding, and I know that various programs with certainly USDA and others have their own requirements on this question, so we'll look at that pretty closely. Ryan, thanks for bringing up the issue. So I think Rob may have some experience with some previous Odo programs, such as the red grants, and I don't know if that will inform part of",

        "text": " be of value for increasing energy diversity, reliability and resilience of the state and regional power grid flag. The due dates for that are also similar to our state energy strategy, which, which I'll talk about on the next slide. So next slide. You remember that September 1 deadline of next year. So our state energy strategy deadline is also similar. So I think the thought would be for these two processes to inform each other as best they can to the extent they can. And so this is our snapshot slide on the state energy strategy, which most people probably have heard a little bit about. So in 2023, the legislature passed House Bill 3630 that gave us this authority. So a year before the recent offshore wind road mapping bill passed. This passed, and this is kind of like simple way to think of it, is just all the energy technologies, you know, and I maybe use the word roadmap, even though it's called a strategy, kind of a similar tact. Basically, we are charged with leading an engagement input gathering process with a diverse group of interested parties. And that would include tribes, communities, state agencies, kind of pretty much everybody under the big tent to develop a state energy strategy to identify pathways for achieving the state's energy and climate policy goals. So the scope of this would assess many types of energy technologies, not just offshore wind. So you'll get energy efficiency, transmission, solar batteries. The whole gamut is going to be assessed under the state energy strategy. And the goal is to provide kind of a high level strategic guidance for the state, help identify implementation gaps and options to achieve the energy and climate goals, explore technology, technology and policy pathways, and seeks to identify a preferred pathway, potentially thatency transparently balances all these trade offs that we hear so much about in terms of land use and resource qualities and different things like that. So like I said, the timelines are similar. So we'll try to keep these two processes connected. Next slide is a little bit about. So my last two slides are actually more on the energy sector side of offshore wind and showing folks what are the other activities, whether at the state level or the power planning, power sector world like with utilities. What are these other activities going on that are relating to offshore wind off Oregon's coast? This one is with speaking a little bit about the Oregon Utility commission, public Utility commission and what it does with our utilities and their integrated resource plans. So what is an IRP? That's literally what it is, integrated resource planning. And that is like a 20 year outlook that utilities do to forecast the scale and timing of what they need in terms of new resources to meet load growth and things like that, and. And to identify potential candidate technologies to fill those needs. These irps, they're continuously updated. Essentially, they're on two year cycles. So as soon as one is kind of submitted to the PUC, their review process begins, and that takes a while, and then shortly after, the utility is onto their next IRP, like doing the early work on that. And so it's kind of a continuous refresh, basically, of these evaluations. And so what that means is what's identified in a utility IRP one year may not match with what's identified in a subsequent IRP. These things can change based on market conditions and a host of other factors, weather conditions, all sorts of things. So, for example, a significant change in forecasted load growth or a rapid cost decline from an emerging technology could cause utilities IRP to change and the resource mix to change from one cycle to the next. And maybe I said this already, but the Public Utility Commission reviews these, and these are, the nexus is really just with our investor owned utilities. They have the regulatory authority over our investor owned utilities that serve Oregonians. And the point is to acknowledge whether these plans are reasonable. That's the point of the review process. And the 2023 IRPs for both Oregon's two largest utilities, PGE and Pacificor, are nearing the end of this review process. The 2023 IRPs are the first to include assessments of the new resources PG and PAAC need to meet Oregon's 100% clean energy goals. So that legislation, House Bill 2021, passed in 2021. And so these irps that were submitted around this time last year in 2023, were the first go around in the first pass incorporating the 100% clean energy targets. So these are important irps'the, pucs closing up their review processes on them. They haven't issued their final orders, but those are forthcoming. The whole reason I'm flagging these is because there were discussions that kind of either talked about offshore wind on the outskirts, or we were re directly talking about offshore wind. So for people who are interested in this topic, I wanted to flag this as an opportunity to learn more about what",

        "text": " There's no mixed zones to worry about. The idea of Cottonwood is actually added later to the application and it is only that possible contingent alternative line that the PCC claims can trigger the third scenario. So if you look at the images on the next two pages you'll see that it's only the smallest, smallest segment of the site boundary of the alternate Cottonwood line that the facility might connect to, that passes through more than three zones. A little black box on the first image shows the area we're talking about. And then the up close image shows the teeny teeny part in red circles of the site boundary or the quote unquote analysis area that would happen in an additional zone. And that's how the applicant and the department and the PCC gets to the more than three zones by saying yeah, the line won't be there, but the site boundary or the PCC goes further. The analysis area, which is a site boundary plus a half a mile gets you to four. And so we get to count to four not based on the line, not based on any structure, but based on this analysis area or site boundary. But if you look at the PowerPoint we define what a related or supporting facility is. We give you that 469 300 sub 24 definition state law provides. This isn't hard. And what does it mean? It means a structure proposed to be constructed by the applicant or substantially modified by the applicant in connection with the construction of the energy facility. Well the first problem is a possible alternate line that may or may not be connected to the facility doesn't meet that definition. And there can be no claim on this record that it's going to be the applicant who constructs or modifies the Cottonwood line if it's selected anywhere. Now Odo in its response to the county's exception says well no, the evidence really shows that the applicant is going to substantially modify the Cottonwood line. But that's not true. What did the applicant tell us? The applicant said in its application for site certificate exhibit b, and I quote it, page four. Under project description, upgrades an additional infrastructure to their network are expected to be handled by UEC, not the applicant. Exhibit b, page 16. From the northern substation the project will either directly connect to the regional grid via UEC transmission lines that will be constructed, owned and operated by the UEC. Now compare that to the statements in exhibit B, page four regarding the Stanfield route which they say will be quot constructed, owned and operated by the applicant. And then at page 1516 the applicant will construct a new 230 kv transmission line to BPA. In addition, as we cite in our exception exhibit k, land use, page 38 says that the section of the Cottonwood transmission line that we're talking about here that maybe the project will connect two will address UEC's general utility needs by providing an upgrade to UEC's existing utility system and may also be available to other generation facilities for ongoing capacity needs. The statement that cited by Odo with regard to a partnership with UEC is nothing more than an economic deal. But in terms of what the standard says constructed by the applicant, no go. There's no evidence of that. Zero. Moreover, a site boundary is not a structure and the fact that a small part of the site boundary is in more than three zones doesn't show that there's a related or supported facility that passes through more than three zones. If you look at the definition of a site boundary, it's the perimeter of a proposed energy facility, it's related or supported facilities and a whole bunch of other things. Temporary lay down staging all corridors, microsiding corridors proposed by the applicant. It is simply not possible to say with a straight face that there is a related or supporting facility that goes through more than three zones on this record. And similarly, there's an administrative rule for OTDO 345 110 27 that says a related or supported facility means structures that would not be built but for construction or operation of the energy facility. The applicant has failed to carry its burden to demonstrate that the Cottonwood line would not be built but for the construction of the operation of the proposed energy facility. The preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that that line is going to be built regardless, including its upgrades. The PEEpco claims the county had not provided evidence that the Cottonwood line would built regardless. But I just read you a bunch that says exactly otherwise. I don't know why the ALJ would make that determination, but the record doesn't support it. If there are evidentiary gaps. However, that's not the county's problem. The county presented evidence from the applicant that it's not going to be constructing the Cottonwood line and it' maybe not going to even use it and the UEC is going to construct it anyway. That means that there is at most an evidentiary gap and that's an evidentiary burden problem. That's not the counties, it's the applicants",

        "text": ", if it's by resolution or some other process, then I think that that would be appropriate. Absolutely agreed. Okay, thank you. And then Tamara. Yes, we do have a list of contractors. I'm go going to drop that plan development resources list in the chat right now and you'll see that the first page is that list of contractors. Alice has already beat you there. Thank you, Alice. Appreciate. And I actually will be, as I mentioned, I'll be getting an updated version. Cause we have a couple new additional contractors. So if you know of someone great that you've worked with, you know, or you know someone interested, this is a publicly open list so they can just reach out to me and I can get them on the list. You know, they should have expertise in the area and be potentially available to help counties. But other than that, they can go up on the list. And I see Karen, question. Yeah, I was going to say Karen Chase is also a fantastic resource from energy Trust is kind of a similar front door person. Energy trust is awesome and has a lot of different things. So she's a great resource to getting connected over there if you are not already. Yeah, yeah, I'll just tag ono that, that, yeah, we've talked about actually once counties get enrolled in the program that I can connect you with staff at Energy Trust of Oregon if you're not already connected, so that you can have that, you know, initial opportunity to know that they're a resource. And we're in great dialogue to make sure that we can help you all with this planning. Awesome. John, you have your hand up and then we have a question in the chat as well. You wanna come un mute? Yeah, thanks. I figured it'd be easier to unmute and ask this one. I think I understand the requirements from the HP three. 3630. There's a couple I don't entirely understand and back on. I think it's slide eight. It says the requirement is identify critical public services facilities where the development of alternate energy generation and storage resources will meet local energy resilience needs. What does, what does that mean? Is that, that. Are we talking microgrids or can you maybe paraphrase that for me? Sure. I don't quite quite understand. Um, yeah, that is a great question. So, I mean, the idea behind it is when the energy grid goes down, making sure that your critical public service facilities have an energy resource available to provide them with power. And that is, I think, the simplest way to phrase that. It could look like microgrids. Those are excellent. It could look like backup generators. It could look like thinking about additional fuel storage for those backup generators, thinking about your fuel points of distribution so that you can receive emergency fuel supplies. It's pretty comprehensive, and I think there's a lot of different ways that it can look based on what's available to your county, what your county wants to go forward. So in type, you know, that's, it's. There's not a lot of specificity. And what you have to do. The idea is just to be making a plan for how you're going to support your critical public service facilities, should they not already have those resources in place? And maybe, if I might just add one more thing, Hannah. I might look at a critical service facility, like a water treatment facility or a wastewater management facility as an example. I mean, it could be a fire station. It could be, you know, a hospital or a health clinic. But think, oftentimes I think of water and wastewater facilities, and if they don't have grid power, how much energy do they need? How much electricity they need to continually to operate, to provide water, wastewater facilities and services? And then I think the phrasing simply, this is a quote out of the statute, by the way. So alternative energy generation and storage resources, you can take that for what it means. I think it's exactly what Hannah talked about. Maybe there's a backup generator that uses diesel, but then you have to think about fuel supply chains and fuel storage. Maybe there's an alternative that would have some solar in a battery facility, although that may not be sufficient for all of your needs for a major facility, but major, some type of facilities. So I think it's really getting to the point where if you can look at, identify first those critical public service facilities and then understand their energy needs and then sort of working, what options might there be available to meet that needs if grid power was down, I would also just add as like a plug for one of our other programs, the Community Renewable energy program or project grant program, C Rep. Again, one of those things that this plan can identify is those places like. Like your police station or your sheriff's office or whatever, that probably that might not have that backup or needs additional",

        "text": " miles that we seasonal weland actually more like 4 miles stretched out, but two and a half square miles of this excellent habitat with nothing to replace it. I've built wetlands all the way from down around Eugene all the way to north of Brownsville. We've got a flyway of waterfowl that use this in the winterime. Thousands and thousands and thousands of waterfowl. And what this will do if this goes through is to interrupt a section probably close to 4 miles long, where the wetland, the seasonal wetlands will be gone. Just think it's really wrong. And I think this wasn't well thought out. The idea of the solar complexes, you can't call them parks and you can't call them farms. The idea that solar complexes can go ono LCdC land that's exclusive farmot use is just beyond me. I've heard all your answers. Pardon me. They're all really reasonable and. But ask anybody in this room, you, let's show a hand to people who really want this project to go. That's how many. I don't have to say another word. Thank you. Thank you. Can I get the show of hands again? I know you'next. And then you'll be after that. Sorry. Then you'll be after that. And then I see you in the back. Hi, my name is David Ko, I live in Brownsville, Oregon. What question for you? You talked about batteries. What type of batteries? The batteries themselves have not been determined, but most likely lithium ion. Lithium ion. Do you have an idea of the physical size? It varies from manufacture, manufacturer, but those haven't been picked yet for this project. Would you guess it's the size of this table or the size of like a shipping container? Typically they're more around the size of the shipping container. Do you think it would just be one shipping container or. It depends on the size of that particular battery. So it could vary. Do you guys have a fire protocol for if there is a fire with the lithium batteries, we would be required to have one. But even the battery manufacturers, typically these systems are self contained. Within, in that storage container looking thing with its own cooling and fire suppression systems. We talked about whose land it is that, you know, you're going to be. You're leasing this from the landowners. Someone else brought up the fact that a lot of this land is from outside. It's in Idaho, which parent company is actually in Connecticut, which then it ends there. I looked it up on the Linc county assessors, and it was sold in 2008 to those companies. So, kind of interesting, just a fact for everybody to know. The thing that's really weird about this is that. Excuse me, sorry. The thing that's really weird about this is that your company from California or you're based out of California, you're. The land that you're gonna put this on is owned by a company that's registered in Idaho, whose parent company is in Connecticut. You're going to capture the sol light. So the solar light that's coming to, you know, the Willamet Valley, sell it to us because we need it. But the real reason why you're go going to do is because it's. You're gonna make money. Otherwise you wouldn't do it. That money is then going to go to your american company, but then some of that money is going to go to your parent company because you wouldn't exist. Your parent company wouldn't own you if you guys didn't give them money. So the weird thing about this is it just seems like that all the resources are outside of the state and all the money is leaving this state. So I guess my question this would be for you guys is, what's the economic impact? Like, are we expected that prices are going toa go down by, you know, 10% or like, what's advantage to us? What's in it for us? So to talk about benefits of the project, there's the immediate impact, which is the construction phase. That's anyere for employing 100 to 300 personnel for about 18 months. That's directly for contracting and construction of the project. That's not including impact going to have on the local area, including these people most likely going be hired locally. But these people will still need place to live if these people need places for food, et cetera and things like that. So during the construction phase of the project, again for about 18 months, there's a direct impact to the local economy because there's a lot of resources needed for these people. And then after the project'built, yes, the construction jobs are gone, but that benefit rolls into tax benefits. So right now, when we did our early analysis. This project is estimated to be giving Lynn county about $1.6 million in additional tax revenue every year to be used in whatever need to support lyindn county. And that's very early projections.

        "text": " from this complicated slide, I don't expect anybody who hasn't seen this before to absorb it fully. But first, we use energy from a lot of different sources for a lot of different purposes. That's our starting point for our energy strategy. And secondly, some of that energy is produced in Oregon, and a lot of it is also imported. And this is the landscape that we're starting with. So in this slide, it's a little easier to see where our energy comes from. So you can see in this pie chart that petroleum, natural gas and hydro are the three biggest sources that we have. We also use quite a bit of coal, quite a bit of biomass, wind, and there are other resources in there, too. And on the right, you can see where's that energy going? About 29% of it goes to transportation, cars and trucks and other transportation. About a quarter of it goes to homes. Little more than a quarter powers industrial processes, and about 19% goes to businesses. So this is kind of where we use energy if we think of our whole state split up into these four centers. So here's another view. But now I'd like to zoom just into the electricity sector. So electricity is't all the energy, as you remember from the first slide, but it's a really big part of the energy that we use. And you can see here that hydropower accounts for the biggest share of Oregon's electricity production. There's also a big share of wind, of coal and natural gas. And coal and natural gas are the resources that are most responsible for our electric sector carbon emissions. If we fast forward to 2040 and the 100% clean electricity standard in HB 2021, those are the sectors where we need to look at clean alternatives to decarbonize the power sector. So then if we look a little bit deeper across different sectors, different end use sectors, if we look at the transportation sector, which, as you saw, accounted for about 29% of our energy consumption, gasoline and diesel account for the biggest sources of energy powering our vehicles. They're also the biggest sources of emissions. And so if we go out to 2050, these are the places where we'll be looking to alternative clean sources, including, you can see here, electricity and also low carbon fuels. And we're watching the climate protection program, rulemaking right now and keeping in mind the important role that that program will play in driving emissions reductions here. Then if we look at buildings here, we've split up buildings into homes, residential energy use and commercial energy use or businesses. And if we look at buildings, you can see that the lion's share of our energy use is in the form of electricity. That's the kind of light blue, 47%, 53% in this chart. That's followed by natural gas and then biomass. And again, there's a challenge to decarbonize these sectors. So that brings me to why do we need an energy strategy? Oregon has ambitious energy and climate goals. They cover electricity, transportation, and direct use fuels. Direct use fuels include things like fuels for industrial processes or for heating your home. And there are a lot of things going on. At the same time, we are also seeing changing weather patterns affecting the energy system, wildfires, a need for increased focus on resilience. All of these things are part of the picture that we need to consider when we think about the future of our energy sector. In our 2022 biennial energy report, we asked ourselves how Oregon might meet these goals, and we looked at what other states have done. We reviewed 20 technical studies from around the country, and we concluded that the state would benefit from a state energy strategy. And by undertaking the kinds of analysis that we've seen elsewhere, an energy strategy can help align policy development, regulation, investment, and technical assistance. It can help identify pathways to meet the state's policy goals while considering different technologies, different approaches and trade offs. It can help maintain affordability and reliability. It can consider ways to strengthen the economy, to be proactive rather than reactive in how our energy sector evolves. We can prioritize equity and work to maximize benefits and minimize harms. So last summer, House Bill 3630 directed Odo to develop an energy strategy that identifies pathways to achieve our energy policy objectives, and that is informed by stakeholder perspectives and by existing resource plans, energy related studies and analysis. The bill calls on Oo to develop pathways. It's not just one route, but rather to consider trade offs. And that includes things like costs, efficiencies, feasibility, and the availability of different energy resources and technologies, economic and employment impacts, energy burden, affordability, environmental justice and community impacts and benefits. We'll also be looking at land use and natural resource impacts and considerations and things like energy resilience, security and market implications. So it's a pretty tall order. The energy strategy. Oh, yeah,",

        "text": " given to you in the comprehensive plan, a vision that was adopted by our board of county commissioners. And so every time an applicant comes in with a new element, they want you to consider to the vision, a new application that they want you to consider to the vision. You have to decide, is it the vision of Marion county? Is it the vision that matches the comprehensive plan that's structured today? Is it a vision that is being refined? You do not have to build out. The comp plan is meant to last that 50 years. That means maximum maximums are in that comprehensive plan. All the maximums don't have to be used today. You have time to fill in and satisfy the comprehensive plan. So I just. I wanted to touch on all of that and share that with you, let you reflect on it, ask questions, get with your staff as you needed to. All right, so a lot is going on with the comprehensive plan, and I didn't tell staff I was doing this, so I'm going to need some help. They are currently in a seven year review cycle of the comprehensive plan. It's called the evaluation and appraisal report. That QR code and link takes you to a special webpage that has been created specifically to address the update of the. To address what needs to be changed in the comprehensive plan, there are community meetings. You are invited to participate. The public is invited to participate. We would hope you would encourage other people to come to this. And I'm going to ask Chuck. We need to actually add that to every agenda item and make sure it's announced at the beginning of the meetings. We flash this up here and invite the public to do the surveys and to come to the public meetings. So this is us working on the elements of the comprehensive plan. We'll identify what changes need to be made. We transmit to the state. We want to get through this effort by the end of the calendar year. We're required to technically get through this so that we can transmit what we desire to change in concept by February. Then we have to work the following year to update all the language. So your staff is going to be very busy working through and updating. And we just want you to be well aware of it and help us solicit public input for it. Got a question? Yes, sir. Okay. The ear or ear thing evaluation appraisal report. Right. How is the public getting this? I mean, what are you doing to get this to the public other than being on the website? So I'll hand this over to Chuck. But it is an effort, and talking to folks like you is part of that effort. We need your help. But is it advertised on the radio, tv, or anything like that to engage the public? There's. That's a large piece of the ear process. It's one of the most significant pieces is to engage public, get public comment. So there's, on the website, there's also two surveys. But one of the big things is going out to the public. So you'll see up there a schedule of when we're gonna have public meetings, public discussions, and we'll with our consultant, go through a process to get their feedback and understanding, similar to the questions that are in the surveys that are online and social media that are. We're trying to advertise these public meetings on social media in every meeting here of the QR codes so that they can, one, take the survey, but then two, really come to these meetings in the different quadrants. Because the only thing I saw on, on the facebook was one of the commissioners that put it on there, and that was it. So I don't know. We haven't started the public first the public campaign, so we're working with pr to put out these QR codes. I was actually texting with them earlier, so that process is getting started. So no tv, radio, billboards, nothing like that? Radio, yes. Social media. I don't know about tv, but your commission had a presentation recently, and then we wanted to make sure you all were aware of it. We are refining the public meeting locations this past week. They continue to refine where they're going to be at, and these are several of the more formal ones. Staff is also going to be available to. If there's a homeowner's group that wants them to meet, we can attend additional meetings like that. And this is a requirement by the state? It is a requirement by the state. We have some of those QR code things that we can hand you. And if you have people that you want to give them to and encourage them to participate, take the survey. We would love for you just to hand out these little cards. Friday, I came to pick this agenda up, and I saw they were having a meeting at the time, said stakeholders. Who are the stakeholders? The stakeholders were. The first group was the county departments and department heads. The",

        "text": " And so what this does is it allowed the developer to use an assumed ambient noise level, and that's the 20 sixpa. So, and again, that was specific to wind, not anybody else. Also, it allowed for noise sensitive properties, and these are homes, schools, hospitals, basically places of human kind of habitation, that if the increase is more than ten DBA, based on monitoring and modeling, that you would have to get a waiver from the landowner. So means that even if, you know, they can go from 26 to 30, you know, five, but if they go to 36, they would have to get waivers. And so it still allowed some control by those adjacent landowners if they chose to sign the waiver or not sign the waiver. Now, the one thing that's important about that is there is a not to exceed maximum threshold, which causes, you know, potential harm to humans. And that table exists in the rules. That was not changed. You still can't go, even if somebody was willing to sign a waiver, you can't go above that. So just, there's a not to exceed amount. So again, that was done in 2004 for wind facilities. We've used that consistently since then. It's been included in many of your reviews for wind facilities, you know, where developers oftentimes for wind, have chosen to do that because it's cheaper and easier and again, still has the safeguards. And there are numerous occasions where people have signed waivers. So it's a system that has worked and, you know, created some flexibility, but still safeguarded, you know, public health and safety. Really what we're doing is we're proposing the same thing. Just make this applicable to solar as well, because, you know, we want that same flexibility. It just doesn't exist right now. People can't do those things even if they want to. So I think one element of this which is important to clarify in the record is many people ask, well, why are you even bothering with this? Because solar panels don't create noise. And that is true. But there are lots of equipment associated with industrial scale solar facilities that do create noise. And those include inverters, transformers, generator step up transformers, transmission lines. And then if they have a battery storage system, the h vac units associated with that. And through our process, our reviews, we have looked at that data. We have the data in our record. And the noise generated by those types of equipment range from 46 to 160 diba at the point source. And the higher end of that, well exceeds the not to exceed threshold. So they have the potential to create significant health issues for people from. From noise. So, you know, there is a need to review noise for solar facilities. There is a potential impact. But again, because this has been done for wind facilities would have the same value and the same safeguards. So that's why we're proposing that. So the idea is that we will create a rulemaking advisory committee. And the reason I haven't gone to you with this is it's an EQC or environmental quality commission. Tom has already solicited, you know, interest in a rulemaking advisory committee. We will likely just show them in a one time meeting. Here's the draft rules, which is pretty surgical, making sure that there are no concerns or issues, or if somebody has a different idea on language, then once that concludes, we would initiate that process, do a public commentary or rulemaking hearing, and then ultimately we go to the environmental Quality Commission with the potential to be adopted as early as may of next year. So any questions? Any questions? Cindy Khanan, for the record, just maybe not related to this, but I'm just wondering. We do, a lot of our work is an analysis of fish and wildlife impacts on fish and wildlife. And this is just human to human and nothing with. Is there anything out there with respect to wildlife near solar, wind facilities? I mean, there can be. So when we look at those standards, there are. When you look at protected areas or recreation resources, there are noise elements to those. Those are not the DEQ noise rules, those are if you have a protected area or a recreation resource and some element of that, you know, and say the management plan for that is, you know, a quiet sort of setting, we would look at potential impacts of noise from the facility to that. Similarly, you know, we would, if there are, you know, noise issues associated with, you know, sensitive fish and wildlife habitat, we would work with, with ODFW. Regarding that, I'm not aware of any particularly that that's occurred. Certainly, you know, if ODFW, you know, some, you know, nesting species during certain times of the year that were very sensitive to noise,",

        "text": " So this is s just continuing on issues around notice requirements, how the public comment period is structured during an amendment, how to properly raise issues, sort of matching the changes we've made with sufficient specificity, sort of, I should say, matching the additional clarity. There is some changes with the standard for an amendment with raising issues. So there's a reason why we didn't just copy what we did proactively. This sort of needs its own lens to examine how exactly the language should read for the amendment process, but sort of matching how we clarified it for the contested case generally, and then just any other issues identified by council staff or rack members. So it's pretty broad. This is not a sort of, we identified one little issue and we want to fix that. This is a kind, is going to be a what and sort of what we did with the contested case ruls, where we're going to start on you, and we already have internally, just sort of look at each rule in the amendment process one by one, and ask ourselves, does this make sense? Can we improve this? So that is what we're going to be doing with the rack and going forward as part of the draft, creating a draft, proposed rules. Any thoughts or feelings about the amendment rulemaking, any areas that you already are concerned about that you don't see reflected on those slides that you want staff to look at? And of course, your, this isn't the last time that you'll be able to, you know, raise any issues or concerns, but, you know, if something was already in your mind, can you click back a slide, please. The site changes that trigger. This is chair Grail. The site changes that trigger an amendment process are the things that I feel like we're good, that people look for or find opportunities to expand perhaps what the intention was. So that's one that I think was we keep seeing changes. We've had a lot of conversation about people changing ownership and when we need to be concerned. I think earlier when we talked about the battery storage. So that's one I'm just super curious about myself. Definitely, definitely. Councilber Condon. Thank you. The next one on that same side, the amendment type A B, has been questioned a lot and so that is to me an important area for us. Thanks for. And we're go going toa check in this chair grail. Counciler Choct Tor, council member Devlin, do either of you have any comments? No, madam Chair. Thank you. Thank you. I heard them though. I got supersonic mom hearing. All right, let's go. Two slides, I guess. Go to the. Yep. So again, we are asking for or recommending that we form Iraq and requesting that council approve staff to create a RAC consisting of again, roughly twelve members and just sor of based on how the last you have gone, this sort of seems like a good number. Sometimes we get interest matching this, I think with the contested case we had eight, but you know, it sort of matched the distribution that you see here. But if anybody has any questions or thoughts about rack makeup for this rulemaking, council member Condon H just really a comment about it. I appreciated the, the diversity of this group. But also just want to mention that, you know, the slide suggest there are two members of the public here. And really, as I look at it, the reviewing agencies certainly represent a public view that they have a constituency as well. Obviously the two members from the public public and the two resource interest groups and environmental justice groups are members of the public. To me, I mean, so there is quite a bit of public representation there. And sometimes I think that maybe the racks aren't looked at that way. But this one particularly, I think it's a good grouping of both stakeholders, uh, that are the investor owned utilities and the independent power producers, but also members of the public and diverse. Todd. Sorry, Mister secretary. Thank you, madam chair. For the record. Todd Cornett. And just a reminder, you know, and we will make these, you know, we'll provide the notice about these rulemaking advisory committee meetings and we encourage any council members to, you know, either show up in person or show up online as long as'going to have a quorum of council members. We think that's helpful. We appreciate all the councilme members who have done that in the past. We think being part of that or just listening to those conversations also helps really inform you later on when we provide the rules to you. When you hear other comments, you can help translate that to the rest of the council members as well. So it's certainly not required, but we encourage it and we will provide that information to you. Thank you. And I would just say this is chair Grail. When I look at this list and we",

Know what our customers are going to be. Good point for me. Incentives programs. Learning what's coming my way next. I'm Jennifer Jolly with the Oregon Municipal Electric Utilities association and we have eleven city owned consumer owned utilities like co ops and work closely with that group and again looking to see what the requirements are and whether cities would be good candidates for some of these friends. That photo it here to make sure people can see the video. Good morning. I'm Katie Toki. I work with Christie at Tgrity Consulting and we're really honored to be supporting Odo this initiative. And it's a real pleasure to meet all of you this morning. Thank you for being here. All right, so I think if we're all good to move forward, we can move into the agenda and just some of the here who's online too. Oh, we can. I know we did ask them to put all of their information in the chat and we can. You got signed in, though, I don't think. Yeah, I was just trying to see. I'm not on the web app. We might be able to just read off the chat. Do that. Okay. You want to? I have the Danish. Okay. So joining us virtually, we have Tal McFarit from the city of Ashland electric utility, Lee Elder from Pacific Corps, Janine Benner, director of Odo, Faith Youorba from sustainable northwest Tegan to bolt from Eugene Water and electric board, Austin, Jack Jackson from Consumers Powerr, Brookke Brownley from Portland General Electric U. Keith Hman from city of Foreorst Grove Light and power, Mel Boyd from Idaho Power, Jenny U. Who's one of the communications, uh, team members from Odo. Uh, Lyn Ansel from Idaho Power, Clinton Mills from Idaho Power, Robert Wallace from Wa East Orasco county, and Jason, who's her, I hope I'm saying that from Eugene water and electric, Christina Medina from Pacific, Fl. And that looks, that looks to be the group from Uhy, Virgil. Yeah. Thank you. Okay, so we do have a lot to cover today and just to kind of go through some of the housekeeping notes. U first, we want to make sure you do understand how this GR resilience fundndling works and the narrative that Odo recently submitted to the US Department of Energy. Based in a large part on feedback we received, the people in this room and people on the chat. So thank you very much. This approach was developed over the past year in post confronation with OPUC, and it was informed by outreach and experts work working in space. Second, and most importantly today, we would love your input and feedback to continue to improve our program design, such as community benefits. I know that came up today as an interest. So we'll be talking about that, the competitive scoring criterias to evaluate most competitive projects and lessons learned from past projects that you've all implemented in the past. So we just want to align this work of what is already being done with utilities and others and to better meet the objectives outline in better funding opportunity. And then third, I know there was interest in this as well. And as we've mentioned, there are handouts here for all of the federal rules and regulations. We've also posted them on the website so they're available to those virtually if you're interested in following along. But rules and applications regarding Davis Bacon, NeA Justice 40 and by America America as well. And I think forward and then just for everyone on the chat to do a little bit of housekeeping as well. For those of you who are new to web Redex, there's a quick guide with some features. So attendees are off camera and they are muted, but we do have a host who will be able to unmute you. If you have questions, you can see the option to raise your hand on both of the screens so you can put questions in the chat, or you can raise your hand and people from Oto and fromr people kind of monitoring this to make sure that we get to everyone's questions. So feel free to use the chat function to use your ask questions or make comments, you just ask that you please send this to all the participants so that everyone can see and it's a group to s number so that covers it for housekeeping. And just know, because we are trying to facilitate and as we've already witnessed, kind of virtual in person and we really want to hear feack from everyone, we'll foster discussion, but if we need to kind of along in the essence of time and just raise our hand and just say, you hear your vinyl thought, keep it moving so that we do show you different. And I think with that, any last questions in terms",

        "text": " involved in permitting and it's not easy for that translation. And then, you know, many site certificates have an allowance to do pre construction in phases to align with how it's actually built, especially as projects are getting bigger and bigger. They're not and we don't want them to. We don't want a solar project to go out and grade and develop 4000 acres in three months. We want that to be spread out, spread out, the impact in across the board. But that means that pre conststruction compliance happens in waves and each time it might be varying degrees of adequacy and accuracy, given what we believe the conditions require. Fun. Only fun. So our typical forecasted cost for pre conststruction for any site certificate is about 400 hours, which is like four to six months of full time work. And if there's more than one project at a pre construction phase, that four to six months becomes like eight months because you just can't handle the volume. Things are spread out and we lose efficnc. So typically, once we're in pre construction, how it starts is that a certificate holder contacts the department and it lets us know, ideally six to twelve months in advance of when they think they're going to mobilize. We assign a staff as the point of contact, and we have been setting up monthly phone call check ins, if not in person meetings with them to go through conditions, conditions, environments where they're at. There's a lot of work that has to be ironed out at that phase. It is, and we've built into the conditions like that the department has to approve. So, and that's not a checkbox approval, it's, we're approving something substantive that wasn't figured out in the permitting process. So it's quite detailed and requires a lot of coordination. Typically we've interwoven other agencies to help in that review approval. ODFW is the obvious. A lot of times the local government, the special advisory group entity, and Dogami are, are standard agencies that we build into that process takes time. So just a couple of examples. I have more listed on the slide than I'll go into, but of conditions that we're evaluating at pre construction compliance. One of our FAV and applies to every developer is the decommissioning bond. And that condition, if you're familiar, I mean, is typically a half a page long, makes sense to everyone, right? But it doesn't. And so where we, the council would approve the methods for estimating that decommissioning estimate and the unit costs. And so really all that is supposed to happen at pre construction is you can adjust the number of components. If you don't build battery storage, you don't have to pay for it. If you don't have 100 wind turbines, you only have 41. You can adjust that. Well, what ends up happening is a complete redo of the decommissioning estimate. And you're like, what is going on here? That's not right. Go back. And then maybe they would say, well, can we do bonding and phases? Or, and so you're working out like know, all you can do is update the number of components and we will confirm inflation. And then, oh, by the way, you have to use a council approved bond or form or financial institution maybe then they need to pitch a new institution or bond form changes and three months later we might get through this condition. So that times 40 anyway. So that's just one example. There's, you know, every. Every substantive pre construction condition has a lot of back and forth in review to get it where it's at. Rarely do we have an instance where what we get is what it's supposed to be and we can move forward on that day. Okay, so facilities, I believe the next slide, please. Thank you very much. So facilities that are currently in this amazing pre construction phase are the boardman to Hemingway transmission line, which I believe everyone's familiar, but that is a 500 kv transmission line that council has approved. It extends across five counties. Umatila, Union, baker, mel here and Morrow county. So we're. It's incredibly complicated to do pre conststruction compliance for a project of this size while at the same time processing requests for amendment to. That's interesting, but it's. We're actually experiencing it on more and more projects where they just need approval of changes while at the same time wanting to move forward on another arm. And then the other project that's in pre construction is the Madras solar energy facility. That's an approved 60 megawatt solar in Jefferson county. Both of those projects. I shouldn't talk anyway. I won't. I'll tell you about that on the next slide. And then we expect for wheat r renewable energy facility east, which is a 200 megawatt approved in Morrow, although going through an amendment to initiate pre construction. Immint like tomorrow. Next slide, please. Oay. So then we'll move",

You are also welcome to access the online project mapping tool in any documents by visiting our website. Please note that the audio and video of this meeting is being recorded and may be posted to the council's website following the meeting. Energy facility siting council meetings shall be conducted in a respectful and courteous manner where everyone is to state their positions at the appropriate times consistent with council rules and procedures. Willful, accusatory, offensive, insulting, threatening insulin, or slanderous comments which disrupt the council meeting are not acceptable. Pursua to Oregon administrative rule 345-011-0080 any person who engages an unacceptable conduct which disrupts the meeting may be expelled. Our first agenda item this evening is approval of the June 1 and June 23 meeting minutes as everyone had an opportunity to review the minutes. Any questions, comments on the minutes, Madam Chair. I move that the council approved the minutes of the June 1, 2023 meeting and the June 23, 2023 meeting as presented and recommended by staff. Thank you. Here. How do we have a second o chair, this is counselor, by our second motion. Thank you. Counor Byyer. With no further questions or comments. Mister secretary, please call the roll. Kent, how Anneber. Richard Devlin. Jordan Trueitt. Cindy Condon. Yes. Marcy Grail. Motion carries, madam chair. Thank you, mister secretary. Next we have the council secretary report, Mister Cornett. Thank you, madam chair. First, I'll start with some staffing and council updates. Councilmber Truitt's term ends on September 22 of this year. He's indicated he will not be seeking a second term, so we are actively looking for his replacement right now, Liz Boba, who is our compliance officer. Second compliancer is no longer with the Department of Energy, so we are looking to refill her position. Next, I'm going to move on to project updates. The first is the Muddy Creek solar project. So the project is 199 megawatt solar and battery storage project, proposed on 1000 1588 acres, or 2.5 sq. Mi in Lynn county, approximately 8 miles south of Brownsville and immediately east of Interstate five. We will be holding a public information meeting on the project at the Brownsville City hall on Tuesday, July 25. So a week from today, it'll start at 05:00 p.m. from five to six o. We'll hold one on one conversations and questions with people. We'll have formal presentations by the department and the applicant at 06:00 p.m. and then at the conclusion of that, we'll take questions and comments from members of the audience. If any council member would like to participate, either in person or virtually, you're absolutely encouraged to do that. Please let me know so that if we have four or more, that constitutes a quorum and'technically a council meeting.",

        "text": ". The project will not be built until 2027. And so we have the time to see through a new applic application to simplify the process, clean up the project record so it's all consolidated within a single application for site certificate. And hopefully, eventually a successfully granted site certificate for the facility. So, with that said, I'll turn it over to Matt Hazard, who again is the PM for the project, to talk through details and look forward to answering questions later. Thank you again for your attendance. So, this is the project area map. U. The area kind of outlined in purple is. Is basically our project area that we've done our surveys on and will be the area that we will develop again. The project will be up to 201 wind and solarm. We may do with also what was called the best, which is an AC coupled best with the project. Um, and that will be located on approximately ten acres within the project area interconnection. We're again interconnecting with Bonneville Power Administration. And it will be on their 230 big Eddie to mop in line. And they'll have a new substation that they'll be building, which is called Boyd Ridge. And if you're kind of looking at the project map, if you look towards the west of it and it kind of hooks down, that's kind of the location of Boy Ridge proposed substation. And that's. There's an existing 230 kv line that runs through there. BPA will be permitting that and constructing that and designing it. That will all be on Bonneville power administration. And again, like Sam said, their proposed in service date is late 2027. Project studies. Again, the purple area that. That's outlined on that map is the area that we've studied. And we'll continue to study, um, with. With the relevant studies that are needed. U we'll update our survey results that have been done in the past to account for new avian studies and things like that that are needed in biological studies and then site control. Again, it's 4601 acres under lease, and the pro proposed land use out in the project area is mainly dryland wheat. Next slide, please. This is a little bit more of a detailed map of the project area. If you can see the yellow dots, those are proposed turbine locations. The yellow area down in the southeast corner of the area, that's our proposed solar area and battery storage. And then again, the purple area is that heads to the west. That long line of 8 miles is our proposed geni route to the proposed Boyd Ridge substation. Next slide, please. This is a tentative project schedule. Again, the environmental studies will have been done in the past, and we'll continue in through 2024 for refreshes. Our agency outreach will continue all the way up until construction as we are here today with the NOI we've submitted for that and with our application for site certific will be coming up. And then late in 2025, we're suspecting or approving going to have our approval for site certificate, and then engineering will proceed through 2026, with construction basically occurring in 2027 and then a commercial operations date in late 2027. Um, as far as estimated homes, uh, to be powered by the project to be around 52,000 U. Operational life for the project is around 30 years. Again, project acreage is around 4601 acres, and then estimated capital expenditures around 550 million. Next slide, please. Summit Ridge renewable energy facility project will be designed to align with the Wasoe County'vision, ensuring environmental care, community safety, and economic viability. We're committed to doing this right, respecting the neighbors, and contributing positively to Waso County's future. With the submittle of the NOI, the Summit rid renewable energy Facility project will proceed through multiple permits dependent process, ensuring a timely process towards renewable energy generation. And then just on the far right, just kind of the steps that we'll be going through with the NOI, the submittal of our site certificate, and then into engineering, then eventually into construction and building permits. Next slide, please. That's about all I had, so thank you for your time. Okay, can you scroll up, Nancy, to slide number 16? No, this one. Okay, so now we have reached the public comment period. I just want to go over a couple of things. As I had noted before, the public comment period is open. It closes on May 3. So a month from today at 05:00 p.m. there are multiple ways to submit comments. You can submit them via email. You can make comments orally. You're not limited to comment one time. You can do it again. You can also use our comment portal. We have comment cards back there on the table if you wish to make a public comment oral comment tonight, we do ask that you",

And so there's no point in making it harder for people to obtain a contested case before Odo because they will either have that case record developed in front of the agency or they will have it developed in front of the circuit court. So that's just sort of what I'd like you to keep in mind as you're looking at the rural revisions for contestic cases. Thank you. Thanks for your comments, Miss Gilbert. Anyone else wishing to provide public comment? Yes, chair Howe. I do see that Wendy King has her hand raised. So, Wendy, I'm going to go ahead and unmute your mic, and you are ready to comment. 337 Southwest Pumice Avenue, apartment 303, Redmond, Corrin. I, too, would like to ask for additional time with the b two H RFA one. It appears that because of our location in Morrow county, we are encountering multiple energy projects that we are trying to provide, to be involved with, I guess I should say. Currently we are considering a contested case for the Wheat Ridge east RFA one, and we also have the b two h grain that's directly to and a half a mile about to our north. It looks like it's at a considerable boundary to its site, and we're extremely concerned and really haven't taken the time to pour through that DPO, but we intend to. In addition, our family has drafted a public comment letter concerning the contested case rules that we encountered with b two h, and I hope this letter makes its way to your committee, as it is in response to some of the questions counselor, Cond and Fireyer asked of us in the last FSAC meeting. And with that, that is all. Thank you, Miss King. Anyone else wishing to make comment? There are no hands raised at this time. Okay, well, give 1 minute here for a final opportunity. Still non Nancy okay, well, the time is now 1027 and we'll close the public comment period. The next item is the wheat wheat rich renewable energy east request for amendment one review of the draft proposed order Christopher Clark, senior sighting analyst, will have the floor. Thank you. Thank you. Chair Howe, members of the council council for the record, my name is Christopher Clark. I am a senior cighting analyst for the department. As chair Howe just mentioned, I'm here to talk about we read renewable energy facility east and assist the council with your review of the draft proposed order per request for amendment one. I get slide. Thank you. So I covered a lot of this material at the March council meeting, so I'm not going to go over it in detail, but feel free to stop me if you would like. But this request is being processed under the type a amendment review process, which included a public hearing and public comm comment period which concluded on April 4 and we got certificate holder responses on April 8. During my presentation today, I'm primarily going to be focusing on the public comments received rather than the other findings in the draft proposed order that we reviewed in March. As far as the remaining steps in the process, after we hear the council's feedback, we will issue our proposed order containing our recommendations on findings of compliance with standards and conditions of approval. The type a review process allows for a possible contested case on the proposed order, and I'll just note that only those persons who raise the relevant issue in person at the public hearing in March or in writing by the comment deadline may participate or may request to participate in that contested case, and then, if held, the contested case would be overseen by a hearing officer appointed by the council after the deadline for contested case hearing requests has passed or the contested case proceeding Hasludd. The council will then review the proposed order and issue your final order approving or denying the request. Perendeded site certificate all I believe you're all familiar with most of the history of this proceeding, so I'll just start with at the march meeting we had the public hearing and then the comment period for written comments closed on April 4. After that, the council did leave the record open until the following Monday, April 8 to get certificate folder responses which they provided on that date. So today, then, is your chance to review those comments and the DPO and provide feedback on what you believe should be included in the proposed order. Assuming there are no significant issues raised or anything, nothing needs more time. We would be expecting to issue that proposed order next Friday or next week, I should say prior to April 20. Sixthadline if that timeline holds, then we would be looking at a deadline for contested case requests on May 27, right before your may meeting, which was scheduled for May 31, at which is the earliest d the council can make its final decision.

There was a tree during the storm that fell on my son and I in 2004 that smashed our car. And I stood right here when the ambulance came to get me. You talked about Paul Nuja, which is great. You know, him starting a lot of this initiative. I stood here, right about there, they had the podium, and there was a bus that came, and I was council president, 2003, and the Seminoles came up here, and so they were all on a bus, and they were getting out, milling around down there. And I kind of called our little meeting to order and stuff, and I said, I want to say something to you that my forefathers probably never said to yours. And I paused and I said, welcome to Fort King. And it took them a while. Then they said, okay. They started laughing, so they got it. But no, this place has a lot of rich history, and it's just going to continue. And it continues by the work and the efforts of all these people that are here, Fort King Group, and the money and everything that's been spent here and will be spent here. So we thank you for that and thanks for all these county commissioners I served with. And I'm sure in the future, I'll probably be at that podium back at your new commission chambers, probably asking you for something. So, anyway, thank you for the honor. Appreciate it. Thank you, Kent. Yeah. I will say, the last three years since I've been in office, Kent and I have worked behind the scenes on a number of things. You don't see it. You see what's in the paper. You see a live meeting, and that's what you see of these elected governmental officials. But there is a tremendous amount of preparation and work that goes into all the projects. It doesn't matter if it's a utility project or a road project, but Kent and I have worked behind the scenes on a number of things. We sincerely thank you for your service. And I know it's a shock. You go from getting on the merry go round and all of a sudden you're going to be off. You're going to have to figure out how you're going to handle that. Congratulations, Bunny. Thank you. Take all your. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Congratulations on your daughter. Thank you. There you go. Thank you. So we have another proclamation from the board of county Commissioners for Farm City week, and I'd like to invite those, our extension, Lynn Nobles and her team to come up for presentation. Good morning, Lynn. So glad to have all of you. Morning. Sorry. We'd like to hear more about that shortly. So it is an honor to welcome you here today for this proclamation from the Borda County Commissioners of Marion County, Florida. Whereas, all of Marion county citizens depend on farmers to produce the food and fiber necessary for health, safety, and quality of life, whereas, agriculture significantly affects our local economy, employing 33,740 people with an economic impact of $1.7 billion, and whereas, the equine and cattle industry are big economic drivers, but forest products with over 400,000 acres of timberland also contribute substantially to economic value and whereas, the practice of agriculture results in water recharge that is essential to surface and groundwater and whereas, as part of the Farm City Week celebration, Mister William Bill Phillips will be inducted into the Marion County Agriculture hall of Fame for his contributions to the agriculture industry. Now, therefore, the board of county Commissioners of Marion County, Florida, by virtue of the authority vested in us, do hereby proclaim that November 15 through November 22, 2023, be known as Farm City Week in Marion county. We remind everyone that producers and consumers share a unique interdependence, for one cannot exist without the other. Duly proclaimed the 7 November 2023, signed by all five county commissioners and attested to by Gregory C. Harrell, our clerk of court. And Lynn, I'm going to pass this to you, and if you'll share a little bit about what's happening in the during Farm City week. And of course, we certainly want to honor our recipient for the Agriculture hall of Fame as well. Okay, we want to thank everybody for being here today, and we most especially want to recognize Bill Phillips. He was a county employee at one time. He was the county extension director. We have a great partnership with the board of county Commissioners and the University of Florida, where we extend the University of Florida's research based information to our farmers in the community to help make them more efficient and better productive, productively",

        "text": " members serving in a volunteer capacity. Council members are appointed by the governor and approved by the Oregon Senate and represent diverse professional backgrounds from across the state. When OTo citing staff makes recommendations to council, council itself is the final decision making authority for energy facilities under their jurisdiction, including this project, the wagon Trail solar project. This slide represents or illustrates the seven major steps in the review process of applications for site certificates. The first step here, the first chevron, is the notice of intent phase or step, and this is when this the applicant states their intention to submit an application for a site certificate and generally includes information, general information about the project. This is functionally the applicant's conceptual plan. The information in the NOI allows reviewing agencies, including local governments and the public, to identify applicable requirements and special issues of concern the applicant must address in their application. The second step in the process is the project order, and the project order defines the analysis area for various types of impacts and identity and identifies the applicable statutes, rules, and ordinances that the applicant must address in the application u the third step, which is where we are now, and it's highlighted here with the red box, is the application or the application for site certificate and. Oh, excuse me, sorry. Okay, the application, which is where we are tonight. This step is where the applicant describes the facility, its s anticipated impacts and provides information to prove that they meet all of the standards. I'd like to emphasize that we're currently at this step, the third step in the process, and that at this step, there's no public comment period associated with this step. However, when we get to the next step in the process, when the department issues the draft proposed order, there will be a public comment period as well as a public hearing. Now let's see, following as I just explained, the next step in the process is the draft proposed order, and generally the draft proposed order is the Oregon Department of Energy's initial findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as recommendations to counsel on whether or not the facility would comply with all of the applicable requirements. And I'll get into a little more detail about the draft proposed order in a couple slides. Following the DPO or draft proposed order, the department would issue the proposed order and this proposed order. Issuance of the proposed order follows the draft proposed order public hearing and also follows the energy facility siting Council's review of the draft proposed order and based on the direction from council, the department issues the proposed order and a notice of contested case. The proposed order is staff's revised recommendation based on comments received, comments received from the council, comments received from the public from the applicant, just comments received. The second to last step in this process is the contested case step, and only those persons who have raised a relevant issue in person, at the public hearing or in writing by the comment deadline on the draft posted order may participate in the contested case step. The contested case process step is run by an independent hearing officer and following the conclusion of the contested case step would be FX review of the proposed order and review of the if there is a contested case review of the hearing officer'recommended contested case order and the council would, following that review, would issue a final order either approving or denying the application for a site certificate. The final orders, finding of facts and conclusions of law are based on the proposed order and the outcome of the contested case. If the council approves the application, thesel issues a site certificate, which is effectively a permit. Okay, the next two slides I have here provide an overview of the timeline, the schedule associated with this particular project, the Wagon Trail solar project. As you can see, the department received the notice of intent on November 3, 2020, 2020, and then issued a project order and an amended project order in March 20. On March 23, 2021, and then August 17, 2021, the department received the preliminary application for site certificate from the applicant in August of 2022. And what's not represented here, but I would like to just clarify, is the department determined that the application was complete in December of 2023. And then following that determination, on January 3 of this year, 2024, the department received the complete application from the applicant. And now the next couple steps. The last line item in this table on this slide, the draft proposed orderuance by the department. Our forecast is to have that issued in February, and although that's subject to change, but that's our forecast. Now, the next couple steps, the DPO hearing, if issued in February, we anticipate would occur in person in March, and that would be followed by council's review of the DPO, forecasted to be in April. And following coun council's review of the DPO,",

        "text": ", we'll plan on sticking around and see what other questions come up. We can sit here in awkward silence all day, but at some point we might just say we'll let everyone go and then usually a couple people stick around and ask us questions one on one, which is totally fine, too, for those that are done and take off, even though we're going to sitick around for a little while. Thank you very much for coming. We appreciate the time and your interest in this program. Great. For those of you still on to feel free to come off camera and talk with us. It's a small group now, mostly just Odo staff. Al right, Clay, we can probably call it if you want my experience, or we could just hang out together. Okay. Well, we're past 30 minutes, so somebody was really late, I would think war. John Warner'asking, how to come off. Perfect. Can, if you raise your hand, then we can unmute p, your, can you unmute? John Warner been unmuted. Hi, everybody. Sorry. I was trying to figure that out. I couldn't on my end. I appreciate the assist there if we have a moment, and I know we're after the half hour, so cut me off any. We have time. We were planning an hour, so you're fine. Okay, so my question about PGE, and really is getting to a question about collaboration in terms of your competitive scoring with PGE, benefit from demonstrating collaboration or cooperative strategy, working with either private parties, perhaps for someone who is proposing to finance the development of a battery energy storage system and then through a PPA, have PGE be the off taker for use of that. That could be for under blue sky conditions used for load shifting and reducing the need for fossil fuel peakers in the. In the evenings, let's say, but through further collaboration, let's say with the city of Tiger wanting to pursue GR, a microgrid resilience strategy that that DES was a portion of than have that system be able to, if there's a grid outage, be island and support critical infrastructure such as a community resilience hub, police emergency response command center, a public works facility. So it know has a benefit under blue skies. But in terms of resilience, it kicks into high gear under a black skies event. Okay, so yes is the short answer. I mean, what I'm imagining is it would be a PGE project, PGE application, because they would. They're the utility, they would be providing the microgrid services. Right. In the event of a disruption of their grid. And so the improvements are the reduced numbers of customers that are out in a disruption or reduced amount of time, things like that, based on that microgrid scenario, that is, you connected to PGE on partnerships are allowed, but only one sub grantee or subrecipient Odo of us can receive the funding, but they could have agreements or partnerships and how they distribute that know outside of our agreement with the sub grantee or the subrecipient would be under their own rules and procurement guidelines and things like that. Seeing similar things in the Community renewable energy grant program with partnerships and partnerships are certainly allowed. The only thing I've seen in the US Department of Energy on partnerships were discouraging a small utility and a large utility from partnering, because the cost match would end up being the large utility at 100% on the cost match on that kind of a partnership. And so they want. They were recommending that if there are partnerships that they be of like kind, that large utilities would partnered together or small utilities would partner together. Great, that'make sense. And clearly PGE would need to be the applicant. But I'm just reading the OA it's pretty clear that just a large scale battery storage system in a vacuum isn't eligible, but if it were instead embedded in the context of a microgrid in a resilience district that the city of Tiger wants to pursue, and obviously in collaboration with PGE, since they are the grid provider. And would you the overseeing and operating this facility certainly under blue sky conditions and having supervisorial control, but under a black sky event, I mean there need to be delegated or some kind of autonomous control for the microgrid so it could run an island mode and support the critical community facilities within the resilience district, such as that public works police facilities resilience hub out of which the community emergency response team could be operating, as well as other loads that are within the island district. But those would be the key ones from the perspective of assuring that structures or facilities that are essential to the public welfare and that energy dependent critical public services have continuity under a grid outage scenario. No, absolutely. And that is a sort of priority criteria for this program. And so as they would bepge customers, normally MPG would be involved in this project, then those customers are the ones that",

        "text": " parking lots. And so I can't imagine we're going to put in, you know, a 20 megawatt facility. But, you know, someone could come along and say, I want to rent the rooftops of your buildings in McIlrest and cobble together a 1 system. And that seems to me where Salem could go in addressing some of this. And so, so I guess my question was, if someone were to take up that opportunity, then they actually have someone that has to purchase their utilities have to purchase some of that product, correct? Yeah. And if they were designed strictly as projects that sell electricity to the utilities, then you could get them to qualify under this small scale category. And they're presumably will be a premium for that energy once those 8% or 10% requirements kick in. I think it's in 2030. Now, again, if that same project were connected on the customer side of a meter and they were able to use it all on site, they're probably going to get somewhere around eight or ten cents a kilowatt hour for the generation of that projectuse. It's going to offset their local utility bill. If it was designed to sell directly to the utility, it's probably more like $0.04 plus some adder because it's small scale and we have yet to know what that market is. But the financial benefit is still probably higher to put a rooftop system on the customer's side of the meter and offset the local load, unless it's just very small loads on the site. And some warehouses are like that. They have a little bit of lighting load and they can get more solar than they have load, and then you could sell it and presumably get a premium for it. So in my two acre with go across warehouse that I now own, I mean, right now would be my financial interest to put solar on there behind the meter. I could then defraame my existing costs that I could sell now they could. I sell that. They would have to buy the. The surplus energy from my two acre systems. That right? Well, if it's net metered, and that would be several hundred kilowatts of solar, that would be a significant system. If it's net metered, you're able to roll a surplus of energy forward to future months. And so summer surplus can cover winter months when there's less solar. However, for a net metered project, at the end of a year of billing and the solar year ends in March, all of that energy that is surplus at that point actually gets donated to PGE's low income assistance program and is not reimbursed by the utility. So you get. Go ahead. No, I think you understand it. I think you it. Right. Net. So your choice is net metering and you offset your costs or you sell it. You can both. Yep. You don't do both. Although if it's Salem electric, you do get to sell the surplus at the end of each month. But that's at Salem Electrics avoided cost and that's probably closer to two and a half or three cents. And so it's really hard to see a project pencil at that very low avoided cost. Did you have a follow up? So I don't think I knew. I think that was all very helpful. Then I'll move to coach for. Because. Thank you. Couple of things. I think we may need to distinguish between community solar project and small scale, as community solar is a particularly defined as opposed to the small scale. Second, I really think that the opportunities for solar involve two things in one. One is a high degree of partnership in working with utility in trying to either develop the grants or identify opportunity and identify and actually come to fruition possibilities. So solar. So I think it really requires a high degree of partnership with the utility. The second thing is, because of that, and because the bureaucracies and I know from the resiliency project and from early efforts to try and get a focus on community solar project, in reading the grant applications, that's a lot of bureaucracy. There is a grant application is pretty overwhelmin and I think it's going to important, and I believe the council is going in this direction, or at least the budget committee is. I think it's really important that you have a city, a staff person whose job it is to implement the climate action plan. Sorry, they're picking up my voice. Inious searching for some plans, searching for a staff person. It's like I call up work or whatever it is. So I think that's going to be really important. Yeah, I mean, the council'in, the process, as I understand it, with the task force setting, setting priorities and picking out the most practical strategies, the reality is the most practical strategies are those ones generally that will involve working with the utility in order to implement. But having a staff person, I believe, is really critical, someone",

We've got approval of the July 17 and 19th through 19th, and then the August 24 meeting minutes, after which the council secretary will give us a report. So on the approval of minutes, does anyone have any adjustments, corrections, changes, or someone ready to make a motion move approval? Mister Chairman. Okay, would that be of both the July and the august meeting minutes? Yes. Yes it would. Okay, we've got a motion. Councilloor Condon Cindy Condon and I will second that motion. Okay, we've got a motion in second. So Secretary Cornet, could you pl the council. Ken Hal? Yes. Ann Byer? Yes. Richard Devlin? Yes. Jordan Trueett? Yes. Perry Choctu? Cindy Condon? Yes. Motion carries, Mister vice chair. Okay, thank you, Secretary Cornet, and we're ready for. Do you have a report for us today? I do, Mister vice chair. I'm gonna start with some staffing updates, so I think all council members are aware, but Waliams has let us know that next week will be his last week with the Department of Energy. So for the last three years, we have greatly benefited from Wal E's process improvement expertise. And I don't say that lightly. He has a lot of expertise in that area, been very valuable to us. And in addition to that, his ever present ability to jump in and help out on anything that we need his help on. And so all of that has been very valuable for us and we very much appreciate it. I very much appreciate all of that. So. So Wally, you. You are definitely leaving us in a much better position than when you got here. So again, thank you very much. And I am definitely go going toa miss you. And I know the rest of the staff will, and I anticipate the rest of the council will as well. So again, thank you for everything. I'll speak real quick to that too, Wally or Mister Adams, we have really enjoyed working with you and like, I'll echo everything Todd said and have a fantastic retirement. Thank you. Appreciate it. Us very. All right, I'm gonna move on to project updates. We got a couple of notices of intent submitted since the last council meeting. The first is the yellow Rose Bush Energy center. So we received the notice of intent on September 1. And the applicant is the Yellow Rosebush Energy Center, LLC. They are a wholly owned subsidiary of Savvion, LLC. The facility is a proposed solar",

So the motion to approve the technicalust technical budget adjustments to the fiscal year 24 25, proposed budget as outlined in Washington county, exhibit a on May 17, 2024. I so move second. Okay. The technical amendment is moved by committee member Laird and seconded by Commissioner Willie. Discussion? No discussion. Okay. All those in fav. All those in favor incorporating the technical amendmentes and any opposed? The motion unanimous, what you said. Are there any other committee members who want to make a comment before I go last? Che I will thank you for everyone who participated. There's been a really enriching experience. I've learned so much and I've been glad to contribute and my hats off to the staff and all your knowledge and what you've contributed here and the department heads and assistant county administrators for bringing a lot of information to us. So it's been a fire hose of information to learn, but I've learned a lot. Thank you to Tanya and Greg over there for helping guide us through the budget process. So, and thank you to the commissioners for helping us, letting us be part of your process. It's been really enriching for me. Thank you. And one other administrative adjustment before we finish, so, but it has to do with SL number one, comments first. Y, I just want to make that at the end so we don't close. Then go ahead. I just wanted to say, say thank you to everyone, to the county staff, to all the leadership team that came and presented, and also the community members, to five of you that participated. It was a bit bumpy last year for all of us figuring out the quorum, how many votes it takes to pass and whatnot. So thank you for your participation, full participation, and really, the hard questions and the comments that you provided even gave me an educational opportunity to even dig deep and learn more of this budget that we're about to approve. I'm just really appreciative of all of you and look forward to seeing you again, hopefully next year. And I also want to know extend thank you to chair Harrington for all your mentorship along the side of how to navigate this parliamentary procedure and teaching us. And I'm very glad that the chair of the budget committee, you're sitting right next to the subject matter experts of all parliamentary procedures. So, so thank you. I just, and even extending your knowledge to me, too. You know, it's not just parliamentary, but also you've got enormous amount information in your head, chair Harrington, and I appreciate you sharing that with all of us. So thank you just one little for our board. Our Washington County Coordinating committee is ##nna have an agenda on MStip and as the board rep. I will carry the vote that happened today and the overwhelming vote that took place when it came to that topic and look forward to sending that message to the committee of where the board is and where the budget committee was today. I think you'll likely find that there are multiple commissioners who attend that Zoom meeting. Anyone else? I'll just say, also, thank you for the support. I was hoping to learn how to be a chair, and I learned a lot, so thank you. Well, usually I hold my comments until budget adoption, but there's so much work that that's gone into this and a lot of learning along the way. And since we have a lot of our staff, we have several of our staff problem solvers in the room today, I want to take some time to reflect on this. First, I want to say thank you to our budget committee community members. I really appreciate the time that you spend learning the proposed budget, as well as trying to spend time watching us during the course of the year, through our new management and with these colleagues of mine on the board of commissioners, we've been doing a tremendous amount of foundation building and improving the culture and system of the Washington county government. And it's not just a village, it's an army, and you're part of that. So thank you. I think you've gotten a lot of insight as to what the job of the board of commissioners is. You've heard reference to different programs along the way. One that we didn't spend time really highlighting is that this board asked, directed Miss Angie to work throughout the organization to deliver a first ever public safety and justice assessment. And it was our direction, not this committee work, that really did the assessment of where we were. And Miss Angie helped the board develop, just like we have in prior years, our budget principles and our budget priorities in the development of the proposed budget. And I'm really proud of how all of the leadership throughout the vast portfolio that is Washington county and the depth of the different functional areas. I am really proud and grateful for all of the collaborative problem solving that you've gone through. I'm just. It'incredible.",

        "text": " with them on battery storage. So battery storage is kind of becoming a big deal. PGE'of, course, more interested in that, as well as number of other companies. But so she kind of explained that to me and what the purpose of and why she switched jobs. She'd been with PGE for 20 years and decided it was time for a new adventure. So she did that. But other than that, it's a pretty quiet week and we're going to enjoy it, because after Labor Day, it's back to work. So that's all I got you. Yes. Well, according to my calendar, next week isn't going to be a quiet week, but I am going to enjoy the fact that it is the last week before Labor Day weekend, and therefore the month of September. So, continuing on the theme of the congress, August resets. Last week, Congressomman Bonamichi had a tour of THPRD tpening center. This is related to the Natural Hazards mitigation plan and a grant request that THD has made to Congress. And John Wheeler spoke rather well about this. And THPRD was one of the eleven partners in that the development of that joint hazard mitigation planning project. And they approved their annex to the county wide plan this spring, which was the same day we approved it. They requested a $950,000 federal appropriation through the congresswoman, and if approved, it would give them funding to address soon six of the 17 mitigation actions on their annex of the plan. That would include engineering studies to address seismic vulnerabilities, H VAC, and other structural and equipment limitations at several of their facilities. So, for example, we had the opportunity to go into the tennis center, where they don't have air conditioning for the main part of it, just for the office. But if they need to house people for a mass event, we're going to need air conditioning during the hot summer months, similarly better heating in the cold weather months. We also similarly walked over to the building. I can't remember the name of it, but it's where the volleyball courts and the pickleball courts are as well. So it was great to physically see the structures and to see where the dollars would be put into action. I was reminded because we were on the tail end of our last heat event last week, that part of the space that we saw was part of the facility that was used for a cooling shelter. And I did not know that THPRd houses, Red Cross, Red Cross equipment, trailer and their facilities are recognized as Red Cross and county shelter locations. So they also have arrangements with the Beaveron School District to be used as a student PA reunification site and they have other preparedness partners with the city of Beaverton and TVWD. So fingers crossed on that. I had one of those deer in the headlight moments that you never want to have and I could remember John's first name, but then I kept thinking of the two different John Williams that I've known for a long time and I finally gave up and I said, john, I know your last name is not Williams, but I can't remember. He was s like Wheeler. So hopefully that is tattooed on my brain yesterday and thank you to John for participating and speaking eloquently. Yesterday I had the monthly chair mayors meeting and our sheriff briefed the mayors on his status with regard to jail staffing and how that's led to an additional pod closure and how he and his team with county support and our support are really working intently on solving the staffing problem. But it's going to be with us for a while, 18 months to two years, because you have to go through the recruitment, the training and whatnot. So there are near term problems that we've already provided guidance to. The one fact though, that I had the benefit of hearing from him both in a briefing with me earlier and in that meeting is with these pod closures. It's less bad than what we experienced during COVID Now, I know that's no small comfort, but it shows that we got through that and we can get through this too, and we will. So hopefully the consequences or the effect, not consequences, the effect in our community will not be as high as my imagination has gone wild with moving on. The tri county chairs meeting yesterday, we talked about ambulance response, so Clackamas county and Multnomah county are each suffering from response times in their jurisdictions. Some of the failures have been within seconds, a small matter of seconds so Clackamas county has moved to, they have a performance based contract with a two month review. What they would rather not do is continue on a path where they're levving the full fines, which by the end of the year would be to the tune of a million dollars. And why I spoke to the end of the years because that's the response that AMR has said it will take. So it is",

        "text": " a number of comments about the operational aspects of the facility and what they would do to manage vegetation and inspect components to ensure that the components themselves aren't proposing a ignition risk. The certificate holder did provide the revised plan that had this table in it, this information kind, explaining what their inspection schedule would look like. I it provides for visual inspections of most components, at least on a quarterly basis, with some components inspected annually. There's a more detailed list of this in the plan itself, and they would be doing annual inspections to ensure compliance with the avian power line interaction committee recommendations, and that's specifically inspecting the transmission line components to ensure that the protections to prevent avian electrocutions are in place, and then they would be doing inspections to ensure that the clearances are maintained and gravel pads are free of vegetation and the defensible spaces are maintained. You know, on this more annual basis, I guess I'm probably not able to speak to the actual standards and manufacturers recommendations in detail, but if there are any questions on this, we could discuss further. Yeah, I think that's good that there are s some time frames here. I would think that with vegetation in particular, those would be being preventative, so we would do those. They don't specify what time of year here, is that correct? I'd have to go back and look. My recollection is that the vegetation inspections and an annual vegetation management plan, as far as they're going to do spraying and mowing for this stuff, would be prepared before the fire season each year. But I. I'm sure that the county weed that's the expert here, has given that input as to when they would like to see these things done, because, you know, the council'presented, with a pretty high level understanding of that. So I just wanted to make sure that that collaboration was happening. I believe that the weed supervisor is more directly involved with the weed treatments in the weed eradication program. But as far as things as, like what section of the transmission line needs to be moded or when trimming needs to occur to maintain the five foot clearances from the transmission lines is kind of a separate issue. Well, I'm just talking about when they're doing it, when they're performing the inspection, and when they're, you know, that's the only thing. And I don't want to get too far into this. I understand this. This is out of my wheelhouse, but as long as's being done at the appropriate time. Yeah. And I do believe that before the fire season and making sure that that trimming is done before the fire season is the right time. Again, I'm little over my skis and I can pull up the plan itself, if that'd be helpful. But I just want to make sure that the coordination and collaboration is happening. That's where this is. My question is more geared towards. So, thank you. If I could get the next slide. Yeah. Similarly, this just kind of lists the particular vegetation management standards. I do want to point out that I believe the I own rural fire protection district requested a 100 foot defensible space around structures, and that would include U, the substation control building, and I think the battery site itself, which they're kind of on a combined site. And we did request that be included in a condition. And I don't think that particular setback distance showed up in the management plan. So I think that would exceed that defensible space would exceed these standards. Otherwise, the standards are based kind of on the engineering details and the likelihood of arcane based on the voltage of the equipment. And that's beyond my particular knowledge set. So otherwise, these are the standards that would apply. It's the International Institute of Electrical Engineers standards, the National Electric Committee standards, and the, which are, I think, also adopted by the National Fire Protection association and then the National Electric Rely Corporation standards. A lot of acronyms. A lot of acronyms. And I. Yeah, please, please don't ask me to explain what's, what's in. All right, next slide, please. So to kind of go through the issues, we heard concerns about hazard from lightning strikes and both, I think the hazard from lighting striking turbines and the hazard of whitening, starting a fire at the site and that getting out of control and the extra equipment being out there. So it's not referenced in the wildfire plan or the associated documentation, but in the project description portion of the RFA one, the certificate holder did indicate that a lightning protection system would be incorporated into the turbine blades. That, from what I understand, provides a pathway for the current to go through the blades and downunce through the tower and be grounded to reduce fire risk. I think the certificate holder represents that that would eliminate fire risk from lightning. And I think we all know that's not the case. It reduces it or minimizes it, but there is still some risk there. The wildfire mitigation plan",

        "text": " out, I think that will also inform a. Those will indicate what's being looked for. Okay, then. And the FEC permit process does offer that dynamic kind of scope versus specific. I can speak to that a little bit. Yeah. So the applicant team, like they mentioned, have asked for flexibility to use multiple different chemistries. So we kind of look at the worst case scenario to determine compliance with the standards and also what the additional conditions of approval would be. So, for example, we know nithium ion chemistries can have a little higher fire risk of some thermal. So we'll look at that for determining compliance with wildfire. They also, I think, typically have bigger h vac systems, so they might have a little larger noise profile. So we permit to allow them that flexibility to kind do something less impactful if they want to use a different chemistry'technology, neutral in that way. So as that's developed and built out, will that be published as part of the permit, the more specific data needs and support needs of the buyers. Right. Maybe the final design, I expect, will be publicly available. Yeah, we will, we will require a final site design, so we'll kind of need you to say how many containers and where. And we'll need you to do a final noise analysis. But I don't know if we'll get into the really detailed technical engineering or the technical standards because that's a little outside of what the council looks at. Right. But as far as the final permit, we'have all the different technical conditions and standards that they have to meet regardless of technology. Yeah. And obviously all of our supply agreements are offtake agreements, etcetera, all that's pretty confidential, but. Oh, right. But I would love to keep a dialogue going with you. I can tell this is a subject that you pass general, give you as much information as we're allowed to give. Sure. Good. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Ro right, anyone else in the audience, questions or general comments? I'll let you think about it a little bit more, see if we have anybody online. Right. Mark Henry. And you'see. Right. Mark Henry, if you're there, please go ahead. Hi, can you hear me? Yes, we can. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I'm an industry person. I've, you know, studied a lot of different battery chemistries, and I've looked at a lot of you public and private companies just staying on the topic of battery storage, I guess given the fact that this is, you know, going to be a seven gigawatt hour proposed project, how critical is it that the supplier of the battery energy storage system, whether it be zinc hybrid or lithium ion, how critical is it that they have the manufacturing capacity to be able to provide seven gigawatt hours of, of batteries in the timeframe that the project is going to be developed? And just on the notion that lithium ion does propose significant thermal Runway and fire risk, how much of that is a decision factor in making a decision of which technology to select it for the project? Great. Thank you, Mark. This is Logan, and I'll take, I guess, the question in two parts. First of all, the ability of the manufacturers to supply the equipment that's needed for the facility is a very key consideration in the procurement process for us. And tier point, will, you know, influence which provider we go with, which technology we go with based on kind of those supp, supply chain dynamics that exists when we get to that decision point. On the second question, you know, we have a number of exhibits and attachments in the application that address kind of fire risk, wildfire risk, um, all the preventative measures that we're going to commit to taking to, to minimize and contain that risk. And ultimately, you know, we will not be allowed to build a facility that does not comply with the conditions of the site certificate. And we do expect there will be conditions addressing some of those concerns as well. That's about as technical as I can get on it. We'd be happy to get your information and maybe put you in touch with some of our folks to have a deeper discussion. But I don't know, Lina, if you want to add anything to that tonight. Just that the fire management plan. Yeah, it's called the fire management plan. Trying to remember all the titles of it is an attachment to exhibit v, as in victor of the application. So there's a fair amount of detail, both in your construction and operation, about considerations that will need to be taken to reduce the risk of fire either moving through the facility or being created by facility construction or operation. Got it. Thank you so much for your response. This is one follow up in exhibit b in the application. It shows very clearly that",

And then you can also follow up and provide it after the meeting if there's, you know, something that comes to mind when you start kind of processing the discussion. We have few hands up. So. Yeah. So, Ben, I see you first. I don't know who raised the hand first, but I see your hand is up. Ye. So, yeah, on the last topic, I'm just kind of curious. It seemed like in that initial assessment that office buildings with higher occupancy had lower euis or higher higher utilization hours. Did I misinterpret what I was seeing on that chart a few slides back? Yeah, that was kind of an interesting data point. Maybe that ties into that. But, yeah, I'm curious to see what Vin data says as well. And then in terms of meeting the goals of the bill and meeting our goals here, I think, you know, I wanted to concur with Clark's assessment that, you know, if we're really trying to maximize our emission reductions, I can't think of any solid reason that we wouldn't go with the averages with the most stringent that we're allowed to, especially since, you know, in comparison to some of these other bills, they are not particularly stringent. Wonderful. Thank you for that feedback. And then let's go to Ka and then JP and then care. Thanks so much. Yeah, I just wanted to support. I actually raised my hand not knowing that Ben was going to as well, but support Clark's comment and Ben's as well. And just hearken back to the language of the statute, which does invite us puts a sort of a clap on what's the most we can do. And so I would just urge us to be as ambitious as possible unless there's something more that we ought to know that makes. That is persuasive or compelling evidence for why we wouldn't try and both meet the answer, the invitation, while also responding to the requirement that we maximize emissions reductions. Thank you. Wonderful. Thank you. I'm assuming, Poppy, that we don't need to respond to those. We could hear them since if there is anything, please jump in. But let's hear from JP and then Kerry, please. Yeah, hi. I raised my hand when we were talking about the euis from pre Covid and post Covid. I just have some experience looking at a private data set so it's not a public data set. So I don't really know how relevant it is, but anecdotally, it's kind of interesting. I've looked at data sets around commercial buildings, about 16,000, 16 million square foot, and the difference in occupancy has been drastic. You know, across Seattle, what, Oregon, Denver, different markets. It's gone from, you know, like average around 18 90% occupancy down to, you know, the heights of the pandemic. And it hasn't really recovered. It was around ten to 20% of actual occupancy, and that affected the total energy consumption of those buildings by about 20%, which is quite interesting. So it's not a one to one correlation, but it definitely did decrease the intensity of, you know, the energy intensity of those buildings quite significantly. As I say, they still, it is still, we're still in a post pandemic state. In commercial real estate, things have definitely not recovered back to three pandemic levels. So I just thought that might be interesting for folks. Good, thank you for the insight. We appreciate it. Carrry, go ahead. Good to see you, car. Yeah, hi. So first off, I also support setting the targets at the mean, since that's the most stringent allowed, and that's not all that stringent, but my other comment is kind of, it's a, I'm getting brainstormy on key drivers for targets and thinking about some of the lessons learned in Washington and just other things we're trying to accomplish in the region. And I'm curious, I'm gonn, I don't know the answer to this. I'm gonna put it in y'all's hands or put it out to the rest of the rack. But how could we consider flexibility in buildings and in the EUI target setting? I don't know if that's a possible place to take it into consideration. I know it's come up in the working group discussions in Washington as well, that when building owners are undertaking, you know, putting battery storage on their facility or using OnS site renewable generation and other things, how can they be credited in their ability to sort of flex their load during peak times and support other kind of goals that Oregon might have with grid modernization and overall renewable adoption on the power supply side? Just putting it out there, I don't know the answer. Thanks, Kere. I think that's a great topic for",

        "text": "PPP day head markets, that's, that's something that we don't consider in a model because it is a, it's a physical representation model where you could consider the system operator being a benevolent westwide system operator. And that works well for a long term analysis when we're going out to 2050 just because we want to look at what are the ideal outcomes and operations for an energy system in the future and kind of so setting ourselves a target for what could be achieved through the different mechanisms that are available to us today. So we can think in the long term of, of everything that is, is currently the way that we operate markets or regulate markets right now as, as things that serve us. They are, they are mechanisms that, that should be suited to the way that our energy system looks. And if they're not serving us as we move forward into a decarbonized future or higher renewable future, then those would be levers to pool and change. So we're trying to, to level up above that a little bit and look at if things were dispatched, ideally, what would the outcome look like? And I think that the processes that you're highlighting there are efforts that are in somewhat in response to changes that we're seeing already in the marketplace. Right. Thank you. Let's go to Brandon, who has a hand raised. And Jeremy, as we're doing, I just keep scanning some of the questions. I'll work through them. Brandon, can you unmute and ask your question? Ok, let's see if we can get someone who can speak out loud, Eric Strid, and try that. Hope it's on a technical issue. Eric, can you unmute? Yeah. Successful. Ask your question, please. My question is this. Modeling apparently relies on data and calculations that are all proprietary to eer in the quest for openness and transparencies. To what degree can we trust all this modeling? How do we know the accuracy or gaps in the data or unintentional biases of the inputs or the interpretations? For example, how well does the ER, model agree with other tools that are available, some of which is just open source and online. Thank you. So all of the data that is going into it will be public. And, and that, that, that's actually a process that we've, we've gone through the last few weeks of identifying. What are the data sets that are specific to Oregon that are going to be, give us the best character characterization for the state. So the, the data inputs and assumptions will, will all be transparent and open at the end of the process here. And you'll see in the working groups the ones that are being used. If you have alternatives that we should be using, then, then please bring those up in the, in the working group sessions. The models themselves, they are, they are proprietary. And the challenge there is that, you know, it is, it is our ip, but they, they also, in terms of the open source models, we include a lot more detail in there. You can see some comparisons. For example, if you look at our national hydrogen work, that work has been compared against about twelve other models that were also modeling the impacts of IRA on, on hydrogen adoption. And, and that highlights the, the differences in similarities. So there are some comparisons out there of our work with others. And we can also share a lot of detail about what, what are our models actually doing. And we have detailed technical appendices that we can put the details of, into, into the chat or share them a later date. That's great. Thanks. J. We had a question around from Jennifer building new gases prohibited in Washington. How does that factor in relying on imports? Question mark. So, so building, building resources are, they're constrained based on the policies that are set in different states. And so that, that does factor into, into the modeling. If we don't have the availability of resources in particular places, the model has to find an alternative for that. And so it is representing the realism of, of policy impacts that we see state to state. Right. Thank you, Alan. You I a handoff. Yeah. Back on Eric Strid's question. So the whole point of the working groups is to actually go through all of that information and work through that stuff so that, that, that we get the inputs into the model correctly and that the workgroup is informed of that and, and helps formulate the inputs into the model. I'll also point out that what the model does is actually create the, what things will occur in a particular scenario, the reference scenario, or any of the other ones that we look at and will, and then, but it doesn't necessarily get into how exactly that, that particular action gets done or the very detailed specific. A lot of the questions that we're getting here are like two levels down from what the",

        "text": " it might impact, most of the answers should be there. And if you ever need help navigating that, you can find information for my information on our project page. You can also find the applicant's information if you have questions for them. After the ASC, the department will after we review the ASC, the department will prepare what's called a draft proposed order. I'll get into a little more detail about what that entails in later slides, but generally the drop propose order is the department's initial findings of facts and recommended conclusions of law and recommendations, other recommendations of the council on whether or not the facility would comply with all the applicable requirements and whether or not we recommend that the council should issue a site certificate. There is a public comment process associated with the draft proposed order. Members of the public can submit public comments both on what's in the DPO or the DRaf proposed order and on the application itself. And it's important to note that to preserve your standing or to preserve the ability to participate later in the process, if there's a contested case, you must comment on the DPO during that comment period. So I'll bring that point up several times just because it's very, I think, important if you're interested in participating in this process. So after the comment period'over, the department will present its recommendations and all the comments to the council, and then we'll prepare a proposed order, and along with that proposed order'come, a notice of contested case where people, if they disagree with our recommendations, can request a contested case hearing on issues. Again, I'll just repeat that only persons who raise a relevant issue in person at the public hearing, in writing or in writing by the common deadline on the DPO, may participate in that contested case, and that process is run by an independent hearing officer that's appointed by the coun council. Usually that's somebody from the Oregon office of Administrative Hearings, but it could be another third party or a council member. So after the contested case proceeding is done or has run its case, or if there's no issues immediately, the council or FSEC will be reviewing the proposed order, the information in the IC, and making their final decision on whether they will approve or deny the application for site certificate. Okay, so just to show kind of how this facility or this project has worked. So, yeah, as I mentioned, we got the notice of intent in 2022, and we again had that informational meeting out here at that time. We issued a project order that September and then got the preliminary application for site certificate in just about a year ago, in June of 2023. The department has consulted with our other agency partners, tribal governments and local governments to make sure that the information in that preliminary application was complete and contained sufficient information for us to recommend findings to the council on all the applicable laws, rules and standards. The applicant responded to all those requests and issued their complete application just last month on May, which is, again, the application that contains all the information that the department determined would be sufficient for us to recommend findings. So from this point on, we are a little speculative on our timeline, but our best guess at this point is that we'll be issuing that draft proposed order in June or July. So towards the end of the month or early next month, and at that time, we'll be issuing a public notice that contains more information about the public comment period. How you can comment I'll be showing again how to sign up for updates, but if you are interested in receiving that notice, we do recommend that you sign up to get those updates for when that comes out. CA because it is very important we'll be having a public hearing on the DPO back here in this area, so likely in Morrow county, either here in Boardman or another local community. We're right now anticipating that to be in August, but that could change. So again, please do sign up for updates if you'd like to know more. And then from there the process will continue, kind of based on the level of participation receive and the council schedule as well. I will what the experts in the room give you really the details about the project itself. But just so we all know why we're here, the Sunstone project is a proposed solar facility that would have up to 1.2 gigawatts of generating capacity, 7.2 gigawatt hours of battery storage, six collector substations and an interconnection substation up to four own in buildings, and 9.5 miles of overhead transmission line. And then I noticed that I didn't finish filling out my slide and so I figured I might pop quiz you all, but I do have the answer. It would be up to 55 miles of access roads and 58 miles of perimeter fencing. I think those are a lot of pieces, but one of the things that people are most interested in are kind what is the overall footprint of this? And",

So having miss is, should she get through the Senate rules Committee and the full Senate vote would be an important geographic representation that we haven't had for. For some period of time. Miss Imes currently serves as a council member on for the town of Lexington, so she's a city council member, and previously she was the Morl county transit manager. So she lives in a good area and she has a lot of interest in terms of these facilities. The Senate Rules Committee will meet early February to review and recommend appointees, and the full Senate should vote shortly after that. Do not have the exact dates yet. If Miss is is confirmed, she would participate in the February council meeting, and therefore this could be councilmb member Trut's final meeting to be determined, but it could be. So if that is the case, I just want to take the opportunity to say that it's been a pleasure to work with you and to provide whatever assistance we can to you in your hard work and efforts, and my sincerest gratitude on all of your hard work and thoughtful deliberations on, you know, what are some very complicated projects. Well, thank you, Todd. And for the record, this is Jordan Tru. It's beenn a whileild for years. It's been a very interesting time. I don't know that I was aware this might potentially be my last meeting, but in the event that it is, thank you to everyone for staff and the support of fellow council members in the public. It's been very informative and educational, and I will definitely keep close tabs on what's going on. So thank you, Todd. So it's always a little awkward because the timing of the replacements. So if it is, we will invite you back and have a proper thank you at a future time. And if this is not my last meeting, then I'll do this again. I just, this is count our chair. Gr I just want to say that one thank you for sticking around when you didn't have to, to make sure that we could continue conducting business. And I definitely will take you up on that follow up because, you know, we still haven't played golf yet. So let's go. Next, I would like to introduce Amric KR. She is our new operations and policy analyst and replaces Wally Adams. Amri started on December 4. She comes to us from the private sector and most recently was an operations project manager for remotely video, where she did extensive project management and business process improvement. So she's got a lot of experience in there, which is really primarily what the position is designed for. So she is still very much coming up to speed on working for the state of Oregon as well as working in sort of the nuance of what we do. But she's making very significant progress and will likely be on the agenda for next month to have her annual work program reviewed and approved by the council in terms of what the process of improvement projects she'll be working on in the near term. So welcome, amr. We have an interesting tradition at the sighting division. I'm not sure we'ever told you about this, but when it's somebody's birthday during our staff meetings, we kazoo them, happy birthday. And that's usually really poorly done, but it's fun nonetheless. So on Tuesday, Dwayne was not at our staff meeting because he normally doesn't work on Friday. So he switched his days to be able to be here today for the agenda item. So we did not Kazoo, happy birthday to Dwayne. Tomorrow's his birthday. I'm not going to do it today, but I just want to express since we missed it, happy birthday. Happy early birthday. Next are project updates. So the first is on the Muddy Creek Energy park. As a reminder, the project is currently proposed as a 199 megawatt solar pv and battery storage facility located immediately east of Interstate five and approximately 8 miles south of the City of Brownsville. The project would occupy 1588 acres, or 2.5 sq. Mi. The project is currently in the notice of intent phase and the applicant has not yet submitted their application to us, although we do believe that will be coming very shortly. So more importantly for the purpose of this update is there is no current open public comment period. So last week, both councilmb members Truitt and councilmeer Cond and received emails from members of the public. I people just sort of searched you all out and tried to find your emails, and you both received emails expressing opposition to the project. Councilmber Truitt and Councilmber Con and promptly sent those emails to me asking what you should do with them. And so essentially where we're at now, because there's no open public comment timeframe, this creates a potential issue with the record.",

We appreciate it and we hope you come back to give us an update when you feel it's appropriate. Thank you. Thanks. And I'll just add so folks, have an idea because I know I've been focused on kind of this summer. The strategy is due November of next year, and we'll kick off the more detailed policy discussions, which I think is where a lot of those regional conversations will be particularly valuable. U early next year. I can't say exactly when, but kind of I have in mind February timefraame. I don't know if that's right, but, but, and I very much appreciate that. The kind of emphasis on making sure that we hear from all corners of the state sles. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, the next item is public comment. So Nancy. Well, first of all, I'll ask is there anyone. Well, let me read this. This is an information item. It's, this time is reserved for the public to address the council regarding any item within council jurisdiction that's not otherwise closed for comment. Items closed for comment are the wagon trail solar draft proposed order and the boardman to Hemingway amendment two draft proposed order. We've set the amount of time for individual commenters at seven minutes and I have folks here in the audience, we've got Troy Jones and Irene Gilbert. So, Mister Jones, would you like to come up? It's on. Oh, it's on. Okay, than you. You're good to go. Thank you, chair Hal. Council members, it's good to be back again here in Salem. Be able to see you. I've attended the number of meetings since January and I've been learning a little as we go along. It's very informative. And thank you for allowing us to have a moment to speak. I wanted to go through a couple items, just review, kind of give an update as to where we're at. And then I have a couple observations. We'll try to keep it within that seven minutes. So first I wanted to notify the council that we have followed your thought process and we are pursuing change in the statute, 469.504 with the Legislative Council. We've got it before legislative council doing a review with them to see how everything alignies. So I want to thank you everyone for that direction that we were provided. I also wanted to let you know that we have friends of Gap Road has formally organized since a couple months ago when we were speaking. We're considered a nonprofit pack at this point in time. So I just think I should go on the record to state that I also should say, I guess this is Troy Jones for the record. 22 33 five gap road. Thank you. I apologize for missing that. A couple observations. Look, it's really, to me, it's really interesting and it's very clear that this council understands the tension between land use, proper land use, and the need for green energy or clean energy, where it does not go unnoticed. That you all have a strong sense of the rural heart, if you will, of their values. And the things that I've noticed as we've gone along is the attention to the potential wildfire, noxious weed, control, aesthetics, all that you're taking into consideration. And for that we're very, very thankful. I think that that's very important, that tension will continue, obviously, but we, but we do recognize, or at least I recognize that that effort is being applied. And, and it's very important that you continue to do that. So we also see that you don't take these responsibilities lightly. And for that I'm very appreciative. So that was about all I had for today and I wanted to thank everybody for the time. Thank you very much, Mister Jones. The second one we have is Irene Gilbert. Hi, Irene Gilbert, 23 ten Adams Avenue. And I also appreciated the discussion about goal three from the council and your review of that, and continued concern with making sure you do that right. One thing, at the last meeting, one of the, the presenters said, when do I get to ask questions of the council? And I've been thinking about that and I think. I think that's a really important issue because really there is no communication back and forth between council members and the public. And I think it's a lost opportunity for the council when that does not occur. One thing I can tell you about my own experience during a previous, actually, amendment one, there was some discussion about, I made a comment about not feeling that the public had been notified of their rights to participate in the, in some changes to site certificate conditions. And I believe in my comment, I said it was not my intent to ask for contested cases on that issue, but what I did do is send a letter to",

But the way that, that informs decision making in the best way possible is to make sure that we are asking the questions that, that are the largest uncertainties in Oregon are the most important policy priorities or the things that are going to move the needle the most between one future and another. And so that's where the input from everybody on this call will be really valuable to us to be able to characterize that. We are starting from developing a reference scenario and this is developing an Oregon specific database using the best available resources. And this past month we've been going through meetings with various data holders to make sure that we are using the best available data sets that are out there. We are defining reference scenario assumptions. So what is the starting point of assumptions for stakeholders to react to and suggest changes? These are going to come into the working group meetings over the next month as something to, to refine. And then in addition to the reference scenario, we're developing a set of interesting questions. So what are the most pressing questions, the largest uncertainties, the state priorities that are going to provide the most valuable information to policymakers. And we'll develop a starting point study, some starting point study questions that can be refined and, and narrowed down to a final set of five scenarios to be modeled in addition to the reference scenario components of a scenario. This is showing a conceptual idea of some of the things that are going into a scenario. The, the process for us will be to develop a set of interesting questions and then translate those into scenarios with quantitative inputs. Some of the examples on the right hand side there are demonstrating things that could be changed in the input assumptions. So vehicle electrification, for example, we could have more or less of that. Then there's things that we could switch on or turn off in the model. So can we build new gas? Is Ira going to roll off early? Things like that? And the model is optimizing decisions informed by those levers. So we're testing uncertainties. We're looking at the impact of different policies, different actions or customer behavior to see how we would supply energy differently, what would be the different trade offs between scenarios? If we do less in one part of the economy, we would need to do more in another part of the economy, and what would be the consequences of that? So the interesting comparisons between scenarios are going to illuminate some useful information for making decisions. The reference scenario database is using Oregon specific data, and I'm just noting some of the data that, that is going into it here. So transportation data from, from ODOT, EPA moves, building data from, from NIA, benchmarking against EIA SEDS data for Oregon, the DEQ emissions inventory, planned resource investments coming from utility IRPs data center and crypto forecast data and population data. And we are still in this process of reviewing these data sources and making sure that these are up to date and the best available. So, defining key questions, this portion of the working group meetings, what is it that we're actually doing or looking for in this step? And we are really asking a couple of questions here. What do we want to learn, first of all, so what are the questions that are going to illuminate the biggest uncertainties in Oregon? What can we learn with the tools that we have? So that's kind of the second piece, the translation, how we translating those questions into the modeling work. So the feedback in the working group sessions that will be focused on specific parts of the economy or topic areas is going to be looking at. What are these interesting questions? And a format that, that we find works quite well is to frame these in a what if format. So what if things were to turn out differently? Or what if we had different policy choices? And some examples are shown there at the bottom. So what if developing new clean energy resources is delayed? The challenges on cing and permitting new resources? What if consumer adoption of technologies like heat pumps and EV's occurs more slowly than expected? What if transmission expansion to access resources outside of Oregon is harder than expected? What if hydrogen pipelines and other clean fuel delivery systems cannot be constructed between Oregon and other states? So all of these are framed in a way that suggests an uncertainty in the future. One thing to note is that with one scenario, we can potentially answer multiple questions. So we take that first one. What if developing new clean energy resources is delayed? That could be an uncertainty where we would have liked to have more clean energy resources developed, but we couldn't get them because of unforeseen barriers to getting those resources built. But it also could represent a policy choice where we don't want to build this as much because of stricter environmental controls. And so what if we were to limit the amount of clean energy resources built in the state. So that, that's a way of one scenario answering a couple of different questions and representing different, different",

        "text": " footprint, but there are offsets that can be invested in as a way to allow you to travel. So unless we get to a point where we're just like, literally not moving anywhere, we're probably going to have transportation emissions footprints, our building sector that's getting driven down naturally. But some of these other things we're just not going to be able to fully, like, eliminate. Right, right. And on the topic of air travel. So thanks for bringing that up. Does this take into account what Hio is putting out? What Hillsborough airport is putting out? It is. Okay. So you're not putting that aside as though it's port of Portland and not part of Hillsboro. You are including. It's actually both. And let's see. So air travel is included in that transport. It's on the top of that transportation bar. And that looks at both travel from Hillsborough airport as well as an estimate of. Actually, I take that back. I believe the green bar includes the Hillsboro travel because we can actually measure that from fuel sales. The magenta bar on the top that says air travel, that's the estimated amount of PDX travel that Hillsborough residents are contributing. Oh, so that's based on. So the top bar is based on, like, population and sort of internationally recognized estimates of how much people travel in the community. So just to be sure, I understand the green bar is from hio. And the top magenta bar, where it says air travel, is people leaving Hillsborough going to PDX and flying out of PDX. Yeah. And then. So the green bar, the majority of the green bar is you driving cars? That's cars, yeah. And a little bit of that is the trucks on the road. Thank you. Yeah. Any other questions before I move us on? Okay, let's move forward. Okay. So this spring we hosted three community stakeholder workshops with experts who work or volunteer in the sectors with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. So we discussed the most promising activities to cut emissions for consideration in our climate plan. In transportation, we discussed plans to support electric vehicle charging in more parts of the city and strategies to make transit more equitably available and a viable option for more people. We're also looking at ways to make the city more bike friendly and moving toward expanding the availability of renewable diesel at our gas stations. In building energy, we talked about city support for programs to enable home energy efficiency projects, more home energy scoring, and city owned battery storage systems. In consumption, we shared a need to consider ways to promote more plant based eating, especially reducing our beef and dairy intake. We also discussed ways to ensure the community has information and tools to reduce food waste and compost food scraps. And we're looking at low carbon concrete standards. So our consultant team is currently evaluating these that I just mentioned, as well as other recommendations to help us scale the impacts of the actions, prioritize them, and develop partnerships to implement the measures. So in June, you got a chance to hear from the Youth Advisory council's climate Resilience and Sustainability subcommittee, who developed the city's climate change page in coordination with the city's communications and sustainability teams. The new page is linked from the city's sustainability page, or you can go directly there using the QR code shown on this slide. So we're glad to have this site available to provide data driven information, helpful resources for our community, and as a place to share updates as we build our climate action plan. The page includes information about what the city is doing, ways community members can take action, and programs that help address the impacts of our changing climate. Robin, I believe Castor Sinclair has a question. Thank you. Thank you so much. This is Councillor Sinclair. Robin, how often does DEQ submit admissions reports to Hillsboro? And what, as a partner, what is their plan for projected growth in maintaining? I do not know the answer to those questions, so I'm going to jot those down and get back to you on those. Unless anyone else knows about our, the reporting we get from DEQ. I don't get specific reports, but someone in the city may be getting. Okay. Okay. I'll look into that and see if I can find out some more information. Thank you so much, Robin. And councillor Alcare, I'm not sure if you. I do have a question, Robin, can you go back to the slide before this one? Yes. So for consumption, are we. These things are things that are being considered in the workshops, are we. Well, is consumption also, are we prescribing diet changes that people should consider making or should start making? And I'm, I'm, I'm not against this, but I'm just reluctant to say that without, like, USDA present. No, the city will not be. Yeah, we're not. Yeah. So there won't be any prescriptive diet recommendations from the",

        "text": "% when the actual entity that's using the electricity needs to see the raise in prices. And so I just wanted to mention that, you know, I've been getting a lot of concern over that issue. I haven't really fed into it. I just listened to it. But 11% is quite a bit for a power bill. So I just want to say thank you for tolerating me. I appreciate it. We appreciate you, too. And without stepping out of line, I'm going to suggest that you direct folks over to the Oregon Public Utility Commission. They deal with the investor owned utilities and their rates. That's not really our space in place, but concerns about that. And they can always participate in the integrated resource plan hearings that occur as well as the rate cases. And as they study along and see what's happening with the storms and the wildfire mitigation, don't be surprised to see more of that. So I'll, anyway, that's my opinion on there. Council, councilmber Meer, just to add on to coun councilor funding's request, if we could get an update from somebody probably in the department or the industry, kind of telling us the council is perceived as a barrier to development of renewable energy. But, but we all know that there are other barriers out there, whether it's supply chain, the interconnect labor issues, you know, what are some of the other issues facing the industry and what are some of the improvements? I mean, I know panels have improved 20 fold in the last ten years. Battery storage, what the options are there because I think we'll see those as part of facilities. So just somebody who could help us be a little more technologically savvy. And I know I have my big department of Energy annual report, but my sense is that the world has changed even since then. So again, just a briefing, probably from somebody within Doe about, you know, what the world looks like. So for the record, to cornet, I'll ask this question. We could have somebody, there are people within the Department of Energy who have that certainly that kind of expertise can provide something along those lines. So we could do that sooner rather than later. The department is also currently by director from the legislature doing a energy strategy, and that's, you know, that's going toa be ongoing for a little while. So I don't think we would on a waitill the end of that, but I'm wondering if you would rather wait till some midpoint of that because there may be good information that gets gleaned. You know, the department, at least the sort of the point person, point people for the department working on that are going to reach out to a bunch of just different stakeholders to figure out, you know, what's our sort of strategy. But in trying to determine the strategy is also pulling a lot of those elements to figure out, you know, what are the different scenarios if we go, you know, more offshore wind, more onshore wind and solar, you know, other types of things, and then getting into those sort of barriers, limitations, opportunities, you know, that's really what that report, I think is going to ultimately conclude, you know, and sort of recommend where our future is going. So again, it's really a question sooner or more like three, six months. Oay I will put it on. We have a listing of future potential agenda items. So I've already included the BPA one. I'm going to add that one. And then we can begin having conversations, you know, with our counterparts within the department to figure out what would be a good time to provide some of that information. Just a brief council member. Trueitt yeah. Just wanted to leave us with a brief story. Feel good, maybe practical application of what we do here and how it kind of, I don't know, I'taken what I've learned here and put it in real practice, and it involves myself, a cross country road trip and my ten year old daughter. And we drove to Louisiana over Christmas. We went through eleven states there and back, and we talked at length about wind turbines because as soon as you get down the gorge, you start seeing wind turbines. And it would be moments of silence followed by dad. And I thought a very serious father daughter conversation was coming on. And it was always a question about wind turbines and going down 84 and seeing the blades and the tower sections. And she would ask, well, why is that blade bent back at the end? It's kind of bowed. And my assumption was that what I've learned in FSEEC and from Dwayne and everybody on staff, that's probably a repowering, that's probably, probably a new, longer blade and it's probably heading for somewhere in Morrow county. Well, how do they make power? How much powder they make? Anyway, it captured the fascination of a ten year old, my daughter. And when I got",

        "text": ", maximizing community benefits associated with these projects, and finally operating under a continual improvement model to ensure that the program continues to fund the best projects in future years. So that gives us flexibility to work help program design as we go. This is a list of eligible activities in the GR Resilience grant program. It includes a lot of the sort of bread and butter reliability projects that utilities have to do just to keep the lights on, you know, utility poles, undergrounding, monitoring and control technologies. You'll see about two thirds of the way down. There's an asterisk next to some distributed energy resources, including microgribs and batteries. That is included in the list. It's included in the federal eligible projects, but I put an asterisk next to it because these are not the types of projects that we really want to focus on. We have other funds for supporting microgridss and batteries, and so we really want to focus more on those, um, you know, vegetation management and natural hazard mitigation projects. And finally, at the bottom of the list are, um, what's not included in this program. That includes new generations such as solar and also cybersecurity. And again, those have different funding streams associated with them. So not in this program. So I know we have a couple questions here just to kind of prompt discussion, you know, in terms of what you're most interested in on these eligible measures. I think what might be helpful is if we go back to that slide and just get any thoughts and reactions or answer any questions that you have. And similarly in the chat, if you want to comment on these or have any questions that you want to ask, feel free to put it in the chat. We'll watch where we'll try to bring it up in conversation as well. Yeah, I do have a comment, Jone, online, it's around microgrids and otheruss saying that those are, I'm assuming what you're saying is that those are in the federal grants that we go after, which is true. Those grants are highly competitive. The resilncy grants, national competition, seven to ten across the nation. So you, one of the strategies that we took, you know, we looked at what's eligible for funding under these grants. The resiliency grants are things that we're talking about undergrounding of electrical lines. And some of these other things are very expensive. We put those into a large national grant award because it, we just can't do much with the state funds that we're going to get. You know, those, the limited dollars that you have, 10 million a year, we can do micro grids for emergency resilience centers and critical equipment and stuff like that with the funds. So that, that's the strategy we're taking that what can we do with the state funds and make an impact versus what could we do with the federal funds and make an impact? So, you know, that's probably what we're going to submit for this. We have some of our large, like I said, the larger fire wildfire protection things we're doing under the national grant. So I would like that to be considered, you know, when we're review these applications. Yeah, that's. Thanks for that comment. And yesterday we heard, yeah, we had a lot of discussion about focusing in on critical facilities and that being one of the primary community benefits that can flow through this program. And so ensuring backup power to those facilities is certainly going to score the community benefits points that we talked about yesterday. So we were in the narrative. We adopted as much of the broad federal language as we could to keep all options open. So I would say if this is the, what we hear from folks that would, would like to make this microgrids, especially for, you know, battery backup and critical facilities, part of the program, but that's definitely on the table. That would be perfectly allowable use of phoness. We have one question from Thomas elsing about when usduee is going to respond to Odo about the expanded eligibility criteria. Time for that. I wonder if Emily could jump in on that question because I'm not sure if she may not be. Maybe just waiting. Sure. If you can hear me. Yes. Okay, perfect. We're anticipating, and I say anticipating loosely receiving some feedback. Hopefully know by the end of the summer the US Department of Energy has a little bit of a different timeline and some other things going on that things have been moving a little bit slowly with them. It feels like. So that's our hope. But we really don't have any promises from them in terms of exact timing. Thank you, Emily and Thomas, I see you've raised your hand. Would you like to come up off mute and weigh in on that further? Can you hear me okay? Yes, thank you. Great. Awesome. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Thanks for this opportunity to discuss everything. Yeah. So I just like",

The statute does not explicitly address, it does not address at all who has jurisdiction for your decisions on a request for contested case. The circuit court denied that. Then we went directly to the Supreme Court and asked them to take it up. That's probably the last update you got from me. The Supreme Court said, we're not gonna take it up, but this council's decision on the site certificate is final because Miss Gilbert had not appealed that aspect of your order. So then it went back to the circuit court and then at circuit court, most recently Idaho Power, as well as my colleagues at DOJ, sought to dismiss it. And they said, given that the Supreme Court has said that the decision on the site certificate is final, this case is moot. There's no reason to have a contested case. What would we be arguing about? The circuit court unfortunately denied that motion, but did not offer any rationale. So right now, we're still in circuit court and we are deciding whether to just stay there and argue whether present the case there or once again ask the Supreme Court to take it up. That has yet to be determined what our next step will be. That was interesting. Thank you. Yeah. Councilor Byer. So is there a statutory fix to the, what do we do with appeals of contested cases or do we just wait to see how this shakes out? I have recommended to the department that they go to the legislature and ask for a statutory fix, and that's up to the department as whether or not that they'll do that. Okay, thank you.

So the next item is the wagon Trail Solar council review of the draft proposed order. It's an information item. And Chase McVeigh Walker, senior citing policy analyst, will take the floor here. Okay. Good morning, chair Howe. Members of the council, morning. For the record, my name is Chase McVeigh Walker, senior signing analyst with the Oregon Department of Energy. Today's agenda as chair, how just mentioned is council's review of the draft proposed order for the wagon Trail Solar project application for site certificate today's agenda item is an opportunity for the council to provide comments to staff on the draft proposed order and the issues raised on the record of the public hearing. Um, for staff consideration in the proposed order. In hopes of, uh, appropriately organizing my presentation, I will first briefly describe the proposed site and facility in the procedural history, and then we'll provide an overview of the draft proposed order and the comments received during the DPO comment period. I'll do my best to adequately address and characterize each issue brought up and will allow council to discuss and provide recommendations on those issues. And to be clear, today's age gen item b is not an action item, it's simply an information item in an opportunity for a council to provide comments to staff for consideration in the proposed order. Next slide, please. Oh, yeah, so this slide is, is the overview I just went over. Um, next slide, please. Okay. The wagon trail, uh, solar project is a proposed solar photovoltaic energy generation facility proposed by Wagon Trail Energy Center, LLC. Whom is the applicant? The applicant is a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary area of Nexterra Energy Resources, LLC. The proposed facility would permanently occupy up to approximately 3685 acres of private, exclusive farm use zone land located within a site boundary of 7450 acres. The proposed site would be located entirely in north central Morrow county near the near Lexington, Oregon. Related and supported proposed, related and supporting facility components include a 500 megawatt lithium ion energy storage system, two collector substations, a 34 and a half kilovolt collection system and operations and maintenance building, 0.6 miles of 230 kv transmission line, four metorological stations met stations, and four construction staging areas. The next slide I've, uh, called out with the location of these components next slide, please. Oh, I guess not. Um, okay, well, we'll go to the next slide then. Oh, this is. No, this is fine. Procedural history? Okay, well, the procedural history for the wagon trail solar project, um, starts on November 3, 2020, when the department received the notice of intent to file an application for site certificate for the proposed facility. On November 20, 2020, the council appointed the Morrow County Board of Commissioners as a special advisory group for the proposed facility. And on November 25, following the NOI receipt, the department issued a public notice of the NOI. In January of 2021, the department",

        "text": " refer to as CPRG. And I'm just here to give you an overview of this grant. This is a really exciting but also complicated grant that has some short term and long term elements that I'll be discussing with you today. So, ye know, we can, we can see, you know, basically your notes and the current slide in the next slide. So we're seeing. Oh, my goodness. Let me just try that one more time here to see. Thank you so much, Mayor Calloway. I must have been sharing the wrong screen. I'm going to get nasty texts from all the rest of the panelists, but I just thought that. No. How's that? Does that look a little better? Yep. Okay. Thank you so much for letting me know. So really, why I wanted to come talk with Washington county and many other counties around the region about this grant right now is that Metro's administing this grant that makes our agency partners eligible to pursue some implementation grants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the near term. Also, the grant that we have funds us to create a comprehensive regional climate action plan in the long term. As far as how members of WCCCC can get involved, you can support the county and its cities and pursuing implementation grants for some of the projects that we hear about today, I'm going to share about that we've identified so far as priorities, and you can also give us feedback to ensure that the comprehensive plan that we're moving into in the next stage addresses all the climate needs and opportunities across the region, including those here in Washington. So these CPRG grants consist of both planning grants and implementation grants, and Metro has a planning grant. These are non competitive four year grants that fund states and metropolitan areas to identify projects and create plans that significantly reduce greenhouse gases and can be implemented and are ready for implementation both by the agencies that would potentially lead these projects, as well as their aligned with state and federal climate funding that could help to move these projects forward. Two things that are really interesting about this grant right off the bat are that first, it covers the entire metropolitan statistical area, not just the three county metro region, but the entire metropolitan, entire metro area, or MSA, which includes Clark and Scamania county on north of the Columbia, as well as Yamhill county and Columbia county here on the Oregon side. It's requiring us to cover a bigger planning geography than we normally do. Another thing that's really interesting about this grant is that it's not just limited to transportation and land use related emissions, but it's really looking for ideas to reduce emissions. The emissions produced in buildings, the emissions produced due to agriculture, the emissions produced in industrial processes. It's bigger in both geography and in scope than a lot of the projects that I, as a transportation planner, tend to discuss with our local partners in rooms like this. In order to deal with that breadth, we set up a new group, the Climate Partners Forum, to help steer this project. As I talk about these folks, I'm just going to leave the list of agencies up on the screen because I want folks to be able to see how their agencies have been represented. If you see your agency on this list and you want to know who to connect with to talk who's staffing the grant at your agency, or if you don't see your agency on this list and you want to be included in the future, I'll have my email address at the end of the presentation. You can reach out to me. This is an open invite group of technical staff who provide feedback at key points of this process, including on all the draft plans and the processes we established to create those draft plans, in order to make sure that all the deliverables we're producing are really addressing the needs across all these different greenhouse gas reduction sectors and across the metro statistical area. So the process and timeline for this grant is pretty complicated and pretty unusual. The main thing I want you all to know is that this grant involves two rounds of planning, and each has a round of implementation funding attached to it. The planning deliverables are shown in the arrows going up the center of the slide. The implementation funding rounds are shown in green bubbles. We're in this left hand arrow right now. We're creating the priority climate action plan, which is a very short term implementation focus plan that we had six months to create. The purpose of this plan was really to identify the projects and existing plans in the region that were well positioned for the implementation grants that are tied to these priority climate action plans. You can see from that first green bubble that EPA is making a round of CPRG implementation grants due. The applications are due April 1, a month after this priority climate action plan that we're working now now is due. I'm due on March 1. Any project that's identified in one of these initial plans can apply, and EPA is providing $4.3 billion in implementation funds that could potentially implement",

        "text": ", go back one slide, please. Yeah. So, yeah, my name is Todd Cornett. I'm the assistant director for citing at the Oregon Department of Energy. And so I manage the energy facility sitighting division. I am also the secretary to the energy facility. ##iting council so I'm going to give you a pretty high level overview of the state siting process today, but happy to follow up with any questions later on, or provide me more detail at a future meeting if you would like. Next slide, please. So you can see the statute on the slide. So the state sighting of energy projects goes back to the 1950s, but the program that we have in place now actually started in the early 1970s, and it really, what we do is incorporated in the policy on the slide, and that's essentially to balance the need and value of large scale energy projects. So for the production and transmission of energy, as well as to evaluate and mitigate the potential negative impacts of these projects to both the built and natural environment. So these are some of the bigger infrastructure projects in the state. So in addition to being important and valuable, they could also be quite negative and impactful if not done correctly. So next slide, please. So some of the basics about the program. So the energy facility siting Council is a seven member, governor appointed and legislature confirmed board. They're volunteers. They are the decision makers on all applications, amendments and rulemakings, the sititing division, or one component of the Oregon Department of Energy. We have 13 positions, and we do the majority of the analysis, writing, coordination, day to day work associated with reviewing projects and ultimately making recommendations to the energy facility siting council. So the process is designed to be a one stop shop. People oftentimes talk about takes a long time and, you know, it costs money. But it is also because we incorporate all the state agency reviews, local government reviews. It's a much more significant and robust process than the local government process. And so the values are that it's all done in one place. That eliminates duplication of process, eliminates different timelines, different appeal processes. And even if those individual reviews would have resulted in all approvals, those could be contradictory in terms of what gets approved and maybe what the conditions are associated with those various approvals. So the idea is that this is a one stop shop. It does make it bigger and more complicated, but it also, there's a lot of value in doing that as well. The tracking for the public is easier, the participation by state agencies. So as part of our process, we have what are called reviewing agencies. Those are pretty much all of the natural resource agencies, state agencies, all the tribal governments that are identified as could be affected by the project or a particular project, as well as the local governments within whose jurisdictions project is located. Those are all designed to be part of our process. We rely upon them as subject matter expertise, and we rely pretty heavily upon them and coordinate significantly with them. Our process is standards based. So what that means is we have a set of standards and it is the burden of the applicant to prove through the record, through the information they provide on the record, that they meet each of the standards. And one of the differences, people often will compare us to NEPA. One of the elements of NEPA, the National Environmental Policy act, the federal government level, is the lead federal agency can propose ##ose the project in a location different than the applicant actually proposes it. For us, we can't do that. So we have to review what is submitted and that either meets the standards or it doesn't based upon the information. So when you look at our process, some of the language that we have, I think it confuses people because some of it sounds like the NEPA process, but when you actually look at it, it functions much more like the Oregon's land use system. Oregon's land use system is a standards based process. Applicants have to submit information again, they have to prove that they meet those requirements in order to get an approval. So we're much more oriented to the state land use system than the NEPA system. Once a project is approved, if it's approved, they are given, the developers, given a site certificate. Functionally, it's a permit, but it does have some different legal implications. It's more of a business contract between the state of Oregon, the energy facility siting council on behalf of the state of Oregon and the certificate holder. And then finally on this slide, we are fully fee funded in terms of our review process. So applicants pay for the entirety of our cost. That includes staffing the Department of Justice, any costs associated with the energy facility siting council, and any reimbursement to state agencies, local governments and tribal governments who help us in our review of projects. So next",

        "text": " been moving a little bit slowly with them. It feels like. So that's our hope. But we really don't have any promises from them in terms of exact timing. Thank you, Emily and Thomas, I see you've raised your hand. Would you like to come up off mute and weigh in on that further? Can you hear me okay? Yes, thank you. Great. Awesome. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Thanks for this opportunity to discuss everything. Yeah. So I just like some of the other previous comments that have been made in regards to the kind of the national, this national opportunity announcement that came out. I know that we had tried to participate with some other larger utilities on some stuff, but we didn't quite meet, I guess, what some of their thresholds for some of our projects. And I guess I just want to understand, I mean, there's a lot of great things on here. We're trying to do a lot of these things that are on this, on these eligible activities lists. But I guess, I guess I just really want to understand and I know some of the details are still in discussion or at least up with us usde for review as well. But trying to understand that threshold from like, yes, this is going to go and no, this is not. And I kind of saw that, that kind of objective list and it sounds like that, that stuff'still, getting, you know, decided or still in discussion, but I just really want to understand a little bit more or maybe there isn't anything more now, but just really what'what's, that threshold that's going to push us over for some of these things? Because I feel like we're almost right there. But maybe we are over the Oregon, you know, Doe threshold, but maybe not the federal, I don't know. Okay. Can you hear us now? Okay, great. We're back on. Okay. Okay. I don't know that was missed, but yeah, just that, Thomas, that, that's a good kind of preursor into the next, this meeting where we're going to talk about the criteria for this program for selecting projects. Right now it's, it's a blank slate and we're hoping to get input from all of our stakeholders on how we should select these projects. And the Oo for this program will manage all of the federal requirements internally. And when we get to the point of the competitive review and the final negotiation of a contract with an awardee, we're going to try to make all those federal requirements as easy as possible for folks. Thank you. Does that answer the question? Yeah. Can we take Thomas off mute again? Yes. Thank you. Can you hear me again? Sure. Okay. Okay. Yeah, no, Rob, that, that actually does answer quite a bit. Maybe just one, one little follow up question just as a point of clarification. So basically, if I understand correctly, the, we will, the, I guess we will be submitting projects, you guys, Odo will manage, you know, meeting all the federal requirements and then it still is a competitive grant afterwards to see, to make, to see if the state or everyone under the state grant is going to be able to, or going to be able to apply and get that. Is that correct? So there's still like a competitive nature to this still yet even though we might be accepted into the state deal? Yeah, we will handle the complete competitive review at OO and so the state will manage the selection of projects and everything that we selected. That review will automatically qualify for the federal requirements if we do our job perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Thomas. We had one question from Martina with renewable hydrogen alliance. Can you elaborate on whether fuellls fuel cell systems count as new generation under eligible measures? You know, I was thinking of that question when I heard that she was on the line and I was thinking to myself, would hydrogen qualify as a storage technology or a generation technology? And I don't have an answer to that, but we can dig into the regulations more closely and see if there's an opening there. Yeah, so I think we should dig into it. But my rec from one this came up before was that it depends on how the project is designed. Like if the hydrogen is being used in the project as stores, you kind of have to document the purpose of it. But we can. I think we should double check and get back to you too. Yeah, thank you for that, Martina. Are there any other questions from anyone participating virtually or anybody in the room? Andy Fletcher, plumbia based electric small utility. These are what you have listed. Theirs is everything we struggle with from a, from a cost perspective. We have limited funding as everybody has. I'm not saying that people don't have that, but, but every little bit for these projects. The downside that we",

And that's just to say these three things combined really do accounts to almost a de novo review of this facility. So you'll see throughout the DPO that we've done extensive analysis where council's previous findings related to the facility are still applicable and accurate. We've referenced back to those and recommended that the council continue to relwy on those where appropriate. But this was a pretty extensive review and is still a pretty extensive review before you so put that out. Oh, and I guess the only other thing I'll say on that is that also means that you all are more than welcome to provide feedback on anything in the DPO, any of the recommended bindings, although I won't be specifically mentioned to them, I can bring them up and can hopefully respond to any of your comments or questions. So at the march hearing, we did receive four public comments in person. Most of you were there. There are transcripts in the meeting minutes and those will also be, I think, summarized in your or were summarized in your staff report. We also received 20 written comments before the public comment deadline. Those included 16 comments from members of the public, three comments from reviewing agencies including Department of Aviation, Department of Fish and Wildlife in Morrow county, as well as comments from the certificate holder asking for clarification or minor changes to some site certificate conditions in the DPO. And then we also got more formal certificate holder responses to the public comments on April 8. All of those are included in your packet and attached to your SA report for this agenda item slide, please the significant issues raised in comments are shown on this slide. We got several comments related to wildfire risk and both related to the assessment in the RFA one and the wildfire mitigation plan that was attached to the DPO. We got comments re related to noxious weed control, related to impacts on emergency communications infrastructure, comments related to visual impacts of turbines, specifically turbines proposed to be cited on GLE and Butte. We got a comment from ODFW and the certificate just ODFW I believe are related to raptor nest buffers. Other comments rel related to wildlife monitoring mitigation and Lawrence s milk fetch mitigation. We also got several comments in support of the facility related to economic benefits and workforce development opportunities that come with the sighting of the facility. We got a comment related to prop loss payments for transmission line sing codes and standards rewy on for the facility design, one comment related to visual impacts on the Oregon National Historic Trail, and then comments from the county about road use agreements, and then several comments from the public about the cumulative impacts of traffic on communities in the vicinity of the project. I just want to point out now that I am really going to be discussing the items on the left hand column of the slide in detail now. So if there are any questions or comments on the right hand side, or if you want me to discuss any of those in more detail, I can do that, but this would be the time to do that. Good question. Councillor Byer on the road use agreements with, I presume, both counties or particularly Morro county. When do those have to be implemented before construction? Or councilmb member Byer, thank you for that question. Yes, road use agreement is required for both counties. This site certificate does contemplate phing. So if there and and right now I will say what we are expecting to see is a phase that consists of components in Morro county and then a phase later phase with the Umattila county components. But the condition does require that the road use agreement be in place before construction begins for that phase. As far as implementation of the road use agreement, it's kind of throughout construction because there's a requirement to do a pre construction evaluation and then I think go out and make repairs if there's damages to rows. So I hope that answers your question and follow up question. Are the road subject to the sediment and erosion control 1200 permit? Thank you, council member beayer. The erosion and sediment control plan, to my knowledge, really applies to construction activities. So it will apply to private access roads within the site and does require bmps to be implemented along those. I do not think that it applies to public roads which are really what's addressed by the road use agreement, but I would have to verify that. Thank you for the clariication, Councillor Hs. Thank you. Will the sediment and erosion plan that DEQ evaluates and puts forth, will that be available before construction and will the council have an opportunity to review, I mean, I",

When we actually find a sheep grazer and we actually sign a contract for them for operation maintenance of it, I would have to be relying on people who are subject matter experts to tell me what's actually needed. And those are little tidbits of information that are very valuable to me. Just want to add back on the record. Yeah, that's critical because in youron, your conditions, when you set, when you come back to these people in a future meetings said, okay, this is a plan we're going to have. Somebody brings together's working that. We have a mowing crew in here because fall and winter, when we have the grass growing there is pasture out there, but this time of year it's nothing but stubble and that s becomes a fire hazard. And you've got to control the thing with the mowing. Thank you. So, like I've been doing all night, I'm going to tie things back to our standards if I can. And one of the questions or points that got made, I think ties back to one of our standards. So one of our standards is the public services and we're required to evaluate all the potential impacts to public services. 10 miles out from the facility. You go back to that kind of bullseye. Public services is 10 miles out. So we look at the impacts to buy our water, sewer, police, hospitals, schools, housing 10 miles out from the facility location. So if we miss anybody like your r fire protection district, we definitely are making note of that. So we'll ensure that we give you notice next time. Colton Nus SchWandeR and then I think again, apologies. Joanna Witszig next. Okay, a couple more talk. She was wanting to talk. One of the main things that you're always bringing up is standards, and this is going to sound ornery, but it is. I'd be interested to know who writ the standards. Was it regular everyday folks that are affected by the step or was it highly educated college folks that ain't really affected by all the standards? Like I said, sounded orner. I don't expect an answer I can respond to if you want. And another thing that I wanted to say is at least on, from my perspective, we know that you guys ain't the root cause of what's going on. So if I get a little irate, I ain't mad at you folks, but you're the faces of your corporation or the state. And so coming from us, you guys are kind of the enemy at this point. So, you know, you're get people getting up here getting mad. I hope people ain't mad at you personally. It's more what you guys represent. And I just want you guys to understand that. The other thing I was curious about is where is the power stored? Is there a way to store it? It's my understanding most of this power just goes to the grid. And when the grid, it just kind of uses it where it needs it. I've worked in maintenance and power plants, one of them being the PKA down in Klamath. I was talking to the guy that runs it down there. And the way he described was when like, the, the dams are like a giant battery, they can provide power in old time. And so the dams just kind of stand on, go on standby when the wind picks up because Oregon's all about, you know, green stuff. Well, what's greener than wind? What's greener than sun? So the dams just sit there when the wind picks up? Well, when the wind dies down, then the, then they'll let water come in. But when they need to flood the grid with more then a place like K. Clamath energy, which just runs on natural gas, fires up and picks up where stuff is little lacking. But how does that playing with sunshine? I mean, you guys going to kill the wind out that's already there? I mean, what, I guess, why do we need solar panels if we've got the wind? If we've got places like K. Clamath energy, if we've got the dams. Oh, well, you're taking the dams out, so we ain't got them no more. It, it's, it's just, it doesn't make sense to me if we've already got stuff in place. I understand you got more power needs, but it seems foolish to take stuff out, especially something like a giant battery that will provide power when you need it. But we got to save the fish, so whatever o, I already did that one. And then back, I think the soil guy left, but he brought up some real good points about, you know, the class one soil and how it's some of the best ground. Okay. Let somebody do with what they want to do with their ground. That's fine. It does affect a lot of folks. Where was the vote? You",

        "text": " was very administratively challenging and onerous. And I was wondering if there was any way that we could put language suggestions. I don't know if it has to be a requirement, but just some advanced notice on the information people can give. Have to give utilities and how much advanced notice they need to provide to get that. Because we have to do interconnection reviews which can require, like, desk engineering reviews. And we just don't do that at the snap of a finger. Yeah. Audrey, the within, within our rules we ask the applicants that they can show consultation with the utilities about the project. It doesn't necessarily have to be in this letter format. We can even, we're even accepting emails communications that this is going on kind of pre, kind of precursory communications. I think a lot of applicants, a lot of applicants have almost assumed as if they were supposed to get an official letter from, from their utility, which is where we wind up with that avalanche that's come in because it is required to show that consultation. I'm glad that you brought it up. There's some other pieces about this that the program team we're going to be addressing once we get through this sort of crazy period before we move into subsequent rounds. We're actually going to move into, trying to look into that. Providing some clarification on some of the items based on what was required in statute because this was actually a statutory requirement, this consultation that made it into the rules. But there was never any specified guidance of how that had to come in. And we've done a lot to go to go deeper into our other required items to create that guidance. And based on this round and subsequent rounds we definitely see the need to go and try to re, try to resp, respelll this out a little bit better for applicants on what we're looking for versus what the utilities can even provide at this point in time in a project cycle when it comes to the feasibility. Yeah, and we're happy to do it and it's actually pretty useful on our side to receive information ahead of time. But maybe like a, a form or something like that to just kind of guide what is mean, what information is wanted from you guys because they're not doing a full interconnection review. That's not something. But we are definitely taking a hard look at system protection and making sure that if um, somebody receives a grant we are not going to decline the interconnection application because nobody wants that to happen. But to do that system protection review is kind of, what I'm talking about is depending on the size of the project, could take longer or shorter, could be more complex, less complex. And there were some very large ones that came through. Okay. Yeah. I think as we, as we dive deeper into this, this feels like something that we might want to get a few of our, of our utility reps together, try to find out sort of what is that process for you? What is the, from, you know, even the cous to the I. What are the process and what are you really providing versus what we're really need at that time, as well as what information would be valuable to you from an applet, from a project that's being a proposed project, not an actual at this point, and then formulate some guidance because I know all of the utilities are going to have separate, they're going to have separate pieces about what this really means, what it entails, what we're asking for, what's good for them to have at this point in time as it's in a proposed state. So I think that's a great, I think it's a great exam. We were looking at doing that guidance, but that'll even be more beneficial if we are able to touch base with our, with our utility reps and. Yeah. Happy to help with our thoughts on our side if it would be useful. Wonderful. Thank you, Audrey. Yeah, that's something that's been in there. It's, it's on a, it's on one of my famous post notes on my desk, actually. We need to address this. Yeah, thanks for bringing it up. And I think it's a rule thing. It's a statutory and rule thing. Yeah. Statute has something, but it doesn't have like a letter. It's like loose on what it looks like. I remember us trying to figure out what y, no, even rule doesn't have. Rule says that that's one of the options is a letter, but the, it's built upon consultation with the utility and stakeholders for feasibility. Yeah. Great. Well, with that, I don't see any other hands up for me. Oh wait, Shannon's back. Hi, Shannon, come on back. Hi. Sorry. Ve, in the past here. I'm great. I'm trying to unpack and better understand. And I know this is a whole other long hour and a half conversation, but about what that BPA restriction is to the cous, we're working with a couple and we've definitely",

        "text": " I'm going to talk about that more in a minute in detail. There were also some statutory changes to our programs. I'll talk to those in detail in a minute. And then also a couple of other bills that passed related to energy or one that didn't. But there was a bill related to energy market. Sounds like there's interest in talking more about that in the future. There's legislation that will require the state's two largest utilities to issue a verbal update to the legislature periodically on progress related to energy markets and how the state and those two utilities play in that space. So that is essentially the legislature just wanting to keep posted on those efforts. And then I know we have a member of the commission who was a leader in the next bill, House Bill 4112. This was a second attempt at creating sort of a clean energy technology economic development package. For those who have followed the news last session, a big deal was the chips, was the chips act at the federal level and then an Oregon Chips act that was sort of designed to create a bunch of incentives and sort of promoting of semiconductor manufacturing in Oregon. And this is an effort that would do that, but for clean energy technology. And in fact, it sounds like that bill will become part of interim work and be coming back again. It seems to me like the primary issue with it just in listening to the committee hearings, U. There were some issues and some, some pieces of it that were not like all Kumbaya, but I think in the end, it was sort of a money question. So it'll be interesting to see what happens with that. And I actually talked more than I meant to because I would love it if folks who know more about it that are on this call. Feel free to we in, in a minute when I give that chance, and we can go to the next slide. Great. Thanks. Another big topic that continues to come up related to energy and climate is around energy facility sing. You all just heard about floating offshore wind house spill 40 80 in the roadmap as well as there were labor standards and procurement standards in that bill that did pass. As you know, I don't need to talk about it anym more than that, but it was certainly a high profile bill during session. Battery energy storage systems this is a technology that has been becoming more and more affordable. As you know, electricity, unlike liquid fuels, cannot be easily stored. Battery storage is a solution for that, an expensive one that's getting more affordable, like I said. And there's now a lot of interest in setting up a full on like energy facilities that are 25 mw or greater. That, excuse me, that would be standalone battery energy storage systems. So if anybody clicks on the link for the report that we just pulled together in the last few spe of the bills that passed and didn't pass the session that related to energy and climate, you'll see a picture actually on the COVID The smaller picture is of one of these types of facilities, the inside of it. So what needed to happen is that right now there's no way that the energy facility siting council can consider these type of projects because they aren't defined. So they're now defined in the energy facility siting council statutes. And there's also a mechanism that will allow a developer to e ##ither go through FSeC to getings, to get a site certificate or to go through county planning processes in order to get approval and then be built. So it's sort of a choose your own adventure for the developer as of the structure of the legislation at this point. And then finally, another high profile bill was that was regarding F SeC jurisdiction on federal lands. I was actually in a different meeting, but heard that you all had a conversation about this bill earlier. So I don't need to go into detail since it was talked about earlier. But I will just say overall that there is so much tension on this issue of energy facility cing and so much conversation. I'm sure that it will be a hot topic again next year. And I just want to be clear that it's a, it's just an interesting issue with two very, with two sides. There's maybe more than that, but there's folks who think that we really need to sort of continue to have really strong protections for a variety of environmental resources before making decisions about energy facility siting. And theres folks who say that climate change necessitates taking a second look at those processes and seeing if we need to streamline them or somehow sort of review fewer things or reduce the public process in order to make the processes faster. So that tension between the two is really interesting. And sometimes it feels like in the cap capital, there's a lot of like one side of that coin. For those of us that are working on citing, we hear a lot about the other side of the coin on the folks who want to see fewer projects cited or who u who want to hold on to that more robust",

So just give it some time in case anyone wants to raise their hand with any other questions or chat. Any new questions in while we wait. Christ. I just wanted to kind of flag that circle background to that first question we had on deadlines, and we have a bit of flexibility in terms of how long those extensions can be, depending on the circumstances. We just kind of look for some sort of explanation from the applicant and we can kind of discuss that on a case by case basis. Yeah, that was something we asked for in build drafting, and it was almost as though we knew that something like this was coming. I don't think we did, but we just wanted to have flexibility. At first, those timelines were just set in the statute, like in stone, so at least we have some, some ability to have one on one discussions and decide how to proceed. Let's see. Alex is back. Hi, Alex. When do you anticipate performance agreements will begin to be signed? I think we mentioned that the first round of applications will be reviewed starting June 10. Right. Probably take us a bit to review the applications, do the competitive review process so that it's fair and thorough. Yeah, we have kind of a estimated kind of calendar schedule on the front of the opportunity announcements, and we're hoping to award kind of the grants approximately at that kind of week of last week in August. That's kind of our best guess, our best estimate right now. With then we have like 30 days to kind of reach an agreement on performance agreement with applicants following that. So that would kind of be late September. Early October is kind of when we'd be anticipating that happening. Great. Thank you. All right, another question from Terrence Romaine. Can two separate wastewater treatment plants apply under the same public body, or do we have a limit on how many applications one public body can turn in? No, there's no limit on kind of the number of applic as long as they re distinct projects, the same public body or can apply for multiple different projects. I think I would just add, can you correct me if I'm wrong, but we do have geographic diversity as something that we are valuing in our competitive review. Right. That is in the kind of scoring criteria. Yeah, it'just one. One of many components that'be included in there. All right, next hoping way. We are currently helping a client with replacing their boiler system for a wastewater treatment plant. The boiler system is intended to serve as a backup system, and the event the main heating and power system, a cogen engine, fails for whatever reason, would the boiler project in this case, be eligible for grant funding? Rob? That boiler could be eligible if it was powered by wood pellets or some biomass waste stream, something along those lines. If it's a natural gas or oil or some other boiler that's not using renewable energy, it would not be eligible. Thank you. She said it. Or they said that it would be powered by biogas mainly. Okay. Yeah. So a biogas boiler would be an eligible technology. Thanks for a great question. So generally, when I start to be like, okay, the questions are winding down, we do get. Get several more, which is awesome. But I'll kind of start thinking about next steps a little bit if things are kind of winding down. So we'll follow up with everyone who's on the line today when the application opens. So just anticipate that coming. We'll also send out the slide deck and just make sure everybody has our contact information so they know how to follow up if they have further questions. So we'll get some sort of follow up email to you within the next few days or so. So just keep an eye out for that. And then when the application opens, we'll let you all know when that happens, too, which, which is coming soon. We're in the, we're in the test phases. As you just saw. The application is coming right along the online application. So those are sort of the next steps that will make sure we follow up with you. I also wrote down that I'm going to follow up on port of Tillam, Mc Bay, and the work that you all are doing under kind of se separate program concepts that might be coming from the federal government. And with that, I don't see any other raised hands or any other chat. So people want to start feeling off and getting on with their day. Feel free. James, Rob and I will just sort of stick around in case there's any straggling questions in the chat or raise your hands. We're happy, happy to be here until one. So really grateful to everyone for making the time, and especially grateful to the special Districts association of Oregon and the association of",

        "text": " of these conversations as possible. And I can tell all of you these conversations are happening in multiple places, some of them in duplicate fashion. And I don't consider myself an expert in any of it either. But just being able to listen and think can, wow, that's not accurate or that's not correct. Or just from the work that we see here, for example, we know there are a lot of things that have been approved through asset that have not yet been constructed. The process isn't broken. It works. It's not our fault that it's not ins. So finding tactful ways to share information or at least encourage people to look for things is something that we can all do, whether through our own legislators, our friendsint, or whatever. But I think it's important to recognize we have to find ways to participate. I believe everyone's intentions are good, but some folks really don't know. So I justn toa say thank you to you for your work. Um, this is a fascinating time to be in the legislature. With the continous turnover, the things that we have from a goal perspective to get to zero carbon, things are happening simultaneously at the regulatory commission. So thank you for your efforts. And Waly Todd, I see your name in those chat boxes a lot, and thank you very much. Oh, thanks. I guess I should open the chat. I'm on as an attendee and I'm not. I guess I'm on as a panelist. Oh, no, I can't see the chat. Oh, sorry, Chris, I think chair Roubman on the Berde sitighting tables in the chat y. Oh, okay. Okay. Thank you. I was like, what's happening in the chat? I can't see it. Okay. I just, I see them. I know that they're participating because when we have to identifyselves. So that's aw, I'm sorry to confuse you. Oh, no, no, it's great. Thank you so much, chair Grail, for the comments and for your paying attention and being at these meetings too, and seeing just how sort of complicated it has been to follow. So House Bill and that's the sort of table process has been a little less difficult to follow. It's been sort of the side conversations that have been happening that have been harder, for what it's worth, because that process, I actually feel like was like really interesting to participate in. House Bill 29 89 is one of those that I mentioned and turn these slides in two days ago. And of course, something's already changed. We had been told House Bill 29 89 would become something along the lines of FX streamlining. And we've been in a lot of conversations about this lately in the past couple of weeks. And last we heard, although again, things seem to be changing quickly and without much notice, we saw an amendment to this bill that just would add storage only, battery storage only to upsect jurisdiction for large storage projects. So we have seen language on that. Got an email this morning that they're still working on amendments, but not sure if that's beyond that topic or just sticking to that topic and amend min's on that. So just that looks like what that bill is. So please maybe ignore, I expected to become, because actually maybe it's going to be something different. So that's where that bill is. House Bill 3179 was a placeholder bill. Again, this was one that did not come from that coalition process, but came from a developer and working with legislators. And there was a dash two amendment on that. We put in comments on that. A lot of what chair Grail said about looking at that, it just seems like solution without a problem, if that makes sense to us. And so we, while having no position on the bill, submitted some testimony and some fact sheets to help legislators understand just the good work that FSEC does and sort of how different aspects of our work stack up in different ways. The bill included, for example, if there was already federal jurisdiction, then FSEC would not have jurisdiction. And so kind of talking a little bit about how federal citing process differs from FSEC process, just to give an example of something in the bill and that we put a fact sheet together to help legislators understand it. So at this point, we're not expecting that bill to move forward. And in breaking news, I got overnight, essentially, it sounds like some pieces of that, particularly related to the jurisdiction for counties on solar projects, might be moving into the next bill. So I will kind of see what happens on this next bill. But right now, House Bill 3180, I was told that it was just land use related provisions, but it looks like some of the elements of 3107, nine that would affect our work at FSEEC might also be in House Bill 3000, 183 thousand, 180.",

        "text": " the working group discussions in Washington as well, that when building owners are undertaking, you know, putting battery storage on their facility or using OnS site renewable generation and other things, how can they be credited in their ability to sort of flex their load during peak times and support other kind of goals that Oregon might have with grid modernization and overall renewable adoption on the power supply side? Just putting it out there, I don't know the answer. Thanks, Kere. I think that's a great topic for discussion, and I think that it's something that we could think about. How would that show up potentially? I mean, it may be something that is very valuable to discuss within the context of this process, but then it may or may not be able to be implemented directly here, but it could have a lot of value somewhere else, or it could be something that is potentially considered in the overall rule making in relation to the target. So it'd be really interesting to see kind where things go with that in terms of how the rat could potentially, what types of things the rack could recommend. I just want to acknowledge that we're at time if we wanted to stick with 1 hour Blake to give you time to go through the three or four other agenda items. But before we close o, there is another comment in the chat. The only emission reduction requirement in the bill is seek to maximize reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, qualitative and not quantitative. So that'a good comment. Yes. And the emissions reductions could be within the larger context, cont of the state's goals and how they're trying to use the building performance standards to help meet those larger goals. Just a follow up question for JP, and maybe Vin has anything to say too. And that is a question about. I don't know, JP, if you're from, sounds like maybe you're involved with commercial real estate, but something I remember hearing about and actually experiencing with our own office building is the lease requirements are that buildings have to maintain the H vac system, the operating set points and those types of things, regardless of whether they're occupied. What I'm interested in is are you seeing as leases are turning over any changes in those requirements that could be taken into consideration that maybe we hadn't seen in earlier data and not something we have to get down in discussion now, but just maybe a quick response and we could follow up offline it'the. Question that is there changes in leastase language specifically? Yes. I haven't actually seen that. No. That's a really good question, though. I wonder. I wonder if that is happening in certain markets. But no, I don't have any personal experience with that. I will just add that you write that even when you can have occupied spaces in buildings that are still leased, so there's a difference between leastased occupancy and actual occupancy. You know, you can have a leased space, but there's like one person in it or no one in it, and you still have to run the h vac. And that's why you're not seeing like a one to one ratio of like, oh, there is, you know, you still, we noticed a dip of about 20% in EUI at the height of the pandemic. But given that we were at like 10% occupancy, you can see that there's not a one to one ratio there. So, yeah, that's because spaces might be occupied by one or two people. You still have to keep the lights on and run the h vac, correct? Yeah, I have any, but yeah, that makes sense. JP, or like the 20% reduction you're talking about might be more of a plug load reduction, but it is making me think of subs, city owned property that was deeply affected by the pandemic. And maybe it's not as relevant because I think about assembly buildings and like spectator event kind of buildings and how they have, I think now they're back to normal. So comparing three pandemics now is probably similar. But it does make me think about like how h vac systems do actually. They're aligned with the actual event. So we like, we have an older building called memorial coliseum. Its h vac system goes back to the fifties, and it doesn't operate in the deepest of winter. It doesn't operate in summer because the h vac system can't handle it. So I would do really well its EUI compared to a mean for assemblies. And then we have another building that is very temperature controlled, is infrequent use, that has a very different EUI, but one is very efficient and like the buildings, efficient. The H vac system is newish. The other one'very inefficient. All glass has an h vac system from the fifties, but has a better uI. How do you treat those kinds of issues? Yes, definitely the pieces to have in consideration. We're looking at that at the EUIs. Okay, Blake, I think we can hand it back over to",

        "text": " member in the room. Thank you. If you could come up. I was kind of surprised that these are one year agreements. We've had this program for so long, yet we do one year approvals. Is there a reason behind the one year versus having multiple years for this? Thank you, councilor. Yes. One that we recognized ourselves. And this was. You'll see. It's a calendar year, so we're gonna move in line with our biennium. So you'll see future contracts into your biennium going forward. So, yes. Perfect. Thank you very much for the answer. Is there any other discussion? Hearing? None. It has been moved and seconded. Maybe have a roll call. Sanchez rouletto. Aye. And beverage. And the motion carries. Item 8.3. Consider approving an agreement for $35,000 with Ty Oregon to fund the partnership agreement that delivers the west side annual. I'm sorry, the annual Westside pitch event and provides business coaching and development support to our traded sector and entrepreneurship from the real community. Do I have a motion to approve the agreement? So moved. Second. Done. Button. It's been moved and seconded. Is there any discussion? Hearing? None. May we have a roll call? Council? Mark me. Aye. Aye. Aye. Thanks. Aye. Luncheon to Leto. Aye. I'm Beverett, and the motion carries. Moving on now to item nine, the city manager report. I will turn it over to Robbie and thank him for his virtual presence. Thank you, council president Martin. And this is one of the benefits of having virtual meetings is when allergies hit. You all don't need to hear me sneeze. I can just mute myself. So it works out great. A couple of things I wanted to share with the council tonight. First, I wanted to thank our city manager's office team that is focused on sustainability and resiliency for a great cost saving opportunity for Hillsboro homeowners to install solar panels. Robin Straughan and Daisha Baucom have been working with our partners at Energy Trust of Oregon and Solar Oregon on the Solarise, Hillsboro and Cornelius campaign. Now through April 30, Hillsboro and Cornelius homeowners are invited to learn more about installing solar or solar plus battery storage and get access to limited time discount pricing and other incentives. All the information you need to learn more is on the city's website. You can attend an online workshop on Thursday this week, and there are more workshops in April in English and in Spanish. And if you don't have time to do a workshop, you can simply request a custom quote for your home by following the information on the city website. That's actually what I did a couple of weeks ago and it's pretty fascinating, the information they shared with me about my home, what my options are, what works and what doesn't. So it's definitely worth your while to go and take a look to see if it's right for your home. And second, I want to say a big thank you to our communications team and everyone who works to keep our community informed through the city Views newsletter, including graphic designer Kaylee Cooper. Recently, city views switched its paper type to help community members see photos more clearly and see the colors as intended. The previous uncoated paper had left pictures appearing dark and dull and made it difficult for some to see, but not anymore. The old paper also led to calls and emails about the ink smell and we wanted to fix that as well. So thanks to our Hillsboro based printer, Lithex Printing solutions, we now have 100% recyclable paper that uses post consumer waste and doesn't have the smell. So thank you. Thank you very much. Rapping and you were done correct and thank you. Thank you very much. And also thank you for sharing your personal experience on solar solarize. Definitely recommend any community member interested to look into that.

And with that, council meeting is adjourned to work session. We'll take a ten minute break and frankly, it'll probably be a 15 minutes break, but let's try for ten and we'll come back and talk about highlight. It is about time for us to start up again and we will have our work session on highlight. A great group of folks here. We're going to hear a lot of good info from. I will turn it over to Glenn guessing Gray. Yes, I will turn it over to Greg. Yeah, great. This is the year since we were here last, but we will. That's the plan. Just to get your rate early and let you know how we're doing. Progress and excitement. Enthusiasm. There is another one",

        "text": "Okay. All right. Good evening and welcome. The time is now 05:01 p.m. and I would like to call the August 24, 2023 meeting of the energy facility siting council to order. Mister Secretary, please call the Rol. Marcy Grail? Here. Kent Howe? Here. Jordan Truitt? Here. Here. Cindy Condon? Here. Perry Choctute Ann Byer? Here. Richard Devlin. Madam chair. You have a quorum. Thank you, mister secretary. Are there any agenda modifications? Madam chair, there is one agenda modification. Unfortunately, we're not able to get the July meeting minutes done in time. They're close to being drafted. We should have those out soon, just not quite ready. They were quite complicated from last time, so those aren't ready. So, in terms of the first agenda item, there will be no need to take action on those. Thank you. I have the following announcements for tonight's public hearing on obsidian solar center. Amendment number one, an agenda item c, public comment period. There are three ways to let us know your an. This is Cindy. Can anybody hear me? I can hear you, Cindy. So, I have lost. I can't hear anything else. Yeah, I've lost sound. Did. Did you all lose sound, too? I'm gonna text todd since I don't see a way to. Chaty. Energy facility sititing council meetings shall be conducted in a respectful and courteous manner where everyone is allowed to state their positions at the appropriate time. I think she would mute again. Jordan or Cindy, can you hear him? Cannot. Perry, I can hear you. Okay. How about now? Can you hear us now? Yes. Okay, thank you. All right, so we are going to move forward. As previously stated, we will not be taking action on the July minutes at this time. So our next item on the agenda is the council secretary report. Mister secretary. Thank you, madam Chair. First, I have council updates. So, I had recently heard from the governor's office that they are not moving forward with replacement for councilmber Truitt's position. So, councilmber Truitt's term ends September 22, next month. So they are now. The governor's office is now looking at the November legislative days instead of the. Yeah, September legislative days. So, as we've had this conversation, you know, this question come up numerous times. Even if a council member's term ends, they're technically still on the council until they resign or until they're replaced. So I reached out to Councilmber Truitt, and he's graciously agreed to stay on until he is replaced. We very much appreciate that. And so certainly we'll be working with the governor's office. To try to find a replacement for November. Next, I have project updates. The first is the Muddy Creek energy project. This is a proposed 199 megawatt solar project and battery storage approximately 8 miles south of Brownsville and immediately east of interstate five. We received a notice of intent on May 19 of this year. On July 25 of this year, we held a public information meeting in Brownsville. We had approximately 100 people attend in person, including councilmber condon in person and councilmemb member buyer remotely. The comment period closed on August 11, and in total we received 142 comments. So 80 of those comments were submitted through our comment portal. So I want to kind of provide some kudos to Wal e and ourit department. So this is something that we've worked on in the last couple of years to provide another alternative method for people to provide public comment, and we're increasingly seeing the use of that. And one of the values is there's an opportunity to tie comments directly to council standards. So while not everybody did that, and at the public information or the public, excuse me, the notific notice of intent stage, it's a little more nebulous. But that being said, as we did get quite a few people attempting to connect their comments to standards, which is great, and I think that will help as we move forward. So I think that's a big, a pretty big outreach in terms of the number of comments. None of those were what I call robocomm comments. These were all individual people submitting individual comments. So that's a pretty big number. And obviously, with the conversion of farmland in the Willamette Valley of high value farmland, there's a lot of interest on this project. Any questions before I move on to the next one, or any impressions by councilmember condon or councilmember Byer who are in attendance? Bayer, this is Ann Byayer. And I did listen into most of the presentation. I want to give staff kudos, particularly for that, trying to keep the focus",

        "text": "Right. Good evening everyone, and welcome to the public information meeting on the complete application for site certificate for the Sunstone solar project. I'll note that we are both in person here in Boardman tonight as well as online, and this meeting is being recorded. We'll go ahead and post a copy of the recording to our website in the next few days. So anybody that's not here can listen to the discussion and anybody who is here can listen again if they want. My name is Christopher Clark. I'm a senior cighting analyst with the Oregon Department of Energy. I will be facilitating the review of the application for site certificate. We're joined here tonight also by the Pine Gate renewables team, who's the developer of this project. I'll have them ll introduce themselves in a little bit after my presentation. Yeah, and Nancy, you could go to the next slide. I'll give us a quick rundown of what we will be talking about tonight. First, we just had a meet meeting greet. So thanks to everybody for coming out and hope you got some good discussion in with the applicant team and us at the department if you didn't get a chance. I did just want to point out that we have a computer set up towards the door where you can sign up for email updates from the department. You can preview our ESA mapping tool, which I'll give a little bit of an overview of in a minute. And you can also see just other information about the energy facility siting council and the work it's doing there. I'll be going over that a little bit in our presentation as well. So I will be providing a quick overview of the energy facility sitighting process, which is the state level permitting review. I'll also be giving, as I just mentioned, an introduction over the Oregon Renewable energy siting assessment tool, or ESA, which is a good publicly accessible mapping tool. So you can see some more details about this project and other energy facilities. I'll then be turning it over to the applicant team to give a more detailed overview of this sunstone solar project, and then we'll be taking questions and answers from the audience, both people that are here in person with us today and those on the webinar right, so the energy Facility Siting Council review process is a consolidated review at an oversight process for most large scale energy facilities in infrastructure in Oregon. In addition to solar facilities, the council, or FSEC, has jurisdiction over large scale wind facilities, large thermal projects, some transmission lines, and some pipelines. The council is made up of seven volunteers from around the state. They are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate and Odo's siting division. So Odo, the Oregon Department of Energy Sitighting Division, is staff to FSEC. And I do want to point out before we get going that we do have at least one council member in the room with us, councilmb member Iams. And I believe we have council member Byer joining us on the webinar as well. Thank you both for being here. We really appreciate it. Yep. So next slide. So what the council does is review typically applications for site certificate, which is the request for the state level permit for a large energy facility, or request for amendment of a site certificate, which is another administrative process. In the application for site certificate process, there's seven major steps. Some of you may have been out here, maybe logogan remembers better than I do. A year ago, two years ago, when we had a similar meeting as tonight on the notice of intent. Two years ago. All right, which the notice of intent is the first document that the department receives. It gives the applicant'kind of general proposal for an energy facility and gives the department the chance to establish the legal standards, applicable laws and rules that would apply to that review, which we put in a project order, which you'll see noted as the second step. The applicant responds to all of the information requests in the project order, as well as the other information requests in our administrative rules in their application for site certificate or ASC. That's the process we're in, or the part of the process we're in now. Application contains a lot of information. It is available on our website. I'll talk a little bit more about what's in there more specifically, but there are a number of exhibits talking about everything from land use to fish and wildlife habitats to cultural resources. So if you have specific questions about this project or what resources it might impact, most of the answers should be there. And if you ever need help navigating that, you can find information for my information on our project page. You can also find the applicant's information if you have questions for them. After the ASC, the department will after we review the ASC, the department will prepare what's called a draft proposed order. I'll get into a little more detail about what that entails in later slides, but generally the drop propose order is the department's initial findings of",

        "text": " So under both Mister Calloway's and my versions of the final agreement, that 100 foot is going to be measured just on our land unless we can resolve the hiatus. And that will make it easier. There won't be any more people, shouldn't be people coming up and saying, are you going to count it or not? It's going to be on our land unless we can resolve the hiatus. Now, here's why I'm comfortable we can resolve the hiatus. First is at the last meeting y'all learned for the first time, and I think staff did, that the hiatus is actually owned by Marion county. Since then, I did a lengthy letter to Mister Rison and Mister Calloway and copied Acton county engineer Tracy Straub on it, as well as guy minner and a bunch of people. I think we've conclusively established that the county owns the hiatus. We got a better copy of the deed and we've shown a pattern. Chris, could you put the plot back up of countryside farm? We found a pattern of actual what was a county road system in this area. The hiatus is above that tract f, but tract. Tract f on the countryside farm plant was an additional 20ft 25ft of right of way that was deeded to Marion county, and that right of way went all the way to the east, almost to Cherrywood. The county at one point apparently planned a road system to go through there. All of the deeds, including the deed, pursuant to which the hiatus was deeded to you by our predecessor and title contained rights of reverter. That said, if the county didn't use it as a road, it reverted back to the owner. The owner, the people who had conveyed that southern piece, the countryside farm tract, went back to the county and said, you're not reusing it as a road, give it back to us. And the county did. County gave him a deed, thus losing that 25ft. That owner then sold the property to the Uller King Family Corporation, whatnot, but was granted an ingress and egress easement. And that's why, if you look at tract f, you'll see that even though countryside is using it as a buffer, in fact it's reserved for ingress and egress by private person, not by the county. So the county gave up its road system there. Now that I think, and I think Mister Calloway agrees, that ingress egress season is probably barred by Marta. But I just wanted to give you the background. This was part of a road system and it's not anymore. Thus the county hiatus 25ft should eventually be dealt with the same way as that other one was. Mister Bonoz, you look confused. I'm asking guy a question. Okay, so we've established, I think, conclusively that the hiatus is owned by Marion county. We don't have to debate that today. I don't think. I think even Mister ob agrees with that. So the issue is what to do about it. And there I thought we were in pretty good shape until I saw that language that said we've got to impose it and we can't impose it on y'all's property. So we got together with Mister Calloway, who represents the HOA, and we tried to figure out what would solve their concern and let us develop. Mister Calloway will explain it to you in greater detail, but what he's concerned about is that something will happen in that 25 foot that would be inconsistent with the buffering conservation easement that his clients agreed to back when the comp plan was approved in 2004. For example, if the property reverted to us and we then put something there, or if the county put a road in there or the county did something else with it. So what we're trying to do is we're trying to make sure that countryside farm gets the benefit of of what it bargained for, which means doing something with that hiatus. We've come up with three things that can be done with that hiatus to protect countryside farm. And actually, Miss Bryant, you mentioned one of them as we were walking out the room last time, you asked Mister Minner whether you all could close the street, abrogate whatever you do with the street under chapter 336, and convey it to the Hoa. The answer to the first part is yes. The answer to the second part is no. Florida statutes only permit conveyances to an hoa when you're vacating a planted road. This is a deeded road. This road will revert back to the successors entitled to the original grantor, which is my client. But you can close the road and then the property would revert to us under both versions of the agreement that Mister Calloway and I prepared. We got two competing versions. They differ on one thing, which I'll get to in a little bit. If it comes back to us, we will then put the buffering conservation easement",

        "text": " unintendedequences thatkk lne. Maybe if we could just mention the exhibits and attachments for the vegetation plan and weed control. Yeah, good point. The exhibit p has a couple of attachments. There's a revegetation plan that talks about vegetation that will be planted underneath the panels and in between the panels and how that will be managed. So it's important to keep the vegetation at a level where it doesn't shade the panels. And also for fire, fire management as well. And then there's a weed management plan, I think revegetation and weed management, I forget which ones are together, but that also addresses making sure that there are not invasive species that are taking over job. Thank you so much. I appreciate your response. Thank you. Thanks, Daisy. And I'll just jump on to say thanks to everybody at the planning department for being so engagedment process and the board of commissioners and same to the OO staff as well. Thank you. Any, anyone else in the room, I'd like to, to comment. Thanks. Good evening. I'm Mark Kendall and I'm an Oregonian and interested in your project. And I am most curious about the, how the timeline for decision making and what the decision tree looks like on batteries. Given this tight FsEeC timeline. How do you get an FsEec permit with a battery? That is maybe that. Maybe I'm curious what the timeline, what the decision tree is on lithium over zinc or what? Sure. Thank you, Mark. If the current timeline holds that we have shown tonight'roughly two years from startup construction. So some of those final procurement decisions will be made closer to, to breaking ground. And, you know, in this industry, there's a lot of kind of constantly changing dynamics when it comes to supply chain and availability of equipment, you know, evolutions and technology, etcetera. So I would say, you know, likely over the next year or so, getting into 2025, when we're going through final design and engineering, making those kind of firmer construction plans and contracting decisions is likely when we'll be making those decisions. And, um, with all of that in mind, you know, we attempted to our application preserve a little bit of flexibility for some different technologies. Right. Given that it's, you know, still a decision that u needs to be made closer to startup construction. So, um, I don't know if David Weiss is available to jump in on that and speak a little bit more about the EPC management project delivery teams approach to that. Sure. Good. Even everyone meant to be there in person, but there were some issues in Dallas Fort Worth. So unfortunately, I'm calling in from Nashville, Music City. But as far as the timeline for how we make that decision, there's a lot of things that go into play. We're still considering both technologies at this point. We have batteries in our fleet, essentially, that we've been operating for a while. So we're, you know, well aware of what goes into construction, management and operation of both types of batteries. So, like Logan says, that the decision really falls on, you know, we want to go with the best quality product to provide the best reliable hour when called upon from the utility. So we're going to continue those coordinations with the utility. And as they're a customer, that's going to be a big part of this. Okay, good. Thank you. I know, just a brief follow up of what kinds of support are Bonneville Power and UtO Electric co op. Looking forward to if you incorporate batteries, what kind of dynamic power by hour kind of, or next day, or what kind of voltage support or dispatchability or what are they looking for? Sure. Well, possibly a mix of a few things that you just mentioned. And I'm going to get out ahead of my, over my skis pretty quickly on this subject. But in general, I think you're touching on an important point, which is that the equipment selection, the technology selection, the configuration of the energy storage depends a lot on the customer and who's buying the power and what are they looking for. So, you know, we are pursuing interconnection and transmission agreements with UEC and BPA. They will not necessarily be the customer for the project. Right. Our customers do tend to be utilities or large commercial industrial power users. But as we're still working through trying to get those contracts sorted out, I think that will also inform a. Those will indicate what's being looked for. Okay, then. And the FEC permit process does offer that dynamic kind of scope versus specific. I can speak to that a little bit. Yeah. So the applicant team, like they mentioned, have asked for flexibility to use multiple different chemistries. So we kind of look at the worst case scenario to determine compliance with the standards and also what the additional conditions of approval would be. So, for",

        "text": " like I said earlier. So this is a project that Eugene Water and electric board, or EEB, completed a few years ago. The city of Eugene, like much of western Oregon, could be subject to significant damage from a Cascadia earthquake. And that is something that a lot of folks on the phone have, something they have to contend with as well. And as a utility that manages both electricity and water services, EweB recognized the importance of energy to water delivery and was well positioned to support resilience and disaster recovery within Eugene. So EWeb considered community resilience based on what's called the rule of threes. And that is in the first three days, provide access to drinking water, first three weeks, repowering of critical facilities, and for the first three months, completing system repairs to restore water and electric service. As a result of their planning efforts, Eweb developed the grid edge demonstration project, and it here at Howard Elementary School, and they added a battery storage system and a new potable water well to an existing 50 kilowatt pv system that was on the roof there. And as a result of the planning efforts, we now have a facility there that includes a potable water fill station for the community. In an event of a water power, a power outage, the school building is also provided with backup power, and the school can serve as an emergency shelter. The system provides value to the community, which is great, of course, but it also has these water and energy resilience features, and the school benefits from energy savings all the time. And EWeb is able to use the batteries to provide grid services during day to day operations as well. Also just wanted to share the schematic diagram of the microgrid system showing the electric loads that can be served during a power outage. The battery storage units shown in black can be charged by the solar and natural gas generator, assuming natural gas is available. The water well and critical loads within the school are shown in green, and then the switch shown at the main breaker ensures isolation from the grid to ensure the safety of emergency crews working on local power lines during the grid outage. So now that this program is nearly up and running, the agency has started to hire the staff that will run the program from here. Pandi and Krishnaswami is on the line today and he's our energy services manager. And then James Kogl has been leading work on the program nuts and bolts, and he's going to take things from here to talk through our application and then when we're done with that, we'll do our Q and A. Thanks. Chrriy CS I'm James Kogl, policy analyst, the Oregon Department of Energy. So the program will provide grants for planning and constructing renewable energy and energy resilience projects. Opportunities announcements as we said, were posted on March 7 and there are four of them, one for each of the different project categories. $12 million was allocated between the four opportunity announcements, with. More opportunity announcements are going to be announced after this round closes with additional funds. Online applications will open shortly and we will only be accepting applications through the online application. Next slide, please. So the opportunity announcements outline the minimum required information for a complete application, as well as detailing how applications will be scored during the review process. This includes required information about the project, the applicant and partners, and consultation with different stakeholders and groups following a review of applications to make sure they contain all the required information and are eligible for the program. The applications will undergo a competitive review process assessing the strength of the project and its feasibility, as well as how the project meets the program's priorities and targeted benefits. The scoring criteria include topics such as the project leadership and involvement of environmental justice communities, jobs and economic development, direct energy cost savings for families and small businesses, inclusion of inclusive hiring and promotion policies, procurement of services from disadvantaged businesses, assisting with natural hazard mitigation plans, and geographic and project diversity. The grants will be awarded on a competitive basis, and at this point we don't know how many grants will be awarded and how the funding will be distributed across the four categories. How the funding will end up being distributed will just depend on the number and strength of applications in different buckets along with the required funding allocations stated in the legislation. Next slide please. So the online application is still being finalized and as we're expecting it to be available in April, you'll be able to. When it is available, you'll be able to access it from the Community Renewable Energy grant program webpge and we've got a red arrow pointing to where the link will be available from. Next slide please. If you're familiar with our customer service portable portal, it'll also be available there from the Financial Incentives tab. Selecting it from the drop down menu. Next slide please. Once you navigate yourself to the application, you'll be able to apply for either a planning or construction grant, change information, or withdraw an application using the drop",

        "text": " silent. So the question you might be asking is, why are we bothering? Good segue there. Council never talk to. The answer has nothing to do with solar, and indeed the wind turbines move and makes sound. But I would wager a guess that that wasn't the reason for this rulemaking either. It has to do with the commercial scale facilities here. And I have just a little video here that I thought, this is not, by the way, this is not connected to a solar array or anything. This is just to show you commercial scale electrical transformer and inverters do make very audible sound. And indeed, as Chase pointed out earlier, if you'll recall, they have a solar project that currently is measured to trigger this ten Decba increase. So they are very excited about the prospect of being able to do a waiver, seeking a waiver as opposed to mitigation. So, yeah, it isn't the solar panels themselves that are necessarily making the sound. It's all the electrical equipment that it's connected to. Does that make, make sense? For the record, this Perry chalkate again, you know, I looking at it, we should be more concerned about the noise coming from the power lines from Bonneville plant because it's disturbing. It's really, really loud. The one that runs through central Oregon. Yeah. So I'm wondering why we shouldn't we be looking at something that makes some real noise? That's a great question. And the answer with respect to this one is these rules don't address that instance. So this rulemaking was driven by a few different factors, but primarily direction from the state to do what we can to make it easier or more efficient to siteite renewable energy projects in the state of Oregon. And this is just a very low hanging fruit. So there might be other issues around noise, ort industrial externalities that are caused by energy, but the sort of outside the scope of this rulemaking, but that doesn't mean that the state or shouldn't look at it or address it for sure. Okay. Yeah, a coun councilloor, as Tom, does this pertain to the battery storage facilities as well? No, this is only the language as it currently is in there. It'just it says wind and now it's going to say wind and solar energy facilities, if I may. So it would be, if there is a battery storage facility associated with a solar battery energy storage associated with a solar project, it would apply. So, you know, if you look at like a typical solar project that's being proposed, it includes transmission lines, transformers, inverters, and most of them also battery storage. It would apply to all of those elements of the facility as part of the overall solar facility. But because the council doesn't have jurisdiction over a standalone battery energy storage, it wouldn't apply to a battery energy storage facility if that was proposed, you know, to the local government or even if somebody wanted to have coun council review that. Now, the other standards associated with the DEQ noise rules would still apply that particular element. These assume 2060 ba would not, though, just would not apply for and just a standalone battery energy storage facility. So some of the facilities that we're currently reviewing and have been approved do have battery storage as part. As part of the solar facility, correct? Yes. And I think just from my perspective and living in Morrow county, what I hear from the public and news articles or whatever, that the battery storage equipment and facility is actually what is noisy is what people are saying. Yeah, correct. There is the cooling, you know, of that, which includes fans, and those can be, those can be noisy and those could exceed it. But, but these rules would apply to those if it was part of a solar facility. All right, thank you. Yes, exactly. So only if it was a standalone would it not apply. But if you're seeking a solar s certificate for a solar energy facility, the analysis for the standards applies to all the stuff that's part of that facility, which could include batteries. So if you assume 26 dba, that means anything over 36 dba would exceed the limit, and you would need to seek a waiver. That means between a whisper and a modern fridge. So it doesn't take much to trigger the ten decbels exceedents. So it can be pretty quiet. Obviously there's sound attenuation. So, meaning if you're 2 miles away from it, you may not hear it, but if you're a landowner that's directly adjacent to the project, that's where the noise sensitive receptors are going to pick up potentially more than ten DecBA increase. Which brings the question of why this is an action item, a not just an information item. And essentially there's a statute that says that when other rules are being proposed, they so have an impact on the sing of energy projects that the council has to review them to determine whether or not they need",

There'll be a place for an electronic signature. It really is just a way for us to have a portal where we can have an auditable deadline and not have any confusion about when the submissions came in or any submissions possibly coming in after the deadline, but it don't need any of the meat or heart of the application is all in those documents that are already posted and available. Hi, so I'm going to go to Lisa's question as it relates to the portal and then I'll go back to Joshua's question. So Lisa is just asking when the portal will open. I believe that's as soon as possible. Don't have a set deadline. I would like to see it open in May just to give people time to sort it out and take a look. But we don't have a set date yet and generally like our thinking on this, we've had this happen in the past where our portal hasn't been open and that's why we kind of put together everything that you need to complete the application. So that because in our experience, you need to sort of like draft everything in a separate document to like have everybody review it that needs to review it and all of those things before you just kind of put it, cut and paste it into the portal in the end. So the portal it, there's nothing there that you don't already have. And the idea is really just so that we don't have to delay getting the money out the door to you all to do the projects that we know you want to get going as soon as possible because our it folks are not able to get to opening the portal right away. So hopefully that makes sense and you agree that it seems like the right approach to heres everything you need. And then in the end the thing you just need to cut and paste to will be open and hopefully that will all open in time for you to do it. But we didn't want to like slow everything downct, right? That's exactly right, Chry. The only thing is we won't even have any cut and pasteing. This will be strictly document uploads, like a Dropbox, a few checkboxes and attestations, and a digital signature submission button and you'll get a chance to make sure all your documents are uploaded and then you click submit and that's basically it. On this it will require a login, a username and login to the Odo customer service portal and we'll have full instructions to that at the same time that we do open the portal. Great, thanks Clay. Then Joshua Reed. I wish I knew where you were from. Joshua. What about projects that do include new, new renewable generation? Can the cost of that component be excluded and the resilience components still be eligible for the program. The reason I'm asking, because if you're from a consumer and utility, I feel like we've got a different program for you. But yes, the answer to that is yes. Again, all of the details, what will be looked at and stuff before, you know, I give definitive answer on any particular cost, but the short answer is yes, as long as those resilience components are for, you know, reducing frequency and duration of grid disruptions. Great. Thanks so much. And then finally we have a question for you in case we get more questions in the chat or any hands raised. So we are just curious. You're on. That's so great. Are you planning to apply? We're just curious if folks are planning to apply this round. We know there will be multiple rounds and just curious if anybody has started pulling together application materials. Just kind of wondering where folks are and what folks are thinking. A little finger on the pulse, if you will, and you can put it in the chat. You can raise your hands, keep it to yourself if you want. But we'd love to hear. Great to, and great to hear Idaho power. Great. Hope that, yeah, we know how capacity issues go, too. So good luck on that, Lisa. Good. Well, we're glad some people are thinking of applying and it's a competitive application process, so, you know, help, I guess, for the first one. If we don't have so many, maybe. Great. Otech and QGe planning to apply. That's potentially with Tiger. Cool. Great. Well, we can just, we'll plan on sticking around and see what other questions come up. We can sit here in awkward silence all day, but at some point we might just say we'll let everyone go and then usually a couple people stick around and ask us questions one on one, which is totally fine, too, for those that are done and take off, even though we're going to sitick around for a little while. Thank you very much for coming. We appreciate the time and your interest in this program. Great",

        "text": " some plans, searching for a staff person. It's like I call up work or whatever it is. So I think that's going to be really important. Yeah, I mean, the council'in, the process, as I understand it, with the task force setting, setting priorities and picking out the most practical strategies, the reality is the most practical strategies are those ones generally that will involve working with the utility in order to implement. But having a staff person, I believe, is really critical, someone who can identify this and work through that, identify projects and help work through the bureaucracy and use the utility. I mean, if it's in the utilities interest, get you can util can get the utility to write the grad proposal, but it really works. It really needs someone who is not distracted by other duties, and it needs someone who can focus on those issues to do that. So I think there are opportunities in solar. I think it's a good thing for us to continue to explore and to find out the things that the city's already doing, to learn what other cities might have done and to identify some of the opportunities. And maybe we can have a two way street through Michael with the council task force and the planning commission. But I think this is one of those areas where we should try and figure out the best way to exercise our advisory capacity as well and utilize that to gather information and explore different options. Good point. Other. Yeah. Turnator. I have one more question for Rob. Sure, I can wait if further. I think I see your hand as one. So, Rob, given some of the financing challenges that people have right now, and the administrative burdens that people are facing to install some of these projects, do you have any experience of municipalities taking on a leadership role in leading an effort like this? So if Salem were to say, oh, you know, we're in the middle of our resiliency plan, and we decided that we really need to have 5 mw locally produced and stored, and we want to take the lead on that and develop that. Is that something that another city has done? You know, there have been some projects that have certainly had a strong municipal component, including many of the ones that are being funded in our community renewable energy grant program, where Salem is already participating, because they, you actually have to be a public body just to apply for that one. But two that come to mind, one is Milwaukee. And I don't know how much Clackamas county is involved, but Milwaukee has a similar vision for developing rooftop solar on a vast amount of warehouse space. I'm not sure how far they've gotten along that path, but it's certainly been something that's been discussed. And then another one is the public safety center in Beaverton or. No, maybe it's in Hillsboro. I think it's Beaveberon Public Safety center. This is a municipal building that has solar and storage. And it houses a lot of the emergency response capabilities for the community. And so having the battery backup and the ongoing solar recharge of the batteries. Most of these facilities are fitted with a diesel generator, which is great. You can serve a lot more load with a diesel generator than you can with a little bit of rooftop solar. But in the event of you a seismic emergency or something like that, the state's liquid fuels are likely going to be really hard to distribute. And so having a truly resilient recharge on that battery is something that's driving some of these. So, you know, if Salem really took the reins and did something at the municipal level, I think you would likely kind of be leading the charge. But you might look into what Milwaukee has been talking about for their rooftop plan. Thank you. I don't have any other questions. Thank you, Rob. Thank you. Commission or other questions for Robert before let them off the look it your thought. Thanks. It's actually not a question, it's more of a. I guess I'm using that. We're talking a lot about solar specifically as one of the renewable energies. But what if this was essentially treated more in a resiliency manner as it relates to getting these projects permitted? Is there some way we can incentivize? Maybe there's an offset cost or something that you. Similar to. If you have like SDC credits, for example, if you are doing a demolition of a project and then coming back in with a remodel, is there a way that we can kind of bank renewable and resilient strategies at the design side that can then offset and the construction on the construction side so that we can really start encouraging more development that uses those strategies from the beginning rather than. I mean, I think solar rooftops is a fantastic idea, depending on the existing structure and what kind of solar you're implementing. And there are a variety of factors that come into play. And I think having those conversations as early in the design process as you can is really where the value",

        "text": " know before you go out and do something that's going to have a ten or twelve or $15 15 a month bill impact. And again, these are just numbers that I'm giving you for the sake of discussion. They're not real numbers at all. Understood. Thank you. I have a question. Yeah. Can you give us an idea of how many people are enrolled in the voluntary green program currently? I can't, but PGE certainly can. I believe we have that data on all cities in our jurisdiction. I think that would be interesting context to have. Like what is Salem's? You know, are we at 50%, 10%? I mean, I have no idea. I wonder, work in advance to try to increase that number. Right before we commit to anything elseor Mayor Hoy, we can provide you that number. In terms of the number of residents. We can get that number pretty quickly to you it's not heavily advertised. I'm on and I had to find it. Yeah, that would be great, Wendy. Thank you. Yep. I can't tell you that PGE'is the highest as a percentage of customers. Is largest in the country. We have a lot of customers on it. Just read good. Steve, can you skip this slide five? I think I'm on side five, actually. Customer pricing. Yeah, you are great. Like I said, steve just will intuitively know where to go. Except when he gets the wrong screenup. Yeah, that was it. Just showed some of my political ignorance. Okay, so this is showing you, sort of with words, what this is going to cost. And I want to be really clear about what we're asking communities to pay for. We are not asking communities to pay for every cent of what a new resource is going to cost. We are just going to ask communities to pay for what percentage of that new resource is above what PGE's cost would be otherwise. So you can sort of think of us as having a baseline cost, which all customers are going to pay. And then the increment above it is what residential and small commercial customers in the city of Salem or anywhere else would pay. So, Steve, let's go to slide seven. I think that's the cleanest pictorial example of this. So that chart on the right shows this with sub bar graph, basically. So you're going to want to know how we figure out what PGE's cost would be without this program. The answer is, it's a forecast. So, in our integrated resource plan, in our clean energy plan, which was recently acknowledged by the PUC, we have a forecast for what energy is going to cost and what capacity is going to cost. And collectively, that's pretty much what it costs to serve customers. Energy is the total amount of megawatt hours that we're going to need to sell to all of our customers. And the capacity is the ability to meet load instantaneously. Historically, it's something we've done by turning on our gas plants as we look into the future. It's something we're planning on doing with batteries, for example. So that amount. And again, this is just ballpark numbers, or not even ballparks, they're just indicative numbers or demonstrative. I guess if we say that's going to cost dollar 60, but then you all are choosing resources that collectively cost $90 per megawatt hour. People in Salem are going to be on the hook for only that $30. This is the hardest thing to explain in this program. So I'm just going to be quiet for several minutes. Well, you all think about this and ask me questions. Can you repeat that last line one more time, please? Sure. So if PGE'forecast for serving all customers over the next 15 to 20 years is $60 per megawatt hour and Salem is signing a contract, or having PGE sign a contract on Salem's behalf that costs $90 per megawatt hour, we are only going to ask people in Salem to pay, on an incremental basis that dollars between 60 and 90. Because that 1st 60 from zero to 60 is a benefit to all PGD customers. Because we needed to do that anyway. It's that last $30 from 60 to 90 that we didn't need to do. So that means. But everyone pays the first 60. Correct. For Salem residence, in your example, would still be dollar 90. Yes, but in terms of, like, if there's gonna be a line on your bill that says Salem community green tariff, or whatever you want to call it, it's only going to show that $30 divided by whatever number you're going to divide it by. So is there any thought to any of these projects, like, grouping, like, let's say, Salem, Milwaukee, in Portland, all decided to sign in? I'm going",

Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us for the wagon trail solar project. Complete application for site certificate virtual information meeting. The department intended to be hosting this meeting tonight in person, but because of whetherather had to change plans, we do take attending meetings in person seriously. And at the next opportunity to to host a meeting, which will be at the draft proposed order public hearing, we will be in person. It's actually a rule that we need to be hosting that in person. So you will see us in person at the next opportunity in the process step. Before I get too far ahead of myself, my name is Chase McVeigh Walker. I am a senior sighting analyst at the Oregon Department of Energy. I'm joined tonight, I believe, by my colleagues Todd Cornett, Sarah Estersson, Amricarr, and Nancy Hatch. Do we have any actually? I see. Well, I'll ask. Do we have any council members attending tonight? I see. Council member. By your council member, K. President. Oh, council member as awesome. Well, thank you both for joining us tonight. Really appreciate it. And than you do have Ann Byer on the line, also attended virtually, and I unmuted your mic. Thank you. And thank you for hosting this. Yes, thank you both for. For attending. Really appreciate it. The applicant for the Wagon Trail Solar project is Wagon Trail Energy Center, LLC. And I see that they are also here tonight. We have David Lawler, Ryan Hill, and Sarah Twitchwell. And before I go into my presentation further, I just want to go over a few logistics. The meeting tonight will be recorded and it will be posted to the wagon trail solar project project webpage along with a copy of the presentation slides. The present state the presentation slides actually are already uploaded and available on the wagon trail solar webpage. I will show a link to the project webpage later in this presentation. For those that want to write it down or don't know where it is, after I provide an overview of the energy facility sititing council process the applicant team will describe the proposed facility and then, following their presentation, will open up the meeting to a q and a session. And I ask to, I ask you to please hold on to questions and comments until we get to that portion of the agenda. Okay, well, I just kind of went over it, but tonight's presentation will provide an overview of the steps in the energy facility signing council review process, and we'highlight opportunities for public participation in the process. The and that's what I will I'll provide that overview, then I'll hand over the presentation to the applicant team to provide an overview of the proposed facility, and we'll close out the meeting with a q and a session. This is when the public will have an opportunity to ask questions about the proposed facility as well as the FSE SEC review process. Okay the Oregon Department of Energy's sititing division has one primary objective, to review large scale energy projects for compliance with applicable standards and rules. For reference, citing refers to the technical permitting review of a proposed energy facility against a number of predetermined standards. And I'll go into a little bit more of this in a couple slides based on site specific locational issues that may be affected by a particular facility. Please note that land acquisitions, land leases, and easements are all outside of the FSE SEC review process. The Oregon Department of Energy's siting division serves as staff to the energy Facility siting Council, which I will also at times refer to as the council or FSAC. The council consists of up to seven members serving in a volunteer capacity. Council members are appointed by the governor and approved by the Oregon Senate and represent diverse professional backgrounds from across the state. When OTo citing staff makes recommendations to council, council itself is the final decision making authority for energy facilities under their jurisdiction, including this project, the wagon Trail solar project. This slide represents or illustrates the seven major steps in the review process of applications for site certificates. The first step here, the first chevron, is the notice of intent phase",

        "text": " maximum blade tip height of 648ft. Next slide. There are also related or supporting facilities that are proposed in the notice of intent includes a battery storage. What we call a be on would occupy up to ten acres and it would store up to 201 energy. There are other facility components such as a switching station, a collector step up substation. I pointed at the point of interconnect as intended or proposed to be with the Bonneville Power Boyd ridge switchyard. There will be above envel below ground 34.5 kilovolt collection system. There will be a 10,000 square foot o and m building and 8 miles of approximately 8 miles of 230 kv overhead transmission line and some new access roads, approximately 10.2 some road improvements of approximately 13 miles, another set of staging areas and temporary batch plant. Those staging areas are primarily for construction purposes and I believe that is my last slide and I am going to turn it over to the applicant team to present more on the actual proposed facility and then we will, when they're done, we'll go right into public comment. Do you have their slides? It's all you. Okay, just to be clear, you're going to double back to the public comment slide that preceded this? Yeah. Thank you. So thanks again, folks. Again, Saml Theield and I head up the development team at IPA power. IPA Power is one in the industry is called a independent power producer, which means that we originate or initiate, develop, build, own and operate renewable generation and battery storage facilities. IPA Power was founded in 2017 under a different name. It was acquired by Blackstone, one of the largest asset owners across real estate, energy and other industries globally in 2020. And we have been developing utility scale again, battery storage, wind and solar energy facilities, and hybridizations of those different technologies across North America. Since that time. We're currently 114 people strong or headquarters are in Austin, Texas, and I'm based in Portland. Matt, who I'll turn it over to in a minute, is based in Idaho, but our sort of majority headcount sit sits in Austin. APA is a very credible developer, owner and operator of these types of facilities. Most of our team came from other independent power producers and have been working in this space for 20 plus years. We're currently operating 150 mw in Texas. We re under construction on another 150 mw in Texas, 100 mw in Los Angeles, in California, and then we just achieved notice to proceed, meaning we've just signed our construction contracts and have sent some large checks out and we'll be iminenently starting construction on 150 megawatt battery storage facility in Cuna, Idaho, outside of Boise. And we have a lot on the way. We have roughly two gigawatts. So 2000, what we call contracted backlog, meaning projects that have achieved a power purchase agreement with an ultimate buyer and therefore are in the late stages of development and we will be entering construction and operations over the next two years. We're operating across operating our development business across 16 states, all major power markets in the US, and for a relatively young company, again, only having been initially founded in 2017 and then acquired by Blackstone in 2020, are moving quite well along. Matt's going to talk about the project in detail. Kate, I think, did a good job of maybe heading off some confusion around why we're here today for a notice of intent for a project that many of you are familiar with and has been under development for a long time, and in a slightly different iteration, previously held a site certificate that's currently in the process of being terminated. Again, you're welcome to review the notice of termination on FX website. It'll give you the full color on why we're doing this. The very short version is that you, we as the applicant and the developer, felt it was most prudent to terminate that application and start fresh. We have the time to do so. Matt will get into the project schedule in detail. But in short, Bonneville Power who we are interconnecting our facility. Two currently estimates an earliest, or I shouldn't say earliest, an expected in service stateate for the interconnection facilities of the fourth quarter of 2027. And what we will work to accelerate that with Bonneville in order to just de risk that element of the project. The project will not be built until 2027. And so we have the time to see through a new applic application to simplify the process, clean up the project record so it's all consolidated within a single application for site certificate. And hopefully, eventually a successfully granted site certificate for the facility. So, with that said, I'll turn it over to Matt Hazard, who again is the PM for the project, to talk through details and look forward to answering questions later. Thank you again for your",

        "text": ". So we haven't identified specifically those pieces. This is just putting the plan together. Yeah. Well, we'll get down into the weeds once we get all this done. This is the first thing that had to be done. Thanks. Commissioner Bryant, any other conversation? Yes, sir. Commissioner, I would like to. Administrator boy on us. I would like to bring forward item 14 one one. And introduce Michael Chad Wicker as the new MSTU director. All right. And he told me he was very happy to leave the building department. So I don't know. Well, I see the building director was blocking his way, but he did relent. Good morning. Good morning. I just want to say that I am honored to be given the opportunity to do more for Marion county, and I am very excited to be a part of the MSTU team. Very good. Thank you. Mister Wicker. Yes, please. I gotta break your chops a little bit, and then I'll follow behind him. All right. Welcome. Welcome to the next best job that you've ever had. Right. I don't know what to say in that regard, but I just want to say a couple things. When I first got here, light commissioner Curry has been, for the last three and a half years, still lost with technology. Chad helped me, you know, get everything set up. When I first got here, he was part of the admin team. He was, you know, just one of those phenomenal resources that everybody called. No matter what, no matter what happens, we still call Chad, no matter where he's at in the organization, as he's had the opportunity to take advancement. And, man, I love it because, you know, you continue to play the high card. You continue to have that humble servant leadership type of style, and it served you really well. And I'm so happy that you're getting a chance to be the director. And not only that, but you're going to be a director in a place where communities have disagreements, discord and those kind of things, and your ability to communicate and be the face of Marion county and part of this board and our administration is going to look great for us. You have that type of style, and I'm so excited for you, and I know you do. Phenomenal. So congratulations. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Commissioner Zalick, have you talked to Matt yet? Have you guys conversed a little bit? I have not. Has he warned you, you know, about how much time you're going to be out in those communities loyal to Marion county? You don't talk to traders. Come on, now. You can't say that anyway. No, that's exciting. And I, too, like commissioners. Alec, I was not happy when you left us. Yeah. But it's exciting to see what you've done. Thank you. Congratulations. Anyone else? I'm just excited. He's a lifer and he's going to stay. Yeah. Sir. Well, having worked with him prior to his coming to the county, it seemed like a short time, but he made a mark in such a way as well in the financial industry. So I, too, am very happy to see your progression over the years and excited for the future for Marion county, as well as you and your family. Thank you very much. Thank you for the kind words. Thank you. Thank you, Chad. Thank you, Chad. Get them, buddy. I know. Next you're going to move into section eleven. And before you start, I would like to pull eleven one and bring you a new date at a later time. Okay? Okay. I'll move eleven two and eleven three. I would like to know that there is a typo on eleven for the first public hearing. It says Tuesday, March 19. That should be Tuesday, March 20, 2024. Mm hmm. 19 or 20th. And anyway. Yeah, so with that correction. Oh, wait, no, wait. I was going to say, let me go. The 19th is right on that one. It was wrong on eleven one. It says the 20th, so never mind. All right, so we're still good? Yeah, I'm just going to move eleven two and eleven three as presented on the agenda. Very good. Got a motion by Commissioner Bryant with a second by Commissioner Zalick. All in favor indicate with an aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. And now we get back to general public comments. So if there is anything that anyone in the audience would like to address with the board this morning, you are invited to do so. I do have one person who has signed up to speak, and he will receive five minutes and everyone else will have two minutes. Mister Nechtel, good morning again. Mir",

        "text": " a lot of our service area for water. They sell water. Right. When you lose access, the water that's just in them, you know, that gets, that gets back to the entire point. The other thing we deal with on the f, mitigation side, if you want to. We're damned if we do, we're dam, if we don't, we shut off power to these at risk communities, high extreme fire risk communities. They lose their wells. When they lose their wells, they don't have water. Um, technically, if we shut off power, we're going to get, we're going to get sued either way is, is the way we look at it because we've shut off their ability to protect their structures, the way they sit it, because they can't get water. If we don't shut it off and a fire starts, we, so we'we're, in trouble either way on those sides. And there's, there's, the only way to mitigate the risk is underground. Go on that side of it. Yeah, that's very similar for us too, because our risk is in our more rural areas and that's what heals. You know, Cascade range, the coast range. People are on wells. Right. Lower density. And it's the same issue. It is, and it's one that, that I think every rural area feels with and struggles with on that side of it to, to keep them, to have the availability of, of their wells staying on yet at the exact same time protecting everybody from fire. Yeahually, rural fire to also have access and volunteer firefighters to also have access in southern Morgan have many times. It's really hard to find a good middle ground. Right. You know, maybe there's something in there for these cascading effects, especially, like, like you say, if you cut off the power, but all those, they all lose the ability to fight a fire because they don't have water locally. And so maybe there's a way to build that into, again, that vulnerability piece, trying to identify the greatest impact populations and letting those projects rise to the top, so. Right. Yeah. Well, thanks for kicking us off, but I know that we had some others that we're hoping to share some stories. I don't know if we have the ability to identify them and unmute them or if there's any others in the room. We can. Sure. We have Greg Lambberg who just fl in. Peterson Power Systems is a leader in providing clean backup solutions to load serving entities for public safety power shutoffs. And Greg, is there anything else you'd like to say on that in this webinar here. I think this is a great discussion. I think thej presents some tremendous opportunities for all of us in Pacific Northwest to harden our systems and provide more resiliency for customers. We are your local caterpillar dealership throughout Oregon, and over the last four or five years, we've been providing a tremendous amount of backup solutions that run on renewable fuels to backstop public safety power shutoffs. We provide over 100 mw annually in the summer to a Pacific gas electric company that we locate in their substationsions throughout California. We're starting to see more and more of this activity in Oregon and southern Washington, and if we could be of any help to the northwest load serving entities, please feel free to reach out to us and we'd be happy to help. We hate hearing people going without power, without water in the summertime, and it's very easy to deploy solutions to avoid those situations on a short term basis. Thank you, Greg. Thanks. I know that in the previous discussion yesterday, Christina, you had some really good feedback on some of the work for community benefit indicators, and I thought you made a really good point in terms of the work that's happening with the utilities in that space already and wanting to sort of learn from that, but also recognizing that the different utilities are in different places. And so this is a really good learning environment to sort of see what everyone's doing where the, where there might be some opportunities for alignment. So what we found, you know, clearly we're really engaged and involved in working on community better indicators related to hospital 2021. We, we work from there. We also had experience in Washington, c 2019 doing a similar effort. And one of the key elements of that is building partnership and also creating pathways for engagement and input by people that are absolutely affected and impacted by thell out, these decisions being made. The key point I was trying to make yesterday into space, and I apologize for those of you that weren't there, was that while there may be some, I think maybe even mindset sometimes that may create a limiting perspective on how to move forward on community benefit indicators, really, I think there are s some lessons to be learned by the very public process that a lot of, for example, that I use are going through as we kind of, as some people",

        "text": " and maximum awards? And what about the sub grant process? Would you prefer to see a competitive process or a first come, first served style process? What else should we consider in designing our program? So if we can go to any questions or public comment that would be appreciated. Yeah, Roger, there is a question here from Tim at the Multnomah County Office of Sustainability, and they're wondering if we are anticipating a single award cycle or multiple for the sub grants. Emily, I believe you'd be best to answer that. I think it's a single. Right. I'm happy to answer that. You know, given that this is a one time funding opportunity that we know of, we intend for this to be a single award cycle. And in terms of the timeline, we have a three year reporting period. And because of the nature of timelines, in terms of how we'by, the time that we receive the funding award letter and we get these sub grants out to you all, we'd probably be looking at about a two year period of performance for our sub grantees to stay on on track and on time. I hope that helps answer the question I'm not seeing. Oh, yep, they said it did. Thank you. Yeah, not seeing any hands raised either. But yeah, feel free to keep writing stuff in the chat or go ahead and raise your hand and we can unmute you as well. Oh, we got one more in the chat here from AJ at Fall City. Does reducing emissions include electrifying of municipal fleets? I think that would qualify. It depends upon how you, how you want to go about it, but I would definitely not note it to us either. An email or we'have the chat here, but also we have the portal that you can enter. Any comments in that we can collect easily and consolidate from there. That's a good idea. Any other comments or questions, suggestions? It looks like we have a couple of handra raised now. I think Natalie was first. Natalie Rogers. I'll go ahead and mute you. Go ahead. Hey, Natalie, hear me? I think we can barely hear you, Natalie. Oh, can you hear me now? Yep. Y gotcha, Natalie. Hey, Roger. Hey, everyone. How would things like resiliency projects, battery backup, solar arrays, et cetera, which ties to the decarbonization efforts, how would that kind of align with this block grant? I think that would fit in just really well. I would submit that as a comment from Milwaukee. Right? Yeah. Thank you. Thanks, Natalie. And we have another one from Julie Williams. I'll unmute you now. Go ahead. From Corvallis. I'm curious if a city government can access these funds to create a revolve loan system for low to middle income people to provide GAAP funding for access to all of the incentives for energy upgrades. Would this qualify? That might be on the fringe, but I would definitely submit that as a recommendation. That's an interesting, interesting point. The population of corvallis, you, I think 59,000 too big. Yeah, it probably is. I think it was 35,000 or under. And corvallis may have got a direct grant from the federal level. Okay, I'll check that out. Thank you. That would be the first stop. Oay. I can confirm that corvallis is. Is applicable to apply directly to the department of energy. Forvelis has an allocation of 122,590. Thanks, emily. That helps a lot. I'm not seeing hands raised. I haven't been able to do that for some reason. But if there's other comments you want to make in the chat, that'd be helpful. There are. I was just going to check with staceacy to make sure all of the hand raised were answered first. I think so. Natalie, did you re raise your hand or is that just left up? Yeah, I actually raised my hand again. I was curious, are we allowed to, you know, one concern that I would have, and that's always a concern, is just for these smaller jurisdictions, we don't necessarily have the staff capacity to implement programs. Are you open to local jurisdictions working with utility partners in implementation of these programs? For example, if we were to partner with PGE on something, would we still be eligible for grant funds? That would be the case. Awesome. Thank you. Okay. And then we've got a couple of questions here in the chat. A question about accessing the presentation and online webinar recording. How soon will folks be able to access that? Well, I think Emily has indicated that this will be up on our website, the recording of this tomorrow, and I sure hope it will be, but maybe give it one more day, even so, very quickly, actually.

        "text": " the Fairboard page on the Washington county website. The information is up year round. Anybody can apply at any time. We do occasionally have mid mid term vacancies, so we like to make sure that if we have applications available, we've got them on hand and applications are valid for one year after they apply. And our board and commission's team includes vacant positions and their weekly updates to community partners as well. Any questions on that? All right, so we have one position available on the fair board and we have two really good applicants. Sheila Harris is an applicant. I've known Sheila for a very long time and she would be a great fair board member. And then we also have Troy Bos, who is actually the staff recommendation to this position. And I want to give you just a little bit of information about why that recommendation is what we're bringing before you today to consider. Mister Sabalos is a lives in district two and like I said earlier, we don't have any. Most of our members from the fair board are geographically part of district four and having geographic diversity on the fair board to fulfill the needs of meeting everybody in Washington county being involved in the fair, and the fair board would meet the Fairbo board's goal in geographic diversity, as well as the other diversity that the fair board would like to see on the board. And then Mister Sabalos also brings the table some of those other things that, those categories that we don't see very often come up from a fair board member. While both applicants are past four h and FFA members here in Washington county and both served in roles as fair, I'm sor four hrs in their youth and showed at the Washington County Fair, which is great to see people when to come back and give back in their community. Mister Sebalos brings a lot of expertise in sponsorship fundraising and entertainment. And those things would really bolster and support the staff and the fair board in providing their oversight to the county fair and what we do and serve for the community. So that's just a little bit about why that, Mister Sebalis is the staff recommendation. And that concludes my presentation. I'm happy to answer questions. Commissioners. Roy is also exalted ruler of the Elks Club here. And the Elks are not only active participants with the fair, but at a lot of other organizations. So I know Troy. So I have an entirely different opinion, which when it comes to committee assignments, I very rarely do. But I think at a time when we need to emphasize agriculture more at the fair, seems to me that Sheila Harris has more to offer better suited than Mister Sebelus. As you said, they each have something they bring to the table. But I think we have to own our need to improve the agriculture relationships and the Washington county fair. So I'm just one of five. That's my thought. The other thing, and this isn't specific to this recruitment, but rather Miss Angie, I am quite dissatisfied with this quote unquote, advertising of our positions in this community connections email. The headline is Washington county has board and commission positions available and you have to click to find further information. Whereas for other jurisdictions, it has those specific positions in the title. We're not even marketing our own positions directly. It's like on a scale of a through f, we're doing c level work when the marketplace is demanding a level performance. Well, that should be a relatively easy fix, shouldn't it? It does go out for about six weeks. I've looked. I have a post it, which I left in my office of this specific weeks. But I mean, come on, we're not doing ourselves any favors. Those are just my thoughts. Yeah, I think we can work on implementing that feedback and then also working with the ACA is working with their departments on when we are recruiting, developing a further recruitment plan similar to employee hires. We have a recruitment plan because OIC does have a role in boarding commissions and so do the departments, and many departments have, for example, social media feeds that these opportunities could be further broadcast out so we can work on a few multiple tools. What you're asking us today for some feedback? I am, yes'm. Not as involved, obviously as commission Willy, but I like the comments and far as improvement, but I'd be a little embarrassed to the back and try to redo it now. So I'm okay with the recommendation. I think you've got three thumbs up. Okay, great. Thank you. Well, moving right along to the Fairgrounds development Advisory committee, we have four vacant. I actually have a presentation. I forget that part. You talked a little bit earlier about flexing muscles and I haven't done this in person in so long. All right. The Fairgrounds Development Committee member Appointment Fairgrounds Development Committee overview Advertising appointments it's almost just like I just told you about the fair board.

And that includes things like costs, efficiencies, feasibility, and the availability of different energy resources and technologies, economic and employment impacts, energy burden, affordability, environmental justice and community impacts and benefits. We'll also be looking at land use and natural resource impacts and considerations and things like energy resilience, security and market implications. So it's a pretty tall order. The energy strategy. Oh, yeah, Jessica, go ahead. I think you might. Edith, I have a really great question from the Q and A, and that's from Beth, who's asking in the energy flow slide it'she wants to know what's waste energy since we had 770 to btus lost in that. Yes. Waste energy is energy that's lost and that doesn't actually help heat your home or power your vehicle. There are a lot of losses. Another word we can use is inefficiencies and how we use energy. And so this is one of the reasons that energy efficiency is so important. So losses happen everywhere from the power plant itself. Losses can just be heat that goes out into the air rather than turning the turbine. There are losses that happen on transmission wires and distribution wires, and then there are losses actually at the device level. So cars are a really good way to look at that. Like fuel economy standards try to reduce the losses in the car itself and make it more efficient. It's a good question, and I just take this opportunity since we stopped, to remind folks, if you joined as a participant and haven't added your name and affiliation to the Q and A, we don't have a chat on this webinar, but if you could do that, that would be fantastic. Thank you. Thanks, Jessica. So the energy strategy ultimately will take the form of a final report with three parts, and this again comes from the bill. There'll be a summary of the energy strategy and pathways to achieve Oregon's policy objectives. There'll be a description of stakeholder engagement and how stakeholder perspectives informed the energy strategy and recommendations of policy options. The starting point for this work is going to be number one. It's really undertaking the technical analysis to understand where we are today and what the different pathways or options might be and what the trade offs are for those different options moving forward. So that's what I'd like to talk about next. I'll start by saying that we have just kicked off work with our technical consultants, the Clean Energy Transitions Institute, who we chose through a competitive procurement process. And we're very excited to be working with them. They really know their stuff and you'll hear more from them in the future, although today you're stuck with me. So. But they helped us prepare these slides and we have been speaking with them quite a bit on how we structure the analysis, which will help us also structure in the engagement, which I'll talk about in a moment. So it's useful to start with the tools that we'll be applying. We're going to be undertaking a modeling exercise. So model. The model will take a look at the whole energy sector across the economy today. So not just electricity, not just transportation, but across the whole energy sector. It will make assumptions about how energy use and energy needs are met into the future. Importantly, the modeling is going to be structured to meet Oregon's energy policy objectives, including Executive Order 200 four, which calls for an at least 80% reduction in economy wide greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, HB 2021, which I've already mentioned, the 100% Clean Electricity standard, the Clean Fuels program and Climate Protection Program, just to name some of the really big ones. But there are other policies in there that we'll be looking at. So the model is designed to meet those objectives and within that to look at least cost solutions, or look for least cost solutions. And by making different assumptions about the future, we can evaluate the trade offs of different pathways and answer what if types of questions. For example, what if more or less transmission is available? We can put that question into numbers in the model and into rules in how the model works, and we'll see what the effects are on the rest of the energy system and on what needs to be built, and on costs and on other effects. The model cannot answer all questions, though, so we'll also be conducting some complementary analysis and applying results of the modeling to get insights into other areas like jobs, like public health and like land use. And we will also be looking to evaluate equity effects. So I think it's important to talk about the goal of the technical analysis because easy to get kind lost in the idea of looking at the whole energy system and projecting into the future. So all of this serves to inform decision making. It is not a prediction of the future. It's also not a place to debate settled policy. We're going to put in where we are today",

        "text": " very important and fundamental transformation in how we produce and consume energy and interact with the energy system. So we have an economy wide target set by executive order 200 four of at least an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. HB 2021 sets a 100% clean electricity standard for our state's biggest ious by 2040. And we have the climate protection program, which we're following the rulemaking for closely, which sets a 90% greenhouse gas emissions reduction target by 2050. These are the anchor policies that are driving greenhouse gas emissions reductions across the economy and across the electricity sector, across fuel sectors. And at the same time, it's really important to recognize that we have a lot of other important policies that help drive and shape compliance pathways, and we are also taking those into account. And you can see a few examples here. There are too many to list on one slide, but we have the clean fuels program, advanced clean cars, two building codes, appliance standards, renewable portfolio standards, and many more. So if we go to the next slide, please, when it all boils down, we'll come out with a report to the governor and legislature by November 1 of next year. That's a Saturday, so it'll be a Halloween deadline. And the energy strategy will take the form of that final report, which will have three parts. So the first part is a summary of the strategy and pathways to achieving our policy objectives, recommendations for policy options, and a description of stakeholder engagement and how stakeholder perspectives informed the strategy. And going back to the earlier point about how we build in accountability, we will have a written kind of report and accounting of what we heard and what we did with that information, and we'll share that kind of as we go at certain points, but also in the final report, if we go to the next slide, please. So this is a little bit more information about the structure that we've built in to inform the energy strategy. So we have an interagency steering group. That group serves to ensure coordination between state agencies, and I've listed here, excuse the main agencies participating in that group. We also are in conversations with other agencies, and that group meets about once a month. We have the advisory group, which I've mentioned already, which will also meet roughly once a month and represents diverse perspectives and lived experiences from across Oregon. That group is different from the working groups in that it's meeting throughout the whole process. The working groups right now are really focused on the next couple of months. The advisory group also has discussions at a bit of a higher level. It's not digging into assumptions and data sources. It might touch on some of those pieces where they've kind of floated to the top as really important topics to flag to the advisory group, but they're having more of a bird's eye, holistic view of the process. You all are highlighted here because that's what we're talking about today, the working groups. You're helping us focus on the details of the modeling and the analysis that will come out of the modeling on some of those trade offs. Jeremy will talk about that in a bit more detail shortly. And you're all subject matter experts who are able to inform our work across all of the topic areas that we're covering in the energy strategy. We're also consulting with tribes. So we have an ongoing process for tribal cons consultation, both at government to government level. But you might also see even in the advisory group, we have some tribal organizations who are also engaged in that way. And tomorrow we're holding two public listening sessions. And the goal of those sessions is also a little different from the working groups. It's a broader forum anybody can join. The focus is to inform the technical analysis, since that's where we are in the process right now. But Oda will be much, very much in listening mode. We will be trying to tee up questions so that we can hear priorities from the public and understand what kind of priorities concerns, questions that folks would like to see the energy strategy answer. And that will also help inform our thinking about which scenarios we eventually model. And those scenarios will help us answer those questions. So if we go to the next slide, please, I think I'm almost done. There might be one more. So this is just a kind of a visual to understand the process in a little bit more of a chronological fashion. So right now we're in the stage of developing the technical approach. And as you can see, we have kind of stacked all of these or layered these various engagement structures to inform that approach. The one thing that I have not mentioned is the importance of EJ, environmental justice and equity engagement. So that's a piece that we're working on kind of throughout the process. And we also held a webinar in June, and we plan to hold a webinar at the kind of, at the end of this process of working group engagement and conversations, meeting with the advisory group to",

Keep the record open until April 1 at 05:00 p.m. next slide, please. Nancy okay, persons tonight interested in being considered for party status in the contested case proceeding must meet two criteria. The first relates to timing. To be eligible to participate in a contested case on this amendment request, a person must raise an issue, either in person tonight or in written comment before the deadline. Again, the council won't accept comments after the close of the record. The second criteria relates to the content of the comments for consideration in the contested case. Issues must issues raised must be within the council's jurisdiction. It must be raised with sufficient specificity so that the council, the department and the certificate holder understand the issues raised and are afforded the an opportunity to respond to the issue or issues. To raise an issue with sufficient specificity, a person must present facts that support the person's position on the issue. Um, and you can go, oh yeah, this is last one. Okay. No, that was fine. Before granting a request for a contested case hearing, the counsel must find that the request raises a significant issue of fact or law that is reasonably likely to affect the council's determination whether the facility with the change proposed in the amendment meets the applicable laws. In council standards included in chapter 345, divisions 22, 23 and 24. We do have a ten minute video that describes the type a amendment contested case threshold and that's available on the department's website and it's YouTube link Coun council has three options when it comes to requests for a contested case. Counsel may hold a contested case, may remand the proposed order to the department, or deny the request, and with that I conclude my portion of the presentation for agenda item a and we'll turn it over to vice chair condon for the second part of this agenda item. Thank you mister McVeigh Walker for that presentation, and thank you all for filling this room. Does. Do we need more chairs or do we want to take a five minute break just to do that or just go forward? I would take five minutes just to get people seated while we're doing that, does anybody want to provide? You might need to turn up the air conditioning. This is a public hearing on the draft proposed order on the request for amendment three to the leaning Jupiter juniper. Two, a site certificate I, Cindy Condon, FSEEC vice chair, am serving as the presiding officer for this hearing. Today is March 21, 2024 and the time is 614 pm. This public hearing is being held at an energy facility siting council meeting in person here in the Oxford Room of the Oxford Suites in Hermiston, Oregon. This hearing is also being held via a webex webinar with a call in option for those who cannot participate in person or via webinar. Today's hearing is being recorded, the presentations, written comments and oral for the amendment request for the facility. The purpose of the public hearing is to provide an opportunity for the public reviewing agencies, counsel and the certificate holder, if they wish to do so, to present oral and written testimony on the amendment request and the department's draft propos record on the draft closed order March 29, 2024. This different from some other hearings that have held that the record closed to stay open so people can consider comments and presentations today and comment, and hopefully there will be plenty of time to do so. So with that, is there a different slide pursuant to oAR 304 5027-0367 parentheses, five A and b. Please note the A person who intends to raise any issue that may be the basis for a contested case must raise the issue in person at the hearing or in a written comment submitted to the Department of Energy before the March 29, 2024 deadline, and that's 05:00 on that date. To afford the council, the Department of Energy and the certificate holder an adequate opportunity to respond, including a statement of facts that support the person's position on the issue. Review amendment process issues eligible for a contested case must be determined by FSEAC toot raise a significant issue of fact or law that is reasonably likely to affect coun council determination of compliance with an applicable standard. To raise an issue in a contested case proceeding, the issue must be within the council's jurisdiction, raised in writing or in person prior to the close of the record of the public comment period, March 29, 2024, at 05:00",

And then after the project'built, yes, the construction jobs are gone, but that benefit rolls into tax benefits. So right now, when we did our early analysis. This project is estimated to be giving Lynn county about $1.6 million in additional tax revenue every year to be used in whatever need to support lyindn county. And that's very early projections. Again, that's not including any of the community benefits packages that we want to propose for the project. 'been reaching out to different cities to see if there's any pet projects. Been reaching out to different school districts to see if there's anything we can help with. Reaching out to the local, different groups of interest groups to see if there's anything we can help with. And then again, through all the different schools, whether it be from k through twelve or higher education, things like that. They're trying to reach out to everyone to see if we get a list of things that they would like to see. We're never going to say no, but I can't guarantee anything. But what I've been trying to do is just asking everyone, like, what would you like to see? How can we help? And I take note of that, and I'm trying to see if that can be fit into the project. And then the last question is, do you think that there would be a significant impact to the price of consumer power? That's not in my control. That would be with the utility. Thank you. Hi, my name's Gary Olson. I just got a quick comment or question. It was mentioned earlier about the question was the impact of the cloud cover and the ability to produce electricity. Excuse me, I've a recent moved here a few years back from a place called Las Vegas. There's a little more sunlight than here if you've gone to Vegas in the last 1015 years. There's on the border at prim, right inside California. There's a monstrosity solar plant there called Ivanpaw. It's different than what you have because it's directing up to the peak there. One of those caught on fire. I don't know if they ever replaced it too. They used natural gas to generate electricity there as well, which people don't know about. But I mean, I haven't looked up or studied it recently since moving from there. It never met its potential. Never met its potential. They found out weird things. Planes fly overhead with contrails, reduces the efficiency on their plant. More clouds than they expected out in the desert and Nevada, but that reduced their efficiency. So you got all the sunlight that's there, and we have six months. So is there a sun still? And I just don't know how this efficiency works on there. Also, when they put that plant in, they destroy the desert tortoise habitat. Prior, when you'd go into California from Nevada on the 15, there was a sign there about natural nal area or something to was worded that signs disappeared and they wiped out all the tortoises that were in there would just strip in and put their plant. So I don't know how we protect our, what we have here. If you can just go through there're using that as an example. That's it. Just my big one. One comment. Soy can't speak for any standards that Nevada may or may not have. But again, I'll go back to ours where we have a fish and wildlife standard and a threatene endangered species standard. So you that will be evaluated to our process. Again, I can't speak to what they do, but I definitely know what we do. Hi, my name is Frank Frenzel. You talked earlier about staffing the place once it's built by three people, is that correct? And where they are they going to be part of that and part of other facilities, or is that going to be their main place? You would need anywhere from one to three full time staff to monitor the site. But, sorry, the project, typically that'd be remote because everything's through a computer type. But on the operation and maintenance side, that depends on the contract that we sign with a sheep grazer and what's required for that. But those persons would be on site as neededay. Because my concern is Mother Nature. If she starts destroying some of the panels, you know, and you have the material that is an environmental problem going into the soil or the wind coming up, picking one of those panels, or half dozen of them up and sending them 2 miles down the road or into the freeway. How long is it going to take for somebody to get there and clean that up, if even they can. So when it comes to construction of these projects, there are standards that need to be met for wind tolerances. So in case we look at historic wind data in this particular area to",

        "text": " timeline for the project. I noticed that it said that we had to start construction within twelve months and it had to be completed within 36 months. You know, that does make me a little bit anxious, given the current supply chain around the country and the world of what we're facing, getting some materials and some certain items. So I, I'm just wondering if there's going to be any flexibility around that once we start to go out for procurement and we find that we're having issues. That's a really great question, Wade. It's something that is, some of these timelines are set in the statute itself, and when the bill was passed in 2021, we didn't have the same situation as we do now. So we've certainly heard a lot about that. Rob, can you go ahead and dig in a little bit more on what we heard about that and what, what maybe we can do in addition to what the statute might limit us. How the statute might limit us. Yeah. So that's a good close read of the rules in the statute, Wade. And it does have a one year to start and three years to complete requirement. However, the bill also allows us to grant an extension, so we'll be able to grant extensions for these issues associated with, you know, the supply chain. And I'll have James correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe we can extend a project an additional year for the construction projects. And so if we find that there's a lot of issues beyond those timef frme we'll have to address those as they come because we are kind of limited to the statutory language, but we are going to be very accommodating up to the limits of the the bill itself. Okay. Thank you. Great. Thanks. Rob and Wade will be keeping tabs on this this year, too. And, you know, it could be something that the legislature might hear from people and want to take up making some changes there just because of the supply chain or something. So just know that there's that legislative session coming, and we don't necessarily have any plans to do that. I'm not suggesting that, but it might be just given how this year goes, that it does come up there, too. All right, thank you. Great. So Alex from Corvallis had a question that I always like to try to answer, and then like, let Robin James correct me if I'm wrong. So this is one where they can do that. The question was, can a project be just for renewable generation without being paired with the resilience aspect? And that's absolutely, that's absolutely possible. We have sort of four categories of projects, and so one of them is what we sort of call pure renewables as like, shorthand. And then there's the renewables plus resilience. The issue is that the bill is set up and our program is set up to give preference to those projects that are renewables plus resilience. So that's the only thing you can absolutely apply. We can absolutely accept those applications and put them through the competitive review, and they might you turn out just fine. But just wanna make sure it's clear that that's the issue, is that there's the resilience ones. We have to spend a certain chunk of money towards those projects. They also get, they can be up to 100% reimbursed versus only 50% for the pure renewables projects. Does anybody want to add to that, or correct me if I said anything wrong? All right, I'm learning every day. Any feel free the chat, you can raise your hand. Someone is wanting me to just make sure that I make it clear that there's, I can go back and show the dollar amounts. Just so it's clear. We can't fund necessarily 100% of all projects. There's so many more slides now. Okay, but this is the amount that we can give as a maximum grant award and the maximum percentage of the cost. So it's up to a million dollars, 100% for resilience plus renewables, and a million dollars up to 50% for renewables only. We got a lot of questions just to give you some ideas on the first webinar we had about like specific project ideas that people had in mind that led to some good conversation. So if you have anything in mind, you're thinking and just want to know if it'll fit the project or question. Any other questions, let us know. I did see another one in the chat though, which is great. Thanks, Joshua. This is a fire station. It sounds like this could be an appropriate grant for the design phase to develop a renewable energy component. What was the amount we could budget upro front if awarded? I'mn toa let, that seems like one for James, but I, I think this slide is helpful, right? Yes. So designing a fire station, renewable energy components. So if it was just kind of renewable. Well, planning is initially, so, yes, planning renewable energy only.",

Now, under this statute, the department is required to issue notice of this, of a hearing to adopt a final order. And that procedural box was checked because we included that provision when we issued the agenda for this meeting. So that's how, functionally, how we addressed that notice, which there is a part here. And I apologize. I'm going to go back because I totally skipped over. So we issued the proposed order, and when we issued the proposed order, as council knows, for applications, new applications, there's an automatic contested case compared to an amendment where individuals have to request a contested case. So the contested case, at the conclusion, when there was an opportunity for parties who commented on the draft proposed order to submit a petition for contested case, no petitions were received. So the hearing officer functionally opens and closes the contested case. And so she issued her, her order concluding the contested case on February 17. So at the conclusion of the contested case, which technically there was one, there was just no parties. Council shall issue a final order either approving or rejecting the application. So as we've gone through before, there's the standards and the question council is asking itself is the preponderance of evidence support the conclusion that the applicant has met the applicable standards, rules and laws that apply to the facility? And again preponderance of evidence. Is it more likely than not that the standard has been that is under scrutiny? So as a reminder, where are we? Just back in was it November, we were in beautiful Hermiston in Unottila county. The facility site is a relatively small site compared to what FAC does review. We are at looking at a 324 acre site boundary kind of right outside of Hermistton. And the applicant is EE West End LLC, a subsidiary of URs Solar holdings and URS Energy related support relr supporting facilities associated with this project are centralized or dispersed battery storage system, system, a substation and then switch a switchr substation which would interconnect with an existing transmission line. One of the items of note that is the focus of this application is that a couple benefits of this site is that there is a very. Is basically no access road. There's an access driveway off of the main road there which maybe I'll go, we can look at this and that's a little bit hard to read, but the road on the right hand screen there is the applicant would put, can you make sure just because the members how and Devlin can't see it, they're running it on their own. So just sort of clarify which. Okay, council members Howe and Devlin, I'm on the project overview slide that has kind of a more detailed layout of the facility site. So the applicant is not proposing a transmission line with this facility because it's proposing to interconnect with one of three transmission lines that run adjacen to two or over the site boundary. As we can see here, the facility layout has kind of avoidance corridors for the two existing transmission lines that crisscoss over the facility site. But the substation and switching station are more to the east end next to the road because the applicant anticipates connecting into the UEC line that runs parallel to the site. So this is, you know, keep this in mind and we have another figure. When we're talking about the goal inception and the locational dependency. This is one of those sites that really minimizes facility components and other impacts because of its location relative to the existing transmission corridor and existing access roads. Let's see. So part of the otherator supporting facilities common to solar facilities is there would be a 34.5 kv collector lines. There would be interior service roads. The applicant is proposing that the site boundary be a micro sighting corridor. So even though we're looking at this facility layout here, this is not what they would be bound to. They would be able to move facility components anywhere within their subject to the site certificate conditions. So there are conditions that represent a setback on this southern portion where there are those pivot circles. There's a condition for setbacks from the fence line",

        "text": "Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. We'll give folks a couple minutes to get on the call now that it's twelve noon and get started around 1202. Okay, I'll go ahead and get us started. We have one of our staff members who is up to speak as having some technical difficulties. So if things get a little awkward in a couple minutes, just know that that's why. But I can probably handle it taking care of his slides until we can get him on. So thank you so much to all of you for joining us today. My name is Christriy Split and I'm the Oregon Department of Energy's government relations coordinator. I'll facilitate our conversation today and I want to start by thanking Oputa, OmeU, Orrea and Eweb for bringing all of us oHoT yeah, that's right, eweb for bringing us all together for what I think is an exciting opportunity for Oregon's communities, an energy resilience and renewable energy grant program that can both support planning and projects. A couple things I want to flag before we start. While the first part of this webinar is aimed at applicants and cous are eligible to apply, we also want to be sure to cover what the experience could be like for utilities dealing with applications coming from within their communities. So we'll make sure that after we kind of get through the slideshow, we talk a little bit about that before we go into the q and a. I also just want to make sure that I'm clear about the definition of resilience here from the start. So the statute itself defines resilience and it's in more of the community resilience type of framework than maybe what resilience might mean for the grid or for utilities. So feel free to ask questions about this when we get into it. But I just wanted to like immediately raise the flag that this is more of like those community benefits when the power is out sort of resilience benefits that the bill, the statute uses us, the definition that we based our program on. So's see our, luckily our panelists that was having technical difficulties just made it. So we're go goingna be fine for our time together. We're going to spend about 1520 minutes going over the program itself, give an example of a project out of Eugene, and talk a little bit about the application process. And then most of our time together will really be determined by you and the questions that you have for our program staff about the program. You can use chat to ask questions along the way and you can raise hands or chat during the Q and A. And for those of you who aren't as familiar with Webex, I just thought I'd share a little bit about how to raise your hand and how to use the chat in case that's helpful to you. So, you'll see there are. You'll see that there are two ways to raise your hand, and one of those ways is right at the bottom. If you click on the little smiley face, one of the options is to raise your hand, and it's right at the very top. It doesn't have a image associated with it. And then you can also raise your hand if you click next to your own name under attendees. And then the chat, you can see, you can click to everyone and enter chat message. And that should be on the bottom and right hand side of your screen. So when you're done speaking, or if you decide you don't want to speak because someone else may be answered your question, asked your same question, you can click to lower your hand in the same places you click to raise your hand. So we can test this out. Now, if there's any questions on the plan today or how the meeting will be facilitated, go ahead and raise your hand if you'd like. We don't seem to have anyone on the phone. I'll keep an eye on that. But there's different ways to do that for folks on the phone, too. So if anyone has questions, you can ask them in the chat. You can? Yeah. And then I'll also just say, it'd be great if you could introduce yourselves and share what utility you work for in the chat as a way to kind of get us started. And that's definitely a good way to chat. Check that you're finding the chat function, and we can continue to use that. If you have questions, like mid presentation, just go ahead and throw them in the chat, and I'll make sure we ask them at an opportune moment. And then the other thing that I'll flag is that we'll use both chat and raised hands during the q and a part. Either one is fine, whatever is more comfortable for you. So, with that, I'm going to hand things over to Rob Del Mar and James Kogl, who are the certified smart people when it comes to this new program. Rob, you feeling ready? Yep. Sorry for the slow joint. I had a login problem, but I'm ready. Great. Well, it's nice to see you.",

        "text": " denial on test a case on one of the amendments as well as sort of the status, whether the status project is actually active or not active. So on February 14, we received request to decommission the facility, terminate the say certificate, as well as withdraw amendment number six. So the decommitioning request requires a notice and a public comment period. We have not yet sent out that notice to the public establishing a public comment period. So that will be in front of you. Whether it's March or April, it will be coming to you at some point. So we're starting just beginning in that process. Following on that, even though that project has not yet been terminated, the same applicant or developer has submitted a notice of intent for a new project, which is the summit Ridge renewable energy facility. Functionally it is the same project as approval through amendment number five as well as what they're proposing an amendment number six. So they're effectively resetting project that would include 32 wind turbines equaling 201 mw, solar area equaling 60 battery storage equaling 201 mw. That came in relatively recent. We have set up a website. The notice of intent is located on the website. But as part of the notice of intent process we have to provide notice to public and reviewing agencies and see comment. We've not yet on that. We will also have a public informational meeting. We have not yet set that either. So that will be coming council just a question about is that a strategy that does away with all the case activity and then we just start from scratch? I'm just curious what's behind it is terms of the activities so far and then going well. I'm really inclined to speak for the certificate holder or the stage the applicant. But on its face that appears to beself I guess from from our position we'll get a newlish per to get that starts to move. We know about a lot of that more but the analysis is still the same or similar. Yes. You know, in that assuming all of the standards and requirements are all exactly the same in terms of all of the characteristics and facts on the ground are all the same, it would be largely the same. But things changed. You know this original was approved in 2011. There has been multiple amendments, but you know it's also an opportunity. You know we know in this area, but for example in other areas of the Columbia Plateau, Washington grounds squirrel Migte you know and move into new areas. And we had where project has been approved taken several years to go into construction and by the time they did Washington ground Squirrel had moved into that area which then eliminated their ability to develop half of the project. Now I don't know if there's any circumstances like that in this area of this project, but that's where new information is valuable to assure that everything is the same. Don't we don't assume it is. We have to evalate the facts. Thank you. Next is the Boardman solar Energy facility. This is an approved 75 megawatt solar energy project on 790 acres located in north Morro county. It was originally approved in early 2018 with the deadline to begin construction in February of 2021. Council approved amendment number one, allowing a three year time extension for the beginning of instruction which ends today. The certificate alder stated that they will not be seeking another time extension will let the site certificate expired. They've indicated that they will be seeking county approval instead. If you recall the last, last legislative session, there was a change in jurisdictional thresholds about what go to the counties and they're going to be seeking to have this project permitted by the counties. Next is the Cardi generating station. So this is project is located in Morl county, not too far from city of Boardman. It consists of two components. It's an operational 450 megawatt combined cycle natural gas fueled electrical generating plant. And that was approved originally in 2012 and it's been constructed and operated. They did have another unit that was proved that they didn't build and longer valid. They also had questioned under amendment number 150 megawatt solar pv facility. So I don't picture the location, but you have the cardio generating station and across the street was the Boman coal plan. Then there is a big retention pond water area that was related to the h coal plant and south of that was where the solar facility was approved. So the solar facility was approved in 2018, not yet constructed. They requested time extension to begin construction through 2025. It'their February 2025 will be their new time only to begin construction. Earlier this month we received amendment number four, requested to increase the solar components from 50, adding 156 battery storage. Don't have not looked at the details. I believe a lot of that new area would be on the site of the coinate cor. Next on my list is the Muddy Creek energy project. So",

        "text": " ye. Other comments or questions for questioner Hler. Rob, can you hear me? Yes. Okay, good. My question is more procedural. How can the plan help with this, these projects meeting these goals? Do you envision any role for us? That's a good question. And there, there are some programs, and I will bring up the community renewable energy grant program that. That odo runs. I work known as the C Rep. In fact, Salem has already been a successful applicant with PGE for one of those projects. But I think that with, when you can get a municipal entity, a planning commission looking at renewable energy projects, you can start unlocking some of those things that we identified in the study, like potential sites that might be appropriate for development, sites where maybe there was an old industrial, you know, an old industrial development that maybe is no longer there. And so it's served with an electrical service and is ready to go for something like a solar project. The other thing is just, you know, understanding the grant programs that are out there and working with community members to get grant applications flowing. And this relates to the first question, which the second part of that question was, how reliant are these projects on the grants? And we find that at the small scale, they are still reliant on grants, and especially when you bring in that energy resilience component, because batteries are still very expensive. And one thing that I noticed when I was reviewing the community solar projects, when I looked at it, probably maybe four months ago, 0% of those projects had any energy storage, which means that when the grid goes down, they are not able to provide power to the local community. And so we haven't found that community solar is addressing the resilience component that well yet. Now they have time to get that going, and the technologies are coming along, but that's really an important one with our grant program, seeing if you can tie a project to, you know, there's a project in Eugene where a rooftop solar facility on a school is tied to a municipal water well and a battery storage system. And if the power goes out for two weeks, the solar on the roof charges the batteries, and the batteries run a well pump, and you have the ability to bring potable water to the community members. And those types of benefits are something that you all could think about as you work through some planning, not only the renewable energy and storage part, but where is it most appropriate to cite one of these? You know, what are the most vulnerable communities within Salem where a project like that might bring the maximum benefit? So, you know, just keeping your eye open for opportunities, I think, is a great thing to get out of flning commissions. Thank you, Rob. Other questions? Commission slider. Thank you. And thank you, Rob, for joining us tonight. Do have a couple questions. One of the resources that I see in Salem is rooftops and empty park lots. We have a lot of rooftops. I spent some time just looking at rooftop areas, which is a very exciting thing to do late in the evening, and found that just like in the McGillrest area, there are 28 acres of roofs just in that one space. Now, of course, not every piece of roof is going to be useful for solar, but when I looked at the chart on page, what our page is 18, it takes about six acres to generate a megawatt of solar energy. So even if 50% of that space were used just when, Milillresst alone could generate 2 electricity for the city of Salem. And I know in that case, actually, one of the facilities we in there is a commercial battery storage facility, which is kind of interesting. So there starts. There seems to be a market now for commercial electrical storage. So one of the questions I have in this is, you know, if I were. If I owned a building in the go crest that had a two acre roof and I wanted to put. And I want to put a solar array on there, that solar array would not get to the size of what we're talking about in this conversation. Is that correct? It doesn't. Is it is community scale solar? Is it 1 up and anything below that isn't part of this conversation? No. There's an upper band, and that's 20 mw defined in the statute. But on the small scale, you could go down to the hundreds of kilowatt range. And rooftops are a really prime opportunity, one you don't see them. And so you're developing an area that has no local opposition from an aesthetic standpoint. But it's also not disturbing any farmland or the place where I used to run my dog or any of those types of sites. A second advantage to rooftop solar is that most of the time you're interconnecting those projects on the customer s",

        "text": " support all of this within the draft slide. So up first is transportation. Not only is transportation the largest contributing sector in Oregon to greenhouse gases, it is also the one that touches almost everyone's lives. Whether taking a bus, driving a car, getting packages, transportation is involved. I had a delivery this morning that was delayed, actually from our ice storrm, so I know what that's like. By including transportation in this PCAP and applying for funds to address greenhouse gas reductions, as well as it will address those major greenhouse gas reductions. Just to be clear, like this funding, this is our largest computer. So by including these measures, we're really going to more quickly address the greenhouse gases coming from transportation. And in addition to addressing transportation, we get other air quality as well as environmental justice benefits. Oregon already has an EV rebate program for cars. However, there are more people who want to rebate than there are funds to provide rebates to the point that the program can only run for part of the year. This measure in the PCAP is to expand those rebates for EV cars, and it's focused on supporting low income and moderate income households. And it also is for both new and used EV cars, another measure ofs medium and heavy duty vehicles. Examples of these vehicles include school buses, transit buses, garbage trucks, and deliverery trucks. Oregon has an existing grant program is creating a rebate program for medium heavy duty vehicles. The current program has millions of dollars of applications every year that do not get awarded due to available funds. This measure would expand funding to support purchasing medium heavy duty electric vehicles, which also reduces diesel exhaust. These programs will prioritize vehicles that drive in areas with vulnerable populations, such as where there are children, minority populations and lower incomeals. The potential recipients include fleets, school districts, local governments, tribes and companies. We're also including measure to support infrastructure for electric vehicles so that new electric vehicles are able to charge because it's great to have the vehicles on the road, but we also need to be able to support so that they can charge slide please. Housing is a major concerne organ and these measures are in support of the creation of so sustainable energy efficient buildings as well as efficiency gains for existing buildings. Again, there are existing programs to support the delivery of these measures. They have some funding, but those funds meet a small portion of the need. If we received funding, this measure would increase the energy efficiency of housing, create more sustainable and lower carbon footprint buildings. In addition, these measures can support Oregon residence by offering heat pumps and weatherization. Not only would there be greenhouse gas reductions, but there would also increase community resiliency, especially for extreme events. These measures include incentives to build more energy efficient houses or incentives to the reach code, incentives for heat pumps and near existing houses as I mentioned, and weatherization as the same. And it sentence to early adoption for buildings of the building performance standards, resulting in additional near chart nearer chart greenhouse gas reductions. Next slide please. Addressing waste is not something a lot of people think about, but it is a huge contributor to greenhouse gases in Oregon. It also needs a holistic approach, meaning one that addresses greenhouse gases from upstream to downstream. So from food waste to the greenhouse gases that result from the waste in LA, our measures aim to address food waste through the recovery efforts that prevent food waste from going to landfills and utilizing techniques such as composting and anaerobic digestion. Landfills remain one of the largest sources of methane emissions in our state. Methane has a high global warming potential, 28 times more than carbon dioxide, so we are also including a measure that allows for site specific emission reductions while we discuss buildings on the last slide. Using materials that have low embodied carbon can make those new or renovated buildings have an even lowered carbon footprint. So that's also included within our materials measures. That was a lot of information and a lot of measures to go through quite quickly. I just want to say that all of the measures that I just walked you through were selected to address the areas where greenhouse gases reductions are needed the most for our state. But they are also selected because they're scalable, they can deliver reductions in that short period of time, and they can benefit rural communities throughout our state. Slide, please. Just as a reminder, in addition to the state agencies and mult jurisdictions, we'also engaged with interested tribes in Oregon to identify actions to include in the state's PCAP so that they can point to the state's PCAP to apply for implementation funds as they are also eligible applicants under this program. Not all tribes are developing a PCAP, however, the ability tribes of northwest Indians Ati is also developing a plan that tribes within the region can point to. In addition to state's PAP engagement with interest, tribes in Oregon has guided actions for inclusion and tribal priorities which you see reflected in the draft, and we continue to engage with those tribes to make",

You're off from you addressing my question. I'm not a contractor. I'm just, I guess one of those non LMI people, just a residential person. Homeowner who is interested in getting onto this solar panel stuff and I was doing research. I think the biggest whole thing that's been holding me back is that storage solutions are not really up to par. I'm not really liking what's the common storage solution right now, which is lithium ion. And I heard that vanadia, I looked at some alternatives and vanadium flow, it seems to be the best out there for long term and reliable non drainaining. So many factors. I guess I could look into the contractor. Sounds like what you're saying is I need to hire a contractor that Oregon O doe approves of. I guess what I would hope then is I could work with them to buy the storage that I want and if they can't, I guess I'll just have to wait for vanadian flow to become more popular so that they might consider it. Ye you'd have to do the purchase through your contractor, but hopefully you could find a contractor that'd be willing to work with you co on what you want. Excellent. Thank you. That answered my question. Yeah, got to be purchased from the same contractor. But yeah, the contractor should be able to help. Great. Well with that we can go ahead and move on to the next slide. Thanks James and everyone for the good questions in the comments. Okay, so other proposals that we're kind of proposing in for amendment are include increasing the number of low or moderate income residential customer or low income service provider reservations a contractor can have at a time from 20 to 25. We're also proposing to increase the amount of time a reservation for low income service provider can be extended for one from a one year reservation with a possible extension of 180 days to again that one year reservation with a possible extension of an additional year. This is again due to the feedback that low income service provider projects have been delayed due to supply chain and workforce constraints. So that would be like an extra 180 days there to get those projects complete. But again, looking for feedback whether that is would be helpful. An additional rule change being proposed is to reduce the residential rebate rate for customers who are not eligible for a utility incentive and are'm not low on moderate income, from fifty cents per watt down to we would maintain the current rate of wat for those that are eligible for utility incentive and are not low or moderate income. And again the same we're going to maintain the rate for the low moderate income rebate as well. And we're also proposing to remove some language in rules that was written when the program was first established and relates to kind of the original budget timeline. So kind of pulling out some of those original dates, but kind of maintaining same allocations. They're just kind of doing a little bit of a cleanup from when the program was first established. While I've got these proposals upon the screen, are any questions or comments on these rules? Chrie on t mute. Looks like Frankie G. Had their hand up first. Cool. I think it's pretty, the causation, the link is pretty clear why the reduced. But I wanted to hear it from you, Gu, you two, or one of you two, is that it's pretty obvious the amount a rebate will be reduced for non LMI is because you want to kind of allocate more the money to the LMI residential customers from 20 to 25. But is that why there's just not enough money to increase LMI and keep the residential rebate rate? So I think to some degree, that kind of the landscape for utility incentives has changed a little bit since when the program was first started. So inart it to kind of take account for those changes as well as to kind of increase the longevity of the program and sustainability of the program. That makes sense. Yeah. And I think, Frankie, the thing that I would add just quickly is one of the things that's changed a lot is there's a federal tax credit, and for low to moderate income populations, that federal tax credit isn't always available. But for someone who's above that income threshold, they'll qualify for that federal income tax credit that wasn't there before. So it basically says, like, we'll still give you an incentive, like a rebate incentive in addition to your tax credit, but, like, you're going to get more than you were going to get before from a different place. So kind of leveling that out. And then the other piece is that we want the incentive to last longer, to go further. And so if we're continuing to incentivize",

        "text": " would just take this slide to walk through it with you so that it gives us all the same foundation to work from as I go through the slide deck. So we recently filed our integrated resource plan and our first clean energy plan on March 31. A little bit about the difference. Our integrated resource plan basically forecasts our system energy and capacity needs. It's giving it a long term view on how we're going to meet our customers energy needs. It also provides, in addition to that, our integrated resource plan. It also includes a short term action plan and the basis for any requests for proposals. Rfps. Now, the clean energy plan that was required out of House Bill 2021. And this one we filed together with our IRP. And it's our first one ever. And that one details PGE's plans to meet emission targets and demonstrate our continuous progress towards that. It also requires extensive community engagement and must include community benefits in meaningful ways. Together, the integrated resource plan and this inaugural clean energy plan provide a comprehensive roadmap detailing how the company will meet customers energy needs and or organ's ambitious gas emission targets while still maintaining reliability, safety and affordability PGE's path to these targets is possible with resources available today and I will get into that and talk about the company's strategies. Next slide please. So we have huge goals and 350 do is very familiar and others and they'room are familiar with our goals. And I thought it would d be helpful to talk about what these goals are, which is our decarbonize our systems and you'll see our goals there. And we are leading an energy transformation that will harness the power of clean and renewable resources. On the electrify side, customers and communities are electrifying vehicles, homes and workplaces. And just a data point is 100% of new car sales by 2035 will be electric vehicles. So it's not going to happen overnight. It will be a transition on the preferred side, one of the things that our customers and communities depend on us to deliver affordable power to live, work and play safely. Next slide please. So how are we going to navigate this extraordinary transition? As I mentioned, on March 31, we released our Clean energy Plan and our integrated resource plan to the Oregon Public Utility Commission. Now, they will take some time to evaluate and review these and this combined plan is over 1000 pages long and I'm going to try to summarize it here in this one slide for you. Interestingly, I've spent a good two weeks getting through it, so it is long, but we modeled all of our load forecasts, we looked at all of our generation and supply options, and we are proposing a five part action plan which the pie the Oregon Public Utility Commission will evaluate. PUC there are five major actions and they are as follows. Customer actions. We will not be able to achieve our collective decarbonization goals without engaged customers. And that means customers doing energy efficiency upgrades, signing up for load shifting programs at lower usage during peak times when we ask them to. It will also require large renewables, wind and solar. We need to siteite additional large wind and solar facilities and we need to do it to diversify our portfolio on the small solar storage. We also must support the sighting of small solar and battery storage throughout communities including Salem and Marion county. To add a bit to the complexity of this, we are investing in a technology platform that basically aggregates all these small batteries, demand response programs like thermostats and solar panels into what we call a virtual power plant that we can basically ramp up or down like we do a regular power plant. Ultimately, this platform could include anything that allows us to shift or add load. So batteries at home or from in vehicle, or even just the ability during a peak time to start charging your vehicle if it's plugged in and wait to charge it in the middle of the night so I can talk mean I could do the entire hour on virtual power plants. But the key that I want to convey is that we will increasingly be using technology to make the system more efficient and shift load that can be shifted to better match the available generation. Which I can share is partly because solar and wind is intermittent, so we'need. That ability. Then I have it listed here at storage and that is primarily battery storage and then transmission at the highest level. PGE strategy involves a wide array of commercially available tools in the clean energy toolkit between now in 2030. Next slide please. We really want to talk about maintaining affordability and safe, reliable, affordable and clean are the four attributes we focus on and affordability is a big one lately with inflation and added costs, do volatility in fuel prices and extreme weather events, and the investments we are needing to make at a high level. Giving customer tools to control and manage their own costs is a big priority for us. This includes an improved dashboard that shows their energy use and when",

        "text": " So we would be, if we created a 19 meawatt facility, we would sell that power to you and then buy it back. Yeah, that's basically right. And then there would be a rate that we would establish for how much that we would be paid for that electricity. Correct. Gotcha. Thank you. That was my el. My question. Thank you. Other questions? Yeah. From Juliana or Robert, how you see this working into our climate action plan. So at that scale of what it can be and the cost, I see it being a smaller program where we could do a community benefit agreement with it and get a smaller scale renewable project funded through this type of a mechanism. And what does that look like? What's the smaller scale renewable energy project? Wonderful question. We actually have a couple that we're looking into right now. The municipal airport was doing a solar feasibility study, and our water folks are looking into in p. In pip power regeneration recently. You'got gravity feeding water down. We feed it through a small turb engine right now. W. It's cool. It's cool. But as far as these things go, they won't be hugely offsetting the total greenhouse gas emissions unless we do a really big project. But if you're doing a really big project, you're going to have really big costs. So I agree with one of Riley's statements from earlier that going into it and trying to be like, we can do 100% renewable probably isn't a good starting point. If we want to look into starting it, I think doing a this much reduction might be a better point to mitigate those risks for the city as well. So we could do a project like, say, the in line, whatever generation the Turine, which would be, I would think, relatively small cost. So this could be like maybe 3 million. Okay, so I'm just going to pull numbers out of the. There like $0.50 on somebod these bill or something like, really a relatively small impact. Something like that could be possible. Correct. As opposed to something that would be like 25 buc or something. Ye. Okay, well, there's. And the other part to answer the question is how it fits in the climate action. Action plan. In many ways, this is one of the early opportunities for everybody in, but most everybody in Salem to say, I'm involved in a climate action plan because I'm contributing. This amount becomes an individual participation opportunity, less so than what are they doing somewhere else. Which would be an interesting exercise to see how many people do participate. And if I could add one. One note on that. You know, it's. Think about this, both in terms of the things that you can do to just sort of simply reduce the city's emissions on a, you know, metric tons basis. And then also things you can do to benefit your community overall. Like, there's a combination, like, does a project where you put solar panels on top of a fire station and also batteries in the basement reduce emissions? Absolutely. It also provides really significant resiliency benefits for your community in the events of a major outage, whether it's caused by a big earthquake or an ice storm or whatever else. We PGE provides really significant uptime, but it's not perfect. And it can't be just because of the climate and other environmental risks that we all face. So that's a spot where, you know, maybe you can go to your community and say, this is going to increase your bill by $2 a month, or whatever the number is going to be. It will help us, you get closer to our climate goals and also provide the significant benefit to our community overall, regardless of the climate benefits. I think that's a really great point. Riley. And mayor, you're well aware that city of Salem has the first community microgrid. And that's an excellent example of a partnership, as well as has a larger role in serving the community, because it does serve your public works, which is your emergency operations center in case of a significant event. It has multiple benefits in that microgrid. It also is serving a small number of customers. But I appreciate that Riley brought up that we can certainly have conversations about what makes sense for your community in terms of a small scale project. Great. Thank you, Wendy, for that context. I think, like something that just came to mind, we could do another microgrid, maybe at our airport in associ with a solar. A solar fire out there and then. Because we know that in the event of the Cascadia, our airport could become really a critical asset that we need to keep up with running. Yep, exactly. That's exactly right. So then it has a resiliency aspect, it has an economic aspect. So it's like multiple benefits to the entire community. Great. I guess my last question, if I could, is one",

        "text": ". As I had reported at the last meeting, we received the notice of intent for the Summit Ridge renewable energy facility in northeastern Wasco county. This would be a 201 megawatt wind, solar, and battery storage facility. Public notice was issued on March 14, and a public comment period is open until May 3. We will be holding a public informational meeting on the project on April 3 at the Dooer K through twelve school gymnasium starting at 05:00 p.m. so if council members are interested in attending, please let. Let me know, either in person or virtually. You know, we certainly encourage attendance. You. We're tracking that. The only limitation would be if we end up having four, that would be a quorum, and we'll have to deal with that. But if there are three or less, that is certainly not an issue. Also, I had reported the last meeting on the summit Ridge wind farm, which is largely the same as the new Summit Ridge renewable energy facility. That project has submitted their request to terminate the site certificate. So once they submitted that information, we evaluated it. There was missing information, so we didn't provide the notice that's required after we receive that. We've since received all of the required information and sent a notice on March 13 with a public comment period that concludes on April 1. So unless something changes, we are on track to have that in front of council at the next council meeting on April 19 for your review and possible termination of the site certificate. Next mist amendment number 13 so this is for the mist underground natural gas storage facility this project is an operational natural gas storage facility located on approximately 5472 acres. It has a permitted daily natural gas throughput of 635 million standard cubic feet. It is comprised of underground natural gas storage reservoirs, compressor stations, gathering pipelines, o and m facilities, and a gas transmission pipeline. The project was originally approved in 1981, has been amended twelve times, and the certificate holder is Northwest Natural Amendment number 13 proposes to replace and upgrade the two natural gas fired compressors replace and upgrade an underground electrical power supply create a 7.5 acre construction lay down area that will be converted to a permanent storage after construction. Develop for existing storage reservoirs, including above ground well pads, to increase natural gas storage capacity so increasing the amount that they can store at the site install injection and withdrawal wells and transmission pipelines install three reciprocating natural gas fired compressors install two natural gas dehydration equipment systems and construct a new control and operations new control and operations buildings. So we just received this. It will very soon be added to the project page where the amendment can be looked at and we'll be sending out the notice very soon as well. Next on my list is the Klamath Falls Energy center. Earlier this week we well, we received the money for the notice of intent and I didn't get verification if we received actual notice of intent, but it was intended to come in this week. So this would be a 400 megawatt solar pv and battery storage project located approximately 9 miles west of Klamath Falls on private land that is zoned forest. So this would be our first solar project zoned on forest zone land versus exclusive farm use. Zone land project would be located on 7350 acres, although the solar footprint itself would be about 4300 acres or 6.3 sq. Mi. The developer is savion, which is a division of the Royal Dutch Shell Company. We have yet to create a web page for that or obviously put the notice of intent on there, but that'll all be coming soon, as well as establishing a date time location for a public information meeting which would likely be in K climate Falls. So that will be coming soon. Any questions before I'this? Is chair Grail. I apologize. I just said, oh, if we go to Camp Falls, I've not seen Perry in person before. It would be a greatand opportunity. One update on a compliance issue. So this is for the Reed College nuclear research reactor. So at 11:43 a.m. on March 7 of this year, an operator trainee operating the research reactor under the direction of a license operator initiated a planned manual scram. Following the planned manual scram, the license operation or operator did not turn off cons, the console switch or remove the key from the console. So they basically did a test. They kind of walked away and left, literally, the key and the ignition. So the reactor did not meet the definition of reactor secured as a result of that action. So the license operator then left the control room, securing the door on their way out at 12:00 p.m. so this started at 11:43 a.m. basically 17 minutes later, a licensed senior reactor operator entered the control room, found the key in the console with",

Here'some of the stakeholders that we've already started outreach or have already contacted a few of them to note would be Lynn county itself, as well as the tribes. And I did want to emphasize that we have met with ODFW. We have been talking to them about the methodologies prior to the start of our environmental studies. We're going to continue coordinating with them throughout this time process, including for the review of the results, mitigations, oay. So just continuing with some of the more stakeholders that we have talked to or reached out to already, that would just be some the locals of Ly county listed there. But I also wanted to call out Doctor Chad Higgins. He is a professor at Oregon State University studying agrivoltaics. We've been in contact with him to learn more about just agrivoltaics and dual use, including when it comes to sheep grazing and solar, and utilizing not only his, but everyone's contacts that we have met with to find the right persons to talk to to make this the best project possibly could be. Next slide, please. And that brings us to the end. Nancy, could you go to the public comment slide, please? Okay, well, we've, we've reached, we've now reached the public comment portion of tonight's meeting in person on, I want to mention reiterate that the public comment timeframe doesn't end until August 11 at 05:00 p.m. so it's until then, any comments made today would be record this facility. So to walk through the comments today, we're gonna start by taking questions, comments from people in the room first, and then we'll follow up by seeing if anyone on the webinar itself has comments. And then we'll conclude with people on the phone. If there are people on the phone, and we have received a number of comment cards already, and if you have any comment cards picked up at the front, please provide them to Nancy in the back so that we can bring them up here and call commenters to the mic, I think. Next slide, please. Nancy. So we do have a lot of information that we hope is helpful in understanding our process, and it's all available on our website. Our website contains a public guide and a series of handouts to explain how the energy facility siting process works and how to participate in the process. The website also includes options for individuals to sign up, to receive email notices if you haven't already, and to also comment on on other citing projects. And I just wanted to reiterate that the slides in this present presentation we are already to energy part project page online in a recording of tonight's meeting will be posted to the project page by the end of the week, expeditiously posted to the project page. Nancy, next slide, please. And for those online and in the room, this is my contact information. Should you like to provide mely electronic copies or hard mail? Hard mail copies of comments and those on the phone? This slide has my contact info and I can just confirm my phone number. Phone number. Should you like to get in contact? It's 971 605. Three, two, three. And now I think we'll start going through cards that we have filled out. You can speak later on. Nancy, can you go back to the Q and a slide just so people online can see that? Okay, so we have well, all first state. Again, apologies. We had a lot more people show up than we thought, so we started the presentation earlier than we anticated. ##ipated we were going to start it at six to move forward if anybody has come in late online or in person, we can restart this later on. Want to make sure that you didn't miss anything. So we're going to kind of continue on the process. But once we hit an end, we'll be here as long as anybody has questions or wants us to go over this for them. So we have 16 and how many online. So I'm not going to set time limits, but I just. So please recognize other people behind. So try to limit your comments and questions. I'm gonna read your name, who's next? And then I'm gonna read after that so that person can be ready. And my apologies for whose ever named. I do a bad job of pronouncing. I'm sure there will be many. The person that I have is Joely here. You can correct me when you come up to the mic. And next will be Patrick Starnes. Thanks. I really won the lottery here. So yeah, my name is Joel Guyer. I been working over in this and doing bird surveys for quite some time and I wanted to bring your attention and ask you how much you've thought you've given to strict hornn larks, which are known to be in the area where we know this is a major concentration area for them",

Right, data collecting that we're using to even identify these vulnerable areas has s been quite useful. Overlaying those on GIS maps, taking a look at distribution system planning, and then also surveying our requester review community. All of those pies of information are helping us to deepen our lens in a way that offers really informed approach and how we weigh out the value proposition, making a decision, making an investment. And it just so happens now, a couple years down the line, we have these additional opportunities which would help alleviate a cost burden that is obviously socialized across our service districts by potentially having partnerships with new brand. But I can tell you today, there are so many different challenges that have service that our communities are facing that truly are barriers to entry, to receiving any typ funding and actually being able to service. Right. So it's everything from not being able to fund or having to investment capacity to have a technical survey done to even know what the scope would be to get the work done. Now you're talking about undergrounding, and I'm thinking about the permitting process. I'm thinking about, okay, you're putting a thumper in that cost. You're thinking about the time to get out there and do all the scanning and thinking about ground shifting and all the other things that will have to happen right in the segments. So, you know, anything that we can do to maybe share some of that information and make it all live, it's all available online. And also just, again, recognizing the value of asking what communities where they need as well, because there's some real significant lens out there that people are really willing to share. They mike, been on a lot of calls with us now, and you always serv as something that is just. I can't tell you how many times I've been in rooms where I said, hey, that's great if you want to engage in this, but guess what? They don't qualify for alone or, you know, y haveah that many sitting there, but there's a there because they don't want to land or whatever it may be. And people are awestruck because they cannot believe, you know, I thought they were such solutions oriented and focused and doing the right thing. But there were these issues that were really, you know, creating additional constraints. There's a Tim Streint and me, it's like if I was ever to make aommendation on these, these awards, it would be, let's get flexible time constraint. Because you have multiple populations that have, you know, they need support. They need the time to understand technically what's going to be needed and then from there build the capacity in order to accomplish the work and accomplish it in a way with groups and teams that are not going to, we'going to say exploit the need. Right. Because sometimes when we remember you want to get something built, we have all been overcharged before that happens. And that's a negative outcome. That really, really doesn't help a community. It actually hinders them. One of the biggest things that I see, you know, with many government backed opportunities, okay. Is that they don't give a waiver. Okay. So like on you, just like you said on your permitting process to go underground, why would you need that? As long as you're in the corridor that you had established, why isn't there a waiver to be able to do all, you know, and that's, you know, so transmission is a major concern in the area. Okay. From where you have your resources to where your load is. Okay. So. Oh, okay, well, we're going to let every Harry, Dick and whoever come into play in putting their opinion in on. Well, wait a minute. So your timerame from plan to construction has just now been put into the legal system and, you know, drawn out. So where does your benefit go to? You know, you need it, but we're letting everybody come in and, you know, stop it. Well, isn't the public good factor come in as a waiver as to getting something implemented? I don't care if it's coming through your neighborhood or not. That's called eminent domain on it, you know, but there's processes really under. For years.",

        "text": " someone from the growth services department, whether Mister risen or someone, will stand up in a moment and read off those two consent agenda items. Generally speaking, what's on the consent agenda is an item as to which we have not received any public opposition before this meeting today, if you have an opposition to one of these two items, or even if you have a question about one of them when they're read off, raise your hand. And if you just have a question, we'll see if we can answer that question quickly. If you have an objection, then we'll put that item on the next part of the agenda, the items for individual consideration. If we don't have anybody raise your hand, then the board will take one vote to a single motion to approve both of those consent agenda items. After that, we'll go into the items for individual consideration. The first four items are somewhat related to each other as far as the party involved. And then after that, we'll go into two requests for special use permits and a rezoning request. Those items are, as the chairman indicated, are quasi judicial matters. That means the board is basically sitting like a judge in court. It's important for you to understand that the board's decision has to be based on what the courts call competent, substantial evidence. That means you should, when you're up here at the podium speaking, you should be speaking from personal knowledge about what you're talking about. The information you're conveying should be relevant to the questions before the board. In the case of the rezoning, the first question is and the special use permit, are those items consistent with our comprehensive land use plan? That would certainly be relevant to the board. And then the question is, are those items compatible with the surrounding property? Many times that seems to be the focal point of people who are here in opposition, is whether they think the item is not compatible with the surrounding property. And then a related item is whether the request is in the public interest. So, for instance, if you have some information about maybe traffic conditions related to the application or the current state of affairs, the status quo state of affairs, you can address that if you think there's some environmental issue. In the case of the special use permits of, generally speaking, special use permit items are not principal uses within a zoning category, and that's why they're called special use permits. The unique feature of a special use permit application is that the board can impose conditions on the approval of the special use permit. Generally, the idea of the conditions is to ensure that the application is consistent with the surrounding uses. So again, if you're here on one of those items and you have some objection to whether the request is compatible with the surrounding area, if you've looked at, or if you here today, listen to the conditions, if you think they're not adequate to address your concern, you can request the board to enhance one of the conditions. On the other hand, if you're an applicant and you think one of the conditions is not necessary at all, you have that option as well. And the board will consider those things. Again, it's important to understand that the board's decision has to be based on confident, substantial evidence, which is different than saying, when you come up to the podium, well, I'm just against it, or, I never have liked this kind of thing, or. Or things like, we have too many people moving to Ocala. Those kinds of opinions are basically irrelevant to these kinds of questions. You know, your testimony needs to relate to the specific application. In just a moment, I'm going to ask everybody who has any intention to come up and testify about any of these items, I'm going to have you stand up, and I'm going to put you under oath in mathematic so that we don't have to do it each time. And so anybody that's going to speak on any of these issues, even if you think there's a possibility, go ahead and stand up and raise your hand, right hand, and repeat after me. I solemnly swear or affirm the testimony I will give today will be the truth and nothing but the truth. Be the truth and nothing but the truth. Under penalty of law. Under penalty of law. Okay, thank you. Be seated. Okay, mister Chairman, we can go into the consent agenda. Good job. All right, we have two items for consent you want to address. Director of growth services. The following items are for your consideration. Planning, zoning consent items. Item number 15. 1.1,230,806 zC. Michael and Katherine Seimer. Zoning change from residential mixed use, four reals, to general agriculture. A 150.48 acres parcel, account number 4481. Sorry, 448-8100 at 2200 Southeast 175th Street, Summerfield, Florida.

        "text": " it's not u it's more about the security. It's less about, you know, big game and those are things that also, there's ongoing discussions with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife that will be engaged in throughout this permitting process to determine, you know, like fence design and those kind of things. So there's. It's too soon to say, but the project will likely need to have offense for security reasons. And then it's a means of trying to accommodate that. The best possible way to make it, you know, wildlife friendly, not just for big game, but for other critters as well. Okay, well, I'm real familiar with that area. I lived there basically my whole life. If those elk are going to migrate around the north end of that area and they're going to head south and that's going to funnel them right into the freeway, and there's nothing to prevent that from happening. And you know what's going to happen if I heard it out. Get. Fuck. Going across that freeway. So good. This is just a terribly proposed idea to begin with. Thank you. Definitely taking your comment into account. Those little things we'll be looking at when we're evaluating the application. ##Kancy where'sancy? Okay, good. Going to the phone lines. And again, my apologies when I likely mispronounce your name. James Buchel. James, name. Quick. I may lawyer who's representing a local group that's forming an opposition to the project. I'm sorry I couldn't be there tonight, but I have Covid and I didn't want to infect everybody. And I'm still fighting it. The first question I have was on the threshold issue jurisdiction, which seems to turn on this high value farmland characterization. And if I go over the clock and was counting gis thing and just right click on some of these parcels, I'm not seeing that a majority of the acreage is class one or class two. So has FSEEC or somebody done an analysis for jurisdictional purposes to figure out why, if at all, this is. This is to be regarded as high value farmland. I'm going to go to the applicant to answer that. But I would say generally in the Willamette valley, most of the soils, our classifiedies have high value farmland. We have not yet done that our evaluation ourselves. But I'm sure the applicant has. So I will let you answer the question. Yeah, on behalf of the applicant. Again, this is Paul Hick. So with tetrateh, we did evaluate the soils and within the farm using what is kind of best practice for soils is the NRCS soils database. There is mapping throughout the project area in Lyn county. And so that data is available online. Class one and two soils are present within the area. Based on our estimate, it's close to about 300 acres of those soils. And there will also be an independent soil assessment of the project area being completed. In addition, um, there's also NRCs soils that are class three and class four soils, which, depending on the type of soils, are also within the Willamette valley, can be considered high value. And so we're looking at those as well. So we are taking all that information into account. But that data is based on NRCS data. And that's what, at this point, we've used to determine that. Indeed, we anticipate this is a, you know, under f sex jurisdiction as a project, because it, like, well exceeds the 160 acre standard. Okay. I guess what I would say is, if you say that 300 out of the 15, 500 or one 1100 acres, or whatever it is, is class one and two, the statute seems to require that the tracts be predominantly by values, those classes of soils. So I'm not. I don't think you're meeting the standard. And if that's true, then you're kicked off into a different jurisdictional path that I think puts you back in the county. But we'll get to that in. In our written comments. And so the next question for the caller. I do understand the tract scenario, and that has taken into account in a full and robust analysis of soils, will be presented in the land use component under what in, you know, the. The FSE SEC terms is called exhibit k, but it will both evaluate the soils at the trackact level and in addition to those within the site boundary. Okay. I don't know whether theyndn County GIS system is working or not, but if I right click on the parcels, I can get a parcel by parcel determination of how many acres is each type of soil off of the GIS system, and you can add them up pretty quick and. And see what's going on. And because it's a jurisdictional significance, it seems a o to be done somewhat sooner in the process. So that's that. We'll get to that. Now, if in fact, it's not",

        "text": " back even and read the whole section. There's only like three sections in the bill that covers the CRP program. Read those, and you'll see how all of them are related and condensed into the opportunity announcements. And so, knowing the definitions is key to having an eligible and competitive application. So that you aren't speaking to some generic industry definition, but you've actually dialed in to these program definitions. Excellent. Thank you, Clay. And you'll find during the course of these video presentations on either either planning or construction projects that Clay and I will continually remind people to go back and read the bill, go back and read the rules, read your opportunity announcements. That's going to, along with, and maybe even before finishing up this video series, it's gonna create a more successful application. I just want to jump in. And this is also in the bill, is that the eligible renewable energy projects for C REP are solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, wind, biomass, landfill, gas, biogas, wave and tidal energy systems, as well as ocean thermal energy technology systems, as well as electric vehicle charging or ev charging, as long as that is paired with a new renewable energy system or an existing renewable energy system. And as we move into our eligible resilience components in tandem with a renewable energy system, those would be energy storage, such as most predominantly batteries or battery backup storage, andro Microgrid technologies. And I'm going to go ahead and bounce back to Clay, and he's going to talk about one of our key program priorities and benefits. Okay, so we covered the resilience, which is that 50% budget priority, to those projects that have the resilience component. The other 50% budget priority relates to qualifying communities, which is one of our definitions. But all that definition does is point to the definition for environmental justice communities in House Bill 2021, and that's it in its entirety. It basically just lists these types of environmental justice communities. The C rep rules do not have specific definitions for these individual types of environmental justice communities, including rural communities, communities experiencing lower incomes, for example. Odo understands the definitions vary across government entities, and so applicants might decide which applicants may decide, sorry, which definitions to use. And you must detail and demonstrate how your projects are in an environmental justice community, and separately, how and to what extent your project serves the members of environmental justice communities. And we'll be looking for you to explain which definition you used and any other details about the quantities of the size of the community that you're helping or the dollar amount of your program that is dedicated to those communities. The more detail, the better the application. We also have. All of this stuff is competitively reviewed and on a scale, so you can get partial points, you can get full points, you can get no points for these different criteria. And so a great place again to start is the review criteria that are in the opportunity announcements. We also have additional resources on our website that gets to more around the different government websites that define these environmental communities in different ways, depending on the agency that's defining them. All right, now we're gonna get into who is an eligible applicant, right? So, very specific for this program. It's organ, federally recognized organ tribes. There are nine of them in Oregon, consumer owned utilities, and then a whole list of public bodies as defined by Oregon revised statute 174 10 nine. But this includes cities, counties, local service districts, sometimes called special districts, public school districts, community colleges, public utilities and others. There's something like 43 listed in that Oregon revised statute. So take a look. The links are in our documentation. All right, great. Thank you, Clay. And as we're getting close to wrapping up this first video, just going to do a real quick rundown of our application process. And that begins after. After you go through that and fill your application out is submitting that application. And then that your application will go through what's called a completion and eligibility review from internal Department of Energy staff. People like K. Clay and myself will be looking these over, determining the eligibility, those projects, those applications that are determined eligible move into what we are alluding to, the competitive review process. And as you would see in your opportunity announcement scoring criteria. That review process will go direct, directly througher those criteria over project strength andeasibility, program priorities and project benefits or community benefits, and as well as the equity considerations that we're talking about, as well as just the general project diversity, both the type of project, the location of the project and the state. And so that's kind of a brief rundown, I'm not sure. Clay, do you have anything you want Toa add to that? Yeah, just one thing to wrap it up. First of all, that first part, application submission. This current round, the deadline is February 15 at 05",

        "text": " conditions of approval based on the information that's in the record, the complete application that allowed for then a review by the public and the applicant, and the ability to comment on the record. Pub. Public'commented. The applicants commented and responded. Council commented at the last council meeting, you know, and this stage is, this is your review in terms of, okay, you've looked at the draft proposed order, you listened or read the comments. Basically, this is your opportunity to tell us, do you think we got it right or do you think there's more changes that need to be made? And that's your ability, you know, through this conversation, either today or if you want to extend it out into another council meeting, do you think we should look at things a little bit differently? Should we look at our findings? Should we look at our conditions? And based on what we hear from you, and also looking at all the comments that we've received on the record, then we'll issue the proposed order. So, again, that is still staff s document. That is staff s second recommendation of whether or not we believe the applicant has met their burden of proof and meets all the standards or not. And then it goes into an automatic contested case. If there are any party or any persons who commented and, you know, request to participate, the hearing officer will determine, you know, whether they have met the burden to participate or not. They will hold a contested case hearing, and then ultimately, it's that final order. So the reason why is, you know, counsel can make changes at the final order stage. The reason why we want to go through this very carefully with you is ultimately it's your decision, but not now. It's later. But we don't want to sort of just push through and then have a final order in front of you. And then later on, you're like, well, we don't agree with that. You know, we thought you should have made all these different changes. That's why we're seeking your input today on this, to see know where you either believe things are fine or things need to be amended. So that's, again, why I want to make sure that you have enough time based upon either the issues that have been raised or your own review of the draft proposed order, whether you believe we've got it right or based upon your review and your review of the comments, the changes that need to be made. So I don't know. Counciler Devlin, does that help? Yes, it does. And I think one clarification in that sense, there may be other issues that come up, but it appears their primary issue discussion right now is the goal three exception, and whether or not there is more consideration that should be taken of the Morrow county comments, or just in an independent fashion, whether the commission or council is satisfied with the justifications for the goal three exception. So when the staff goes back and reviews that which appears to be the direction they may be receiving from the council, the council in the next stage of this, obviously, will have a chance to review any modifications that are made to the order based on that results review. And at that time, they could probably either ask for more time or make a decision that, you know, what is being provided is adequate, or it's, in the council's view, it's inadequate. You know, I feel a little bit of, there's been some previous discussion in the council about goal three exceptions, and even though precedent is not as big a factor as might be in some areas, I feel like kind of a necessity to hopefully get it right this time. So I guess what I'm basically saying is you'll go back, you'll review what's been the order itself based on all the council comments, but there has, has been a lot of concern expressed, or at least issues expressed around goal three. We'll get a chance to review that when it comes back. We can either accept that, delay it, or reject it at that time as an adequate justification would be. I just want to make sure I'm totally understanding what you're saying. Your ability to review this again won't be until the final order. Right. So while we have this open right now, while the council is reviewing the draft proposed order, you can conclude that today. You can say, we still want to have a little more time to think about it and we'll put it on the next council agenda. But you need to be comfortable with your review of the draft proposed order. And then specifically, I agree, this seems to be the most significant issue. So you have to be comfortable whether you've had enough time to review, think about it, you know, see what's currently written, you know what staff's recommendation is in the draft proposed order. Whether you agree with that or based upon the comments and your own analysis, you think some changes need to be made. So that's why I want",

And then the last question I have is in regards to remediation. So did I hear you correctly? They're required to put in in place a security bond? Ye. And that security bond is evaluated each year for inflation. Yes. And then they have to keep ratcheting up on that security bond, increasing the amount to ensure that 30 years from now they don't just. Well, yeah, just basically say here, here's the bond we had initially and do. Yeah, the way I like to describe it is that's the backup plan. The plan is that they will terminate the facility, they will decommission the site and, you know, do everything according to without the bond. But we hold that bond until all that happens throughout the life, throughout construction, throughout operation, and even through decommissioning. We hold that bond to make sure that if something goes wrong, we have the money to restore the site. So 35 years, let's say the grazing doesn't work very well. This is my last question. Say the grazing doesn't go well, and you guys can't control the weeds without the grazing or the grasses. You're gonna have to go in and nuke that 35 years from now with that ground already. Nuke. How long do you think, how nutritious do you think that ground's gonna be and how long do you think it's gonna recover that ground? And I'll just say on that one, that's the kind of comment that we're looking for. We have, you know, we always have weed mitigation plans associated with, you know, the land use standard. These are the kind of information that we want to make sure gets into the record. So, you know, one, they're hearing it from you, but we hear it from you, and we put it in the project. Well, that land is going to be nuked, and we won't be able to recover that ground back to the farming standards that it is today. It'll take years, and that's a big impact. You can ask any farmer in here. They'll tell you. Okay, thank you. Thank you. So, my apologies. We're going to go out of order. Sorry. We have a city council member, Linda Canas ha. Chambers. Sorry. Who has some limited time, so. Council member. Yeah, hi, I'm Linda Chambers, and I'm here representing myself, my neighbors, and also our mayor. He does not like this either. I am not a fan. I want to thank all of you for coming. This is. This is awesome. See, these people love ly county. Yes. I would like to note, too, who are you council secretary for? I missed the introduction. So. Sure we be. So there are sort of two parts to who participates in this. So we have the Oregon Department of Energy staff. So chase and I and some other members here, we work for the Oregon Department of Energy. Okay. The energy facility siting Council is the governor appointed board. Think of them like a planning commission. Right. They're appointed by the governorah, and I'm essentially the lead staff to them. So that's why I'm the council secretary. Okay. Okay. Thank you for making that clear. I have a few comments, and I'd like to know, if this is built, where's the energy going? Is it going to stay in Ling county? Well, it would stay within the valley. It would stay within Willamette Valley, powering approximately 34,000 homes wherever the generation needed. Well, and I would like to see this. If you got to build it, I would like to see it built closer to Portland or Eugene. I mean, they would love y'all",

        "text": " at the end of fall. And as all you know, the reason we're sitting here, our notice intent was issued at the beginning of October. So that kicked off the ext permitting process, the ASC, or the application for site certificate. That's really, as Kate mentioned, that is the full site permitting application, and we're aiming to have that done by the end of January next year, hopefully sooner, but there's a lot of information to gather there. So that is about a two year process. So we're estimating our permits to o to have received our permit by the end of 2025. And we're looking at COD commercial operations date, the date that the construction is completed. And we are putting energy on the grid at earliest by the end of 2028. And, you know, the one thing to mention throughout all of this, and this is going to be a theme in not the presentation, but in how I answer questions or comments is that, you know, we are looking to engage, to hear comments from, to, to make connections with any stakeholder agencies, even, you know, local community members that are all impacted by this project. So that has already started and it will continue all the way through and past our commercial operations states. So this is a facility, an overview of the facility. I won't spend too much time here. We actually have a map printed out over there. If you didn't get a chance to see it, feel free to go check it out after the presentation. Contact. So again, I would be the main point of contact. I have my business card over there. If I where Sarah sitting, so feel free to take one. Shoot me a message, give me a call whenever you like. Um, Annika Soulsby is our permitting connect is our, our lead permitting, uh, person on this project. Um, and then, you know, also this will be circulated. So should you need to talk to Mitch or Gary, who's head of u engineering procurement and construction, their contact information there as well. So now we're done talking. We've reached the question and answer and comment period of our meeting. I just wanted to go over really quickly. If you are on the webex, this slide shows you how to participate. Raise your hand to make a comment or ask a question. There is also a number on the notice. If you're on the phone, there's instructions on how to participate via phone. We're going to leave this slide up during the q and A and the comment period, but we're going toa start, as I noted before, people in the room, people on the webex, and then people on the phone, and we will work on that. One of the things that I failed to mention at the beginning is that if you do wantn comment, it's really important to us that we get your name accurately. There are comment cards on the back table. If you want to make a public comment tonight, we ask that you fill one out so that we have your contact information. If you are wanting to make an oral comment tonight, I think we're just going to open it up and see if there's anybody who wants to make a comment. And we do ask that you come up and sit at the table and speak in the microphone so we can get it recorded. Meeting is being recorded, and so we're going toa start with the people in the room. You don't have to speak if you don't want to. You can also just write a comment on the comment card and hand it to Sarah or to Nancy or to me or to chase before you leave tonight. And like I said, there's multiple ways to comment after this meeting as well. And you can also ask questions you don't have to just count on. Can just ask clarifying question. But we just went over, so I'm going to stop and see if there's anybody in the room that would like to comment. We'll wait a couple minutes until people get pray. And you had a question. Was answ got a couple of questions. That's right. State name the record. That would be. My name is Ken Clark. With the recent Federal Emergency Regulatory Commission Order 2023 and the BPAQ reform as a generator, when do you expect to be able to receive an interconnection agreement and a commercial? I think you've said, but a commercial ##ation date. Yeah. Um, that is a great question, one that we are, you know, very closely monitoring and very, have been very much involved in the BPAQ reportm process. Um, you know, I'll be honest, there is a bit of uncertainty as to how these reforms in the BPAQ reform will play out. We are targeting, like we said, end of 2028 for commercial operations date. I will say that is aggressive. Um, you know, I would, I would probably say that it's anywhere from 2028 to ",

        "text": " in it that are organic to the county and just. I'm just really struggling. And I get the intent to think about doing a cohort model. But even still looking at two counties in them, in the Willamette Valley alone, there's a lot, a lot of power infrastructure, power and energy infrastructure here that we would need to go through and assess. And I am just. I'm not really seeing the feasibility in this being a successfully executed program u or just something that we can feasibly do. When it comes down to it. I, again, I understand what, where it's coming from. I appreciate what you're doing. I wish, I truly think it's a great thing to do. I just don't honestly know if it's feasible for us to take $50,000 even though it's, you know, free money. It's, it's allocated to us and just make it happen because it takes so long for us to get a contractor on board, get approval through our government process, actually do the planning of a county wide assessment. It's just, you know, it's just a really complex thing that you're asking us to do when we don't have the understanding or confidence to do it. Oh, go ahead, Mac. Sara is goinga Greg, we hear you and it's good feedback. You can understand where we're coming from. You know, we're implementing a program that's been directed to us to implement and doing the best we can. But believe me, we understand $50,000 doesn't go very far, especially in, you know, more populous counties or even more like territorial, large counties, even if they have fewer people. So recognizing the limitations, I fully get that. I can also say that we're making notes for ourselves, and we'll talk to the people that we talk to about limitations in the program and the pros and cons of how it's been outlined in statute. Yeah, and sorry, there's just two pretty not good questions. All questions are good questions, but there are two questions. And I recognize there's four minutes before for the webinars off. So unless there's like a very specific thought about Greg's, I just want to make sure that we're covering everyone before we have to move on. I'm sorry, Greg. Yeah, no, I think, I mean, the last thing I would just say is that, again, there's that good faith clause. So if timing is an issue, you know, you've done your best effort, you've gotten the funds, and contracting has taken a long time because it does, you know, I know there's a trust to believe that we're go GoiNGna say we're, we're not here to slap anyone on the wrist. We wa want Toa be a good partner to you want to help us plan and get on the ground. And so if you're like, hey, this is what happened, we would say, please go forth and proceed, continue with your planning, get the work done. So that's the ethos here. The questions in the chat. One is from Shelby. It says, is there going to be future funding directed to counties that have a resilience plan in place to implement the actions identified. Yeah. So Sarah spoke to one opportunity, which is our C rep program. That's certainly a very natural linkage to access funds. It's available projects that have a resilience component, renewable energy projects that have resilience component receive elevated priority within that program. I would definitely check out the list of resources and opportunities in that plan development resources document. So within odo, you know, there may be additional opportunities. There are some already some additional opportunities. And whether or not this program would involve into a specific program, I can't say, but I do. We are trying to find those connected opportunities for you. Now, I also will just add on to that is that all of the municipalities that are within your counties, if they are applying for any grant funding for specific grants, it's always great to have some sort of regional plan that they can see identified those plans, particularly for federal funding. So that is another, like, benefit, I don't think. I mean, there's not going to be a federal program that's like if you have this plan, then you qualify. However, you know, always having that kind of coordinated regional or county lot wide effort is always really helpful in terms of applying for state or federal grants. And then, Holly, I would say I agree with you on that since you're taking notes, and I know we're talking about limitation of the program, but that puts the pressure on the county to be able to manage and take on this money if we have interested cities or special jurisdictions or special interest groups that really want to do this. So then for sharing, since it has to go to the county to pull the plan together, it's just putting that resource requirement that need on the county's lap. And so it puts us in a place of having to navigate that in our respective counties. So just trying",
