        "text": " would be well received if members of the Planning Commission were asked to be stronger Advocates at city council um and elsewhere uh what we're trying to accomplish I hear that not just for me but I think some of my colleagues some real frustration at the pace of change um and by a sense that they were behind where we should have been maybe 10 years um and um so I think we can be better allies in trying to accomplish many of the goals that have been set already I think that would be the first thing and that's free I'm free I'm terribly free um the other thing is that um I think we need to be a little bit more open-minded about taking some leadership roles and development right now or what used to be Urban Planet I don't think it exists anymore was more proactive in going out of development and recruiting developers and I think we need to take a more active role and maybe that's taking some stat changes that we've snapped the changes and playing the more catalytic role in development so we can say oh this this block we really need to transform and we're going to try and really be the Catalyst to transform this so that it fits what our plan is and that's the second thing we can do the third thing I think we could do is we could really dive in and do some whether it's neighborhood um refinement plans or some of our urban renewal requirement plans and say okay you want to do State Street we've got a plan here or at that State Street let's take north of downtown okay we're going to bring in we're going to bring in a planning firm and we're going to really try and develop a market analysis and a transportation analysis and really turn this into a project that we think we have a reasonable chance of building out over the next 10 years and we tend not to do that a lot I think Fair Wright's neighborhood plan is 30 years old at this point and there are some that don't and it's an expensive project it's not an easy project and then we don't have a lot of long-range planners but to say you know these are three areas that we really want to be successful over the long haul you know that's worth asking the city council that put up 150 000 or 200 000 into consultant project form and try and make that happen so those are the three things that I think of certainly that we could do yeah I would say that so that um that Urban Development does still do that it's very disconnected from the playing commission um and they're limited to areas where we already have urban renewal areas right and so a lot of that planning and visioning that was done in 2030 20 30 you know years ago 40 years ago some of the urban new Liars are very old and they update them periodically turning projects um so the city you know the urban real agency just bought downtown the old UGM site right and the level of buildings and then that's what we're going to do is be looking for a developer that kind of development um the most obvious example that is North Broadway right so that's the urban renewal area the city got all the you know the three blocks and demoed them and cleaned everything up and then sold them to developers from excuse and there's alternating projects which create the misuse you know zoning and all of that and that was you know 15 20 years the problem is in the new areas where we're going to be looking to they're not urban renewal areas right now so there's no money associated with them and the city you can't open any new or new areas it's been close on because we can only have a certain amount of land and urban area and I thought our plan was to close Fairview but in advance that I got expand into the pool in the airport so when it could be used the airport instead of closing in so parts of North downtown that were outside the existing downtown Riverdale were on the short list for a new one state streets on the short list parts of Lancaster there was there's like a short list of three areas we've been looking at but now we don't have the opportunity right now the berserk expanded instead of clothes we've done all the build out you know where the apartments decides to no because part of downtown so when it's downtown Riverfront together it's a pretty big area but it stops just short of where the turtle Brothers property is which potentially redeveloped so um so yeah I I think you know Urban Development and Community Development are one department now um it's very new so it might be to more collaboration on that um it is kind of tricky because urban renewal agencies have their own advisory boards as well on what projects they're going to put in the plan and how they're going to prioritize spending their money um but there is a talk about maybe doing something different within some bad history agencies so um as far as advocating uh I think that's great um you know I'm thinking about the bond that was passed and projects have been identified but they're pretty vague and so through these Street projects I'm trying to weasel my way in so I can be like what's the design and are you going to show that to the public or are you going to do all the work and then it's like this is what we're building because um often for Bond projects it's scoped internally by staff and presented as a cost and then the time people see it it's too late to make any changes and then we don't get Street trees we get sidewalks built at the curb because well we don't have money to buy that much right away but it's like but you decided into like you know years before and then no one got to see it um so there is a bond uh steering committee another counselorism two community members it's not really advertised that well I think that twice don't think that they've seen designs yet of streets I believe from counselor Stapleton is hoping that that will be part of the work that they do but that's an area where I think there could be more for example I think I should be like connectivity and increasing our tree canopy better by fed I think the counselors on their radar but to have people support them in that I think would be important I feel like the last time I heard they met it was like we're talking and so you really gotta be dedicated if you want to be part of that process it seems um but that I think that is an area because I think that's like our one chance right now we have a lot of money and a lot of projects and we're not going to get this chance for decades you know coming up after this so I'd really really gonna do it right do this so I think the council feels that way but I think it's also the city's really set in the way that we do things and it's hard it's hard for the council to going through that and pick it up and I think we can always actually would like to with her free time testify and Castle just you can't represent you know I'm here to work you couldn't do that but you know you could say I'm not planning to admission and I have these it's me so so you're always able to to do that and then but before I forget the commissioner side the only reason I called a question on your condition your suggestive additional condition is that we couldn't give the applicant a chance to talk and that's why I was thinking maybe earlier on and maybe that's why Ian was a little concerned about it but I I it's great to hear from applicants about all the conditions they're placed on them before inclusive hearing so that other accounts for the good of the order I'm sure everybody has April 22nd 11 o'clock on their calendar to do a piece of plasma makes many thanks to commissioner Snyder because he's really taken the Senate moment full disclosure weeding and planting I'm good at reading the planting is the other comments for the good in the order there's no",

        "text": "all right your slide is up evan all righty great thank you and um if we're ready to rock and roll i guess we'll let uh i asked jessica to do a little bit of a introduction for us as to the where and why we got to where we are well thank you evan and just good afternoon it hopefully we may get some more attendees joining us here but if not this is going to be saved on odo's website for people to view as they are able um i'm jessica rikers i manage the policy team here at the oregon department of energy and the development of uh the electric um or excuse me alternative school bus cost analysis tool that was evan's fine work and it is in my group that that work has been done and also the guidebook on electric school bus um uh procurement and use uh was done through my team uh with work from evan and one of our fabulous interns um electric vehicles are a hot topic these days whether it's choosing electric for your next personal vehicle purchase or thinking about how to convert your medium or heavy-duty fleets everyone seems to be talking about it and electric school buses are no electric buses offer a lot of benefits they're quieter they have no tailpipe emissions and they offer significant lifetime operational costs you might have noticed the gasoline prices have jumped over 80 cents per gallon in the last year and diesel by more than a dollar 10. electricity is a cheaper alternative it's a quarter to a third of the cost of gas or diesel per miles driven and electric buses are cheaper to maintain because they have no engines that require fluid changes or parts that wear out and need replacement but electric buses do currently have a higher upfront cost which may be a barrier to school districts that are interested in the benefits of electric buses but they need to operate on tight i'd also like to point out that when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions when you go electric it's not just the emissions that are associated with that tailpipe but also the emissions coming from the electricity that's generated to power that bus and those life cycle emissions in the state of oregon no matter where you charge are going to be lower than driving that diesel or gasoline bus and to that end the rural parts of the state that often use consumer owned utilities to provide their electricity have some of the cleanest energy in the state can be upwards of 95 percent clean even approaching 100 depending on the time of year and if you're interested in why that is you can reach out to me after this i'm happy to talk about it and the other utilities that might have a few more emissions today are actively decarbonizing their infrastructure so we anticipate that these just by driving these buses their emissions will get lower and lower as time goes on so today i'm very pleased to be joined by my colleagues at the oregon department of energy as well as the department of environmental quality and department of education who all have some valuable insight and processes uh with their programs that they help help address these upfront costs and this is just the beginning the infrastructure investment and jobs act that passed last year had 5 billion in funding for cleaner school buses and just yesterday the federal administration announced 32 million for diesel school bus replacements across three different programs at the federal the information and the rollout of these funds is still not known but all of us here at the state and on this webinar are watching it carefully today all of my colleagues here are going to be providing you with information on the current funding streams that are available and what the qualifications for that funding are but we're also watching for news on this federal funding and we anticipate that there will be future opportunities to provide information and all of the expertise that you see here for all of you as more information is made available and with that i will hand it back to you great thank you very much um i'm going to take just another minute or two with some housekeeping uh issues one is welcome to part one of a two-part webinar series on electric electric school buses and today we're going to be talking about funding opportunities however a week from right now we will have the part two that we'll be looking at some technical tools that are available um so welcome and uh i'm also going to point out that we have planned for a q a session at the end of the presentation so unless you have something really urgent on a current slide um let's let's hold our questions until the the q a um and i also understand that if you're if you just post post something in the chat you will not be automatically identified so please identify yourself or your affiliation uh with any questions you post in there um and then at the end like i say we'll we'll have more q a time and a reminder that we're recording this session so please contribute accordingly i think any uh anything else i should be talking about now casey i i guess not i guess we're good to go the chat is on the bottom right of your screen with a little bubble there so you can activate that you can also at the bottom of your screen you'll see there's a mute and share video button um and we'll turn those on and make those available during the end all righty well then without further ado i'm happy to uh welcome brock dennis operations and policy analyst and acting manager for the pupil transportation unit at the oregon department of education and uh with that i'll turn it over to brock yeah good afternoon thank you evan thanks everybody else for joining today later in the presentation we'll get to new funding opportunities but i wanted to take some time to explain how school buses in general are funded and there are really very few differences between how an electric school bus would be uh for a school district or other k through 12 school any other bus in the state so um let's uh let's roll to the next slide so um every bus is provided reimbursement when it qualifies for um for use in a school district school operation uh reimbursable costs are those that are involved in home to school transportation on a daily basis for k-12 schools or any trip that is directly connected to the classroom so that doesn't include sports trips and it doesn't include all zoo trips or any sort of fun day events but if someone is taking a class and that class involves a visit to a site that would involve a report or something like that something the student gets a grade in that would be included in the reimbursable expenses so again kind of essential school day transportation might be a way to sum it up i've got on the slide here just kind of a description of the grants and how it operates we start out with an estimate of membership and revenue figuring out kind of based on what we know what school districts will be owed for their qualified transportation expenses and then it's reconciled with actual data and people transportation every september i pull in reports from pupil transportation operations around the state and we analyze and review what they've sent us um in terms of what uh what the expenses were uh any mileage that was reported that might not be reimbursable as well as assets including new ones such as electric school buses and their charging the largest grant in the state school fund is the transportation grant as you can see we've got the the number listed at 235 million uh and about a half there from the 19 and 20 school year reimbursement is based on uh costs per uh average daily membership uh and so that's the the number of students that and there's a formula in statute that i won't get into here but if you are interested you can contact me later and i may in fact refer you to adam krein who designed most of these slides who is our state school fund specialist the 70 reimbursement rate is largely what someone uh can expect unless they are usually a small rural school district where the average daily membership is low enough that they qualify um i believe our ten smallest districts will receive the i'm sorry it's 20 smallest districts would receive the 90 percent uh and then the next smallest from there would receive the 80 um but by and large most districts in the state will be receiving 70 reimbursement and what that means is that there's always a local investment school bus fleets are comprised largely of uh state dollars and so uh the state agency oregon department of education takes an interest in everything uh how they're maintained whether they are suitable for the purpose whether they meet all the applicable regulations but there's always that 30 local so you can see on this slide there's the life cycle of the transportation grant we like i mentioned we reimburse we don't pay for buses up front if you run a fleet that's going to be your responsibility to obtain and to pay for or finance upfront the vehicles that you'll be bringing onto your fleet however what we do is we evaluate based on reporting how much is owed from the state school fund and so you can see uh beginning in a previous year this is based in uh 19 to through 21. um december of the previous year we have kind of our preliminary estimate of what we expect we would start paying based on the estimate over that next course of time about that six month period from july to in february we would update with all of the information we've received every september we pull in reporting data and so we are adjusting those estimates based on what we've learned about the fleet from reporting that's due in september of each year and then the final grant payments that's done towards the end of the next school year as you can see on this graph that's about may 2022 so next slide please the estimate of membership and revenue data collection uh basically this is a an idea of what you would see if you're the person working with finances at the school districts and you can see the the current years these are dummy numbers of course for demonstration but you can see kind of what your current year's expenses would be as well as the projected gear uh next screen please this is a picture of the report as you can see this is for the abandoned school district just kind of chosen at random when reporting is done each year you can see that we have uh first of all the mileage mileage is a piece of the reimbursement sometimes school districts will fund uh reimbursable and non-reimbursable transportation together that requires us to parse out which of",

        "text": " for Washington county. And then we were so successful, the state gave Washington county some more. So that, and our customers have helped for that. So as you can see in the areas on the census block that are most vulnerable, that is where you see most of the assistance going. So I think this shows that we're getting to the right people who need assistance. And there were other maps that their intern did that council said, I'm sure that water provide that would show where shots were occurring and then how quickly they're being turned up again. Our employees are empowered to work with customers and help them and do payment plans if they're not eligible, or even if they are eligible to work with them to get their water resistant. Our goal is to hope that we don't get to that point, help them into that situation. So this is just a reminder. Besides the city's utility assistance program, the city does have other programs that go into too much detail because Megan will cover them. And what she has been doing are the most recent program is reduced garbage and recycling rates. Andrew Bartlett, city manager's office has worked with the waste haulers in the city to make this program a go. And community action is the criteria customers can get a reduced garbage and recycling bill for that. Our library for everyone, they have a lot of great programs, including the library of things. And then our Hillsboro Parks and Recreation does have a financial assistance program for residents who qualify to turn it over to Megan, who's going to talk about this great resource. Okay, so in addition to all the work that has been done to make some great updates to our utility assistance program, we talked about ways in general that we could connect community members who are struggling with challenges financially or socially or mentally, or with addition to the resources that not only the city has available, but also that our community partners have available. So on May 1, we published a new community resources webpage and then on our project list for some time to update and replace the Covid-19 community Resources webpage. On that webpage, many of the programs have since expired at the state and federal level, so it's time to take a new look at that. In addition, this just brought it to the forefront of the need to highlight these resources for members of our community. We want to connect our community members to our city assistance and affordability programs and centralize them in one place so they're easier to find. If you're struggling financially, you might not know to go to the garbage webpage to see if there's reduced rates there in addition to reduced rates for your water and utility services. So this is kind of a one stop shop for all those programs through the city. We also highlight many, many partner services that are available in the community. In addition to serving community members, it can be a resource for public safety, spacing staff, people are answering phones, our utility billing staff, they can direct people to this web page or even look at the webpage with folks to see what, but may be able to assist them in a time of need. We also look specifically at highlighting affordability and support resources for renters who are in multifamily housing and may not qualify to qualify for utility assistance program. And we heard earlier the challenges of qualifying those renters who are paying through their landlords. This page was reviewed by our Utility services committee as well as our city manager's office staff. It was featured in our made June city, but we have more promotion and engagement in the works for June and July to really spread the word about this webpage. Now that you all have a chance to take a look as well, I'm going to take you on a quick tour of the webpage, if you don't mind. So mark, if you would bring up the webpage. The webpage is mobile responsive. So it should be functional and look great on cell phones and mobile devices which are much cheaper way to access the Internet on a laptop computer. It does translate through Google Translate to over 106 languages. That's via internally on our website, but it'll be compatible with those browser based translation services as well. Because we have such a large percentage of our population that speak and read Spanish as their first language, we do call that out in separately and we're just building the page up for us. Sorry it didn't show up but I clicked on it so I'm going to share that URL you're seeing. At the bottom of the page is a short URL such as Hillborough Dash Oregon dot gov community resources hopefully that's easy to type in for everyone and easy to put on print resources that we distribute to the community. Here on the top right you can see that link that says charter suva pachina espanol. So calling out that translation service in addition to the link up at the very top right, that says translate and then you'll get a list of many different languages to choose from. If you scroll down just a tag mark. We have so many resources on this page and it is a very long scroll. So we start with these anchor links to the type of help that you may need. Clicking those links kind of jumps you on down to the page to that specific subject matter you continue scrolling. We do have as usual, if you're looking for help, we need to call our emergency services, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in addition to 911. At the top here, the next thing we highlight is two, one, one. They have a call center that's open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And they have specialists. They're answering the phones to hear about your specific situation and really find the resources that you might qualify for and apply to the assistance you need. That's more service than the city currently provides. We wanted to highlight that loud Lear as an awesome community partner and a great resource for everyone in the community. From there we grouped the resources kind of based on need and also based on survival. So first of all, we have our shelter, housing and boost access resources. Here you can find rent assistance through community action as well as Washington county rent assistance programs like housing vouchers. We have links to get into immediate shelter as well as if you find yourself without shelter, we do link to our camping webpage where you can see where the places are and most of them where you can spend the night outside. If you do need to camp outside for the evening. We have food pantries that are local as well as links to get signed up for SNAP and I could go on, so I'll have you scroll down just to chat for me. The next thing we highlight is Oregon one. The state now has a centralized application where you can apply for a plethora of resources at the state level, so that includes OHP, SNAP, WIC, TA and F, as well as refugee services and childcare assistance. Scrolling down just a tad, we do have a separate web page just for our utility assistance program. I'm not highlighting that here, but we of course link to it here, as well as our tough waiver program for households that do not have a vehicle so they can apply to other tuck fees waived. We were talking about water leaks earlier, so here you can find information on what to do if your water bill and your utility bill is suddenly higher than it was last month. Depending on your eligibility and our review of your household, you may qualify for assistance or forgiveness on that particular bill if we can determine that it was caused by leave. You weren't aware of energy and natural gas assistance. We linked to PGE programs, northwest natural programs, as well as obviously it reduced garbage and recycling rates, which is brand new here. We also call out some ways that you can save money on water and electricity by taking advantage of local programs and city of Hillsboro programs. We have a program where you can apply for a more energy efficient water heater, for example. We also have a household rehabilitation program where renters and homeowners can apply for assistance if they're living in a home, but it's in dire need of what we're there or it's not energy efficient at all. So bills are very high because, say, windows aren't insulated well. So that's another option for people just to get those bills to be a little bit lower and more manageable as they go through life. Scrolling down just a bit, we of course have a link to our highlight bridge program where lower income families can access high speed Internet for just $10 a month. The state also has a forum and broadband program that assists with those bills. We have a link to our getting ground webpage where you can find all kinds of transportation options, whether that's free or at a reduced price through resources like community connection and tribe. I want to scroll down just a tab more through jobs, work and unemployment healthcare options like OHP and health insurance. Slowing down just a little bit further. I'll highlight we call out mental health and addiction services. So the Hawthorne Walk in center and other Washington county services that are available locally as well as substance abuse and addiction support and support for anyone who may be facing a crisis, whether or not that's student mental health or just a life circumstance. That's happening this week. Scrolling down just a tad more, we wanted to call out our partners at the Pittsburgh Police Department who offer domestic violence response team as well as there's a state now hate crime and bias reporting hotline that also offers support in those areas. If you go through something like that, you can call and not only report that, but you can talk to trauma informed professionals and kind of help me process what you fed through. Scrolling down just a bit more, we wanted to highlight community connection and culturally specific support for people who may be feeling isolated in Hillsborough, whether they're new to the community or have been here a long time. We highlight a number of cultural community organizations that can get involved with to meet people that may have similar, just similar cultural backgrounds",

or 30734 okay and I will read oh uh I'll second your motion any further discussion hearing none all those in favor signify by saying I I I and the chair will read it by title once an ordinance and I'm going to cut out the parentheses I'm just going to cite the laws here an ordinance authorizing property tax exemptions for Rural industrial property pursuant to chapter 112 Oregon laws 2016 a better sighted Senate Bill 1565 in 2016 chapter 575 orgon laws 2019 House Bill 2053 in 2019 and chapter 398 Oregon laws 2023 House Bill 2080 2023 and declaring an emergency all right so now we can go get GK machine signed up right yeah thank you Kelly of course yeah and thank you all I I just want to again for the the history of this want to thank uh Jim berau and Bill cross at wamit Valley Vineyards for helping uh our Economic Development Department bring this to our attention years ago and pushing this through the legislature and I know uh uh Bill cross worked to get it uh renewed in the last 23 sessions so um it's it's been great and uh we'll have more people take advantage of it over the years it sunsets now in 2030 2030 seems like a long way away well yeah I'm just wondering if that first toilet's going to flush or not yeah all right thank you thank you much okay so we're going to move on to our next action item under Health and Services uh consider approval of an amendment number 11 to the participating provider service agreement for Pacific Source Community Solutions incoming funds in the amount of 26 million for a new Total contract of 88 m172 591 to provide covered services for the Oregon Health Plan through December 31st 2024 Ryan good morning yeah morning commissioner so for the record Ryan Matthews administrator with Maran County Health and Human Services my presentation feels like Amateur hour I've got no PowerPoint I've Got No guest speakers no emergency what what am I doing here so uh so I'm here requesting approval of an amendment to add $26 million to our Pacific Source provider agreement a Pacific Source serves as the Coordinated Care Organization for the Marian P County region and is responsible for about 40,000 members and as the CCO their role is to manage the health benefit for the Medicaid population in Marano County uh this agreement recognizes our role as a treatment provider it helps fund us for our Medicaid services that we provide in public health mental health and addictions uh the $26 million Amendment does reflect an increase of about 1.9% to our rates across the board and um it's expected to slightly increase as well because membership tends to grow you know year over year and month over month um the largest portion of our funding in this contract is uh paid on a per member per month basis so it it goes up and down based on the Medicaid population in in Maran Andole County uh Pacific Source continues to be one of our largest funding sources and they they've been a a great partner uh as as their time at the CCO helping to fund several initiatives including you know even the grand opening of his place that we had last year was partially due to our collaboration with uh with Pacific Source and their ability to help give us some upfront Capital funding as well as funding the ongoing services so uh they've they've helped us with any sort of Creative Solutions that we can come up with to better serve our community um I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have about this contract right is this the contract that was reinstated last week reinstated the only reason I'm asking if I'm looking at the right contract you have a reinstatement request or authorization here from January oh it did you're right it did expire at the end of the calendar year yes and then was it reinstated by the contract R viw board last week because otherwise you'll need to make a motion to reinstate a contract that I I believe that was a Bridgeway contract that we we had two contract yeah I don't think this contract was there last we no no this is just been ratted through the process so okay so this cont so do we need to go into contract review board I I don't think so I think um I think last week it was Bridgeway that we rein this is a new contract isn't it all I'm look so I'm just looking at ractive January 29th request for authorization of contract requesting approval to reinstate contract for the Source because it expired um but this is what it did expire on December 31st although it has like the auto renewal language in there for multiple years so I know I I feel like in the years past we didn't have to go back and reinstate it because it had like an automatic renewal period in in the contract language but I would defer to you on whether we need that well I just looking at this it it looks like Dan approved it and it's I'm sure it's fine I just wanted to ask the question okay so are we good just uh approving it with your motion you are okay because it does it does say that it's uh it doesn't it doesn't say it's retroactive but uh yeah yeah it's intended to be effective January 1st which of course obviously at this point is in the past but yeah yeah okay all right you want a motion yes please Mr chair I move that we approve amendment number 11 to the participating provider service agreement with Pacific Source Community solutions to add incoming funds the amount of 26 million for a new contract total of $88,700 the motion any further discussion I guess the only thing I would say is uh just to clarify we only provide certain covered Services Under the Oregon Health Plan for the record we're not uh we don't provide all covered Services Under the oran Health Plan we're primarily providing behavor right they just reimburse us for the services we already provide we aren't obligated to provide additional Medical Services beyond our scope of practice or anything like that yeah okay all right any further discussion no hearing none all those in favor sign if by saying I I I okay thank you thanks thank you for being here for wow this is pretty long board session to get to you're just dragging it out can we just talk a little bit I don't want you're miling it over there it's the chair yeah yeah yeah yeah all right our next item is under next three items are Public Works consider approval of purchase order you know what I'm not going to read it because he's going to read it so there you go you know what Andrew go ahead welcome for the record Andrew Johnson public works good morning Commissioners here to seek approval of the purchase of a cat 3024 material handler in the amount of $497,900 more efficient way and also minimize the amount of damage and wear and tear we do on our current tools on your what on our current tools our backos and stuff so okay questions I don't have any questions I'll take a motion Mr sh I move that we approve the purchase order with Peterson Machinery Company the amount of 3024 material handler to replace existing equipment at the North Marian Recycling and transfer station through April 14th 20127 I'll second the motion we have motion to Second any further discussion hearing none all those in favor signify by saying I I I go get your tractor you all right next item is uh under Public Works consider approval of a contract with a love this company's name dirt and aggregate interchange ink oh we get a video slide a video Ryan's here good morning for the record rag brother Maran County uh Public Works capital projects manager and uh because he's joining me for my next presentation I ask Carl to come on up for this one as well for the record Carl L traffic engineer Maran County you know you bring Carl up here you might not get your approval well he is he's the expert on a lot of things and guardrail is one of one of those things so he can add some good input so like you said we're here to talk about our annual guard rail replacement uh for 2024 uh Project's located just east of Salem on Sunny View Road it's between uh Cordon Road and how Prairie uh just at one of the box covers that uh you drive by without even realizing it but it does have that drop off that needs to be protected by guardrail so there is guardrail there now but it doesn't meet current standards you can see just how low it is um it's not built to current standards it's significantly outdated uh it's a location that our Engineering Group and operations group came together to identify as one of the top priorities in the county for replacement so that's why we we focused on this area for this year so the project scope uh is what you'd expect uh we're going to remove the old guardrail put in new guardrail this these are pictures of the guardrail we put in on North Fork Road uh the design is very similar we standardize guardrail throughout the county uh so our operations group can go out and replace it when it gets damaged uh we'll also do gravel shoulders erosion control anything else that comes with a project like this uh because you can't just put the guardrail in you've got to make sure that everything else fits uh we did bid the project our low bid came from dirt and aggregate interchange uh we got two bids on this project uh our schedule is uh con oh to be complete by June 30th of 2024 with that do you have any no I'm just impressed that it's only $102,000 it seems like every project that we see is in the millions so like Costco I used to call it the $100 store now it's like a $200 store you can't get out of there without I remember going in there one time and the clerk the Checker had a shirt that said I went to Costco and spent less than $100 and then on the back it said not all right any Carl did you have some comments about this guardrail guardrail is particularly helpful when there's something to prevent you from falling so I noticed an expert opinion right there yeah I",

        "text": " our uh resiliency response assessment we'd be looking at in pillar four what we do is we look at we basically go over this cycle one more time but from the perspective of a post-disruptive or cyclical resilience assessment for instance in our general rate case we might put into into the general rate case planning a how we're going to address how well did our resilience attempts work when we look at historical disruption events that might have happened within that grc cycle so where we this we posted this resilience assessment begins at the next iteration of that investment and assessment process and honestly this is really where the valuation of resiliency comes to light this is where when we we compare and no action versus the dips different options that we might have taken or that we did take and we look at what has occurred and how well things have worked next slide please so this topic has been um slated for exploration in track five of the microgrids proceeding the microgrids proceeding was begun in response to sb 1339 legislation that occurred in tooth that was passed in september of 2018 in california directed this puc in cooperation with a couple of other state agencies to facilitate the commercialization of microgrids identify barriers and reduce those barriers as much as possible in order to increase our state's ability to respond and increase our resilience in track five what we're attempting to do follow these key issues that we are con that what we we began with a working group um in track one we started a resiliency and microgrids working group where we discussed various different issues that have come up in the of which we had we held eight workshops on this topic of value resiliency and each one of in that in that working group we discussed the four pillar approach and then we went into each one of those pillars and had discussions so each one of those pillars represents a whole workshop that we discussed and talked about the recordings of which are available on our website we also had some speakers that talked about potential metrics that we could use to assess how where we are uh how we're doing in terms of that resiliency trapezoid should so some of the key issues that were identified as a as key to be considered as part of this discussion of the valley of resiliency is should we develop an analytical process to understand direct and indirect economic and equity impacts of power outages to reflect humidity and utility resilience as we strive to balance reliability with resiliency while continuing to make progress towards our state policy goals should we adopt a standardized definition of resiliency to provide consistency across proceedings understanding indirect power impacts of power outages on communities will require the development or adoption of new metrics such as the social burden used by um the resiliency node cluster analysis tool developed by sandia national labs or the power outage economic tool developed by lawrence berkeley national labs or the interruption cost estimate tool to reflect economic impact of short and long duration power outages these tools provide potential metrics that combined with other existing metrics and decision-making tools could help us evaluate resilience mitigation measures when considering projects at the local and the grid level of should there be a separate resilience process that works methodically through considerations that are specifically resilience focused that are then integrated into the risk frameworks and the grc process and in our grid planning processes should the cpuc establish a more robust bi-directional communication portal between local communities tribes and utilities in order to maximize resources and meet the priorities at the multi-jurisdictional level and should iou risk framework i know we've lost roseanne i just kind of waited for her to get back i'll give her another little chunk of time and then we'll see what happens i think she might have gotten kicked off she's she's logging back on so sorry when i see a question in the chat already i'll ask it when she's done all right well we now have two roseanne's on the column and none of them seem to be coming through um stephanie how many more slides did she have just try to hash out her final slide maybe what we can do is um give her a chance to get back on here i have an idea what if we just took like a little break for like a few minutes give her a chance to come back give everybody a chance to stretch their legs now she's back hang on we're gonna i yeah um let's do it let's do a three minute stretch bio break we'll come back in three minutes and hopefully by then we'll have roseanne back um so just three minutes be back around 10 23. and then we'll go back to it rosanna we got you back i tried yeah i've got a bad echo coming from you let me try to be let me try to i'm gonna mute myself see yeah i think as long as i'm muted your feedback is better i think we have two of you on are you on your phone or are you on your let me get rid of one of you this is linda um can you hear me yes i can hear you okay the one that looks like a phone icon instead of a headset icon i think is the duplicate and then roseanne we just had everybody take a couple of minutes to like go get a second cup of coffee or go to the bathroom or whatever while we could like get our grounding back okay i've i've got you on mute so on both of them on you so let me take off the this is the computer can you talk on this one okay can you hear me now yeah we can hear you yeah are you okay you're on the phone right yeah if this works um then it just keeps me on um the computer so that i can continue to see the slides and the chats but i'll just talk through my phone and i should have thought of that and called in originally so i apologize for that yeah i'm not sure where you left off um we lost you for quite a while um um but i know you're probably going to wrap up how much of this how much of this slide did you hear um did anybody else track perfectly where she was i'm not taking notes or anything and i know other people might you were on your last bullet point you were talking about where the commission is currently perfect thanks stephanie and then as soon as we get back in a minute we'll have you do that last bullet point and then um we have a question in the chat we'll see if anybody else has questions for you so okay that's funny just give it a minute because i told people we'd go back on at 10 23 after they like grabbed coffee i went to the bathroom sure everybody's just sitting here listening to us like regroup but that's fine all right like 20 seconds or so go ahead whenever you're ready roxanne i think i answered angela crowley koch's was a question this was mandated i'm just looking at the questions oh perfect great okay all right we can go ahead and just have you get started and hopefully people are back because i just had to take a couple thanks rosin no problem so i apologize um i have some intermittent connection here um but i'll just uh the last couple of bullets because i'm not quite sure where i left off or where you lost me one of the questions that uh these are this is this slide basically identifies the um the items and issues that we've identified in the scoping ruling that was issued december of 2021 that we are now going to be considering in our proceeding to that end basically the the basic issues are will how will we address economic and equity impacts what kind of resiliency standards do we need to set into place what kind of metrics do we need to adopt um there is we're looking at specific tools that such as the social burden index that can be um identified through the resilience node cluster analysis tool which is developed by one of the national labs called sandia or the power outage economic tool also developed by another national lab called lawrence berkeley national labs who is more well known by in in their development of the interruption cost estimate calculator on the ice calculator that and both of those reflect economic impacts one uh the ice calculator reflects short duration power outage economic impact and the poet which is currently being piloted and further developed economic impact of long duration power outages and potentially also regional as power outages we know can especially long duration outages can supply chain up stream and downstream and also have regional ripple effects so these tools provide the metrics that combined with other existing metrics for instance in california we have affordability metrics and decision making tools can help us start to evaluate resilience mitigation measures when we're considering projects and ideally we're trying to identify we're looking at whether we should adopt some of these metrics so that they can be adopted either in through our grid planning processes on a project-by-project basis or on regional initiatives and that goes back to the that this application of this four pillar being scalable should there also be a resiliency a separate resilience process that we work through methodically as part of our grid planning process that we build into our risk framework and ultimately our general rate case and in our grid planning processes should the cpuc establish a more robust bi-directional communication portal between local communities and tribes and utilities in order to maximize reduce redundancies meet priorities at the and meet priorities at the multi-jurisdictional level all of this is in an effort to also reduce our risk should we should we have the ious incorporate equity and resiliency considerations into the iou risk frameworks and to what extent so that we can potentially support not only our resiliency goals as well as our uh renewable goals and our reliability goals but also our environmental and social justice goals this is where we are at we have begun workshops to to discuss the kinds of metrics and definitions that we might want to incorporate we have uh had one workshop on the interruption cost estimate tool we are having another workshop on the resilience node cluster analysis tool that identifies the social burden index the social burden index is an index that potentially well that does provide insight as to who is working hardest to get their needs met based on the time and money that they're spending in disruption and uh the tool has the capacity to in this way reflect historical inequities that have been thus shine light on that so that we can potentially provide mitigation measures build the rectification of that into our grid planning",

reiterated we're at the beginning of this and we're here for public comment and we want to hear your opinions please hope please hold your comments we have a formal q a plus just to recognize we have a lot of people or at least some people online so you're gonna have to come up to the mic when you're ready to comment so people online can hear you as um so please hold your comments but we will take all of your comments and next slide please so I was talking about some studies that we didn't do this is a list of the field studies that way to do physically on the um some of them started earlier this spring some of them will start in a few weeks or just in the summer and these are expected to be done by the end of the summer next slide please so this here is uh the study area um Todd and Chase had one similar but just to reiterate that our field studies were kind of focused more so on the black outlines but outside of that immediate area there are more things that we need to study through desktop this is a lot of historical review um and it ranges anywhere from half a mile to 20 miles outside of where the proposed project would be next slide here's some of the stakeholders that we've already started Outreach or have already contacted a few of them to note would be Linn County itself as well as the tribes and I did want to emphasize that we have met with uh ODFW we have been talking to them about the methodologies prior to the start of our Environmental Studies we're going to continue coordinating with them throughout this entire process including for the review what the results mitigations okay so just continuing with some of the more stakeholders that we have talked to or reached out to already that would just be some the locals of Linn County listed there but also wanted to call out uh Dr Chad Higgins he is a professor at Oregon State University studying agropotamics we've been in contact with him to learn more about just agrovoltaics and dual use including when it comes to sheep grazing and solar and utilizing you know not only his but everyone's contacts that we have met with to find the right persons to talk to to make this uh the best project possibly could be next slide please and that brings us to the end Nancy could you go to the uh the public comment slide lease okay while we've we've reached we've now reached the public comment portion of tonight's meeting in person on you want to mention and reiterate that the public comment time frame doesn't end until August 11th at 5 PM so it's until then it's me today would be a record of this facility so to walk through the comments today we're going to uh start by taking questions moment from people in the room first and then we'll follow up by seeing if anyone on the webinar itself has comments and then we'll conclude with people on the phone if there are people on the phone and we have received a number of comment cards already and if you have any comment cards picked up at the front please provide them to Nancy in the backseat of that week and bring them up here and and call commenters to the mic uh I think next slide please Nancy so we do have a lot of information um that we hope is helpful in understanding our process and it's all available on our website our website contains a public guide and a series of handouts to explain how the energy facility citing process works and how to participate in the process the website also includes options for individuals to sign up to receive email notices if you haven't already and to also comment on on other citing projects and I just wanted to reiterate that the slides in this present project page online and a recording of tonight's meeting will be posted uh to the project Page by the end of the week expeditiously posted to the to the project page um Nancy next slide please and for those online and in the room this is my contact information should you like to provide me any electronic copies or Hardware copies of comments those on the phone this slide uh has my contact info and I can just confirm my phone number address phone number uh should you like to get in contact it's and now uh I think we'll start going cards that we have filled out you can speak later on um Nancy can you go back to the Q a slide just so people online can see that um okay so we have well all first state um apologies we had a lot more people show up than we thought so we started the presentation earlier than we anticipated we were going to start it at opted to move forward if anybody has come in late online or in person we can restart this later on we want to make sure that you didn't miss anything um so we're gonna kind of continue on the process but once we hit an end uh we'll be here as long as anybody has questions or wants us to go over this looking for them so we have I guess 16 and I mean online so I'm not going to set time limits but I just please recognize your comments and and questions um I'm going to read your name uh who's next and then I'm going to read after that so that person can can be ready and my apologies uh for whose ever name I do a bad job of pronouncing I'm sure there will be many first person that I have Joel here Dyer here you can you can correct me when you come up to the uh to the mic um and the next will be Patrick Starnes thanks I really won the lottery here um so yeah my name is Joel Guyer um and we're going to start and doing bird surveys for quite some time and I wanted to bring to your attention and ask you how much you've thought you've given to strict horn Larks which are known to be in the area where we know this is a major concentration area for them um according to the fish and wildlife um there there was a carve out for grass seed farming specifically as a type of Agriculture that tends to be friendly to and um what you're talking about wouldn't be the same thing so I wonder what discussion you had about me asian bar for because I think there would probably be a requirement for federal medication what you're talking about so thanks so I'm going to take that one first just because what I'm going to try to do with probably some of these questions is Orient them towards our standards um I think probably most of your question should be answered by the applicant but I think it's important also that you know I sort of Orient people to later on in our process if you've got questions or concerns or comments how those will connect so we have two standards uh we have a fish and wildlife standard so our fish and wildlife standard actually um to odfw's fish and wildlife policies on fish and wildlife habitat so we will definitely make sure that you know anything within the area gets evaluated according to the Department of Fish and Wildlife the applicant will be required to conduct studies based upon whatever their comments are I'm less familiar with that species but if it's on the state's threatened and endangered species list then that will also be a pretty significant evaluation under that standard as well yeah I can it's federally endangered so or threatened um and the specific habitat type is normal grass seed Farms so um and then just just for clarification not everything on the state's threatened and endangered species list is also on the federal list those lists may be different so I'm just not familiar with this particular species so we'll have to look at that but I think you can answer the question probably in more detail thank you for your comment um this is Paul Hicks again from Tetra Tech and um the the answer right now is brief we we are aware of the Lark and we have met with ODFW early on in our survey process and at their recommendation um they would they asked that we also uh the applicant reach out and talk with U.S fish and wildlife service and so we we have had a meeting with them and their staff about Lark specifically and looking at um the potential for how to evaluate that we did look for incidental observation while we were out in the field this spring and are going to continue to have follow-up with fish and wildlife and with ODFW as we go through I think it's right now we don't have an answer for like what mitigation would look like if if any because we're still trying to get a handle on like completing the survey process but I think it's noted that that there's potential for habitat and so we're looking into that more closely thank you thank you it looks like Patrick is up on deck and then either uh Dawn or Dan Bowers will be next after that I'm Patrick Starnes my wife and I live on 122 Putman here in Brownsville um I grew up in Douglas County so I'm I'm not a a Pioneer Family like many here today but uh I did serve on Soil and Water Conservation District board for over 10 years in Douglas County so I have worked elbow to Elbow with farmers and ranchers on on those issues but what brought us to Brownsville was 1872 house that we restored many people may know uh the Water the Hardin house on Kirk Street I know Linda knows that we restored that so um we're excited about more electricity in the valley um my old man and I used to argue in the 70s during the oil embargo about the efficiency of electric cars and that's what I wanted to talk briefly about compared to he was a mobile power mechanic so we would always argue about his V8s versus my dream of electric cars because electric cars are about 90 percent efficient the the 10 percent we lose is from the friction and as you know if you work on V8s or uh internal combustion uh they're best at 30 efficiency and because we lose so much heat you know that's why we have radiators and all that so I'm excited to see a lot more efficient transportation across the country especially in Oregon and I think one of our biggest challenges is our infrastructure favors other things you know I if you look at Israel they're starting to develop electronic or electric freeways and I think that may be something we may",

        "text": " the city of Hillsboro Jamie from Clean Water Services who I work for and uh Raheem with the city of Hillsborough and turn it over to Allison who will give a perspective of where we are in our co-creation thanks Bob good afternoon or good morning counselors um as Bob mentioned I'm Allison berksing I'm the division manager of our storm and sanitary sewer section and Ricky is my boss he is our assistant city manager Deputy city manager it was coming to me I'm sorry rahima oh uh is this the clicker we always have clicker drama okay that's why Kevin gets paid the big well thank you um talk to you a little bit today about why we're here and how we got here and uh what the changes we're looking for are so as you guys may know we're working on renewing this IGA that was drafted in 2005. uh and we worked under that IGA for a long time really successfully with CWS but the City of Hillsboro has grown a lot since 2005. we've changed a lot our customer base substantial law our community has changed a lot and frankly our Public Works has changed quite a bit um and as that change has happened we've noticed that the IGA that was drafted in 2005 has some parts of it that aren't working as well for us anymore although in the spirit of partnership we've been able to keep it going really well for the last 15 or so years um don't judge that math uh we noticed that there was a timing issue where we could stop the old IGA and start the new IGA and we were utilizing that opportunity to make some changes um so a couple quick facts about Hillsboro and how we've grown and where we're going um we have really increased our population we've increased our High Tech Corridor and we're really increasing the way we're managing our infrastructure we have a really great asset management system that we're working on utilizing and we've implemented it over the last about eight years and we really track every nut and bolt in our system in this digital Asset Management set tracking system and are able to reject our maintenance needs for that in the next 10 years as well as the annual life cycle or the the full life cycle of that asset so it's one of the things that has kind of changed the way we've been working with CWS is we're working in a much more digital age if you will and working towards a much more complicated permit in this digital age so with all of those things combined the old IGA just wasn't working and we were able to take this opportunity to start to make some changes collaboratively as we started those changes we came from a place of mutual understanding um we worked really well together in knowing that things that we agreed on were environmental stewardship and the residents and community members of Hillsborough are very strong in admitting that those are their goals that we're striving to protect the environment and then we know that the way to do that is through permit regulations and permit requirements um but beyond that working towards more than just what the requirements of the permit is to make sure that the rules protections are working for everyone in our community and be it our industrial Partners our community members or our development Partners in our residential communities as you guys may know we have two big growth areas in Hillsboro so we've got North Hillsborough which is hugely growing in our industrial sector we have South Hillsboro which is really building a lot of great communities for our residents to live in both in Middle housing and single family residential with both of those we have a lot of advanced needs in our community and as a city we're working really hard to provide those needs in a full service manner uh we take great pride in providing for all of the different needs of the community members and working with them individually to meet those goals whilst keeping the environmental stewardship and permit regulations of the top priority but when we're doing that we want to be able to work with them on an individual basis and have that kind of local autonomy of doing at the Hillsborough way um that is very much still trusting in the environment and trusting in our apartment called CWS but providing for the community that is uniquely Hillsboro um and with that we were looking for a little bit more autonomy a little bit more flexibility and how we administer this permit and while still keeping environmental stewardship high and working with our partners CWS um in a very collaborative fashion but we do want to know that that means that we're going to be taking on a lot more of the accountability and responsibility as well and those are things that we are excited to take on in um luckily we've learned a lot from working with CWS and how they were able to manage things uh super well for the last however many years I'm not going to try and do math in front of you again but uh it's one of those things where we're ready to take that step in faith with our partners and we're excited to do it in kind of that collaborative well that was kind of our goal was to try and get that that better customer base try and get find those ways that we can work together and then also uh integrating some of that new technology that we're working on and the asset management and the um collaborative maintenance so and as we grow we're having a lot more of that maintenance and option management and it is nice not to have to be just one entity doing all of it and working collaboratively all right so in in that Spirit of collaboration and relationship building um we know that CWS does things really um and we want to make sure that we're doing things really well too and I believe 100 that we are and that we're capable of it but we don't want to overstep anything that um if CWS is doing something really well we don't want to pay for things twice if you will so it's important for us to find ways to work in collaboration and use the best of CWS and use the best of Hillsburgh ride for the best environmental stewardship and environmental stewardship and stewardship solution as well as providing for the community members highest needs and best uses so we were able to kind of build this relationship over the last two years where we were creating different work groups and different consensus teams we come up with the best solution utilizing all of the resources that we had jointly um giving the community a much better um by combining our resources and working super super well together so as you can imagine that's not an easy thing to do um and there's a lot of a lot of different ideas on how that would be the best way to do that and what that looks like so for the first year we held about 18 three to four hour long listening sessions or collaboration sessions if you will where we brought in 15 to 20 people and we talked about 50 different and out of those working sessions and that's year one here we came up with some really great guidelines of what worked best for us in the future what utilizes the best of all of our resources what utilizes the best of all our technology um and so after that first year we kind of developed some Sub sub teams and then we um started the process of drafting the IGA and so Jamie myself and Bob and Raheem have been working on that diligently for the last year we are getting close to finishing it we still have little sections that we're working on um and we're hoping that in October that we'll be able to raise the pot to you and it's in its full state but the goal of that is to have a a new idea that is inclusive of our new technologies inclusive of kind of that Spirit of collaboration and relationship building gives us that flexibility and autonomy while still providing the most and highest environmental stewardship goals and then also transferring some of that risk and liability from CWS to the City of Hillsboro as well so um with bot said we are excited to present this to you in October we think that two years have been very fruitful and not just in this document but in forging these relationships between our staff members we have a team of seven or eight highly filled best of the best as Joe mentioned that have been working on this and without them none of this would have happened but I really like to link Bob and Jamie um and as well as Joe and Damon Rishi and Andy Braun who've also worked on this really really really diligently with us um as well as our team our key team members uh Ashley who's in the audience um Mark Gibson and Charlie shell and Justin Jensen uh and Rahim obviously for writing the guidance and support for that um but hopefully when you see us here in about two months uh you will be able to see that Spirit of collaboration that team building and really and truly the the best service that we can provide to the community thank you and with that we would like to turn it over to any questions that you may have is that entire presentation that is it in a nutshell business okay well I I would like to start with a colleague down there who's been with Hillsborough for a long time and now we're ready fortunate uh usage is over here for a few years uh anything can I think this is great I think it's from back from my mayor days I can say that the relationship between the other services was not that great um and so I applaud Joe I certainly want you to let Diane and Mark know that I applaud Clean Water Services focus on that collaboration and certainly improving those relationships not only with the city of Hillsboro but I'm assuming you know that's going to be with all the cities in Washington County so congratulations and good job on that appreciate that yeah these are the the statistics you showed for Hillsboro are pretty amazing I knew that obviously that the population had significantly increased the way you demonstrated there I just didn't put a 55 number to it it's pretty amazing for that and you certainly upgraded your mayor you know that there was some problems before but yeah but yeah no congratulations on this we look forward to continuing this very positive relationship thank you I just appreciate the information I appreciate the fact that uh both parties have come to the table in such a collaborative Manner and hats off to you Joe for for your work in this as well I think the creation of the kind of a new approach by thing mother Services was at the right time so thank you thank you commissioner trees I just",

        "text": " but um is the uh don't yeah we do but want to leave time for discussion and wrap up and lunch and I know I'm competing with lunch uh so but just for for uh your awareness is the county is uh our our office is currently working on a disaster recovery framework um uh we have uh most of the support of a contractor uh using some Federal grant funds to develop a a recovery f framework um to uh start us on the process think recovery planning is hard uh but it starts us down this process of wanting to better organize and establish our priorities our governance um and and so on for how we will do uh recovery uh I wanted to share just again it's just in a draft format it's the end of the project is uh is the end of this month um but what we've established so far is you know the the vision is to build a uh build Washington County back more resilient creating a community that is safe and Equitable where individuals family families can Thrive and withstand future disasters um and then the sort of supporting element to that is the county SE seeks to balance responding to immediate needs uh uh and making decisions that align with longterm values and goals and this sort of represents the challenge With Disaster Recovery is there has to be a balance between speed and expediency operation and proper planning uh and so that's what that vision is is uh oriented towards providing that those night post for how we we recover sure I'm really impressed uh you know being the total geek that I am when I was a Metro counselor uh one of those smart growth conferences that I went to which doesn't anymore stop that sort of thing I really focused on two things um I was the council policy and and policy Tech G for Brownfield um so I went to some sessions on EPA Brownfield learned a lot from those uh but also went through the um public the disaster scenario session and uh learned a lot from areas of the country that have had frequent flooding uh learned a bunch from Iowa uh and then also in sort of Hurricane Alley and there was one County Commissioner there where their particular area had been hit over the course of multiple years in a particular that g multiple times and so finally the third time there were a few families that said or after the second time they were like you know we're not going to rebuild a third uh uh so uh it I I learned a lot from each of them about working with community and how recovery requires patience uh and while we have constituents that want to help them get get back to normal so to speak as quickly as possible it also does take a little time and uh that's one reason why I think I've been 100% comfortable with our Economic Development uh recovery work here and so comfortable in trusting the arpa use right just having the framework um and not being concerned about having to understand what the details are in order to be able to handle constituent questions I've been able to stay I feel high enough level to convey that yes the team has brought information sources to Bear here's how you get connected with and really trust staff so I just feel it's I'm really impressed um Stephen and I just talked about this this morning uh part of this recovery framework I think also includes our permitting processes and what we do to help people rebuild I just got an email yesterday from a constituent who is waiting for permitting to be able to do work they're not living in their house they've got they they want to get back into their house and so it's April Now versus January and the same and during the storm the same person contacted me and Stephen and I worked through this that because a tree had fallen but the tree was in the easement and there was a lot of question about all these types of things but our department worked closely with her but I think part of recovery as we talk about this is how how do we uh streamline as much as possible what the processes are for those who have experienced this disaster and their need to rebuild and get back and I just made a list of eight people that I know personally who are no longer living in their homes who are rebuilding and that's just people I know yeah so so and that's that's going to have an impact on our L group as well their permits that were not planned for not expected and it's additional work so how does that fit into our Disaster Focus absolutely uh yeah I I appreciate it I mean obviously this is uh just conversation I'd hope to provoke uh here to a certain extent which is this Dynamic um I mean between again the urgency and getting back to normal uh and dealing with these and and but also doing it responsibly and doing as much as we can to support the community throughout pretty difficult time and doing the best we can to not be an obstacle to them as as their work do this and I don't I say that knowing that our department is not doing that but the perception on the other side is what we to uh well uh we'll get right in we'll take our discussion and get right into the discussion here uh in module for module three uh you can ignore the where it says breakout discussion um we've had lots of great conversation so far this morning on modules one and two uh we can do this in a as a group here here uh to work work through these but uh uh so just interested in continuing this what what question did you have about the community support recovery process or information you need what he to your role is being um I I added a couple of of other specific things for this module just to get your reaction but uh what are strategies to focus Community empathy for disaster survivors and Community morale any thoughts on that um also would you have any you know sort of uh imagining that B has hired this or appointed this disaster recovery manager um so what would be their priorities for that person uh what would be your priorities for them in the short term or intermed or long term I think you you know you can some it well let's do it sure it's a good question let's dive into it we're doing our breakout we're breakout of four yeah perfect so um I'll I'll just start priming the here uh and I really appreciate commissioner T bringing up that recent example um because uh there is with Co you know we have some some folks who have wanted us to stay in special recovery mode uh as though it will never end and it's like no no we we're past that now um and uh but also with the the permitting I think there is there is some period of time uh where like I'll just pull a number out of the air 12 months one year where uh I'm just going to be hypothetical here with permits where I would hope that we would give priority to those rebuilding folks ahead of the Green Field development right which may make hypothetically HBA homebuilding Association mad at me um but it's only for a short period of time a year may sound like a lot but it's really not right um and it takes time for people to settle themselves Marshall their own uh Financial Resources work with their insurance companies find contractors that they're comfortable with to really get things going so my pulling a year out of the air may not be long enough okay but I wanted to pull something El so I don't know what the answers are but that's that's the picture that I I'm hopeful and comfortable that you'll all figure out moving moving p uh as far as the um survivors and building Community morale two different things in my brain I mean the survivors wow um it stays with them forever no matter what the scenario is right uh and their loss um on the community morale standpoint this is um going back to the CRF funding and I proposed and the board uh supported what for lack of a better phrase I coined Community psyche uh because of the early days remember we the funding was approved in April we had to spend it out by December and in the early weeks of co uh you we were hearing I was hearing uh through my efforts to to be informed about people being fearful uh about going out of their homes so I thought through scario thinking through different scenarios how can we make sure people aren't afraid to um participate as a community so our board dedicated over a million dollars uh of CRF funding to be provided out to cities and park districts to plan events and they did beautifully absolutely beautifully um and so I really applaud the board experience in supporting that because some of those events continued years later uh there were the uh decorating your car light parade in toal is one I remember with thprd uh they took the opportunity for some uh Equity Banner building as well which they continued to use those as art installations um as well years later so uh it it really surprised me that these weren't just once and done right at the time I was only thinking about how do we get community members back and comfortable through this um uh but the creativity I was really impressed with how the our local jurisdictional Partners uh used that resource and um brought it to life so I don't know how other than just sharing this antidote as a board member I don't know how to memorialize that kind of idea so that future boards will uh automatically think of things I mean I really appreciate your putting Community morale here I think tomorrow doing the um doing photo shoot from for the foundation check from PGE is part of that as well that's that's that's the recognition that the community went through a difficult time and uh a thank you from PGE to to all of Washington County to the library but done at the West slope Library where there was a lot of Dage yeah so you know I think that's where the community that's what the community will see and react I believe positively if so but it I agree chair that having that up there is a wonderful reminder that we need to be thinking about uh the healing process and I think what we're talking about here is how do we heal from a disaster and one thing I applaud your questions here but because of the way you defined module two employees are missing uh employees are injured and missing employees are evacuees and some have lost their homes so that third bullet I'm I'm read it as Community but I also need the fourth bullet about our own employees right um and and what it takes for our employees to get their own lives settled and and back um I think John just having those questions here uh I really appreciate how you set",

        "text": " encourage you to do that because we're all a giant neighborhood and they're elected for a reason they have a passion that might you might connect with and they can help you over and out to whatever that connection looks like if you work for Marion County would you please stand Well normally I would love to just go Name by name and tell you a story about every single person that stood up Kevin told me I couldn't because I'm supposed to not talk for 20 minutes so I'm going to limit that but I also just want to mention that Betsy is here from Senator merkley's office sorry I'm sorry you probably just took a bite at food I appreciate you being here who's here Fritz is here Fritz Graham with congresswoman salinas's office um I almost got that wrong but I'm quick on the Fly Fritz used to work for a different person we love Fritz Marion um and then also near and dear to my heart Tom Hoffer and Corey filardo Salem chamber CEO and Kaiser chamber CEO would you please stand thank you okay enough with my introductions on you know folks that I think are fabulous um all of the individuals that stood today are instrumental in My Success I ran for office because a group of people asked me to because we work together as a community to get things done and I employ them regularly into the suggestions that I come up with for the work that we need performed in Marion County and last year when I stood on the stage I was the end speaker because there's like a trend that the Commissioners do when you're the incoming chair you get to talk last and I I blasted the Oregon Housing and Community Services Department of the state of Oregon rightfully so if they're here I'm unapologetically going to talk about you again today Oregon Housing and Community Services was gifted 150 million dollars in the 2021 legislative session I call it string free money because it was general fund and Lottery fund money that money was supposed to be a direct allocation and efficient outcome whatever you need for Wildfire victims in the Santiam Canyon and the other Seven Counties that were affected in 2020. well efficient they are not they are finally getting us some money and there'll be some announcements coming from Marion County in the next week or so around our very small portion of that 150 million dollars but nonetheless it is dollars that we will get to use in our community with our Community Partners to recover the lives of individuals who are still impacted today greatly from that wire but before I get into that I also just want to say that because Community is going to be the theme I think of the topics that we each discussed today we as a three cannot do anything without and in the Santiam Canyon they have the most neighborly forward efforts I've ever seen in my life for Grassroots because of the people like Dina Ferris Nick Harvel Ed deal Troy goldstrom Gary Melissa Bauer thank you for showing up even though I'm sure it was last minute these are individuals who run the long-term Recovery Group in the Santiam integration team the two local non-profit organizations up there that are meeting the needs of every single Survivor and household of our fire in the Santiam Canyon at the time it was over 700 households where their lives literally burned to the ground their homes and their properties their businesses and their communities and the seven people that I mentioned oh and Rhonda wolf from the United Way I know she's here while she might not reside in the canyon she's an instrumental part of this effort they've been able to take that 700 number down to just under 150 households if you could imagine what it's like to wake up one morning and realize your entire world is ripped out from underneath you and then the government says we're here for you and then they don't show up you don't know what to do and Marion County is really good at showing up I talked last year about how Marion County Board of Commissioners wrote checks out of their general fund and deployed staff out of random departments to show up and when they showed up the community met them equally with just as much force to say we're here and we're still here today and while we're still navigating those 150 households whether they're landowners or renters they're still seen every single day because of those individuals and the full breadth of Marion County government behind them I'm really excited for what's to come and I'm really really proud of this work because it's consumed my daily life since I've become a commissioner and before we have a really Stellar team in Marion County that really believes in every citizen and every household and I believe in the real version of equity which is meeting people where they are and not segregating them based on their need and that's how we're running our recovery in the Santiam Canyon so I hope that within the next two years we're going to be really successful of getting households completely home and that'll transition me into the next concept of housing we have a huge housing shortage in Oregon a huge housing shortage in Marion County and housing is a passion of mine the Board of Commissioners doesn't really believe in warehousing we believe in giving people a quality of life in the space they want to live in and so I'm adapting some type of a model to make sure that when housing is developed and the areas that I could control or with the partners that can control the city environments that we work with to make sure that we're providing Housing Development opportunities so people can really invest long term in this community through a lived experience of their own that actually contributes back into the community and gives them a leg up I call it an escalator some people enter that escalator at the base level and some people a little higher through Equity we want to meet them where they are and make sure that they can be successful in their life how they see fit and so we're working on some creative Housing Programs throughout the county with certain Partners to see what we can come up with to really make Marion County a livable welcome environment for folks who want to live here one of those opportunities will be in Mill City in the future where we were able to purchase the largest swath of available initially it was for Wildfire survivors and it still will be is the priority but as Melissa's team is fast-paced through this environment of getting folks rehoused that 700 is dropped significantly and so now we have to Pivot into the community to say what do you want to see in your neighborhoods as far as housing we have an opportunity within our grips that we can reach for and be successful with today and so we'll be working through that over the next months as to what that 15 acres and Mill City will look like for housing and will specifically lead that from the Marion County lens which make it makes make sure that the local level participants the citizens the neighbors and the council are part of that process and we'll partner with the Marion County Housing Authority because our goal at the end of the day is Workforce housing I keep looking at the Pharisees they're sitting over here to our my left and you know Timber used to be the thrive living space of the Santiam Canyon and for a variety of reasons it's gotten smaller and smaller but it's still the Forefront for us because there's still people who believe in it we believe in it and they need a Workforce that's healthy and thriving and available for them to keep producing the really great things like Mass plywood paneling that are coming out of their Innovation Labs up there so housing is something that's super important and we talk to our cities we have 20 Incorporated cities in Marion County on a regular basis as to what that looks like for them and how do we support them through the Community Development block grant program that we have we're always looking for opportunities and deploying funds into the local communities to be successful I'm going to transition into Behavioral Health and then I'm going to wrap it up commissioner Cameron Behavioral Health is a really big deal and depending on how you come at it or your understanding of it it can be really positive or really negative today I'm going to talk about the positives and let somebody else talk about the negatives Behavioral Health is mental health and addiction health treatment and for those of you that know me know that I come from a background of being immersed in this system my mom had chronic mental health issues and I grew up through the Marion County Health System because of her and I saw firsthand how government oftentimes thinks they know what's best for individuals without actually asking them what's best for them and so I'm an advocate is to determine what's best for them on their own and then we can navigate the systems for them by opening doors and creating invitations and also bringing a service out into the community we did that recently last year again the Santiam integration team and Santiam hospital was instrumental in sharing their need with us me they kind of put me on blast one day and said we need more and I said what does more look like and how do we show up so Ryan Matthews who's here he's our health administrator I think he probably flinches every time he gets an email or a phone call from me because I'm always like hey Ryan can you do more what about and this was how do we get health-based Services up in the Santiam Canyon where there's no actual developable land and or big organizations that have a lot of money to invest here and he was very creative with his team and he bought a van so now we have the stadium Canyon Wellness fan that goes up to the canyon regularly and works in partnership with the Mill City Clinic and the Santiam Outreach Community Center providing addiction and mental health treatment every single week to the citizens of the canyon because they it's super important to me that people understand that they do matter and they individually matter and so we try to expand our services in the most fiscal way possible sometimes you just have to do something for a moment and sometimes you have to do it for a really long time permanently and whatever that looks like we try to lead from the community's the next thing that I'm super proud about is a home a home for men and their children in Marion County for the better part of 20 years there's been a home in East Salem called her place it's a home where moms who are navigating addiction treatment can go with their children to try to prevent those kids from going into foster care",

        "text": " oregon um where the the hospital and a few of the schools have been retrofitted for uh geothermal heating there's a lot of uh there's a lot of um like hot springs and kind of geothermal activity in that region and they've been able to harness some of it and yeah it was a cool project to check out great well thank you so much for sharing that are there any members of the study work group that i missed you can raise your hand or go off mute and i'll also look at the attendees list to see every once in a while it's hard to log in as an attendee so if i missed anybody there you can raise your hand and i can bring you off mute this is steve huffleman i signed in late sorry i had trouble getting one no worries thank you so much for joining us we're sharing our best example of a small scale renewable energy project and from what i hear you've been responsible or helpful with a lot of them do you want to give an example for us well there are a couple of things that are going on i mean i am impressed uh specifically with with what's happened up in hood river with their small uh hydro project with a microgrid system in place to take care of the emergency facilities in the hospital etc um for which is a 24 7 operation so they don't have to worry about whether the sun's up or the winds blowing the city of prineville is in the process of developing what we call prep which is primeval renewal renewable energy which is a 20 megawatt biomass generator we hope to have um under construction in the next during this next year so it uh it will be a substantial for us and it will uh it will generate a lot of power and it will be a a base load operation so 24 7 operation instead of solar so wonderful well i'm so glad you can join us and bring your expertise and thanks for sharing that example and thanks so much for really all the great inspiration for the conversation that we have ahead it seems like we have a lot of fans of projects like this a lot of examples so um let's go ahead and i think go back to who will take it from here the next slide well thank you all very much for um for the introductions and it's really great to hear about uh you and and your favorite projects um i just got kicked off webex i hope that it doesn't happen again while i'm going um but i'm here if it happens um uh that's the fun of the times we live in i guess um just uh just uh uh for the record i guess i'll say my favorite uh and it it's kind of my way of explaining my accent in a sense my favorite small scale uh project is actually in australia which is where i'm originally from uh and it's the crookwell wind uh facility which is the first greek connected wind uh uh project in australia just a couple of miles outside the town where my mum lives and uh it was really important project because it helped in australia how uh community engagement happens in renewable energy development and a lot of the lessons learned from that which my mom was heavily involved with i a little bit as well um really really helped set the stage for how communities are engaged in australia and renewable energy development um uh and uh just uh one quick uh note too my mom actually grew up in the dalles so that's uh that's a another uh my connection i guess to the to the northwest is it's also through that so but i'm uh just now going to uh give a quick overview of the uh study on small-scale renewable energy projects statutory language and uh um and objectives as i'm sure you all all know last year earlier this year uh house bill 2021 passed and that places oregon on one of the most aggressive power sector decarbonization pathways in the nation uh requiring among other things oregon's investor and utilities and electric service suppliers to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions associated with serving oregon retail electricity consumers by 2040. um and along with those targets uh one of the intents of the legislation was and and and um what representative pam marsh noted on the house for is um one of the intents of hp 2021 was to to set a clear course toward local renewable energy development that can provide jobs and boost community economic vitality um and a recognition that small-scale and community-based renewable energy projects can serve as a um as a critical energy component of oregon's economic recovery and resilience efforts uh in response to the pandemic um and uh winter storms drought and other other issues that we've faced recently um and to that end uh there are uh four key elements of hb 2021 that relate to small-scale and community-based renewable energy projects um the first is at the clean energy planning process uh that's defined in in a statute that requires investor owned utilities and electric service suppliers conduct risk-based evaluations of resilience opportunities and costs and opportunities of offsetting energy generated from fossil fuels with community renewable projects and to do this with advice from uh community benefits and impacts advisory groups that represent interests of customers or other affected entities um within uh electric the electric uh companies various service territories importantly including representatives of environmental justice communities low income rate paiders and others um uh second the uh hb 2021 increases the requirement established uh um in uh sp 838 and sp 1547 for oregon's investor and utilities to acquire a proportion of their aggregate electricity capacity from small-scale based renewable projects from eight to ten percent um third uh the bill established um the 50 million dollar community renewable energy projects grant fund uh that's being administered by odo uh and to support planning and development of community renewable energy and resilience projects that are 20 megawatts or less in size and then last but certainly not least for us uh hb 2021 instructed odo to conduct this study of small scale and community based renewable energy projects um and uh the uh statutory objective of study is to uh for odo to convene a work group um to examine opportunities to encourage development of small-scale and community-based renewable energy projects in this state that contribute to economic development and local energy and the uh the outcome or product of the study uh will be uh an auto report to the legislature the current status and trends for small scale renewable energy development um and and though that defined that report will be based on the findings of the work that this group does a couple of important things for us to note in that um one is that the sort of lays out that the the work group um is to examine and study uh these opportunities to encourage development of small scale and renewable-based community-based renewable energy projects there i go the mouthful is getting to be there and uh as such um we're really uh trying to uh plan the the way this study is done so that it's really a collaborative effort between the work group and oto staff and is is driven by uh by the work group um it's also important for us to know uh and acknowledge that there are other activities in progress at the moment uh related to aspects of small-scale and community-based renewable energy uh for example rule making for implementation of household spending 21 efforts around the small-scale renewable energy targets and others and and to be clear that while the results of our study may uh reflect on or inform some of those activities this study itself is is not a rulemaking process and it's really a broader effort to help identify and examine potential opportunities benefits and costs related to encouraging development of small-scale and community-based renewable energy projects in oregon the the final report to the legislature is due on september 30th of 2022 um so question that i guess may immediately come to mind is is what do we mean by a small scale and community based renewable energy project um so the working definition that we're proposing for this work group draws on existing statutory definitions and language in hb 2021 uh so um at ors-4698.210 which establishes this based renewable energy targets define small-scale renewable energy projects as as projects with a generating capacity of 20 megawatts or less that generate electricity utilizing a a type of energy that qualifies for the oregon rps so that would be our for example wind geothermal um biomass and biogas marine hydrokinetic uh some certain hydropower and then green hydrogen is it is also a potentially qualifying resource this is also the definition of projects qualifying for the uh community renewable energy fund in hp 2021 which uh has a definition of the small scale and community based targets as projects um less than 20 megabytes or 20 megawatts or less i should say um then uh in uh hp 2021 in the languages language establishing this study the um language states that the study will examine projects in this state um so based on that uh we're using the following definition that uh that uh small scale renewable small scale and community-based renewable energy projects are those projects with a generating capacity of 20 megawatts or less that generate electricity utilizing a type of energy that qualifies for the oregon rps and is located in a community in oregon it's a very broad definition that will cover a wide range of project types sizes applications ranging from distributed you know behind the meter projects to larger in front of the meter projects like purple qualifying facilities for example so as we progress through the study uh we'll be looking at the different topics uh with uh sort of sort of stratifying or with the perspective uh from these uh different types of projects that could fit in this um in addition to the overall objective of uh examining opportunities to encourage development of small-scale and community-based renewable energy at the hb 2021 also established a set a specific set of subtopics uh for the work group to examine um and those uh are so they include potential barriers and opportunities to project development in both investor owned and utility service territory um those that things like land use local and state utility regulations transmission capacity contracts or obligations under the public utility regulatory policies act and uh and project implementation or project costs and financing and the the bill also directs the work group to potential economic benefits of small-scale renewable energy projects as well as potential contributions of projects to uh to local energy resiliency they'll also directly work to study potential access and ownership opportunities",

        "text": " manager that protected area is a reviewing agency and will be asked to provide and recommendation at all the times that reviewing agencies is asked to provide comment and uh and then three requiring that public notice be giving to the protected area managers at any time i wanted to give you all just an idea of what the universe of protected area managers are most protected areas in oregon are either managed by one of four of the federal land management agencies that's the national park service the bureau of land management the forest service or the u.s fish and wildlife um state protected areas are typically managed by one of three state agencies the department of parks and recreation uh department of state lands in the department of fish and wildlife um there's a small subset of protected called state natural areas or as the rule currently refers to them state natural heritage areas that are designated by the oregon parks and recreation commission but they're actually owned and operated by other and some of those are operated or managed by private entities uh including the nature conservancy or another land trust and sometimes private landowners as well we heard a lot of support from stakeholders that some sort of notice should be given to protected area um managers and that you know i think most people agreed that early coordination with those managers is important and would uh help improve the citing process um but there wasn't a lot of consensus about what the right mechanism was um but when we had the the conversation about potentially appointing those federal agencies as reviewing agencies there was com some concern that we would be you know obligating them to participate when they might not have the resources or staff to do so um and that we may be kind of burdening the applicants with the job of uh you know doing that consultation when it may not be necessary we talked to our federal partners as well and you know most of them thought that a public notice would be sufficient as long as it happened early enough in the process that they could get their comments a lot of the concern is just involving the long lead times that federal agencies often need to participate in public processes outside of their jurisdiction so we are recommending that that public notice alternative be the one that is we have some kind of tricky stuff with implementation one because there's about a dozen public rules scattered throughout uh oar chapter three four five and um while we could go through and each one to say that a protected area identified in nia or application should receive public notice we actually think it may be better to just consolidate those um in a future rule making and that's how we can address some inconsistencies between some of the different noticing rules as so in the interim we're probably just asking the council to provide us with policy direction uh to add those protected area managers to a special mailing list and that way they'll they'll get the public notice for now and then we can make the formal rule amendment at a future rule making one of the concerns with this recommendation that came up was that it's hard to track down appropriate contacts at some of the property uh protected area managing agencies particularly during covid you know if we send a hard just a paper notice to um the national park service regional headquarters or something you know there may not be staff in the office to route that to the person who would be able to respond to it you know it's hard to track down specific individuals at the actual offices for the protected areas themselves um it's not impossible though so we are recommending that to to address this that we uh do to amend the information requirements in division 20 and 21 uh to require the applicant to do a little homework and get us reasonably available contact information for the protected areas managers many of the developers and other stakeholders thought that the council or the department uh more accurately could help this process along by publishing some of this information or at least kind of giving a source of you know here's where you should start or here's how you should go about getting the individual contact um we think that's worth considering and it's something we could possibly provide in the applicant guide in the future or at least get the headquarters information that's readily available in one single place to kind of give applicants a head start that's something we'll look at further but probably outside of the rule making process and so yeah in a nutshell that's our recommendation is to to just make sure that the protected areas managers get a public notice at any time we send out public notices other interested persons uh and that we would be changing the information requirements to collect the to to get the contact information from the applicant like i said this is really your opportunity to weigh in if you have any questions or deliberation or further direction to us we welcome it i won't belabor it too much though if you don't thank you christopher does anyone have any questions or comments at this time this is back to the options christopher yeah being councilmember oh thanks i thought somebody else had something to say i guess i'm a little bit concerned about if we're talking about protected areas i mean who who better um i mean i i don't quite understand uh the second alternative uh wouldn't be better and maybe i don't understand necessarily the reviewing agency i presume if you get a notice and you don't you don't respond as a reviewing agency that just wouldn't be considered in the mix i mean there'd be no comment to but it seems to me the manager has the most information and if they're mentioned in the site application why they wouldn't become important for input ongoing input into the project especially as they go on for years and years and years you know as they the the certificate is issued can go on for years and years and years so as opposed to just that one you know the one notice with the notice of intent i don't know why we wouldn't want to um have the area managers included along the way councilmember conan i i i can't respond to that there i think there's pros and cons to saying your reviewing agency or like you are just being asked to provide comment as you know any other member of the public um but under either alternative they would be getting notices throughout the process so a public notice for example goes out at the noi and then it goes out there's not as much involvement in the completeness review um but once the complete application is received we send out a public notice we send out a public notice of the dpo of the proposed order and there may be one more public notice that i'm not thinking about for the citing process but they would continue to get notices throughout the process they just wouldn't be um asked to one participate in the completeness review and they wouldn't be uh they wouldn't get the memorandum that like kind of gives them a specific request for input that a reviewing agency would okay sorry i misunderstood i i thought that the managers were just receiving that first note that there's a notice of and so it's at the very beginning of the process which i think is good um but after that they wouldn't receive ongoing notices so thank you for that claire yeah and that that maybe we had another alternative that we would basically just do an early consult with them and say you know at the noi phase two you want to be a reviewing agency and we decided that was untenable i think exactly for the reasons that you projects can go on for years uh personnel changes uh projects change so we thought whatever alternative we pursue it was important that it be carried out throughout the entirety of a project okay thank you other questions comments yeah this is hanley i think just general public notice rather than a reviewing agency because their their comments are going to be specific to their protected area you know i think the notice to them you know needs to be specific enough so that they but i agree with cindy that they need to be kept in the loop as we go through the at least initially thank you other questions comments to conserve time i concur with both councilor jenkins and councillor condon as well thank you well christopher um i don't know if what else you may need or you want to share at this point i might make an additional comment um specific names for agencies or you know organizations that's going to be tough i know that in the b2h process for blm we had managers that changed annually or even more frequently than that so i don't know you're you're asking the applicant to provide those names for you but um i think it's more important that it gets to the right place in the right council member jenkins thank you for that yeah and that was that was the comment we also heard from like the stakeholders both both the developers and the protected area managers themselves and in some cases you know they were able to say that there is a specific position but um i think kind of heard that if we could send a notice to the headquarters or to a generic inbox it would be routed uh to the right person and that would be good enough um and if we were able to identify the correct individual within the agency um that we could you know maintain that relationship and that the citing analysts would be able to work with them the level of specificity is unclear the way that we wrote the the rule was to just require reasonably available contact information hopefully that that strikes a balance but um we'll keep that in mind any other questions comments this is kent and i just say another excellent presentation by mr thank you thank you kent well with that um so sorry just we're uh only issue two on the presentation yeah two of two of twelve uh uh i might go back to my summary slide and actually just ask you uh if there are specific issues you'd maybe like more information on rather than going through them all one by one um i first of all i want to apologize when i thought you had kind of wrapped up when you said here we are and i just totally didn't even look at the agenda anymore so i apologize you do what you got to do i'm so sorry so i apologize as well so if i can chime in it's i know it's already been a long meeting and the the last agenda item really took it out of us so i mean i think you know if you do have sort of the mental capacity to continue on i think it would be valuable to for us to get feedback you know today on this but we could also um you know revisit this at a future meeting if you felt you were you're done today council what's your pleasure well",

        "text": " very easy to see but um there are are more than 107 yellow dots representing turbines on this map and that's because there are some alternate locations so not all of the turbine locations would be um constructed uh you can see the proposed transmission line carridor um reflected by a red line covered with uh little triangles going through the center of the site um and this is kind of helpful to see where the final alignment was proposed on the western side um it has been rerouted I think to avoid um both some agricultural features and then other energy uh facility development associated with the other wheat rdge um and uh you can't see it very awful but I do have other slides showing where the proposed substation sites are um so actually yeah if you can give me the next slide Nancy great uh yeah so uh as you can see there the site with the proposes change in RFA 1 would include two substation sites uh one on the the left side of the slide is north of uh of butter Creek uh sorry and uh that would include a the expanded battery energy storage system Capac uh storage of 30 megawatts instead of 20 um and then on the right side you can see the other proposed substation site which is adjacent to little Butter Creek more in the center portion of the site slide please great um again the site on the left here shows the Terminus of the uh transmission line Corridor at the Blue Ridge substation um which was constructed as part of Wheat Ridge 2 um one of the changes in RFA 1 would be to utilize the existing onm building at weat Ridge 2 as well instead of constructing a separate own and building as part of Wheat Ridge East um and that location would be adjacent to the um substation site uh and then the certificate holder also requests authorizations to add a new temporary construction yard with up to 60 Acres of temporary disturbance area um off of Meers Lane uh close to B and but which I think will come up a few times in this presentation um that a temporary construction yard would be in addition to previously approved construction yards of 15 to 20 acres which were previously authorized to um be constructed anywhere within the micro corridors um so this new site certificate that we're proposing in the DPO would re would allow for those to be built with throughout the the micro sighting forers as well uh slide please okay um so that's an overview I guess before I go on are there any questions just on what the actual changes to the facility are sound like it okay um so because this request uh both proposes to add areas to the site boundary and proposes to ex in the construction completion deadline for the facility um the council must determine that the preponderance of evidence on the record supports the following conclusions before you make your final decision uh one that the portion of the facility within the area added to the site by the amendment complies with all Wes and and Council standards applicable to an original site certificate application that after considering any changes in facts or law since the date of the current site certificate was executed the entire facility complies with all laws and Council standards applicable to an original site certificate application and that the amount of bond or letter credit required under um the financial retirement and financial Assurance standard is adequate um and that's just to say these three things combined really do uh account to almost a denovo review of this facility so you'll see throughout the DPO that we've um done extensive analysis where council's previous findings related to the facility are still um applicable and accurate we've we've referenced back to those and and recommended that the council continue to rely on those were appropriate but um this was a pretty extensive review and is still a pretty exens extensive review before you so that out um oh and I guess the only other thing I'll say on that is that also means that you all are um more than welcome to provide feedback on anything um in the DPO uh any of the recommended bindings although I won't be specifically mentioned to them I can um bring them up and can hopefully respond to any of your comments or questions uh so at the March hearing uh we did receive uh four public comments in person um um most of you were there there are transcripts in the uh meeting minutes uh and those will also be I think summarized in your or were summarized in your staff report um we also received 20 written comments before the public comment deadline those included um 16 comments from just members of the public uh three comments from reviewing agencies including Department of Aviation a department of fish and wildlife in Morrow County as well as um comments from the certificate holder asking for clarification or minor changes to some site certificate conditions in the DPO and then we also got more formal certificate holder responses to the public comments on April 8th all of those are included in your packet um and attached to your s report for this agenda item slide please um the significant issues raised in comments are shown on this slide uh we got several comments related to Wildfire risk uh and both uh related to the assessment in the RFA 1 and the Wildfire mitigation plan that was um attached to the DPO we got comments related to noxious weed control um related to impacts on emergency infrastructure uh comments related to visual impacts of turbines specifically turbines proposed to be cited on G and but um we got a comment from ODFW and the certificate well just ODFW I believe are related to Raptor Nest buffers um other comments related to Wildlife Monitor and mitigation and Lawrence milk M milk fetch mitigation um we also got several comments uh in support of the facility related to economic benefits and Workforce Development opportunities that come with um the sighting of the facility uh we got a comment related to um prop loss payments for transmission line sighting um codes and standards Reed on for the facility design uh one comment related to visual impacts on the organal Historic Trail uh and then comments from the county about Road use agreements and then several comments from the public about the accumulative impacts of traffic on um communities in the vicinity of the project um I just want to point out now that I am really going to be discussing the items on the left hand column of the slide in detail now uh so if there are any questions or comments on the right hand side um or if you want me to discuss any of those in more detail I can do that but this would be the the time to do that Qui question councelor Byer on the road use agreements with I presume both counties or particular Ling County when do those have to be um implemented before or uh council member Byer thank you for that question yes uh Road use agreement is required for both counties um this site certificate does uh contemplate phasing so uh if there and and right now I will say what we are expecting to see is a phase that consists of components in Moro County um and then a phase later phase with the Umatilla County components um but the condition does require that the road use agreement be in place before um construction Begins for that phase um as far as implementation of the road use agreement uh it's kind of throughout construction because there's a requirement to do a a pre-construction evaluation and then um I think go out and and make uh repairs if there's damages rad um so so I hope that answers your question and followup question are are the roads subject to the um sediment and erosion control 1200 to permit thank you council member buer um the erosion and sediment control plan um to my knowledge really applies to constru construction activities so it will apply to private access roads within the site and does require bmps to be implemented along those I do not think that it applies to public roads which are really what's addressed by the road use agreement um but I would have to verify that thank you for the clarification councelor HS thank you um will the sediment and erosion um plan that DEQ um evaluates and puts forth um will that be available um before construction and will the council have an opportunity to review all or I mean I know that's out of our realm necessarily as far as but reviewing it I guess is council member I'm uh yes the erosion and sent control plan they the certificate holder is required to get their uh nifty's construction storm water management permit prior to construction um and the plan is attached to that permit um as far as an opportunity for Council review and approval that's not specifically built into the process um that's something that normally the department would be looking at as part of its preconstruction compliance process um although I believe there is um uh language in the draft proposed order that contemplates the department um and I don't know if the word the council was in there but I'm assuming because it's the department the council would have the ability to give us direction as your staff um ability to impose additional bmps or require enhanced bmps if we feel like uh erosion and other soil impacts aren't being adequately addressed at the site um and that would usually be based on something that we see during an inspection um I hope that answer okay yeah I just bring it up because of the um the site boundary has changed so much right and so going off of 20 whenever it was originally approved um I think it's important to evaluate that thank you thank you council member I'm and I'll just respond further that the um the new permit and the new plan will be spefic specific to the site and and more specific to the phase of construction and the layout that's specifically being moved forward with um and you'll see that there are is also some language that allows for uh the certificate holder to amend their plan and and that's just to address things like if there's micro sighting changes that occur or if um DEQ I guess or the department determines that or the certificate holder themselves find that bmps that were proposed aren't uh working as they were intended to work and I just said BMP is like five times that means best management practices and includes things like yeah uh um straw Waddles and and those sorts of things that you put on the site to control soil for moving well just uh real quick since you're moving to the left side um a quick question on the codes the standards for facility design does a recent Supreme Court decision affect any uh",

        "text": " we're doing an update we don't necessarily need to start at the beginning um and at this board's Direction our process starts at the determination of significance space and I'll give you a bit more details on that process um later on in this presentation as their inventory work is complete we'll move on to step two the esce analysis or the show your work phase and we'll identify the major types of land uses that could conflict with the natural resources and do some analysis this analysis called the es which stands for economic social environmental and energy um analysis considers the positive and negative impacts of allowing limiting or prohibiting conflicting land uses within the significant natural resource area through the various lenses of each of those es categories and finally we'll be looking at our um taking that analysis and weighing and balancing those impacts and developing the policies and regulations that make up our goal five program and so here's the rough timeline um that shows um uh our project schedule and it you can see that it has some overlap and um is a bit iterative of of what we're doing the first um the bulk of the time is spent on our inventory process and our first inperson Community Forum will be a week from today October 24th will be on hand with large Maps so people can see the draft updated inventory and gets a sense of where we have identified these natural resources and get comments on that and then there's also a corresponding online openhouse that'll run from this Friday through November 10th where people can also see the maps online and look up different properties and then kind of make comments as as needed so there'll be another Community Forum the second one um this winter in 2024 and and finally there'll be public hearings um next summer with a board adopting the regulations by our due date of October 1st 2024 so moving on to some of the details of the inventory process this map shows the urban area of Washington County with a tan color showing the Incorporated areas or city areas um in the urban area and the blue and orange encompassing the urban unincorporated area or our general study area the blue areas are where we call the map refinement area and we're doing the bulk of our mapping here and our um and that was an analysis and we're and that was part of our original inventory work um that we did in the 1980s and then those orange areas or the new community plan areas where cities have done some of the the goal five planning work um that will also be included in our update here's some of the terms that we'll be using to describe our natural resources that uh um that will be included in our inventory Maps the habitat is the place where plant and animal species live and grow and we have two types of those riparian which includes the streams and the water areas and those adjacent to the streams and water areas and then the Upland habitat generally goes beyond that riparian habitat and can include some Forest patches that also provide habitat so here was our starting point for the inventory and it's a comparison of the county and the Metro maps of the significant natural resources for the Bethany area um which is the unincorporated Area North of Highway 26 um that's seen a lot of development in the past 40 years so our County's significant natural resources map is on the left with the water related um habitat in blue and the wildlife habitat in green the metro map to the right um done about 20 years later shows um the Upland in green and the rip pairing in shades of blue and so the Metro Maps also uh classify the habitat based on the quality which the County's Maps don't include and so our consultant team has worked to combine these Maps through our arcgis system um so we have one consolid dated map to look at the significant natural resources so using those maps on the previous screen um within our map refinement area our consultant combined the data in both of the maps into one map and then adjustments were made to take out areas that have been developed or where natural resources are better defi identified through the development review process and then we conducted a manual review and cleaned up the data where it was needed and finally um we'll be incorporating the City community plan data for areas added to the urban growth boundary since our original inventory done and so here's a map of that same Bethany area with our Consolidated Maps you can see the areas of blue represent the riparian habitat and the Upland wildlife habitat are the shades of orange in this case and so when Metro and county maps were Consolidated the County's original Wildlife H habitat areas had areas where the the habitat overlaped um within the uh within those Metro riparian or Upland habitat areas so the mapped yellow areas on this map show the original wildlife habitat where there was no over overlap um with the other natural resource categories but it's still considered significant habitat and so those green areas on the map are the open space and areas so a very important aspect of the project has been our focus on community engagement and I wanted to share some information with you about that we've been spreading the word about this project by attending various community events over the summer from Cornelius to Cedar Mill through maloa and also in down in toatin and last week we mailed a letter to all the property owners with map significant natural resources on our draft Maps letting them know about the project upcoming events and uh an interactive map tool um that our GIS team developed for people to use to look at their property and see where the draft resources have been identified so we have our upcoming Community Forum next week um where we'll be sharing information um and also the online open house that I spoke to earlier I also wanted to note that these are bilingual events and all of the materials are in Spanish as well as English and other translation services are available upon request and we've um have presented and we're happy to present to interested community- based or organizations and that work is ongoing so some of our next steps as was shown in the earlier graphic um once the inventory work is complete we'll be talking um through the esce um analysis to get to our development of the goal five program filing the ordinance that will bring to the board and the hearing process um next summer and with that I'd like to um answer any questions that you might have or get any comments um if you could just go back to the prior slide sure um filing the ordinance in April and between April and August 1 we have both the uh ordinance going through the Planning Commission and through the board right that's correct there'll be both of those opportunities Y and as you have laid it out is that a tight time frame to go through both of those major iterations well we believe um it is uh a conservative but also gives plenty of time for several Planning Commission hearings a chance that it might um have engrossment or changes that you might might decide to make and all to make our our deadline okay great great that sounds good um so Commissioners do you have any questions or comments on on this complex issue lots of Ms hundreds of Ms sure so the the county maps were done at one point in time and then all of the development the um the county maps were done actually before GIS systems were in place so we feel that the Metro maps are quite a bit more accurate and then we overlay that with Aerials to get a good um good look at where everything is and we've also um have different layers more recent layers that we're looking at to to do some comparison so so I would say that Metro maps are a little bit more accurate um in most cases but we we didn't do too badion much AG well no we've Advanced our maps to take in the best of the best so we even be more advanced yes it will incorporate all of the changes that have occurred in the last 20 years so to speak we're not adding new areas but we're we're kind of um adjusting where where those riparian areas and and water and well they they were in the general scheme uh uh through 20 years ago but as the teams talked about they've used the most recent over uh what do you call them the visual over overlays the gis layers yes so it's even more up Tod date on the State of Affairs well the inventory is quite a big big process so it is a static map um and that map is is their inventory map and I I'm we haven't really discussed whether they would take on our our adjustments or not yeah with them yeah aren't confused it would make sense yes I don't know what sort of uh time frame they would be required to adopt something uh more up Tod date than their initial but it will certainly be available to them should they uh have a project to go through an update I was just going to add I think I think this is an example of really just trying to sort of merge our two sets of mapping together is a large part of the exercise and so it's not un un unheard of that jurisdictions another example maybe that we ALS while we regulate the FEMA regulated flood plane the 100e what was formerly called the 100-year flood plane we've also adopted yet another layer of review here called drainage Hazard areas and so that's sort of additional area that we have decided as a county is important to also regulate development around and this might be something similar we're looking at both the base Metro mapping areas but also looking at areas that were mapped by the county in addition to so if anything I think the result of this will be that we'll be looking at more area or certainly not less area than we would have in terms of footprint uh previously so I'm fascinated by your U reviewing all the latest aerial maps as well that's just a lot of work to to review and pull in Commissioners Willie or fi any question questions or comments Nea if you'd like to go ahead thank thank you commiss thank you chair I I have a Michelle great presentation um I had a sort of a small question for you Michelle and and that is a question from the slide around engagement you know I part of CPO 6 and one of the thing I appreciate and remember from past memory is the robust conversation and discussions around the SNR uh uh cp6 when you were doing not you specifically but when when the county was doing the last inventory assessment um and I noticed that",

        "text": " right? Technically, that's what I mean. They did it already a one good as anyone else without anything. Now we're giving them a leey to go do more. If they get the zoning change approved and they don't come in with a site plan, then the code case would continue forward. This was your compromise that we will not pur sue you, but don't worry, we'll give you more. The code case moves forward regardless. But does approved zoning change and then a site plan could alleviate that issue. I like this idea. You do it and then ask for forgiveness and then change the zone. I love this idea, man. I'm a businessman. Isn't norlly what we see in here? Probably a lot of times three out of five come in and ask for forgiveness and fix it. It is. I will entertain a motion. Guys. Hi, Jerry Lonco. Agree with staff findings and recommendation. And hereby recommend approval of the requested rezoning. Based on the following findings of fact will not adversely affect the public interest. Is consistent with the comprehensive plan. Is compatible with surrounding land use. I am looking for a second. I, Greg Lord, second the motion. Have a first to second. All in favor? A I opposed. One opposed. Motion carries. It's done. You guys need to fight in a county commission's office? That's my neighbor'can. We ready? Can we archle Gr services again, this is case 23,0070. Two su it is a special use request permit or special use permit request for a parking of a commercial vehicle, the tractor and a trailer on a one property. The property is five acres and is located at 1117 Northwest 150th Avenue. It is inside a farmland preservation area. We had notified twelve people and had one letter of opposition. The land use is ruralan and the ownoning is a one s mentioned. This property was created in 1993 with a family division. And surprisingly enough, the people who started the family division still owned that the parent parcel and the person who the property was given to still owns the subdivided piece. So that's pretty nice to see. You don't see that very often. Here is the conceptual plan. You'll see there's a easement that goes along the northern boundary of the property back to the applicant'home. And the applicant is proposing to park the semi right here. And the site is heavily wooded or heavily vegetated with trees all around. According to the application and theining effects. From 1993 to 2023. The applicant had been parking on the parent parcel of the family division right here. And then there was an issue and the applicant had to move his vehicle from there. And then applied for a specialty permit on his property. Here'some site photos. You can see the site is heavily wooded. Here's the applicant'home and this vehicle would be park back here. One of the conditions, if approved staff is asking that a commercial apron be put in right here. To protect the county maintain road of the northwest 150th. As mentioned, a parcel was created in 1993. Applicant states that he has been parking his vehicle for 30 years on the parent parcel. And the site is well vegetated the staff is recommending approval. But if following conditions. We can go through them if you would like. Or we have them. We have it. And I hope this applicant'here today. If the applicantant would like to come up. Good evening. My name is James Hartley. I'm here on behalf of the applicant. As you said, this is one of those applications where we are asking for. What's thatad? Just please. I'm sorry. Office is at 1531 Southeast 36th Avenue. Sorry about that. This is one of those cases where we are asking for forgiveness. This does come from a code enforcement case. As Mister Wayrock said. Mister Jones has been parking a semi on the parent parcel for about 30 years now. Unbeknownst to him, he does need a special use permit to be able to park on the a one property if there is no agricultural production going on as well. A one does allow by right the parking of a commercial vehicle if you have the agriculture production going on and you're transporting those materials. But we don't have that going on. But it is a lesser intensive use than what is permitted by right. As Mister Wayrock said, it is very nice that the family lot split does still have the original owners. However, it is our understanding that it was Mister Jones mother who reported the violation in this case. So we are trying to. It's our understanding that the trucks had been parked on her property for about 30 years. His dad was a truck driver. His brother was a truck driver. It's our understanding that the code complaint for this isn't necessarily related to a disfavor of the trucks being there, but more so of just some family issues that kind of arise from time to time. As Mister Wayre said, the area is very heavily buffered. It's five acres. The site plan. Our intent and what he's been doing is to park the semi almost smack dab right in the middle of that five acres. So we don't think it would bother any of the neighbors. And in fact we have received a letter of support that is in the packet there from the neighborh who potentially be most affected, who is to. To the north of the property there where the easement out to the main road exits. He said that in his 30 years of being their neighbor, he's never had any issues. The letter of opposition that we received is a property northeast of the property in question. I think there is a county owned piece of property in between that buffers that as well. That was the shriners who had that letter of objection. I did send a letter back to them trying to explain the situation. They seemed to be concerned that their tranquil setting would be disrupted by the truck coming and going. I think that kind of lends itself to understand that they'been enjoying a tranquil setting for the past few years, despite the fact that Mister Jones has been able to park his truck there and they'been unbotherered by it. They also had a concern with Jake brakes and possible use of horn. Mister Jones doesn't need to use the jake brakes while hes in the neighborhood area, so that wouldn't be an issue. And hes not going to be honking his horn either. Like I said, we have a let of support from the neighborhood. Be most affected by the truck being there. And if you have any other questions. Whats he holing? Agricultural. I think it'mostly a mulch. No hazardous material? No hazardous material. And he leaves with an empty truck and comes back with an empty truck. Oay, this is just one truck with trailer, right? Just one truck and trailer. And that's what the permit would be for as well. One? Yes, sir. You've had a ch sor. He has no issues with the conditions. The only condition we were a little concerned with was number eight. I think Mister Wade Rock said it was the commercial apron. If you look at the picture, there is an apron there that was required to get his certificate of occupancy back in 93. I think condition eight says that we need to work with Marion County Transportation Department to determine what would be necessary. I did try to reach out to them today, but haven't been able to get many of my questions answered just yet. But we'll work with them before the county commission to see exactly what would be necessary for that apron to protect the road there. Anyone else have any questions? Let's see what kind of opposition we have and then we'll have you come back to try to address them. Thank you. Thank you. Would anyone that's in favor, would like to come up? Anyone in opposition that would like to come up? There's nobody in opposition here. Okay, you're welcome to come back, but I don't see a reason to. We'll bring it back to this board. Looks like a family food to me. Simple thing. Yeah, 30 year. The guys parking will approve. Your concern is number eight. So how do we address that rate? Really is something that everyone has to abide by if you're going to have that. So they just need to figure out what it is. But I don't think's ever, I don't think that's anything we before the county commission meeting that they can meet and see how big that apron is. It's there. Yeah. We'll get with the traffic division of Oce to talk about the existing apron versus any upgrades that they might require. Yeah, I saw that. It's already there. But it says in a condition once we approve them, he has to do it. That's the problem. So we give them a time in between on condition eight to work with the before it goes to county commissioner. Right. What Oce's off traffic division may decide is that it's fine for now, but if that apron becomes deteriorated or broken, you will need to fix it and replace it with an upgraded one can. The special use permit specifies one truck, right? Correct. Yep, it does. And we'll add the viin number of the truck in the trailer before the resolution comes in. All right, so I move it with those modifications. I have a motion. Do I have a second? I need about a second motion. I have a second. Dan, you want to read the whole little script? Yes, I. Otherwise, I'm gonna get a look. I'm telling you, I'm gonna get a look. Last page. Yeah. Read. I agree with the staff. I agree with the staff. Finding and recommendation. Come and remember recommend approval of the request of a",

        "text": " your pitch for rack members to just say help us um make this still meeting our legal requirements but clarifying our intent and and hopefully members of the public can help us with that thank you it's a good question though uh it is something we think about and is one of the biggest challenges so for sure uh go ahead and go to the next SL so uh sort of have decided that around this this rack size is typically worked for us in the past uh I know some and I have since learned uh and working with other uh rle making coordinators that there are some racks that are enormous but uh we typically don't get much more than this even if I ask more you know let's say I ask 30 people I might get an eight you know so but we do try to kind of get a representative rack uh and uh it would look something like this but you know if we could if we could fill it it would be as around well so anybody have any thoughts about the rock makeup the visual making chair how yeah can't I'm just curious about like you said the public is one of your more challenging positions to fill how has that been in the past with BR making have you been able to get volunteers yeah we've actually had uh members who represent public interest for each the rle making however uh the pool of people who represent the public who who would then also be interested in being on a rule making like this uh is you know you know I can count them on my hands so we typically like the rest you know like the investor owned utilities we're not constantly seeing a change on that front I mean it's been the same for years uh our public bucket is kind of similar to that so we have people who have expressed interest in a lot of aspects of our role making and deciding projects and they typically are the people who will say who will answer the call and say yes I'll I'll be involved in this rule making but we're always trying to think of ways to rot our reach Beyond sort of the usual uh suspects which is why we we did do the re effort for our last most recent rle making uh to actually just directly reach out to sort of folks that have never expressed an interest who didn't even know what we you know that this exists had never been on Iraq before so we're we're always trying to think of new new approaches yeah I think maybe one concern I might have is that you end up having the same people on these racks reoccurring and that would be something that I think that the council should work on um a broader scope there if we can I know it's challenging though to to the roles but if we have the same people constantly serving then we might get the same answers every time absolutely councelor G when we reach out to the counties um I was thinking about like the port commissions and things do we approach them like hey would you like to do this versus can you you know put it in your own minutes and advertise it through your own your own communication I I don't know but my thought is if we reach out to the port it' be like okay well there's what three Commissioners in Moro County they're like I I don't have time for that but are we asking them to communicate it to their constituency the forward so and I typically don't I mean I might you know send a notice to you know all the counties in hear back from three of them who say no the rest I don't even get responses and typically uh the only County involvement we get is from AOC the association of you know Oregon County so um uh they depending on the rle making they they'll they're the the only County involvement we get and likewise with the tribes I I've never heard back from the tribes on any rle making so but we we still reach out to them chair how yeah c um just a thought here um I know most boards and commissions and whatnot have a consent calendar and maybe um a letter that's sent to and put on their consent calendar that way they have to acknowledge it in somewhere you know an email is easy to bypass you know it's just easy to be like H I don't have time for that but if we put it in the public record maybe that would be some kind of you know better outcome as far as interests just a okay any other for huh yeah does she look familiar yes we want you to see uh yeah go ahead okay any further discussion from council do we have a this is an action item do we have a motion councelor gra Mr chair I move that the council initiate the application process phase we'll make turn on the right one we'll making with the scope and objectives presented recommended by staff staff and approve the creation of a rul making advisory committee I further move that the council delegate the authority to appoint specific members to the ruem advisory committee to the park Department do you have a second councelor Byer okay we've got the motion in a second uh secretary esterson could you read the role yes sir Katie IMS yes Kent how yes Cindy Condon yes Anne berer yes Perry choc toot yes and Marcy Grail yes motion carries Mr chair okay thank you so yeah thanks Mr Jackman that was well done um it's a break time do people want 10 15 what do you want to do 10 good okay well it's 933 so we'll take a 10minute break come back at 943 okay uh it's now 9:44 and I'd like to call the meeting back from recess and continue with the next agenda item which is public comment so um this time is reserved for the public to address the council regarding any item within Council jurisdiction that's not otherwise closed for comment and Nancy I'm going to need to ask you if we've got I I see you gave me uh one person here um that's in the room that'd like to provide public comment so we'll do that one and then we'll check the webinar and the phone uh after that so um Mr Jones we're ready to hear your comments welcome thank you chair how is this on no I push that button there you go you're on now thank you chair how and fellow council members uh I want to first thank you all again uh don't think for a minute I don't see this as a this opportunity to address this Council as a privilege and I always want to make sure that we do so in a respectful way myself and and my fellow community members have spoken and uh I just want to ensure that that all of our concerns are are communicated clearly and concisely with uh with all respect so I've attended a number of the last I'm sorry oh I'm sorry my name is Troy Jones thank you my name is Troy Jones um my address is 223 335 Gap Road in Oregon I've attended uh a number of meetings in the past and I've spoken about my concerns specifically to the inequities and some of the Oregon State statutes related to land use um I don't want to continue that same that same conversation today I think I've made myself clear on that matter uh a couple of my neighbors and my myself uh came to the meeting I believe it was in February and we spoke to the to the concern of uh water contamination and uh also the lack of an end of life policy for solar panels in the State uh that concern is still a legitimate uh the reason we're here is because there's a a proposal for a large solar facility near near our community uh it's nearly 1,600 the the notice of intent indicates it's nearly 1,600 acres and it's on uh zoned efu or exclusive Farm use properties that's high value exclusive uh uh use Farmland use and while this hasn't been formally applied the application hasn't been formally applied for yet uh we're trying to stay ahead of the pitch count we're trying to be proactive in our approach and our communication so the council is well aware of the concerns that that exist within the community a main and primary concern is the potential loss of that efu property I've spoken before in regard to the the amount of properties efu prop properties have been lost over the last number of years uh there's records that show as of 2022 up to 660,000 acres of Farmland has been lost to Urban growth boundaries and uh industrial sightings there's a multitude of other concerns that we have uh specifically to Wildfire concern uh Wildlife uh impacts and the loss of wetland well most of this property is considered farmed Wetlands which is also a huge concern to us we what we hope is our hope is is that our presence and our continued communication with fsac will uh have a positive impact on the council and the council will take these considerations into uh into their process as as it evolves and again all we're trying to do is stay ahead of this I I I I personally believe that if nothing was spoken of and it just comes about it'll be too late in the process and that's why we're that's why we're here that's why we're present um a lot of my neighbors and the community that I live in they're not able and capable of coming to the these meetings I know that uh WebEx is available to them but they're not always very good on the zoom in the WebEx type uh format so I come and I speak on behalf of the group and I appreciate that that you're your uh your patience and your thoughtfulness uh in regard to this perspect this particular project um I hope that you strongly will consider our concerns as this goes along as the process evolves we understand the entire uh flow process uh very clearly we understand how it evolves the public comment periods and that type of thing so it's uh again we just want to make sure that we're doing a good job of communicating our concerns before we get to those processes so with that I really appreciate your time thank you for your comment can I just ask a quick question um for you as you know um you know we get both side the the developer and certainly the people they're working with that want the project and others might not so um is the efu issue overriding if we had condition if there were condition suitable conditions to speak to the land use land use water not so much land use I guess uh but the water contamination the end of life of the solar panels those issues conditions were applied that recognize that and possible possible solutions",

is written and commissioner stra seconds all in motion I will now open the public hearing for historic review case number 23 H 23-22 Sor just look with with the recorder please read the hearing procedures statement into the record this is a public hearing to consider case number number hisis 23-22 for property located at 170 Liberty Street Northeast the criteria applicable to this hearing are listed in sised code chapter 2 045d storefronts in commercial historic districts failure to raise an issue prior to the close of the public hearing with statements or evidence sufficient to afford the historic landmarks commmission and the parties an opportunity to respond to the issue concludes appeal to the hearings officer on that issue a similar failure to raise issues relating to proposed conditions or approval prudes an action for damages in Circuit Court prior to the conclusion of the hearing any participant May request an opportunity to present additional evidence or testimony the historic landmarks commission will then either continue the public hearing or leave the record open for at least seven days are there any conflicts of interest or expart contacts that any of the Commissioners would like to declare at time commissioner St um I've done ra on this building before but it won't affect my may we now have the staff presentation good evening uh Kimberly Fitzgerald historic preservation officer for the City of Salem I'd like to enter the staff report its attachments and all public testimony into the record this property is located on Liberty Street and is non-contributing to our downtown National register district and um this is a a on story commercial structure which has been altered uh significantly since its construction uh while the original National register nomination stated that the building was constructed in 1914 research completed by staff Kiren revealed that uh this building was constructed in 1905 and initially housed the switchboards for the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph company from 1905 to 1930 and in 1930 the Fred Meyer store moved in and uh occupied the building through 1948 I love that picture on the left with all the snow um in 1948 the building went through a significant remodel to accommodate the new the leads uh shoe store who occupied the building until uh so this is actually um a compliance case so the case before you the work has already been completed and the applicant is applying for a retroactive approval to install the security gate you can see here and fencing uh you can see on the left side of your screen um how it looked before the gate was installed and then how it looks now on the lower right um so again this is an active compliance case so uh uh while the applicant is working towards compliance regarding the historic design review and building permits which have both been applied for uh some some items remain in violation relating to outside storage um and our compliance officer is working on on that with with the owner so the specifics of the case again it's uh approval to install uh a 19 foot 6 inch wide gate it has a varying height due to the arched design of the gate so it ranges from 5 and a half to 6 and 1 12 feet tall the gate itself is forged steel um and similar to the hearing you had had last last month um it it conveys the appearance of a a r rod iron um picket uh so a portion of it's a gate which opens and the other portion is a fence and so at no point is the gate itself or the fencing actually attached to the storefront uh the gate is attached to two freestanding um metal post uh and the the fencing is as well and they're secured at the at the base so I'm going to go through the criteria uh SRC um 23045 D for storefronts so the first is the materials so again because the the gate itself um is not attached to the existing storefront no original material has been Disturbed or replaced unlike the other security gate you looked at a few months ago uh there's no decorative tile at the base that will be um that's character defining that will that's been disturbed by the installation of the the posts um and then the material the metal gate itself is compatible it's a it's a material that's found commonly throughout the downtown historic district and then the second uh section regarding design again no no features of the existing storefront are altered by the installation of the gate and the design of the gate itself it fits in um to the uh front of the the entry to the opening uh and it's removable so it's not attached and it's removable um so staff would recommend that the landmarks commission find that SRC 230 45d has been met for this proposal so we did receive public comment from John Christensen uh who has concerns about the security gate uh there was testimony in support from the neighborhood association can do um submitted by Livingston and the the building and division uh indicated that the applicant um must comply with the uh applicable code related for egress and as well as occupancy for these Gates and the applicant is working with the building division as part of the building permit process and um the planning division has no concerns and neither did the public works department and there's been no comments from any public agencies So based upon the applicant submittal and the findings presented in the staff report staff recommends the landmarks commission approve the proposal that concludes the staff report thank you Kimberly do any of the Commissioners have questions for staff commissioner sh I have one question I'm looking at the um site plan here and I'm looking at the North side where the six foot metal gate opens um inside towards the glass we know if there's some sort of way to keep keep that metal gate from hitting theoric glass or is it do we know anything about that uh let me share so I'm clear is it this plan that you're referring to at the North side there how the gate opens up towards the um towards the glass towards the storefront yeah uh I I don't have a good answer to that question I I know that I did go to the site and look at u pictures uh I did take pictures and I know that Stephanie did as well but that's not a question I can answer for certain whether they're I don't recall seeing any kind of of barrier or stop um in so it wouldn't hit the glass okay thank you yeah do any other Commissioners have any questions for staff okay I will call for the applicants testimony do we have applicant here so there is nobody here nobody from the neighborhood association and do we have anybody from the signup sheet Melanie yes is this for this case yes okay um please come you can come up to the podium and then um state your name and address for the record hi my name hello hi my name is Melanie Weston and I own Salem on the gallery6 Liberty Street Northeast so I am the retail Gallery just south of the French unicorn um I find this gate very concerning for many issues um one is it just doesn't make downtown look safe where we already have issues down there and people are afraid to come to town far I'm sureg issues that we about in this gate just makes it worse we're not New York um I don't think people are going to be going in and smashing her windows or doors um the other issue is that she is storing things behind the gate um it's a constant move in move out almost every day um they are dropping things off um and she is trying to make nice little displays behind the gate but it's an issue um again it just doesn't look good uh for the rest of the block for the downtown community to have the storage going on boxes and Furniture um yeah I I just feel like we don't need metal gates we don't need metal gates um if if you don't f feel safe if her property isn't safe her belongings safe inside of the building sell the building sell the building so that someone can move in and bring some more uh retail shops to Downtown Salem so that people want to come downtown and Shop um the more buildings that we have that have up this it's just not healthy it's not healthy for our community downtown and it really hurts all of us retail shops seriously where people are not coming downtown um and I'm concerned it's concerning for my business when her shop was open people came in um came into my shop you know we get more people walking around they came down specifically to go into the F cor and then you know wandering around so it's it's just healthy for buildings you know to have have shops that are open not closed putting Gates and not planning on opening I just don't see the point so thank you thank you do any of the Commissioners have any questions I have a question is the business to your knowledge is the business still open or is it just being used to just Storage storage just storage thank you so the gate to clarify the gate is closed all day yes except for when she's bringing in more come back up to the podium sorry thank you except for when she's bringing in more stuff and then it is outside of the doors she moves it in although not all of the product are chairs boxes get moved into the space okay there's always something behind the gate so the gate is not just for nighttime security it's all the time oh all the time thank you yes we have any other um does the to your knowledge is there a second entrance to the building is there a way of you know Ingress regress size FR I I believe there's a back door into the alley okay but I'm not sure I I think all of our build have back yeah seems like a thing okay cool thank you do any of the Commissioners have any additional questions for staff I have a question about the permitted use is it permitted to use this space for storage or as a loading unloading sounds like it's being used because kind of a loading dock is that even permitted um you can't just do storage downtown our records indicate that they're using it for a second",

        "text": " know that this is outside of your jurisdiction that's what we've been told from talking to staff when we talk about Idaho Power there fancy footwork they're bullying but with what they're doing is the people are just what what you're doing by saying this is none of your responsibility you're leaving the people to hang out to drive and let a corporation blackmail them and my suggestion to you is if you want to represented citizens of the state that you will deny this request and that you will vote in favor of a process that is involving the public from the GetGo you guys do a good job but I think there is a better way to do it thank you very much thank you Mr crer okay um Nancy that is there anybody else on the web X so uh Wendy King you have your hand raised I'm going to go ahead and unmute your mic Wendy you're ready to make a comment Miss King the Myers family I live at 1337 Southwest pmus Avenue Apartment 303 Redmond Oregon 9775 there are a number of site certificate conditions that I do not and how they will affect my family I would ask that the council extend the public comment period for further study of these changes have enough time it seems to be a common theme and I think a expansion of the time that we need to public comment is appropriate the rfa2 transission line Alternatives have been requested and approved by land owners and that's great i' hope power would have us believe that the expansion of the ASC approved site boundary is an effort to streamline additional landowner requests however the recent letter titled titled update by Idaho Power States we will make these changes only when land owners request them or they're necessary for engineering or construction purposes their language leaves the door wide open to make changes based only on Idaho Idaho power's needs because power has had their shot at engineering B2 for years and achieve their certificate it seems unimaginable that they have further adjustments that weren't accounted for in the original approved route especially the midline capacitor station the correction to Road widths is another reason to contemplate their ability to design and construct a transition line facility very issue shows to me either the lack of accurate engineering or a total manipulation of the site certificate process to work in their favor I am also concerned about blasting because the plan may be amended to add it back to an odoe has to reflect would fsac have approved the original site certificate had this amendment been part of it Mark family and Mary asked for a reroute in April of 2023 and we were given no consideration since then there have been no landowner consultations with our family I'm concerned about the bald eagle passage up little Butter Creek that B2 H crosses and now this is impacted by changes possibly to site conditions I am very concerned that Idaho will use the amendment determination request ADR to achieve their own re refinements for engineering construction purposes alone leaving land owners out of the process I strongly suggest that the fock require all abrs be approved by the land owners and the public that will be impacted expanding the site boundary with the possibil of moving the transmission line over additional areas of our farm has the potential of adversely impacting our multi-generational families the revised route may result in unacceptable noise levels at our Homestead may be strung over our high value crop land impacting the great horned owls reside in our hay sheds and may justify carving add additional roads through our Homestead location if this is allowed without adequate studies it may impose significant changes to our accepted Farm practices and significantly increase the cost of incepted farm practices like aerial chemical application and movement of products from to storage and Market by allowing the expanded site boundary Idaho Power May justify moving the line through yet more fields and disregard the usual constraints of sighing along the edges of fields existing roadways or natural boundaries rather than through existing pills because they only have to show they did so generally the OS 215275 does not require the complete avoidance or elimination of impacts to accepted bar practices Idaho Power can simply move its transmission line within yet another of our Fields as they did in the original sighting and we have recourse advocacy just land added to our condemnation trial concerning historical cultural and a and AR archaeological resources the Barth Bartholomew Myers Farm is a historical resource it was adopted into the century Farm and Ranch program number 1093 and MHP eligible Criterion a the original CFR application completed in 2005 reflects while farming challenges remain all of those on the farm enjoy the beautiful countryside and respect the great heritage that we we have on Meyers Bartholomew Farm the B2 approved route north of our Homestead is already an isore in the viewshed of our historical Farm if B2 were to be relocated closer to our Homestead we would contest we formally request access to the confidential attachment S10 intensive level set survey visual assessment of historic report in exhibit s of the original b2h application as it includes our property how it was studied and how the line relocation may impact results I'm out of time e okay um Miss King yes you is your are your comments in um yes I have can you email them oh we've got them yeah okay I think um right um yeah Okay so we've got your written comments is if I'll give you like 30 more seconds to highlight anything in your written comments that you wanted to note okay the is that my statement is Idaho Power solely responsible jeopardizing the hard work engineering and coordinating with land owners the 12 transmission line Alternatives by adding the request fored site boundary at a late stage of the Idaho Power further if rfa2 is denied land owners would lose everything they've worked with Idaho Power to include in rfa2 by brokering the addition of an site boundary to our A2 idah to capture two for one amendments in fsac with one F swoop playing off of community for land owners thank you okay thank you Mrs King okay um Nancy others on the web X I do not see any other hands raised at this time okay shall we go to the phone then just to remind the call-in users if you are wanting to raise your hand you're going to press star three on your telephone keypad that will raise your hand and you would press star three again when you're finished commenting to lower your hand there are no hands raised at this time okay okay and um no one else in the room wishing to testify tonight okay um from the council anyone um any councilors have comments yeah councelor berer we just want to thank everybody who came out tonight and who are participated on the phone um this is a very complex project and and kudos to all of you who've been hanging with it this long um so thank you for your comments and the ones that are submitted in writing all the council members receive and we all read them so thank you for that extra effort thank you councelor Byer councelor con or vice chair Condon is it a for me to ask a question of one of the people who testified today a clarifying A clarifying question yeah Miss Gilbert oh you are still here um you mentioned that blasting wasn't um considered before but we did consider it and I don't um I don't see anything in this RFA that changes that so I'm just I'm trying to hone in on the the blasting what happened with blasting is the initial uh site certificate had the process for review of the blasting plan that included um participation from the counties and and that uh input during part of the process for RFA 1 the uh draft proposed order stated that because fsac because Odo did not feel that they had the expertise to make decisions about whether or not the blasting plan was appropriate they were removing they removed the uh the requirement that the counties and they didn't feel that the counties all had that anybody had the expertise to look at this blasting plan and give input so they removed the review requirements now I had a problem with that that was assured that there wasn't going to be any blasting so it wasn't going to impact anything well and they also you know had told people in the public that there wasn't going to be any blasting so it wasn't going to be a problem well blasting is still in the site certificate and at this point from everything I can tell idah power is not continuing to say that there will be no blasting so now we're left with Idaho Power deciding what they're going to do with blasting what their safety is going to be who's going to do it without any influence or input from the counties or the special advisory groups or actually for the Oregon Department of energy they're just supposed to turn in the report after they're done basically so that is a problem okay thank you thank you yeah delin thank you Mr chairman um I had a question actually for the applicant uh would like them to respond to um I'm I'm sort of like in the same position I'm in with my family I'm the eighth of nine children so with the exception of uh misses there I'm the newest person on the council so I haven't been on that long um I think I was selected this because of my background in energy issues background in land use and and uh background and sighting issues um I don't know exactly what the process is here for Idaho Power but I'm thinking about it in a similar way that I would think about because I have some background in that area citing Road facilities and highways where you go through a process where you select a possible Corridor you study that Corridor it might be relatively large actually and corridors tend to upset a lot of people because they have relatively large impact then probably when you get close to selecting preferred Corridor you start probably start preliminary engineering and then when you actually get closer and closer to approval of everything and you're actually going to actually start uh putting in a timeline for actual construction you get to the final final design and Engineering basis is it similar in this case or could you describe it yeah I I do have some public comment that will um kind of walk through what Our intention of the expanded site boundry is um but yes it is we've gone through final engineering we've worked with individual land owners on on some of those changes which is why we had had changes to where those access roads are um but I do have kind of an explanation of what the reason",

        "text": " the group you know like could that be a possibility fit with also true that this part this work will have a half% for so there could be something there go and then we also have peace Plaza yes and my hopes have been since I've been on this committee is is to um Revitalize it doesn't we don't necessarily have to spend a ton of money but we do need to make it Greener and more welcoming and so again my Hope was to be able to have something that went all the way from the pond Mir pond through the building into that and over to the library and so I feel that maybe some of that historic presentation could follow through yes yeah I really like the idea of clearing the view and letting us all see more of the pond and downtown no I do too I do too building having that open space um but you can still maintain that architecture you know that blends in with the the rest of it in a way and in terms of cost I've always had a theory that that structure that council chambers is is did you ever watch Men In Black no but okay so they have the there are these hidden pods all over the United States oh really when you have to return to your planet you just hit you find the button you and and it takes I think that's one of those always that spaces it's a spaceship there's actually a button under the mayor's desk and I've never known what it was for it might be a revenue maker that building yes I think I think you just hit that button and you won't even have any any could save us on demo demo cost right it takes off anyway and because there is some art in the building itself you know so if we could figure out where that would go and mechanisms to be able to have that open space where it once was to represent it in some ways I think we could maybe figure out a way to yeah lose the historic if peace Plaza can get an upgrade that'd be great because I look at like the council chambers that you guys have in this idea and looking out over peace PL as it is now that would be really depressing well what I've been talking about too others know is making sure that we the pathway coming up from um under the the U Commercial Street up into toir pond and then through to piece Plaza is like a oneway you know for strollers for bicyclists for anybody strolling so those are all my hopes and when the library opened onto peace Plaza that's that that really made sense that we killed pie Plaza when they moved the opening to the other side of the building so anyway my hope is to make that feel all again a very movable space for those in wheelchairs or yes yes I also heard what you just said too is that I've been curious we have you today when we're looking at be Plaza I heard you say like something this more green right that's our Instinct too but is that also do you think that's gonna be more widely the trade-off a little bit is like you know I'm sure the original the people that originally designed this thing were thinking this is just like very giant flexible space that you don't have any anything in and it's just wide open for giant public Gatherings like the whole city can f and then they put a whole fountain in the middle of it that doesn't work yeah so I think um you know when we do start you know bringing trees I mean into the space for example um thinking of it as a place that becomes much more maybe it loses a little bit of that just like big tarmac flexibility for sure but becomes more H like a place you want to be yeah yeah you go out there in the summer you want to talk about the hottest place in the city oh yeah go out into PE Plaza on you could PE but you could also put a spin on the word piece and make it a place for restoration you know like so where you go and like be in Regeneration you're turning into an architect I know right good you Mr war and fuzzy something that I've been kind of hoping for that we have some power out there so that maybe we could have um light shows you know like at special events we could you know like we light up the bridge we could also have find ways to um use peace Plaza to uh promote whatever um organization that we're on you know gun violence or um other similar things that we might have there and I'm hoping that we can have some show exhibits okay yeah yeah I love the idea of incorporating light into that kind of like what the police station has in in front of it kind of that or in even more Beyond sometimes they can even have light that go up against the building and but can I ask the question about where we're all going while this is happening we're going to your house making progress looked at Alternatives but we're still shock we haven't we haven't signed any contracts yet okay I really like the parking upgrade especially for just ping and so straight to the customer service center that's brilliant okay I agree yeah there is a downside to that though just to be aware of that because we have the oneway traffic on the liberty and Commercial if if we were to do that service lot then you could only the from Liberty and yeah it just be something people want to get used to otherwise but we were think about having um a small parking lot from entering from commercial I don't know if that's still within your plans that that would be near peace right y I mean the one where the parking spots are already at yeah basically there but maybe even a little bit more um and and have some of those be um you know Ada we need that I think there's one looking we looked at one that was Ada accessible was coming uh coming in a little sooner uh when you're heading north on uh Liberty and we would certainly want some EV Chargers you know whether or at least power so that we could put those in um yes I'll stop because I had a lot of ideas that I've already shared I will continue unnecessary we saw that parking plan in the work our partners CB2 did during predesign they were also just I'm presenting this but this was like the product of like a lot of people um you know not just hacker uh it's our partner CB2 and our our contractor to so see me to they've also looked at they they were the ones that kind of brought that idea and then they were also kind of our partners and thinking about other places like that like that other Corner David what do you anticipate the the process being from here to 100% plans you maybe we're at at 10% right now what do you anticipate the process in as far as going through the design process and and arriving at a preferred design and and Ting that with the public and Council what does what does that look like ricardio do you want to address that from a bigger timeline kind of point of view I mean yeah so I mean architecturally we'll go I mean they'll go I'd say that they're at less than 10% right now so yeah so um you know they're still filling out the rest of their team right now um so that's like the immediate next step is mechanical electrical Plumbing which impacts a lot of the decision making that we're looking at here you know we need to be able to and civil um need to be able to incorporate all of that expertise into uh in in into the big picture and into the into the various different cost ideas and then really what um the design team is focusing on first is you know really rolling up the sleeves and trying to determine you know these big picture decisions because once we kind of say yes to them we have to beted out the cost and make sure that we can afford them um you if you say no to one you really can't come back and visit it later on you know the train train has moved through the station yeah so uh but overall um overall timeline wise it's basically uh um you know from from here until there's a little bit of an overlap once we get into the spring of 2025 um as far as design continuing while we're beginning to think about construction continuing but roughly it's um about an eight month I think overall duration N9 month overall duration from start to finish on the design process and that's broken up into schematic design kind of Milestone design development Milestone and then ultimately working on the the construction documents which I don't remember the exact timeline but I think that that's starting up basically January or so of 25 for construction for construction documents I I don't know yeah it's it's aggressive yeah so at some point in there we'll need to have some Public Access and discussion about this is what we're this is what we're doing I don't want people to wake up hey why are they tearing down totally and there there's a lot of public members with strong opinions about peace Plaza so it's important David during the um selection interviews we presented with a lot of different options to address the the real big issue the seismic have have you settled or has has a solution to the seismic been settled on uh at a at a big picture scale we're focusing on one strategy right now right out of the gate that we think will be the least expensive strategy and free up you know money for the other things like what I was just showing we did in a library we made really like early decisions that we're like let's make the cheapest decision with the things that people aren't really gonna feel yeah it's like okay yeah it's safe building so right now the uh in terms of seismic Solutions we will be we are trying to look at the scheme that add some concrete walls to the outside the outside of the building like we did on the library so you go over there you see those kind of black concrete walls that have the vines growing up them that we're going to need a few of those on this building that's that one component of it I think we are uh looking at retaining the structure out here in the courtyard the the roof structure so the big concrete the giant concrete beams and the big columns out here we're not really looking right now at taking all that out or anything um because the what was needed to kind of tie that in wasn't seeming two over the top um it's not like that's the thing isn't like the biggest um does that answer your question it does and then the other",

        "text": " Whether the gentlemen that do it today keep it or somebody else does it, it's now going to become quasi, you know, industrial. Right. So condition number five said 8ft. And when it's a vegetation, vegetation growing into 8ft, we didn't have any real objection to. We can start doing fences. I mean, if we do a vinyl fence that goes in, then, you know, we would like to do something that's 6ft. If we need to put it on top of a 1ft berm or something of that, try to push up the height a little bit. But it just, you know, it starts to get before we, before we want. I'd like to go ahead and have some public comment. Oh yeah, that's fine. I just was trying to say we need to figure out something that makes it work. I'm asking one quick question, Mister Curry. How many jobs are there now, David, and what's anticipated once it's in full operation? So there's about twelve now. They're looking to go to about 24. 24. Just out of curiosity, David, if we put the requirement to ten foot vegetation and you make sure that it's a solid berm, is that better for your client? I just want to make sure that a solid ten foot berm or. No, no, vegetative and vegetation, it's got to be something you can't see through. Yes. You agree? I don't have an objection to that. So you talk to them. If you do a heavy viburnum bush or something like that. Something heavy. And so, but I mean, the berm is the thing that's difficult to do because it just, it eats up property because it's such a, you know, I don't think that's necessary. I just think we need to have. It needs to be buffered for the long, you know, because for the long haul, we can't make it 10ft day one, it has to go in. But we don't mind maintaining. But you can give us a time frame. Frame. Okay. That it can be. I will have to consult somebody. I don't know. A little bit more of a landscape that five years, probably. Probably at five years of five years ago. Ten foot and it has grows pretty fast. Yeah. So is there something in the pud that if we approve? The reason why sometimes we don't like to do that, obviously, is because once we do that and then you tear out a bush or something happens to it or whatever else, and you can likely over the years get a big hole. And that's what happens to some of our buffers. Or when you're doing it residential, sometimes the people cut it down. Yeah, that's why we like to do the more permanent fencing and or concrete wall because then you can obviously tell or fix that. But is there something in the pud that will make sure that if we do get a complaint 20 years from now or whatever, that they do have to fix it? I mean, y'all put in the pud that the landscape. So it will be required into perpetuity. But it's not specifically written here. But it could be a condition that's written in. I would not see it. We'll make sure it's maintained for the long haul. Yes. Because if we don't make you put the concrete wall in, that does save a ton of money. But it does need to be maintained in perpetuity, right? Yes, sir. Okay, we could add that as a condition. All right, we're going to go ahead and take some public comment and then we'll come back and have further discussion. Discussion. Thank you. Okay, I have Joe Amadeo signed up. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Joe Amadeo. My family and I reside at 5241 and 5300 Northeast Jacksonville Road. My property buffers, Mister Barlow's property, south end, it runs for about 750 foot. I am not opposed to anything that you people can agree with, with Mister Barlow, as far as putting a buffer along my property, I'm fine with hedges, trees. The wall kind of is going to require quite a bit of maintenance over the years. And I know how cement walls and white fences are. They get moldy, they get green, and I'd rather look at trees or something along that border than a wall. So I'm in favor of whatever you guys can come up with on an agreement. I'm fine with that. Just happy to see the youth stay the same. Huh? Said you're just happy to see the youth stay the same. Exactly correct. Thank you. Thank you. Is there anyone, anyone else in the public who would like to speak? Mister Amadeo is the only one that I have signed up. Okay. At that point, we will close public comment. Mister Tillman. Yes, ma'am. What'd you come up with? We will. We will certainly plant the vegetation. What do we need to change the buffer? Why is the condition there? What was the question? We just need to change that condition from a b to. Yes, whatever. A heavily vegetative viburnum that within five years will grow to eight or ten foot, I guess the width. And. Has to be. It has to be. It has to completely, I would say do a double staggered hedgerow. Okay. That way it fills in. If we reduce the. So the biggest problem with these things is if you put a tree in there with them, then the canopy grows up, the trees start shading the viburnums out, and the viburnums can't survive. So if we're doing a straight hedge, we're doing a double staggered hedge to make sure that we're getting full growth. If one plant dies, the other one fills in behind it. So you wind up and then you replace the one that dies, but you wind up with something that's full and thick. But double staggered. Double staggered. If you give us to maintain it at 10ft, minimum would be what I'd like to see the language in and say, meet 8ft by five years. I would certainly think it'll be. They grow that fast anyway, and they're 2030 foot tall, but that's fine. So eight foot minimum maintained at ten foot in perpetuity. Double staggered hedgerow. Okay. And eight foot in five. In five years, yes. What's the width of that? It has to be a minimum. Was that 20 foot? Is that about the width of those two? Double staggered. We need to set that in the code or we just need to make sure it says double staggered. Ordinarily, a type b is 20ft with the addition of the wall. But if you wanted to put it at a 20 foot width minimum, we could do that. I was thinking it might not be that big. They don't get that. We had put down a ten foot. That's what we had on our plan. Yeah. They're bigger than ten foot together, but I have them at my house. It doesn't matter. So it's just double staggered, right? Yeah, double staggered. As long as they're double staggered and just say minimum. Ten. And what's the other thing that we said, though, that can't see through it. Right. Opaque. Creates an opaque screen. Yeah, creates an opaque screen. Eight foot minimum in five years. There you go. And for the western property line that was on the right of way, the type C buffer was type C. Okay. Agreed to type C. I think that was fine. Yes. And so the double stagger on the north, south and east property line. That's correct. What were we doing for the setback? Were we going to 50ft? I don't remember. What was the answer? Setbacks were staying where everything was per code. Whatever the standard code is. Fine. Okay. Right. For industrial property. So the condition that Mister Tillman's talking about is number three. All structures where paint work, body work or metal fabrication are taking place must be at a minimum 100ft from all property lines. Right. So we just want to change that to whatever's in the land development code. That's what we were talking about, I think. Well, if you look at his concept plan. Yeah, I'm not that. He's nothing. Look, I'm fine with you. Just change that to 50ft and then it fixes it. All right, 50ft is fine. What. What about. And the maximum number of building square footage is maybe 60,000. No. So we. Yes. No. Right. That doesn't include the existing building. So there was existing building. They put a maximum floor to area ratio of one that's higher than what we need. Right. We've got the existing building plus another proposed 60,000. And quite honestly, I asked for the extra two extra buildings that we're not building at this time, but we wanted room for growth that we didn't have to come back in and modify the pud. All right, so nothing. So what is that? 75,000, 100,000, something like that? I think it was. I think it was like 80, 85,000. But if you include the house, I mean, it may be a hair. Let's do 100,000 square foot. Okay. That's the limiting maximum. Yeah. And then, I mean, because that's a lot for that property. And most of what they need is outside storage, I think so. That takes care of everything, right? I believe so. So is that going to be strictly",

        "text": "it and I'm the government relations coordinator at the Oregon Department of energy we're really grateful that you've taken the time to join us here today to talk about the Oregon solar Plus Storage rebate program and some changes to that program that are coming in the near um I'm here today as sort of our moderator for the conversation and our plan is to discuss the program and um uh which offers rebates to residential customers and low-income service providers who install solar or solar impaired energy storage systems I want you to know this webinar webinar will be recorded I think someone will press record now or press record soon and I think you'll see a little message about that and then the slides and the recording will be posted to odo's website so that you can find it later or if you have to leave and come back for some reason you can catch what you might have missed we'll start our program today with introducing some of the other staff who work at the department of energy on this program or in general and we'll start with James who's actually leading today's conversation hi thanks Christy my name is James Coco I'm a policy analyst here at the Oregon Department of energy I work across several of the agencies incentive programs and increasing Energy Efficiency or the installation of renewable energy great thanks James and then I'd love to introduce our two program staff uh most of you on the line I imagine work on this particular program and these are the two people that you'll be most likely to talk to they're the ones who make our program run and take really good care of all of our customers so I just want to first introduce Dale and then Katie Dale go ahead and say hi sorry hi my name is Dale veering I am a solar rebate assistant hi my name is Katie Melton and I am with the solar and storage rebate program hey well we're really grateful to have our program team on the line as well as James to answer questions as we go and I think we can go to the next slide please in case you aren't familiar with our agency I wanted to start with just some brief energy or information about what we do at the Oregon Department of energy our agency helps oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable Energy System we advance solutions to shape and Equitable clean energy transition protect the environment and public health and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for future and current um on this slide you'll see our five broad areas of focus including energy programs and activities like the Oregon and stroller the solar and storage rebate Solage Plus Storage rebate so we can go on to the next slide please so I mentioned uh briefly our agenda earlier what we're going to cover today um specifically we're going to start with some Logistics after this and then James will provide an update on changes to the program from recent legislation and James will then give a quick overview of the administrative rulemaking process and then present the proposed administrative role Concepts that we'll be discussing today we really want to hear from you so um as we go through all of this just know that we're we're going to provide time for questions and comments and so there'll be a time for that at the end but I'm also happy to grab raised hands or questions and comments from the chat as we go so feel free to contribute at any point just we'll talk us in a second about how to raise your hand or use the chat but just feel free to use those two ways to get in the line and then I'll call on you as appropriate as soon as they can we can go on to the next slide so um just know that um the way WebEx organizes us is there's panelists and that's Odo staff today and then there's attendees that's the name that's the 19 folks that have joined us today to hear more about these administrative rule changes and again thanks for being here um just know that we have some Community agreements that we expect folks to take a look at and follow to the extent um we want you to just be respectful of others and to be ready and listen to listen and learn if you have any technical issues during the meeting you can please text chat Patricia Phillips and she is happy to take care of you and thank you so much for helping us behind the scenes today Patricia and with that we can go on to slide five um this is just a quick diagram of what we think you're probably seeing in front of you as the WebEx format it seems like it looks different on different people's ends sometimes but um we just want to make sure you know take a second right now to kind of look at how you can share your hand on my screen it looks like a little bit of a raised fist sitting side by side with the smiley face and some forms sometimes people see the smiley face and they kind of hover over it and then they get that raised fist that is a tiny raised hand I guess um so you can look for that now so you know how to raise your hands and then you should also be able to see a place to open up the chat and um and so if you have an open chat yet on mine right now I'm clicking it it looks like a little quote box at the bottom so make sure you open up your chat and um and then you can ask questions in there as well so take a second make sure that you know how this is going to work today and then um for those on the phone you can use star three to raise your hand and will unmute you and you can call on you and then we'll practice um us asking a question and then waiting in awkward silence to see if anybody has any anything they'd like to contribute so if you have any questions about using WebEx or having any issues and want to flag those for us I'm going to go ahead and count to 10 and see if anybody has any issues and I will move on all right I think we're good to go on to you James okay Christy um so quick summary of what happened uh in the 2023 legislative session uh related to this program House Bill 3409 extended the sunset of the Oregon solar Plus Storage rebate program and that is now extended to January 2nd 2029 the end of this intercession Bill also included an additional investment of 10 million dollars in the program there's also a tweak to some of the language that is used in the program uh the existing language in the organ laws required that a contractor purchase construct and install a paired solar and storage system together um I spell 3409 amended that language and requires that only the purchase need to occur at the same time and the installation may occur separately the solar electric system and the energy storage system still need to be paired once fully uh this change comes into effect at the start of 24 2024 uh before I move on are there any questions about um anything that happened at the legislative session related to the okay I'm talking on mute um I was just saying I don't see any hands raised and just a reminder for those on the phone you can press star three but it doesn't look like anyone has any questions in the legislation thanks games thanks um so now a quick high-level overview of the rulemaking process um so in the early stages right now information gathering um we start off with uh some stakeholder and consultation and after kind of gathering the information um and considering all the feedback uh we'll draft up some raw language and then file them with that draft language with the Secretary of State this kicks off another comment period during which we seek additional feedback on the rules and the draft rule language and it's an impact so the fiscal impact or uh some of the other impacts that will be listed on the the um rule proposal um form uh we review and consider all this information that we received during this comment period and then let me go move into finalizing the rules and then file those with the secretary of state and only then once they're filed to the Secretary of State final rules do they become effective um so this process can take a varying length of time um and for this rulemaking we anticipated taking approximately about four to six months but that might change depending on um what we're hearing from stakeholders so uh we're posing a few changes to the program rules um starting with one of the ones I just kind of mentioned uh during the legislative session uh we're proposing changing the definition of paired solar and storage system uh to align with those recent legislative changes so this will require only the purchase of a paired solar and storage system to occur at the same time the installation may be done separately afterwards um we heard that there were delays associated with the shipping and installation of storage and want to hear whether they're still occurring and which of the options I'm going to go through in a moment would be the most effective at reducing the impact of those delays um within kind of what we can do with the program and how the program runs um so the options being considered uh include uh permitting the solar incentive portion of the rebate to be claimed separately from the storage portion uh following the installation of the solar system and proof that it's all all complete um this would include passing any inspections from The Authority having um it would also mean we'd have to tweak to how rebates are processed in power clerk the software the contractors use to replace uh to place the reservation um another option would be to extend the time that a reservation for pads solar and storage is valid for this would allow more time for the storage to be and a third option could be to increase the number of reservations that a contractor can have at a time first systems for residential customers who are not uh lower or moderate income uh this could allow contact to have reservations waiting for that installation storage to the storage to be installed while having a greater capacity to complete other projects um at the same time are there any uh questions on this potential oil change let's give it a moment when we wait to see if anybody puts their hand up or has anything to say in the chat I'm just kind of asked for a clarifying question but I know the answer to just to make sure everyone's clear so we're trying to figure out different ways that we can make the new statute work right we want to hear from contractors their thoughts on how would be best for this to work whether that's splitting payments so if solar goes in first but storage goes",

        "text": " the way that we got to the scenario net benefit cost calculation is is adding up each of the actions net cost net benefit net right and so this that is that's the sum of this all this so we have this data we just haven't put it in the right format yet yeah this product will be coming soon okay perfect thank you any other questions about the model assumptions how the model works one of the elements of the model that I'm uh excited about is is the fact that it's built from the counties up and so I think as we are able to look more at you know the pluses and minuses of different policies um in you know different parts of Oregon you know that will help us think about how to uh design programs to have the best benefits over the state overall yeah Chris can do you have that presentation up so you can pull up either the the health benefits or the jobs one with the two graph spatial graphs for the state that like Kathy said it does get built up each County and then aggregated to get to the state total so from a legislative standpoint it's also really nice because you can tell what's happening in your particular in your particular part of the county um I will add Chris is kind of find urban part of the state um we'll add that one of the benefits of doing that and when we look at it when Chris pulls us up you'll see that those benefits are spread across the state and it's not just one it's like the last two slides Chris uh so it's yeah it's this one I think right jobs get created all over the uh pull up the jobs one it's the last one I think that's fun all the way down the bottom this one yeah so you see the all the different uh Counties have different uh employment per capita increases and uh in particular and the electrification when East Side gets higher job impacts than does uh the west side but and the health benefits are similar where although as you would think if it's pollution reductions creating health benefit where the most pollution is gets the most greatest benefit so that's the Portland metro area if you go two slides up Chris he's there do I have a leg Yeah you must have a wagon yeah but all right so you see that Washington and Multnomah County have the most benefits because they have the most pollution so they get the most most decrease in in criteria pollutants which create more health benefits and the least amount of pollution of course is on the east side so there's less change that will occur but it's kind of nice to be able to see this aggregated or disaggregated down to the county level um well hearing no more questions so maybe I'll be quiet but just 60 seconds in case there is another oh question yes okay some reason this program doesn't show me the question so I think they just raised their hand but Laura has a question hi hi Laura yeah I forgot to say my name before large paper um with the nature conservancy I'm just trying to make sure I understand how the cost estimates and that cost benefit analysis work for specific measures given how you've modeled the CPP in HP 2021 so for example if if the TPP modeling is done by reducing the emissions intensity of natural gas does that then affect the benefits that you're getting from electrification measures would be one example but more generally just trying to understand how those broad brush pieces affect the cost benefit for the incremental measures sure so here if you bear with me here um so for example and this kind of aggregated up but I know like so underneath residential uh buildings you know one of the actions um is like building retrofits and so for that building retrofit action there's a cost associated with the retrofits so that uh and there's some well there's costs associated with anything but it you know that there's a benefit from energy energy reduced energy energy costs so you're saving energy and um I can't there's a there's a slight change in in operations maintenance but mainly the two for like a home retrofitters the capital cost for retrofitting that building and the Energy savings uh on on that retrofit so for that action um you know based on the schedule of retrofits that that we that we do there will be a capsule cost each year for those number of retrofits and then there will be a cumulative Savings of those of those Energy savings for each of those buildings uh you know over time across the years so um so for each action we'll have something similar to that that's just kind of the one example um so so anything that would that fell in within the CPP we didn't uh we didn't do any processing for it but for these kind of actions that fell outside of like things like CPP and HP 20 China and we did do some we did take the costume for and also the numbers that you're that you're seeing there this did that answer your question I think the other part of it is that that the benefits that we're seeing in the new actions reflect the fact that our assumption is that the um that the utilities will meet House Bill 2021 and regulated entities will will meet the intensity is going down through time and so that that affects the size of that wedge right through 2030 for instance right another way to think about this Laura is that EVS is a good example how does that interplay with the clean fuels program where the carbon intensity fuels is reducing over time so uh Chris mentioned at the very beginning that the order that you put these things in matters so um for instance we put in the clean fuels program in first and it lowers the carbon intensity of of gasoline so when you replace an ice vehicle with an EV down the road it saves it reduces less uh it creates less reduction in greenhouse gas emissions because of the carbon intensity has already been reduced so over time a new EV isn't static it keeps it the the last increment of EVS reduces a lot less greenhouse gas emissions than does the first increment because of the way the model interacts with itself Laura did that nope probably just confused her more all right all right are you great thank you well then uh if somebody does have a comment well I'm trying to wrap up uh feel free to to jump back in and we'll try and take it um so as I mentioned at the top of the meeting uh we are hoping to planning to um get notice out of our next meeting which will probably be late the week of the the October 3rd I believe or fourth third uh and we'll get that notice we will be focusing in on uh co-benefits at that meeting and there'll be a bit of a homework assignment for Commissioners but also you know the public can weigh in as well uh with any thoughts that you have we'll have a public uh we'll have time for public comment at the meeting um as well as take written comments in and then the next meeting we're planning late October early in November uh probably more the latter uh and that's when we'll really dig in and start to talk through what does the commission want to recommend is it one of the two scenarios or some blending of the of the two scenarios and and how to how we're going to kind of make those decisions and and Advance this work so um my assumption is that we made two meetings to get to the bottom of all of that maybe not so we'll go ahead and schedule out enough meetings so that we can get this all wrapped up uh and ready for uh production and mid-December and that way it'll be available to the legislature at the either in December at the beginning of the new year so that's the plan going forward uh and welcome comments from the public anytime you can submit those for the instructions on our website and we distribute those to the Commissioners in advance of the meeting so everybody gets a chance to see what you are all thinking about and wondering about so this year we will have two separate but somewhat connected reports that will go to the legislature the roadmap will be its own report and then we'll do the regular report that we do for the legislature uh to report on where our admissions are today comment on that and um and there'll be kind of a cross-reference in the in the two reports about each other so that it's clear that both of these should be considered so that's our plan moving Zach anything else from your end in terms of things that we need the Commissioners and the public to know oh thanks chair McDonalds you covered it great well uh with that seeing no more that I will recall the September 15th Oregon global warming commission to a close and uh do keep an eye out for press release um early next week on our next meeting and I will we'll be hoping to have all the materials posted as soon as possible um but uh likely Tuesday or Wednesday next week thanks again for your time and if you have follow-on questions that you want to ask feel free to send them to Zach and I and we can forward those to our excellent team of folks that are been helping us with this great work thank you for the questions everybody appreciate it thank you Chris and team great job bye y'all thanks everybody bye-bye thank",

        "text": " just for clarification yes we are in rule making related to contested cases it is limited to new applications however that will also feed into the subsequent rule making on amendments where that will be one of the things we look at and you know what our information comes out of the contest in case rulemaking certainly can be applied there are obviously some nuances that have been discussed today regarding the availability and thresholds for contested cases and amendments but those will also be evaluated in that Amendment thank you okay is there anyone else present that's interested in making public comment I don't see anyone and then um also is there anyone on the webinar or on the phone um at this time I do not see anyone with their hand raised but let me just remind anyone on the web how they can participate so if you're on the webpage the webinar you're gonna at the bottom of the right main window is a set of icons click on the participants window the bottom right hand of the participant window is a hand icon just click on that hand and that will raise your hand and when you're finished speaking go ahead and click it again and that will lower your hand if you are participating by the phone press star 3 on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and again when you're done speaking press star 3 again to lower your hand and at this time I do not see any hands raised Vice chair house let's give another 30 seconds or so and see if anybody is scrambling trying to get it to work okay it looks like no more additional public comments so we'll move on to the next item which is the obsidian solar center Amendment one this is an information item we've got Kathleen Sloan senior siting analyst to present an overview of the approved 400 megawatt alternating current solar will take energy facilities and the changes proposed in the request for Amendment mislona jury thank you Vice chair Howe for the record my name is Kathleen Sloan as stated earlier I am a senior citing analyst for the Department of energy I'm going to try to share my screen all that techie all right so for this agenda item this is an information item for Council it is to cover the council review of the draft proposed order and the public comments received on the record for the obsidian solar center request for Amendment one so just as an overview for the agenda I will give you a basic overview of the facility the components and the memory requests I'll also go into a summary of the draft proposed order with the focus on the condition language that actually changed from the original site certificate as far as recommendations um we'll also do an overview of the public comments received both during the public hearing which was held in Christmas Valley on August 24th and also in through the comment border or email written comments received on the record during that public comment period and then it will go to council for discussion and deliberation there's no decision or action required at this time but Council may have the opportunity to ask questions make recommendations for changes to be incorporated into a proposed order or you can just advise us to prepare the proposed order but we will prepare a proposed order and issue that proposed order based upon council's review today so just really quickly overview of the approved facility Council approved the site certificate on February 25th at 2022 the certificate holders obsidian solar Center LLC which is a wholly owned subsidiary of obsidian Renewables LLC the approved facility is for 400 megawatts of solar 50 megawatts of battery storage related and supporting facilities and the approved site boundaries 3921 Acres it's located in Lake County about eight miles Northwest of Christmas so that map there is the approved the solar center request for Amendment the purpose of the the amendment request is to add this 169 Acres additional acres to the site boundary so that the certificate holder has the ability to construct and inner tie to either the BPA line which is on the side of the proposed amended area versus what has already been approved which was to allow for an inner tie to the PGE they want to construct one GSU substation within that area they will also be increasing the voltage of the transmission line from 115 kilovolts to 138 similarly the collection system from 34.5 to 138 and some modifications in the uh length of the transmission line and the collector lines particularly how much was above ground versus below so this map shows you the requested amended site boundary on the left hand side of the map you're going to see the orange cross-hatched area which is I think I could use my low pointer right in here that's the amended 169 Acre Site boundary within that is this 84 Acres which is in pink that is the proposed microciting area but the certificate holder did want some flexibility on where to cite those components within that pink area so just a refresher scope of council review for amendments this is adding a new area to the site boundary so it is a requirement that approved that all the applicable laws and standards for the original site certificate um can that the amendment can comply with all of those conditions and then also and meet those standards and then also that the bond or letter of credit is adequate for the changes proposed in the Amendments um of course all of the draft proposed order is open for comment by Council um we can talk about any of these standards but I am going to try to focus this presentation on the standards where we actually recommended a change in condition language or an additional or new condition So based upon our review of the request for Amendment we prepared the draft proposed order and in that draft proposed order we did not make any recommendations for substantive changes or condition language changes for any of these standards that are listed on this slide again we can talk about any of these if you want but I'm not going to cover them in my presentation because we're not recommending any substantive change or new language for conditions so the standards that we are going to focus on today are the ones that we actually did either make a change in recommended condition language or a new condition recommendation and so these are the standards listed here and my next few slides are going to focus specifically on the proposed change or new recommended language and Council will also be able to take a look at the red line that we have prepared in the draft site certificate for each of these so the first one is the general standards of review basically because the uh RFA a request for amendment is asking to change the transmission line Corridor it's actually requires a change in general standard condition nine to allow for that change from 115 KV to that 138 and so in our recommended amended condition 9 under General standards of review we have provided a red line that basically reflects that change that upgrade from 115 KV the change in the extent of the corridor and also that additional point of inner tie with the addition of area e so just just Council have any comments or questions at this time okay we got to move on so the next standard where we proposed either new or revised condition language is organizational expertise um one was to reflect that the change in the just the structure of the facility as far as the increase in the kilovolts of The Collector lines and the inner tie we ensure that the certificate holder has retained qualified Personnel to do that work and again it's reflected in the the new recommended conditions which is six seven and eight which also speak to that issue of qualifications and making sure that the staff professionals contractors construction managers meet those qualifications for this upgraded so the first is a recommended amended condition because there is an existing condition too that does speak to this uh additional requirements for both the qualifications and the information provided prior to construction for the construction manager and the on-site manager a little more specificity particularly requiring that 72-hour notification if there is a change so this is our recommended amended language for that condition oh go ahead Council Condon Vice chair um thank you a question related to the statement or that assurance that the construction manager has experience in managing permit and Regulatory Compliance requirements and is qualified to manage a utility scale solar facility what is it that we're looking for I think that it's really about looking to see that it is that again it's it's to make sure that the certificate holder has the professional capacity to manage such a robust project like I think it's looking at what we asked what it said for before was that the construction contractors be able to to be qualified to manage a project but what we've learned is that there are the certificate holder does retain these on-site project managers construction managers and that these people really need those similar qualifications because they have to oversee the work of the contractors and I think that was something that we've just learned along the way I mean thank you I'll just add kind of related to my my comment and then the secretary gave the report with respect to the organizational expertise is that it's that this digging down that I I'd like to know more about is what's expected from what if an applicant provides information how are we assessing it so thank you okay thank you chair how councilor Beyer and as you're getting to the next conditions just thank you for adding additional conditions regarding project management throughout the life of the project I think we focus so much on construction but knowing that there is someone on site who's responsible for ensuring compliance with um the order and the conditions of approval is really important and I'd like that specificity so carrying it forward to other proposed projects I think is a good idea and and tightening up the conditions as counselor Condon mentioned as we get more experience so I think this is a step in the right direction so thanks thank you so we do have three new recommended conditions in that regard and really they are tied to the phase of the facility as council member fire mentioned one of the things I've learned is that oftentimes the the certificate holders team shifts from construction to operation so having those two broken out I think is helpful again reinforcing that they have demonstrated qualifications and expertise to do the work that needs to be done and having someone on site that really is uh or on on board that is really responsible for for tracking and managing those site certificate conditions whether it be in construction or during the operations of the facility in the long term so the next standard is the land use I think Council will remember that the question that came up over the addition of the 169 Acres",

        "text": " the mayor mentioned counselor Barney is going to be released it sounds like different points and conditions are beginning with no haven't heard so I heard that she was appointed for me so I thought oh that's interesting and then I stopped for like yeah I'm not sure I have not heard anyone um it might be a little different use cases you know counselors could be at home watching this right now to do and that would be okay part of the record um but I'm not I'm not sure I do know that the mayor is interested in boards and commissions generally looking at what their roles are we have the right working commissions we have too many maybe I know we have some that I feel like they don't really know like the purpose that they were created for um could different roles it seems that the council are going to be given towards and commissions the goal of these to start this year so there may be because I think because your goal has never been done did you want to say anything about the two deputies um sure there's so many changes that start to you know I don't think um yeah so the so we've been sitting last fall um so he's made some organizational and he's decided that based on the size of our city that he really needs two Deputy city managers HR department head um this is Deputy city manager and she's in charge of all the internal and City operations facilities all those people um and then he's recruiting for another deputy singing Center as part of that creating this thing in the Department of Community Deputy manager would run for I call them fun things but I call them like community services at like a community or do things the library center 50 plus products rank that kind fun things happy things which actually used to be an apartment before the recession of the entire department there's your problems yeah so um that recruitment is underway so to fund that position Norman Wright who was our director of Community Development left and set up on that position they took they took his position and turned it into that new um and so they can find Community Development with Urban Development Urban Development as a director of Christian Rockefeller so she's now thank you thank you what administrative staff so there's and then there's just kind of the where people sit is also very jumbled right now because the building they're almost done Urban Development is downtown but obviously no invest somewhere up here she's also in terms of the Housing Authority um this building's going to be remodeled right with the so there's just a lot of change other questions for Lisa and we'll move on to comments for the good of the articles thank you in the state of the city speech which is calling in at the beginning uh I guess on Wednesday March 22nd um from 11AM lunch at 11 30. presentation begins it's at the center Convention Center uh site foreign or something but you don't have to be you don't have to buy one should be um but if you don't very much you sit in the bathroom the event is co-sponsored by Rotary Club the Salem City Club and the Chamber of Commerce this year the Chamber of Commerce has the lead but thank you so in December I had opportunity to participate in a workshop that was sponsored by the department of U.S energy and the landscape program at the University of Oregon and the issue there was the realization that as we moved from apartment-based fuels to removal Fields the actual physical footsteps that is going to be required in order to meet our energy needs this might be significantly significantly larger uh than what it currently is and so the US Department of energy is really working Partners to try and expand the placement of renewable energy infrastructure improving areas it's the project that I participated in was bringing designers planners together to think about you know in these four kind of urban type schools et cetera how can we integrate renewable energy into those so it's kind of a brainstorming Workshop what I left with was the recognition that in order to meet my removal energy levels we're going to have to really maximize sides the use of land efficiency here in our Urban environment so that in Salem and as we look about it and see these huge asphalt parking lots as we look at roofs and warehouses and all these other structures we really need to be looking at those as potential renewable energy opportunities and to think more about that so that that's an issue I hope to bring back here soon because I think that it fits well within the purview of the landing Department Planning Commission and look at advisability Council on how we manage growth so I just wanted to find that for people thanks for sharing that article yeah Michael in this discussion was there anything about designer planning requirements related to solar energy relationship developments or or buildings actually of any implementation of some requirements that there be a certain orientation or does it mean that there be some sort of accommodation for the ability to install so yeah you know I'm looking into this and personally so I'm sure has some answers as well I've been involved in a couple smaller projects going in my own house which is installed solar we were able to install it at an east facing Direction which was surprising to me um and actually because of our sunny days we've actually produced more power than we used in my house on an east-based Direction which is kind of exciting at least fewer because we get a lot for it the the one issue that came up that I learned and I think this is one of the reasons I like to explore more is that we had to have about maybe two thousand dollars worth of structural work done in order to manage the wind loads of those on the roof and stuff that we use that they're the only company they know of that will take a client that needs to have structural work done on their roof because there's such demand that they can just go to the easier houses uh my house is in 1955 in a ranch and there's a lot of housing stock but that's a that is that age and older and so if that's the criteria what's happening in the marketplace we're gonna have a real tough time meeting some of our you know the solar demands and requirements so that was just one thing that I experienced um I know and maybe Lisa wants it correctly but I don't think the city has done any sort of comprehensive review of its own policies in terms of what is it could facilitate or was inhibiting solar uh the company that installed by said oh you know it's really too bad we have these requirements we never had went to vets it's probably worth looking into it I think that's one of the things that we as a commission can do I understand that I support that I thought early on one of the things that we might look at whether or not there are should be any requirements or any provisions in our in our codes in buildings both residential commercial would facility or help facility it used to be that I would see as a huge developments which if you looked at me wrong already reached it was but for a position of our son it wasn't very good for solar there is new technology where your solar panels can move Etc but um I would I'd support kind of going in that direction is something to at some point consider seeing what the impact whether we are facilitating there's a way to facilitate it when there's something that's inhibiting new construction the opportunities a requirement anyway I kind of could support it with Michael's yeah good comments good discussion any other kind of attention to the good of water it's not we're adjourned",

time please save your questions for the Q&amp;A periods or if you have something that needs immediate attention use the chat feature and publicly send the message Chat to everyone so we can all see it we are recording this session to later post on the AO website for your review uh let's see in the next slide here yeah it didn't move there we go here's the agenda we're going to be talking about today it's kind of a small to look at but you can see we're going to go right into base code reach code Federal funding some Moto incentives brief coverage of that and then Blake will take us home with building performance standards so with that I'd like to welcome building code division Mark Heiser and Kelly Thomas to lead off the today are you ready to go Mark yes I am Roger hello everyone Mark Heiser with building codes division would like to start with yes some updates on the energy codes the the 2024 Oregon Energy Efficiency specialty code also known as chapter 13 of the building code uh was approved by the construction industry energy board on um actually of 2023 I don't know why am we're doing some time travel today and I've gone ahead to improve it next year um and we do anticipate we're hoping that and the original intent was to get an effective date of January 1st with a six-month phase in um with a real making Hearing in very shortly next month to be announced soon um but based on not just the federal determination but primarily it looks like based on com check availability uh this may extend to probably an April 1st deadline with a six-month phase in um they're the folks at us doe pnnl are working on a still I believe in beta testing of a new look for com Che an interactive version which should be quite helpful for everyone um just as a little background on com um it will be online and there will be the ability to have a single file that multiple trades can work on so you can have your architect working on the envelope portion you can have the mechanical designer or contractor doing the mechanical portion you can have a lighting designer doing the lighting portion um even plumbers and whatnot for some of the remaining parts so that less need to do with to go with what we would um deferred submitt for some of the uh compliance pieces so not waiting for you an easier way to make sure everything is working together especially now that the additional CR efficiency credits are coming in to um you really if you have a Target set of number of credits then you need to make sure that um if the mechanical contractor is going to do something with higher efficiency equipment they know that they're going to do it and they sign off that they're going to be part of this but as this comes forward there um waiting to see how it's going going to look to see what additional forms we have to come up with in the state to make sure that people can turn in the right information and show that they're going to comply so um we're hoping that they'll have things ready in December that we can look at it quickly and maybe have things ready for January 1 but um based on latest info might be a delay so uh sorry we can't give an exact on that for the commercial but we're still holding out hope to get started early next year next slide I believe we have a one and on the 2023 residential code the effective date was October 1st with a six-month phase in Period so starting April 1st of next year um all any homes going in for permit April 1st or later will need to be using the 2023 code can apologies for some of the delay working with the ICC folks on getting them the document published but we do have available summaries of the changes there's plenty of good it is available on the BCD residential program page site it can give you you can pretty much see all of the changes that are coming forward in 2023 residential code um uh if you have questions about what's coming up in the code you can contact any of us in the policy and Technical Services Group we can try and get your questions answered the administrative portion in chapter one is already in effect but that just helps clarify um some of where codes are applicable and items about fences and swimming pools and like that have been cleaned up so um that is it for the code updates on the Baseline code um should we go for questions now people have questions on on the codes yeah let's split this up any questions about base codes for Mark or Kelly a miraculous job Mark no questions s all right moving ahead so curious I got a question on the updated uh com check that's going to happen so is that all going to be ran through a permit number or is that going to be ran through the architect or who's going to be the central base of that if it's going to be an interactive and who's going to set that up to start off a project well we're waiting to see the final on this we believe that there will a signature sort of a master signature but also a signature for envelope a signature for mechanical a signature for electrical you'll have how they're making sure that this can be interactive and shared um it's still in beta phase and we're hoping to see what's going to happen with that but it should be that people will be designated to be able to sign in and let's say you're the mechanical you can do the mechanical portion and then hopefully if it's not available we'll be looking to have you know who's the designer who's signing off on the mechanical portion who's signing off on lighting and the other people pieces okay does that help some yeah that helps some yeah we're just waiting to see what the final product will look like and you know hopefully have a little time next month to run it through some um run it through its Paces we did participate in some of the early beta testing and gave some feedback on it but haven't heard much then they're they're quite busy at pnnl finishing up a lot of uh different versions of com Che all right sounds good thanks all right I don't see any other questions mark let's move along to wow reach wow a sneeze I know a lot of people are allergic to reach codes so I'll be quick on this one um so on the updates with the commercial code having been really oped the information is out there um you know as we're requesting feedback people thinking about making proposals on this um what the base code is going to be is available so looking for you know be thinking about what you would want to see um in a reach code for the commercial side you know the the official clock isn't ticking but this is the time to start you you know what's there start looking at what you might want to have for ideas is it doing more with just additional efficiency measures um is it just uh what what would targets be if you're doing a um modeling performance and we could even talk about at some point there might be a commercial one for um what's it building performance um Target so um really getting people to start thinking about the commercial side now we know it's 90.1 2022 it's out there available the oesc modifications are available there's um so how to look at you know a 5 to 10% increase in performance could be done either just strictly through propo uh performance or uh other ways of looking at the additional measures on the residential side okay this is probably our bigger thing to discuss today um the sort of rough draft the draft package was released on the 19th we set this up to look at three possible ways of doing the residential reach code side there is a prescriptive path um looking at based on what was done for and modeling for the last reach code now that we have and and also looking at um having some discussions of saying well is there something that could potentially be a um package packages within the prescriptive path versus doing strictly you know addition extra additional measures something that might align with some of the ETO incentives that were out there of course now that we have an ER path in the code looking at what would be that Target performance factor for under an ER paths which is really codified hers ratings for buildings that's one of the quote sort of performance slm modeling paths and the last one that we included was looking at the use of the energy star version 3.2 revision 12 it becomes the official energy star path for incentive starting January anary 1st of 2025 but could be the um incentive path starting now for the state of Oregon um for those of you looking for that $2,500 for energy star uh Builder funds it's going to be the current I'm trying to remember what the number is re revision but um I think it's 3.11 or something like that that will still be available for single family homes December 31st of the coming year so if the construction is completed by the by December 31st you can still get incent of money under the other path but for the reach code we're looking at doing version 3.2 revision 12 which is really looking at that's going to be continuous insulation probably looking at a few additional pieces but it does align with some really um good incentives at the federal level that might also align with if you're going that path and getting some of the incentives the reach code comment deadline is Monday December 18th one thing that we have looked to set up is a and is set up for December 7th is sort of another Oregon energy uh stakeholder panel discussion to get every people together who would like to discuss potential submitt ahead of time ones that might be where you brought into um the O RC package ways to look at um getting feedback on well should we just be prescriptive only should the reach code only be Rath should it only be energy star version 3.2 um this is to get additional feedback from the public before the comment deadline ends on December 18th we'd really love to get more uh feedback from the public what's what are people looking to see we want to make sure that we've got we're looking at affordability looking at um",

        "text": " scenic resource and those impacts cannot be avoided council must require the applicant to implement appropriate mitigation to reduce those impacts let's see so the applicant evaluated the potential impacts from construction and operation to scenic resources identified as significant or important and out of that analysis they identified two scenic resources that the department has felt could have a visual the facility could potential visual impacts and so those two were more closely evaluated so the first site i've already mentioned it's the echo meadow site for the oregon national trail basically they proposed uec transmission line would be would be visible or partially visible from portions of that site however the blm has reviewed the information and has noted that the visual impacts would not be significant and that the methods used to evaluate it are consistent with their own the other resource would be the umatilla the rumatilla river is based upon distance over five miles from the views of the wind turbines and as a result would not those turbines would not prominently be featured in the view shed for these reasons the department has not identified a significant impact to scenic resources and we found the applicant's evaluation to be adequate and we do not recommend any mitigation because we found no significant impact so then next is there any questions next section okay i'm going to move on to oh i wanted to show you the photo simulation that was submitted as part of the applicant's analysis so it is a simulated image on the top that just shows from from the location within the echo meadow see those little toothpicks that would be the visual impact of an upgraded uec line there's an existing line there so the next standard for review is council's historic cultural and archaeological resource standard so this standard is intended to protect the public interest in preserving historic cultural and archaeological resources including sites listed on or likely eligible for the national register of historic places under this standard council must find that the applicant has conducted appropriate surveys at the proposed site to identify historic cultural or archaeological if the project involves construction that would affect an archaeological site the applicant would re would need to get a state permit from the state historic preservation office um to impact that site or do any work within a site if previously unidentified sites or objects are discovered during we have a condition that requires the implementation of an inadvertent discovery plan which will lay out the protocols to be um to protect those resources so the applicant conducted uh numerous oops excuse me yes a chair grill this is very chalky go ahead perry kate was the um affiliated tribes notified or consulted yes i'm gonna tell you what we did okay thank you so um as part of the review that the applicant did they conducted a number of surveys inventories archival research they consulted with the shippo and they also went to what i think should be a knowledge is to they took extra steps to work with the confederate tribes of the umatilla indian reservation um ctuir is the affiliated tribe for this area confederate tribes of warm springs deferred to umatilla for the cultural resources work on this project the applicant engaged the ctu-r early and consistently and actually worked with them to complete traditional use studies of the facility they participated in the field inventory and as part of the archaeological survey work that was done and one of the outcomes of that is that they identified 29 sites that ctuir has identified as historic properties of religious and cultural significance to and they have also entered into a confidential mitigation agreement with the applicant for this proposed the department received a letter from the chair of the ctuir on this project in which they clearly state that they have participated in all of the consultation with the applicant and the studies and that all of their concerns if any on historic cultural or traditional properties have been mitigated through this confidential mitigation agreement so um to answer your question perry uh ctu-ir has been very involved and has actively worked with the applicant and tetra tech in what came out of that in the traditional youth studies so i don't know if you have any more questions but i can entertain them no i'm okay thank you for the information okay okay you're welcome thank you for the so the department has made a couple of recommendat recommended conditions just to make sure that the um representations in the application are are you know codified in a condition all known sites where possible will be by the 50-foot avoidance buffer additional surveys will be completed as recommended by shippo to true up the final design i also wanted to point out that they did work with shippo on the historic resources component the built environment and through those consultations between odo and the applicant they completed an initial historic properties inventory out of that discussion they identified the shippo identified that there were potential visual impacts on some historic properties historic and through a course of negotiating how we were going to deal with those potential impacts the applicant prepared and shippo concurred with the historic resources management plan that is going to be implemented and part of that of that plan is the intensive documentation of these historic so as part of mitigation for built that intensive documentation the generation of that additional information on those structures was considered adequate mitigation by shippo shippo has concurred on the built shippo has agreed that the surveys and the findings to date are adequate however they are also wanting to see the final results of the final inventory based on the final does anybody have any more questions under cultural so the last standard i'm going to review for today before kicking it over to is recreation so under the standard council needs to decide whether the construction or operation of a proposed facility would adversely affect an important recreational at the site or in the surrounding area the council reviews and considers comments from the local community management agencies and local land use authorities when evaluating the importance of a recreational opportunity and if council finds that the signif that there are significant adverse council may impose conditions to the site certificate to reduce that impact or require the applicant to develop an alternate recreational opportunity in the area in their review in the application the applicant identified a number of potential recreational opportunities three of them are ones that um the council found of new one again is the echo meadow site there's also two other sites associated with the oregon national trail one is the coral springs viewing site which is located on private property and the other one is port henrietta park which is an area that apparently has an oregon national historic trail component again the only recreational resource that we found that could be impacted by the proposed was the potential noise associated with the construction upgrade to the uec transmission line if that route is selected once again that site is over 1500 feet from that site um and goal of the condition under this recreation is protected oh okay we we impose the condition for protected but it also covers the potential impact under recreation um and that is to notify blm allow them to put up notice to the public and also implements a reporting response program if there were to be a complaint of construction related noise um during the upgrade of that uec line and i do want to point out that's only if that usc uec line is selected because they have two it was just showing the the visual there were no other impacts to the other relate recreational um identified in the dpo and in the application so at this point we're going to turn it over to kellen who is going to present on the remainder of the dpo starting with public services i think sarah's gonna pass her the okay uh testing testing can you hear me yes we can thank you thank you um let me get my video up here folks good afternoon uh madam chair and vice chair howe members of the council i know it is on a late friday afternoon it's been a long day but we are almost there we're going to get through this and it's going to be interesting and amazing but we are almost up one moment while i get this all tuned up here alrighty do you see my public services could i get a council member just to do an audio check to make sure that if you have questions that you'll be able that i can hear you this is chair grail we can hear you okay that's wonderful um uh same uh for the record kellen tardy weather senior sighting analyst oregon department of energy i'm helped kate with the dpo and helping out with the presentation here because it's a big haul um lots to go over uh as sarah mentioned kate mentioned um and is consistent with all of our slides there's a lot of content and we're trying to really boil it down to things that maybe are interesting or like interesting issues or facility components um under each applicable standard however if there is anything else that council has like flagged in their review of the dpo that's not part of my presentation just jump in and ask um i'm i'm gonna try to move pretty quickly because i know um we're just trying to be mindful of time um and i can see you but everybody's really small so just jump in and cut me off because i can't see body um so i'm going to start with the public services standard council's public services standard requires um an of potential significant adverse impacts to private and public service providers i'm going to my next slide i'm going to go over um the uh the providers that are evaluated underneath the standard however um the applicant underneath the standard and in the application make several assumptions um to to do the evaluation under public services um and one of them is the construction duration which they say may be up to two years but um in the general standard overview the department recommends a condition there that is very typical for other energy facilities allotting three years for the applicant to begin construction and then three years after construction begins to finish construction however this is the assumption that's applied to the public services standard uh the facility may be built out in phases so maybe by facility component or by area or a section um and then under public services like in a lot of i think public services more so than well same as other standards as we look at some at the maximum in impacts what are the maximum amount of people that are going to be on site working and the applicant represents that the maximum amount of people could be 500 people on site at one time um or in one one period usually during peak construction which is during the summer um they also estimate that about 30 percent of those uh of",

        "text": "um my name is Thomas Jackman and I am the energy facility setting council's uh rules coordinator and today we'll be discussing the uh council's contested case rulemaking the as I said this meeting is recorded and it is intended primarily for rack members uh who are part of this rules advisory committee let me actually just share my presentation here I guess you don't need to see this just yet but might as well there we go so uh yeah it's intended primarily for rack numbers uh but members of the public are welcome to attend this is considered a public meeting uh there will be a short time at the end for public comments um but please remember that uh you will have as members of the public multiple opportunities to comment on this process before any proposed rules uh become final most importantly during the public comment period uh after proposals are first submitted to the Secretary of State so uh let's get into it um we'll do introduction in just a second but I wanted to just discuss the agenda here so first we're going to do introductions uh then I'm going to do a little just a brief overview of the rulemaking and a contested case process uh uh uh both just so we're kind of all have a little bit of background information if you're not super familiar with either of these processes I'm going to have a little opportunity for questions and comments that people have about just Basics uh nothing real substantive there I'm then going to give a brief uh introduction about the purpose and reason for this rulemaking as you'll see it's the scope is pretty broad so it won't take long to to go over that um then there's going to be uh uh kind of the bulk and the purpose of today's meeting is going to be an open discussion for comments and suggestions from each of the rock members on key issues and areas of concern that the rack wishes to see as part of this contested case rulemaking obviously we're not gonna be able to make everybody happy but uh if you have some great ideas we want to hear from them uh hear from you about them uh then there'll be a very short period at the end if there's any uh members of the public who are here who have uh desire to to make a comment um there should be about 10 minutes uh at the end hopefully and then we'll we will discuss next steps a lot of times my these Rock meetings are like three hours I decided to do this one a little bit shorter I find that the longer ones uh people tend to kind of Fade Out I certainly do it's tough to meet for three hours on something um that being said if this one if we really have a lot of you know great ideas and it's really you know we feel like we're short on time we might go back to three hours for the next rack um and I'm kind of open to the to the members to see what they think so without further Ado I thought I the introductions is always a little awkward because uh in these teams meetings because I can't point and look at people um so I just kind of listed out the the rack members um by who you represent and I just thought uh just start down the list so you can see where you are here it started with reciprocore if you if you represent that uh particular constituent if you could please uh unmute yourself and kind of let the group know who you are and if there's more than one of you that's fine um go ahead and both speak up and then you know just go down this list here now this John anello from Pacific Corps um I'm in here for my manager Bryce Foster who unfortunately couldn't attend but we're in the project management group and we deal a lot with uh these kind of issues so we'll be representing the company great thanks in anybody else from Pacific core here today John okay I didn't see any names I recognized okay all right Don what about Northwest uh yeah this is Andy Bauer um the environmental compliance manager at Northwest Natural and then also the typically the point of contact for all of our fsac site certificates that we uh sorry I realized that I was looking at my presentation and it didn't sync with the one the shared one so here we go what I said earlier might make a little more sense now uh Davis Wright yeah hi everyone this is Derek green I'm attorney with Davis Wright Tremaine um my colleague Elaine Aldrich uh is maybe joining as well too just uh back to Tom's Point what we're trying to do is just make sure one of us could cover most of these meetings um from from there so you might see one of us um or both of us just on this first one as well too um uh um here we don't represent a specific uh applicant or our client for this matter but Elaine and I have both been through the episode process multiple times and through the contested case process um some as well twos are here happy to be a part of this and to help contribute as we can all right great uh Renewables Northwest hello everybody uh my name is Max Green I'm the deputy director at renewable Northwest uh we're uh 51c3 non-profit that has a decarbonization mission focused on transitioning to clean energy in Oregon Washington Idaho and Montana um I'm an attorney by background I've served on past fsec racks and uh prior to my work at Northwest time do have some experience engaging in a contested case studying processes in other jurisdictions so hopefully uh can bring some of that experience um you know legal background as well as working with some of our member developers and organizations to bring sort of the voice of the clean energy um into this rack and although we had I think talked at one point about having my colleague Diane Brandt be sort of an alternate or joint direct member with me as it turns out instead that will be my colleague Emily Griffith who is also um here in the the teams meeting today uh Irene do you want to go ahead and introduce yourself oh you're unmuted I'm Irene Gilbert and I'm here representing the public I have been involved with contested cases with fsac and so I'm familiar with the current process and and actually what it looks from a from a public perspective come on James can you mute your mic here okay sorry Irene go ahead oh I was just gonna say I'm I'm familiar with the process from a uh participant from the public uh perspective and uh I guess that's all you need to know all right thanks so much for being here Irene uh Jim yeah I saw you yes yep uh Jim crater um I'm also with the public um but I'm also a member of the environmental justice Council so I'll be kind of looking through these proceedings with that lens and I too have been through one contested case so um I have lots of questions that um having gone through it I've made many errors and I found some corrections to those errors but hopefully my stumbling through it will help us all make the process better for the next people all right thank you Jim okay friends of the Columbia Gorge hi I'm Rudy salicroy I'm a conservation director for friends of the Columbia Gorge uh friends looks after the interests of the national Scenic area which constitutes six counties and uh Gorge of the Washington Oregon side um I believe we can test many cases so uh we are definitely interested in what's going on here and hope to be helpful thanks all right great I do really appreciate everyone uh coming and sending uh a representative uh here if there are changes in who uh is going to be you know who you basically want the point of contact to be uh please let me know um that that kind of deals with a charter here so I sent you guys the charter it's it's a pretty brief document it kind of lays out just kind of expectations for how these meetings will go my responsibilities are kind of what our hopes are for the participants um how non-committing member attendees could participate so it's it's you know it's relatively high level but uh it does it should hopefully answer your questions if there's anything in there about the rack process that you don't uh that you have questions about you can reach out to me directly uh at my through my email probably is the best bet uh in that rack is going to be a list of the rack members and their you know their email addresses which will be public information uh if there are any updates and it sounds like there is one if you can please send me um any changes I'll get that changed and this Charter will be posted on the rulemaking page uh for people to review as well as this presentation itself so any materials that we produce as part of this rack process will be made available on the website so you don't need to you you know feel free to take notes or anything but like yeah this presentation will be made uh publicly available the PowerPoint and also a video uh that we're recording now will be posted online for you to go back and and watch if you're can't remember what somebody said or uh you know you that resource will be there for you to go back and uh okay any any questions any questions about the charter before I move on so uh it sounds like a lot of you have or at least many of you have been through the rulemaking process so I'm going to make this relatively brief but essentially there's this is a very high level overview of that process we have already initiated the rulemaking which was uh occurred in front of council uh we we kind of have a unique structure here I am as I am an employee of Odo but I am uh retained by the organ Depart of energy to assist the energy facility citing Council in their business and I am the rules coordinator for that Council so the council is the determining body of volunteer members appointed by uh the governor to um you know regulate the site energy setting process in the state of Oregon and we don't do anything without their say so that includes the rulemaking process so uh we have suggestions we have ideas um we present those to council at Council meetings that occur usually every month and in this case um uh two two Council meetings ago we proposed that we begin the contested case uh rulemaking and we laid out our kind of vision in terms of the scope and objectives and Council approve that so we kind of have our marching orders and I'll be discussing that shortly um so now we are in kind of phase two which is the uh development of the draft proposed rules and this is going to be the primary",

        "text": " round there were 68 applications submitted 34 of which were planning applications and 34 of which were construction applications and as you can see it was a good mix of resilience applications versus non-resilience applications um requested grants totaled around 27 million dollars with advanced requests of about 7 million renewable energy generation plan from all of these projects was around 30 and applications were received from all over the state from counties public libraries community colleges fire departments irrigation districts tribes cities water and sanitation districts consumer owned utilities public universities and state agencies odo is currently working on the eligibility and complete completeness review for all the submitted applications and after this is complete we will move into the competitive review um so are there any questions about that no i do have one question that says angela from oca it looks like the total requested definitely exceeds what's available um i think so yeah is there an opportunity for some of those applications to be funded but at a smaller amount or is it sort of a take the take it or leave it kind of thing this was just the first round there is more money allocated to this program so if it doesn't get funded this round there's definitely potential for the next round and christy you can jump into yeah i'm happy to just to just to clarify that we don't plan on like modifying applications and sending them back to people and being like here's the amount of money we're willing to give you for this instead or something like that but what we are going to do is for those that don't make the cut this time they are welcome to reapply um in the next round which we are working on we're actually like really i think just like having an attitude of constant improvement is important for any state agency and it's one we're really trying to embody with this program so as we're reviewing applications we're looking and seeing what should we change about our application that we can change within confines of the statute and rule so that we can make it easier for applicants to apply um and get the information that we need to make solid decisions so just a heads up that we're right now applications can't be turned in the the portal is closed but that's because we want to like really take a close look at to see if there's any like obvious areas where this people are having kind of the same issues um frequently or something like that so just sort of know that we'll do a whole relaunch for the last 12 million dollars that's available this biennium this fall um and just kind of stay tuned for that to happen and then as people get notified that they haven't moved forward through the process they can reapply um once that's opened great thank you yeah thank you and thanks to i think a lot of people on this call were kind of part of a um pretty obvious um sort of whisper campaign i guess like everywhere we went people were talking about this program over the course of the last year and it really showed in how many folks we had turned out for webinars and how many folks were writing us with questions and interested and then with how many applications submitted i think it's pretty clear that there is absolutely demand for a program like this um and so you know i remember a year ago having folks on our team being deeply concerned that we would have trouble finding people willing and ready to apply for these funds and to have that be completely um shown to be not the case was i think really important for all of you as work group members in this conversation for us and for the legislature to see we have a couple more questions yeah hi everybody um and apologies for joining a little late and yeah really great to hear about the launch and interest in this round of funding i'm uh i'm tying into maybe the resilience is the criteria or competitive review kind of focused on some of what the resilience needs are in different communities or is it just uh or is there uh evaluation of geographic distribution of of the projects or is it just kind of scoring and the best the best scoring projects are the ones that will be selected and knowing that you know i know portland projects are not eligible but yeah yeah fair i mean your perspective and consent yeah i hope we're learning from you and maybe vice versa i don't know but um but um i i'm happy to sorry stephanie i'm just kind of going with this i've been like deeply embedded in this program from the beginning so so uh what i would say is all of the above um we have a score sheet a rubric that um i can find online and post in a few minutes um or that might be an opportunity announcement but there's a rubric that we're using for um scoring for the competitive review and for the internal review and it includes i think everything you mentioned the only thing i'll say is the definition of energy resilience that we're using is we're statutorily bound to use and it's in statute and it's pretty specific it's not like a community can decide what resilience means to them it's like an energy type of definition so that's sometimes caused frustration um but the statute is what the statute is so for example we've had people come to us and want to do like um undergrounding of power lines which wouldn't qualify under the definition that we have of of energy resilience in the bell so um so that's just kind of one interesting note but for the most part everything you mentioned we want to make sure that projects are geographically distributed we have a 50 carve out four resilience projects we have a 50 carve up for environmental justice communities so those will be like um given preference over other projects and in the process great yeah great to hear and thanks for the update did you uh divide the funding that's available uh between uh planning and construction or is it all one pot of money and then you'll just sort through all 68 and figure out which ones to fund okay it's the latter yep we did not um between the two uh the planning grants are significantly less expensive than the project grants so and some of them are there's a 200 000 limit i think off the top of my head um i'm not supposed to talk about numbers without them in front of me but um but some people put in planning grants for lower than that what not so it'll be kind of like putting together a puzzle later as we have probably more projects than there's probably projects we'd like to fund that we won't be able to given that the number of applications right it's one hundred thousand i'm fanning thank you adam for reminding me see i should never say numbers without them in front of me thank you thank you all right it looks like we've gotten all the questions on c-rep and so i'm going to move to the next section of the agenda right on time by the way um so next we're gonna go into a guiding principles discussion for our um and so the idea here is as we move to the afternoon and start really diving in deep to what the work group's recommendations will be for the overall report we want to come to some kind of agreement on what we think the gutting principles for those recommendations should be and so a couple of examples um that you know we're just throwing out there as a starting point we want you guys to come up with these we're um you know the first obvious one assist oregon and meeting the state goals as defined in hb 2021 uh promote equitable outcomes among oregonians contribute to maintaining affordable energy for all oregonians support project transparency consider the perspectives of other consider contributions to economic development or local energy resilience so this is where i would like to open it up to the work group um and see did we miss something what else um what would you guys like to make sure that our recommendations focus on so that we kind of have a path forward in the afternoon um discussing those recommendations so work group members jump in thanks this is a good start i'm curious why um some of these say so for example that last point about economic development to me that feels like it should be a a lot of the stories that we've heard about small projects are really about the benefits that you know the economic development benefits that communities receive so that that feels like should be a little stronger on that one absolutely this was just a quick throwing things up there to have a starting point it wasn't a lot of thought into the wordsmithing so good catch and that was not on purpose anybody else yeah this is uh less of a um what else but more of a yes and i think it may be helpful to either qualify or add to promoting equitable outcomes of more oregonians uh uh the the principle of prioritizing environmental justice communities which is uh part of section two of house bill 2021 and would tie into that first part of the state goals associated with uh house bill 2021 and i think the second would be it would be valuable to disaggregate economic development and local energy resilience and perhaps to the point of my question earlier instead of just naming energy and recognizing that you all are the department of energy name resilience and perhaps we can have some discussion as a group to further define what resilience means but certainly for an organization like faraday issues like addressing displacement are a key part of the way we do our energy work and so that nuance and the definition of resilience you also could if you wanted to keep those uh crops together talk about consider um community benefits which again goes back to section two of hospital 2021 around prioritizing benefits for communities and then define out what benefits are and it could include economic development resilience some of these other other pieces so just some some thoughts there about how to maybe add a little bit of nuance to those uh to that list there but i think generally it looks pretty good thank you and it looks like nikita agrees with you orianna all right rep owens thanks stephanie and it's probably ingrained in all these but uh some emphasis on you know local ownership community-based ownership uh when we talk about equitable outcomes i think the ownership of some of these uh projects is going to be very important to small governments or community-based organizations i like to look at that and also like to just agree with uh ariana on the resilience what is resilience and what are the metrics and how we're defining that for different communities because i think it'll be different thank you uh james i think you're next in my list yeah",

        "text": " that overlay yeah absolutely i think it would be great for us to marry up the provisions in the ira with the recommendations and kind of show how that might change i mean this could be kind of this is the overall cost but we could get a lot of that from uh from the federal government right and uh obviously the ira was signed yesterday uh and we've been working on this for months and months and so we've never been able to incorporate that but as commissioner mcdonald said uh chair mcdonald said we going to be doing uh updates of this on a regular basis so the next iteration of the tigger project can incorporate that kind of analysis that the the cost that we have incorporated here is the total total cost it'll bring up the question of do we want to do total societal costs or just oregon cost if if it's just organ costs we can deduct the federal incentives and and then it would just be what's the cost of oregon or do we want to look at it on a bigger scale at the national level so total societal costs as opposed to just working costs but that's a question for a different day this is the mac curve for the financial metrics of the mac curve for the hybrid i wanted to now shift gears a little bit and when you add up all of these blocks together you get aggregate results and and the financial results that we're looking at are are what we're going to look at next and i wanted to have a couple of important things to understand about how we calculated the financial benefits first and foremost is they do not include the costs and the benefits associated with the programs and regulations adopted or under development so all those the hp 2021 and cpp all and all those other 13 programs that we had listed before are are not included here this is this is the incremental actions that we're talking about here the 30 or 30 36 or 38 incremental actions that are used to accelerate meet the goal by 2030 um so it's and it's only those direct cost of of implementing those programs and the direct benefits associated with them so it does not include any of the additional infrastructure needed for implementation like if we uh uh electrical transmission and distribution upgrades or pipeline local distribution upgrades or the transportation infrastructure investments that need to occur that that was out of the scope of what our ability to calculate was and that will be actually figured out over time through that robust regulatory process we were talking about that will that will allow us to move forward so with those understandings about how we develop the financial metrics uh i wanted to show you this next slide which is actually the financial metrics and of course financial metrics in in its grander sense what we're talking about is how much investment cost is there how much savings do we get how much savings do we get from operation and maintenance and then so if you deduct the savings from the cost you get net benefit or net cost in this case for instance with the electrification scenario and this is through 2050 mind you um the the red numbers are investments or costs and the green ones are savings or benefits so in this case for instance electrification the uh total investment cost is 87 billion dollars but it saves 141 billion over over the 2050 time frame and another 16 billion from from maintenance savings for total net benefit of 70 billion dollars over the 2050 cat time frame an important part of thinking about that is that that of 86 billion dollars is not what the state has to provide to be able to do that so a lot of that is based on replacement includes the the natural occurring replacement of equipment and on cars to evs and all the different things that people would do on a natural basis so that's the total cost of actually doing all this stuff the the incremental cost would be a lot a lot lower if you took all the rest of that naturally occurring investment out and same for the hybrid a little higher investment cost some debt substantial expenditure and uh uh an energy savings and open savings for a net benefit uh 57 billion dollars over the 2050. again this isn't for the entire all of the actions it's just for those incremental actions to get us from the 2035 goal accelerated to any questions those of you that are graphically we summed it up in some nifty graphs for you the one on the left is the cumulative net present value investment in returns it's not nominal dollars it's discounted dollars so it shows the investment bar and then which is a cost and then the maintenance is in red savings and the energy savings is in yellow and then the benefit is the light blue so that's a different way of looking at it if you want if you're more graphic the graph on the right is actually year to year and it does have nominal nominal dollars in it so one of the interesting things about that is the blue is the capital expenditures the investments that need to be made that's the total investment it's not just the incremental so it includes all those replacement costs that would naturally occur anyway the red is the maintenance savings in the yellow the substantial energy savings associated the black line is the net cost on an annual basis you can see that in order to meet the goal accelerated goal 2030 you have to front actions and so you see this bump in the early part uh in the 20 20 20 22 to 20 30 time frame uh where where we're seeing uh about an average about eight billion dollars of investment through 2030 uh again not all of that will be need to be capital by by the state or utilities um because most of that occurs through natural replacements um and so you can see that that the cost curve which is that black actually has an initial investment cost and then over time what happens is the substantial energy savings create the benefit associated with with uh with implementing these actions um chris you will you guys anything to add to these two graphs i got it yeah that's all sounds good yeah and i just wanted to show you this is the the graph associated with the hybrid it's essentially the same graph uh similar the numbers are different but on an annual basis versus versus cumulative on a net present value basis some of the key takeaways that we wanted to share with you about financial results are that while there's a substantial amount of investment capital be needed both scenarios create a net benefit and not a cost to oregonians i think that's pretty significant most of that net benefit comes from the substantial energy savings there is some from the o m savings but that's about a tenth of the energy savings so most of it comes from being more efficient and and the ability to to do to uh to create that efficiency through new equipment that that replaces old equipment and that kind of concludes the part about the financial metrics and and anybody have any questions about these last two slides because we're going to move into co-benefits uh and set up our next meeting so if you have any questions uh clarifying questions about the financial results um we can entertain them now because we're gonna move on to co-benefits yeah mike asked a question mike from oda about the cost savings uh don't include potential cost savings of co benefits just energy savings correct um correct and uh we are going to be able to layer in some of the cost benefits of um some of the coban co-benefit bus and and benefits as well right and we're going to talk about that yeah that was a great question all right i'll move on so the the ability of the modeling that that ssg had allows us to look at a lot of metrics from the model and these this is a list of the co the metrics that they were able to that the model is able to crank out it can crank out health savings and number of person years of employment or jobs we also can calculate the social cost of carbon impact and then some metrics like capital expenditures per household or residential energy or commercial energy use per household or square foot and transportation cost per household so we're able to see what happens over time and again because we do we built this model from the counties up and aggregated all the counties to get to the state level we can show all of these metrics by county which is actually pretty pretty cool and uh will be very helpful i think for for a lot of folks to see how that actually works we'll show you a little bit about how that works in a second and and two the point you made earlier alan where this is primarily focused on what and not as much on how that ability to look at um these measures by county i think does would help inform and exactly so so it starts to get us into the the how would we design these things so as the commission moves on to the next phase of this project we're going to be incorporating trying to figure out how to incorporate the the co-benefits associated with each of these different actions so we want to be able to and some of them are quantifiable and some of them are are are qualitative uh equity for instance isn't necessarily quantitative it's more qualitative but we'll be able to incorporate that into the into the to um like i said rejigger that prioritization of the of the of the mac curve so that we can have the the actions that have high co benefits be the high priority ones that the state looks at so let me get into a couple of these are there some questions kathy i think no i think we're good there's a link that someone has put in about some nrdc data i think that's um that's the only thing all right let's move on uh two examples we wanted to talk about health and jobs are the two that we're going to show you today the health benefits are the result from reduction in pollutants specific health savings accrue from reductions in mortality heart attacks hospital admissions emergency room visits and work loss what we did was he used the cobra modeling that is pretty common across the united states that act actually calculates this on a dollar per capita basis so we could actually calculate the value of the reduction in specific pollutants associated with the actions that get taken to get us to the accelerated goal and uh next slide shows what those are so ssg did their cobra modeling so that uh it estimate what those benefits are through the top line there is carried over from the previous financial",

        "text": " share the screen these money um my screen certainly got a different look about it very well seeing a we're seeing the entire PowerPoint application not like presenter mode here we go the small scale community-based study was completed last fall and I like I said I'll go through these slides and then we can have a discussion if there are some questions kind of about broader small-scale renewable energy development study came out of house bill 2021 which directed Oregon Department of energy to convene a working group and cover barriers to project potential benefits of small-scale processed and ownership opportunities potential rate impacts and also potential legislation that could hopefully address some of the barriers and this is our representation on the work group I won't go through this whole list I know this is being recorded if anyone is interested in seeing who all was on there but we had a lot of work group members we had voices from from every position within kind of the small scale discussion including community group industry representatives from the solar wind and Israel industry we had utility Representatives folks who were interested in evaluating impacts and making sure that the great impacts are not too great abilities that these things don't cost an exorbitant amount um so I'll move on we had four workshops and we focused basically on the areas that the statutory language directed us to look at and that was ownership and access opportunities and barriers um benefits costs and rate impacts and finally we had a wrap-up meeting to tie it all together and one thing we learned was that one we brought in guest speakers to bring kind of some real life examples from actual projects and we learned that that was very valuable for the workshop members to hear from folks who've actually been developing these projects at a small scale and the other thing we learned was in that workshop for um when it came to possible when we have such a diverse work group we had a really hard time getting a consensus on items and so in some ways it was very valuable and that we had a very diverse viewpoints and a lot of ideas that came out of the study but we also it was a bit of a decimal of not being able to bring everybody together infinitive recommendations but I think that's the nature of a study that is essentially designed many many stakeholders involved again a lot of great ideas but maybe not since it's on all of those ideas here are some of the key findings we could have broken up into opportunities that exist for these small community-based projects and then also some of the barriers and some of the opportune opportunities of note were the opportunity to address some Equity a project that bring local benefits to one of the really good ones that we kind of he's not of the work group was efficient land use and the ability of a local community to identify Brownfield sites other sites within the community that are likely to get community support for project development there is a lot of nimbyism where people don't want to see them they don't want them in their backyards and if you work at the local level you can identify the correct site that works for community members for developing some of these projects another big opportunity was improving local energy resilience they're developing renewable energy if you add energy storage most typically in the form of batteries you also have the ability to have emergency backup Power Systems and that resilience component brings a lot of value that you don't see in the large-scale developerative we've seen a lot of projects around Oregon including I mean Salem has has been a leader in this with the sale of smart power center and I know there's a a project with these expanding that into a micro grid these types of benefits enable communities to continue to operate in the event of any prolonged power outage or one of the great opportunities for development increase Local Economic value and that is the not only during construction when you have these projects bringing this essentially creating Commerce to the community but once it's up and running it they can bring cost savings to publicly owned facilities by you know the benefit of the on-site generation of electricity but now that there's really opportunities in every Community but some communities face more barriers and this really gets to the um the point that we saw that a lot of small communities just don't have the capacity to Envision a project and get it over the finish line there's a lot of administrative burden to getting these projects going including Grant vetting contractors permitting um not every Community especially when it gets very small communities that may have just a couple of Staff representing the municipality um it's it's more of a barrier for them and some of those specific barriers are relating to financing and insurance for these projects regulatory hurdles like the siding and the permitting and that local capacity and knowledge in the absence of hard recommendations we came up with these guiding principles and this is what we found that all of um stakeholders could agree on was that these small-scale projects can assist in meeting some of the state energy goals I think it's important to note that the state energy goals it's it's just as likely to meet them with large-scale projects they're based on essentially um giving carbon emissions out of the electricity generation sector in Oregon doesn't matter how large a project is they all you know contribute to those goals but if you were able to develop projects with less local resistance there's some value there Equitable outcomes again bringing value and benefits to these smaller maintaining affordable energy and rates for all oregonians that was an important component throughout the discussions going on in recent years especially solar projects are now coming in additive or even cheaper time traditional fossil fuel generation just recently in Idaho there was a solar project that was developed so it's going to be selling its energy to Idaho Power at a rate that was low in what they were paying for total power so these projects really have at the large scale reached parity or even low and cost than gas and coal but at the small scale there's still some there's still a financial hurdle where you don't get those economies at scale um and the equitable distribution of constant benefits project transparent parents see you we found that it's these projects are that are developed at the community level have much more transparency than when a developer from out of state comes in and develops you know 1200 Acres and we just found that with the perspectives of so many stakeholders um that you get a lot of differing ideas that doesn't always lead to consensus but it does um giving away a good canvas of what are um different concerns and and opportunities are by signing these projects within Oregon at the small community scale we're supporting Economic Development which heard a really nice story about small wind projects that was developed besides some of the larger land projects able to have a kind of a symbionic relationship where several small projects together created an industry of for these facilities so it really is an ongoing economic that for these Community projects and sometimes they leverage larger projects nearby but not always then again these unique contributions of small-scale projects this goes back energy resilience the more targeted Footprints local ownership or local economic benefits and in some cases it's not only identifying the right piece of land but also identifying a renewable energy resource that may not be known to a broader group of developers outside of the community and in some cases this could be a hydro resource for the Municipal Water Supply or it could be a biomass resource coming off the landfill there there's a lot of local knowledge around potential renewable energy resources that may not get the the Eye of larger Developers but I will stop sharing my screen screen and see if there are any thank you rob um that was a great report actually I read every bit of it so let's open it up for discussion and see there are questions for Rob discussion about yourselves questions Lisa and I'll take the first person commissioner ecos um Ron I wonder how much Reliance generally are you putting on the grant programs um yeah that's a good question for both resilience and for the community solar projects for the the community solar projects I will say that I'm I'm not an expert on those projects that they're being administered by the Public Utility Commission and the Energy Trust I can't say that those projects have had such significant financial partners but we've seen very few actually get and that is with a rate that is um those projects may be reimbursed at a rate that equals can be reasonable rate of electricity which is approximately three times the rate that a large project we get for the generation so we recognize that there's a financial barrier in community solar is so far in Oregon and been a difficult thing to has a follow-up you know a couple of them um um how many applications for Community did you get or whether you have to would you did they find out about the financial difficulties uh during the application process and therefore not proceed or do they apply and then discover that that it's not going to be financially it's not financially going to work um that's a good question and again our department is not administering the program however the last time I looked they had they had over 40 applications and I believe that they had something like three projects that were actually either online or very shortly or brought online so my mind that Terry's out and what I really want to see is data around the cost of those projects compared to a project of similar size that the community solar program because the community solar program has a lot of administrative costs associated with attracting subscribers to the project managing a build credit process with the utility the initial pass through that all of that administrative burden I think has really taken a toll on some of those projects but again I'm just not I'm just not close to those projects because it's not something I work on I understand that everyone and I'm sorry to keep asking you questions about the thing that you're not really involved in but you're the only one here who might be able to answer one of the things I wondered about is the degree to which those applications involved in a cooperation a high level of cooperation in partnership with the actual utility serving here um my understanding is that those projects will have I don't know if you would call it cooperation but certainly coordination with the utility and that's been one of the hurdles is getting what they call an interconnection agreement and so not like permitting is a prolonged and administrative and burdensome process and more so for these Community solo projects where they had to do part about a new category of of these qualifying facilities and work out some of the in many cases the utilities happen very Cooperative but within that framework there's been a lot administrative burden",

        "text": " numbers I apologize and I also point this out because we are trying to minimize parking and maximize housing and this is not their first rodeo or their first project and it looks like it's a lot of parking for 183 units I don't know how they're going to scale it down to provide uh For I know it's more cars and they're important but that advice has supported with everything we can to uh support the housing before the estates another comment bar I have no questions but I can go back and make a comment for those of you who saw the committee meeting everyone in the city Surely I voted against this in committee and I'm going to continue voting against this bill tonight and I want to tell you why because of course it's not that I'm against affordable housing and I want to talk more about it but as soon as possible we need more but for me I feel like we're sacrificing one goal for another and we're sacrificing climate action goals for the housing crisis and while both are really important and present and intense we talked a little bit about the Ho committee meeting and How Can We Climate Action? uh balance them that uh To be able to leave with direction So for me I feel that the committee discussion was very good and We did find ourselves find the intention and move forward Here tonight to see some of the things that are very important to me that We continue to focus on the Salem plan and prioritize projects in Field and with transit networks to see this housing development that was approved with the Green light development. There is a lot of space and we have all the walkable transit connections with bikes to get closer to the different areas I'm encouraged by the ideas we heard about having access to work is fantastic But we are more than our work there are families there are uh entertainment and shops and shopping and everything that goes with life so these people are going to rely on the car transportation and that means they're going to need a car payment insurance records maintenance costs my husband and I were uh watching Walking Down the Mountain and then it turned out that one of our tires was about to blow out and uh we just had new tires They cost 400 d and when you are a car owner you have to be prepared for it but that is the cost of living in a society that we don't talk about enough, which is the second highest cost of people who live here, first housing and transportation Secondly, and although I love this project in all its areas, the fact that it is affordable to live in but each time it has an incremental transportation cost is something that I struggle with and I really want us to focus our money on small amounts. Hopefully That it was more like what Councilor Nordik said to have affordable housing to be in locations where it is possible for all people to be able to live and those are projects that I am going to focus on, I am going to focus the money and I think this will be You have to vote for it to move forward but I would just like to say this space is where I cannot sacrifice one objective for another and thank you for listening to the difficult decisions we have to make. Well, in the committee discussion we had it, I support that project. ideal No but it is within our borders eh And affordable and we want to encourage all housing developments to be devised if it is close Of course but ultimately all those open spaces are going to eh be filled with housing and with it maybe not It is ideal but it takes us towards the goal and we are talking about 133 units of affordable housing I cannot say no to this and that is why I am going to support it does anyone else have any other comments councilor barne Thank you very much I really have a hard time with this project. a good project but I would like to take it and put it where there is access to shops and services and the transportation service. I think the little bus to work is a great idea but people are going to have to have cars to get their services and that worries me. and at the bond meeting one of the things we discussed was exactly passing and moving forward with this 10 million dollars for affordable housing because we really had to develop the criteria to use and select the projects and we have not developed them and I'm seeing If I use a third of the affordable housing funds and that makes me feel bad because we don't know what else is going to happen to use those funds and I think 183 units is very good but not being in a central transit area or having access to per bike are big challenges and have a question because in terms of affordable units and providing these affordable units is for perpetuity there is a term a limit until those housing is not affordable it depends on state funding typically it is 30 years but that is owned by non- profit then it is possible that after 30 years the non- profit institution wants to decide that they want to make a profit or I want to make a profit And then they can uh own affordable housing for the well-being of the community but it will be restricted according to the financing of the period and also eh eh And then it will not change and it will be in the hand of the lucrative hono so that it serves its mission Thanks for the answers And then if it is a non- profit they do not pay Predial the intention is that they do pay that they use and there are different financing mechanisms to limit property taxes or limit them And that is part of the structure So the payment of taxes is going to be limited and it is not a separate conversation and discussion but that is of any uh non-profit financing And we have a comment on that So we have two different programs and one for non-profit non-owners of affordable housing one is the housing property tax exemption program which is a 10-year tax exemption for affordable housing and we also have the management contract that through which many projects go through to have their tax exemption that may be in the longer term and that project is going to be exploring the management agreement with the housing authorities counselor Gonz\u00e1lez Thank you mayor I want to mention a couple of things 600 people waiting at the list in cornerstone uh that makes me think about what the mayor said today that 10 million in the budget in general I remember the comments 10 million was what we could get to have public support there is general support Everyone wants affordable housing but even Getting it is difficult, people don't want it in their garden and I um say that we should use that money as quickly as possible if we have it Because inflation is going to kill it to make sure that people come in and have homes eh before inflation eat us we need to have places so that people have parking so that they also get the goods and products they want. I agree with you completely, above all, taking the money out the door makes no sense to put it in the bank. We have to have affordable housing. and these buildings have to be built councilor shock thank you also as I said I mentioned it because I had many questions to understand the project and now I hear that we are in very limited time Thank you for explaining all this to us and although it is not ideal I also feel that we are neighborly It is trying to work on the transportation issue and we hope that the improvements we make also include bicycle paths or the of so that people can walk or uh I think that this project is something that has to be done and done immediately in accordance with the whole premise of what it is that it is going to provide Thank you counselor and we also mentioned the lack of uh bicycle paths but what I was talking about there are bicycle lines and I have been down that path many times by bike and there is a uh path Very interesting, I think he told us this at the meeting and thank you for reminding us, Councilor Philips, thank you to my colleagues, I think this is a very serious discussion in terms of the public situation, that will be annoying around the city's work network and sometimes I agree with some of the tenants eh Because the devil is in the detail in that part of the city in the western part eh And in the eastern part I think it's fine there are many people who eh Oregon is a rural place and Councilor Gonz\u00e1lez He said there is a great opportunity I don't feel like this is going to save lives and I'm not hearing that we are choosing that and something in the city is this or we expect more so I think it's important to uh house as many people as possible I pay more for a single apartment or in a building when he went to medical school and we're talking about 20 years later so that's the number $1,000 a month is good is Eh This is desperately needed and I agree with this project any other comments councilor barne Sorry I have a question How far is it from the nearest fire station there is a fire station planned uh that is going to be built in that area but now it is on State Street west of Lancer but the new one is going to be in that Milk area Once it's built thank you good counselor Sorry I don't want to uh continue with this but I think that's a great project And then I'm I would hate to do it and constantly uh with a project we're asking how many of these units are affordable 15% and that is considered Well that is 100% affordable and I don't know how we wouldn't say yes any comments we are going to go to a roll call vote councilor no councilor nia in favor councilor Philips in favor councilor as councilor phips eloquently said it but By God what s gonzlez yes counselor Ho yes counselor n in favor counselor bar eh No against mayor today in favor the motion is approved Very good thank you for your testimony for your help and now we now We are in the reports one at a time 6a for The public was reading us and I was surprised because it started before I was on the council I had no idea that this council was going to be done and I thought that if we could have a basket so that the public can",

        "text": " so one of the things we could do in the proposed order is we could actually go in and add a footnote and I can go to the base you know similar to what I've done here of going to the docket and footnoting where we pulled that information from but we can update to contemplate like that a more updated one has happened but I feel like what stop b2h's comments were and this kind of goes to the Adaptive nature is that puc says yeah you're approved but you know what in 2024 we want to see these things right and so it doesn't mean that it was a conditional approval or that it was deficient it's to contemplate the Adaptive nature of what these plans are supposed to be and then I imagine in the 2024 plan that the certificate holder is going to go in and and do those things that they said back in 2023 and then if approved the approval for 2024 will probably say in 2025 we want to see this so it's just we want to just keep that in mind in response to these comments it's not a uh they are intended to be adaptive um your the DPO makes a summary of uh findings in the final order I we talk about methodologies right so the methodologies used in the uh Idaho Powers Wildfire mitigation plan are the same methodologies used by um you know very large other utilities it's accepted practice um whether we like it or not this type of modeling is largely focused on impacts to their assets right as rate recovery and utilities that's why it applies to utilities that is generally a lot of what the modeling is targeted on that said for council's other facilities the areas of heightened Wildfire risk are areas of more concentrated infrastructure that is and that goes to the inputs into these modeling you know take into account topography vegetation climate but it also takes into account infrastructure residences roads transmission lines Etc so um I think one of the comments we heard was that these plans don't address risks to people and property and I think we can say oh wait a minute they do address this broader package of risk not just risk to the facility and and I think we need to respond to that but I think it's an easy response uh absolutely and I think once I'm done going through here I can just quickly scroll through the certificate holder responses where they do actually note to that and provide they provide an attachment from luttenberger it was from I don't know if it was direct testimony or what it was from from the contested case but where he says directly what are what you know it is responsive to that so in this section we will go and this is part of what we'll do in the proposed orders like we we weave in that extra support to be responsive um to provide that yeah thank you so um just give me a second here let me find okay uh so I go through go through an analysis of poc's rules um risk analysis okay so this is so oer 860 300 0030 it designates the information that must be provided in a wildfire mitigation plan you know importantly here it does require that a utility model Wildfire risk within its service territory and uh and then outside the service territory but within the utilities right away okay so that's this is kind of right so this is important so and also keep in mind that um the transmission line is not on the landscape right now um but Idaho Power says like they did include b2h in its modeling so and now outside so but let's think about it or right-of-way is what you know a couple hundred feet right so when you look into the methodologies Idaho Power actually did maybe I have a different place here risk modeling steps okay so here so in the areas so they modeled their entire service territory which is generally right down in Idaho and then some in malheur county and then outside their service territory which is what we're talking about here for b2h um they went uh it was you know one so it was 1.24 mile buffer so it's basically 0.62 miles on either side um that they include in the modeling outside their service territory for a little bit of context or comparison uh council's analysis area for Wildfire is half a mile so um so there's that and here's another uh different part of puc's rules kind of reiterate this area of what the areas that need to be modeled so and so again what does their staff do when they get a wildfire mitigation plan very similar to what we do we look at it we look at our rules and we look over here we look over there so this is something that will that will continually be looked at by their staff when reviewing um and making recommendations to the commission for approval of the Wildfire mitigation plan so importantly the certificate holder very similar to what they said in the contested case and was captured in previous conditions they said you know b2h is included in the modeling these were our buffers these were our inputs um but more importantly I mean what do we care about we care that those measures in the Wildfire mitigation plan are going to apply to the whole project regardless of service Theory territory or not and Idaho Power says yes it will so then let's just kind of get so it's you know paraphrasing there's a lot of stuff in here so this is um again we're removing the Public Services condition and you know and it what what did it say before it said you know submit a wildfire mitigation plan it has to it has to cover the whole facility in each County um and then comply with Wow verification um it was a little bit confusing how it was worded so actually I feel a little bit more comfortable with our with our new conditions underneath your actual standard so um we're just going to look at our new conditions here our recommended conditions rather is that it yes okay so so right um the important parts is that b2h is going to be included in a wildfire mitigation plan um and that in each of the counties um so so we um council is saying that the the oppc approved wmp welfare mitigation plan must evaluate file related risk risk in each of the five counties regardless of the service territory or ownership of the facility um and that the measures in the wmp would apply to the whole facility and then we're saying prior to operation give us the most recent welfare mitigation plan right so let's say if we do approval then you know say it's maybe two years we're building out there may be a gap there um so prior to operation give us the most updated welfare mitigation plan and then when you're in operations Wildfire mitigation plan condition two says give us the most up the you know the most recent approved plan and a copy of the puc approval now that you know that depending on when that is you know we may be a year behind but we want we don't want something that is currently being reviewed we want the last thing that the commission approved I'm Cindy Condon um thank you so I just want to so the puc requires uh submission annually and approves annually up in June June or July time frame are we requiring uh every year I I thought we were requiring site certificate holders to covered by our Wildfire mitigation um just submit annually this is this is submitting annually on an annual basis in the annual report the most recent puc approved wmp and the POC approval I thought I heard you say something different yeah sorry that is what I thought we were going to do so um and just uh this is something I'm um concerned about with the risk I certainly respect uh the puc's authority and approval of plans and hopefully either getting more and more experience um this is our Rule and I would hope that we would also be reading those plans and making our own determination because we will have I believe applicants who are not covered by the puc that we will be responsible for not investor-owned utilities and that the more experience we have reading and understanding those plans uh the better will be prepared I guess that's one of my thoughts and um just secondly this refers to prior to operation so during construction is is there a wildfire under this standard as it's written here or these conditions um is Construction the period of construction dealt with because there can be sparking from vehicles and that sort of thing and are are we considering that as an ignition that that's the um that's a good good questions and comments the the applic this this welfare mitigation plan applies to an operational facility when you look at the provisions included in the plan it is for a operational transmission line the while the fire prevention and suppression plan underneath a different Public Services standard that Council approved is what applies to sparking construction all the construction related fire risk so just to repeat so I um put it in my head so we will continue to maintain the fire suppression under public services but then once operational we go to this correct okay yeah thanks it totally sorry I forgot oh um one of the interesting things that we could I don't know how you would capture it in here just to keep in mind um you know the the department or Council can participate in puc's dockets I don't know if this gets a little bit weird of state agencies participating in other state agencies process but right so I we could we could do that you you don't really want to put a requirement for the Department in a condition because that gets weird but we could talk about you know as a policy or just internally what that may look like you know if we for this project or if we get another similar project just a follow-up um and if my memory and understanding is correct the word used here is May for us and so if there were a circumstance that um we didn't feel the Wildfire mitigation plan that the puc had was enough for us since this is our standard um that we don't we're not required to approve the POC but we can certainly do that as a matter of course unless it doesn't meet all of our concerns and whatever right council could yes it is a mix you could do an an alternate plan um you just want to like uh I guess you have to be it'd have to be pretty rigorous to not set up conflicting you know uh uh um plans of how uh you know in the in certain circumstances this these are the safety procedures and protocols the certificate holders going to deploy to address Wildfire risk and it's all",

        "text": " be measured on a portfolio basis and it has to already have that site certificate in place even to play and compete meaningfully in the rfp next slide in the end in this particular rfp the company received approximately 98 oregon bids that doesn't necessarily mean 98 completely separate oregon you know different bids can look like different configurations of essentially the same project and even that 98 number is sort of extrapolated from a report that was produced by what's called an independent evaluator in the regulatory process so it is fairly approximate but it gives a good idea of how many played and many were forced out even just by the interconnection process and this is also a conclusion of the independent evaluators report so the reason for that is diane referenced a move to cluster studies you know the company's irp had sent this strong signal that they wanted a bunch of oregon solar so a bunch of oregon solar projects all put in interconnection requests to be studied together in the cluster study that was ongoing in summer 2020 and essentially when pacific warp's transmission function looked at all of those solar projects together in a cluster they said we're going to need a ton of a ton of expensive and lengthy upgrades in order to accommodate interconnecting all of these projects um the those studies that i referenced said for some of these there would be a 60 or 72 month timeline to complete and that didn't meet with the required commercial operation dates that the company included in its rfp so these bids were excluded essentially just by virtue of getting a an interconnection study that said we can't meet your your online date so in the end the company's final short list the projects they selected in their rfp included just two oregon projects totaling 210 megawatts of solar plus co-located storage which again was less than half of that 500 megawatt number that their irp had had indicated would be beneficial for their customers next slide and now our second example here is pge's 2021 all source rfp which is ongoing pge is seeking about 150 average megawatts of renewable resources uh given the capacity factors of the resources on their preferred portfolio that's probably about 450 megawatts of renewables plus sufficient dispatchable capacity to meet uh some additional capacity needs so sort of a question what that dispatchable capacity resource might be could be pumped hydro could be batteries could be hydro slices you know something else but in any event they're out there looking for um for these resources and they're also going to explore uh an additional uh 65 average megawatts of renewables in order to help them meet that 80 emissions reduction requirement by 2030 that's in uh house bill 2021 um so again the company's preferred portfolio includes about 160 megawatts gorge wind on the oregon side so i'd probably be f-sectional projects and next slide this is probably a little hard to read on your screens but you don't need to read the whole thing the only piece i wanted to highlight there is that the rfp requires permits to be in place by the time of selection to the final short in order again even to be considered for selection in the rfp a project has to have a site certificate by the time the rfp is done which on the next slide is next week so the site certificates due by the final short list originally that was proposed to be april 5th uh there's been a little bit of a schedule adjustment so the current date for determination of the final shortlist is april 27th again this this rfp was launched last year a project had to be far enough along in the site certificate process to be confident that they would be able to have that site certificate in place this month in order to participate in the rfp at and i think does that take us back to you diane yes thanks max um so after they've gone through all this complicated rfp process um if they are selected then they would go through a contract negotiation and so even after all of this there is the potential to not end up with a contract and some of this can be attributed to market drivers maybe they find that they're not able to get those final permits or there's some sighting barriers or other things have come up and we will i will flag one important market barrier um that's happening right now later on and also just the different aspects of the risk that's there can be a barrier to finally constructing the project but all of this is really or i would like to flag that if it's a good project i have been told if it's not successful in this first rfp developers might try again for other ways to secure off-take this could mean that they need this would mean that they have to keep their site certificate valid so even if they secured the off take with this particular process they might try again or look for other so i think max highlighted this really well but just the takeaways on this piece is that just to participate they have to simultaneously pursue site control permitting interconnection transmission and all of these pieces are complex and risky um and it is increasingly competitive and so developers are trying to find ways that will give them a competitive edge in this bidding process which could mean being further along in a permitting process or having something else buttoned up that maybe others haven't it's worth remembering that utilities really are selecting projects based on unpredictable future economics and even selected projects can still as i mentioned before there's a lot more to this process and we aren't going to dive necessarily into it or we're not going to dive into all of these today just for sake of time and also really we wanted to highlight the interconnection transmission and off take pieces but i would be remiss in not taking this opportunity to talk about materials um partly because uh it's always had a big impact on projects especially solar but right now in particular there are some global dynamics that are really impacting projects across the u.s so of course with um the pandemic there have been global supply chain issues that really are impacting developers abilities to get what they need and materials on site which can delay uh startup construction and there are ongoing tariff investigations including one that was just initiated about a month ago so whether it's supply chain issues or other things impacting it there are changes in prices that can have cost with which if big enough could have uh impacts on existing contracts and just lead to more delays uh when they're trying to iron those out so i mentioned ongoing tariff you might have seen this in the news a lot of people are calling it the oxen investigation but essentially the commerce department has opened up an investigation into solar panels coming from four southeast asian countries which make up about 80 of the imported solar panels in the united states as saying that these manufacturers in these countries are actually using parts that should have a tariff on them but because it's coming from these four countries they're circumventing this tariff so there's this is an ongoing process but we are already seeing impacts on uh current projects and development and it could have continued uh ripple effects um pretty pretty significant ripple effects on projects and their ability to to start construction or even be uh since its earth day we thought we would end with um one of the pieces from the most recent um report that came out a little over a month ago um and this was an interesting one because they've come out with uh um an interesting how much solar capacity we'll actually need to do in order to limit ourselves to the earth to 2c excuse me let me back up i got lost in that sentence um in order to limit the warming scenario to two cent to two degrees celsius uh above pre-industrial levels the report is uh suggesting that we would need to increase our solar capacity by a factor of 15 by 2050 compared to 2020 and also a 10-fold increase in wind with 87 phase out of coal just to stick to that two degree scenario so that makes it uh that's a lot of work and a lot of site certificates for everyone involved but with that i would like to say thank you for your time and i hope this information has been uh useful for you and if there are any questions we'd be more than happy to take them and again just recognizing the importance of the work that the council and fsex staff in making these projects possible uh you're a really important piece of this puzzle of figuring out how do we get to the best case scenario for climate change and converting to renewable to do that so that i'd open it up for any any questions yeah thank you very much to both of you this is chair grail does anyone have any questions for max or diane this is cindy yes cindy um thank you and thank you both for being here today um i just have a couple of questions i'll start with my first so max i think you um started your presentation by mentioning you're not a trade association you're something um can you go a little bit deeper into that um and i'm familiar with trade associations and don't quite see the do you lobby do you what's the uh just if you can describe the yeah i'm happy to do that um so we're designed to be um an independent 501c3 it's in our bylaws that our board has to have coming from outside of our um developer and for profit membership so our board is uh dominated by our our ngo members you know there are certain pieces of advocacy we've taken where we try to be extra careful to um you know actually run work product by for-profit members to make sure that um being thoughtful and trying to balance their potentially competing commercial interests but a lot of a lot of the work we do we do entirely in-house and we report out to our membership um and um you know that's i think the main difference is the the the level of independence and staff drivenness of the work that we do so think if i can follow up on that um so do you have any um make any efforts to communicate with the public where your members are certainly looking for property security property do you have any of that public participation again do not do any work like that on a project specific basis so we certainly don't you know help developers identify landowners or communicate in that way we're not a grassroots organization we don't have",

talking from a long tunnel and he doesn't have spelling there well does it log off and log back on you can before you do that I'll just say your I show you it's logged in twice and the second login I just made a panelist as well so you would have control over mute and unmute over that that that um let's see yes I do yes I did and then uh start video just came back okay how's it now are you able to hear us without an echo okay great all right everybody wins all right I'm proceeding but if there's any issues just uh just let us know and I'll stop and we can um so the scope of council's review um when it um the council May amend or reject the proposed order um so Council has has three options right Council can uh approve the proposed order as is a staff recommended it and as it um was issued um and then it Council amends or rejects the proposed order that's when we go into that material change hearing now under the statute um the department is required to issue notice of this um of a you know hearing to adopt a final order and that procedural boss was checked um because we included that provision in um when we issued the agenda for this meeting so that's how functionally how we've addressed that that notice um which there is is a part here and I apologize I'm going to go back because I totally skipped over um the that so we issued the proposed and in when we issue the proposed order we um as a council knows for applications new applications there's an automatic contested case compared to an amendment where individuals have to request a contested case so the contested case um at the conclusion when there is an opportunity for parties who um commented on the draft proposed order to submit a petition for contested case no petitions were received so the hearing officer functionally opens and closes the contested case and so she issued her the her order concluding the contested case on February 17th um so at the conclusion of the contested case which technically there was one there was just no parties um Council shall issue a final order either approving or rejecting the application so as we've gone through before there's the standards and the question council's asking itself is the preponderance of evidence uh support the conclusion that the applicant has met the applicable standards rules um and laws that apply to the facility and again preponderance of evidence is it more more likely than not that the standard has been that that is under so as a reminder where are we um just back in was it November we were in beautiful Hermiston in Umatilla um the facility site is a relatively small site compared to what um fsac does uh review we are at looking at a 324 Acre Site boundary um kind of right outside um of Hermiston and um the applicant is EE West End LLC a subsidiary of Urus solar Holdings and years energy related supporting facility or supporting facilities associated with this project are um uh centralized or dispersed battery storage system system a substation and then switch our switch yard Sun station which would interconnect with an existing transmission line um one of the items of note that is the focus of this application is um that a couple of benefits of this site is that there is a very there is basically no access road there's an access driveway off of the main road there which maybe I'll go but we can look at this and it's a little bit hard to read um but the road on the right hand screen there is the applicant would put can you uh make sure just because the uh council members Hal and Devlin can't see it they're running it on their own so just sort of clarifies okay council members Powell and Devlin I'm on the project overview slide that has kind of a more detailed layout of the facility so um the applicant is not proposing the transmission line um with this facility because it's proposing to interconnect with one of three transmission lines that run adjacent to or over the site boundary um as we can see here the facility layout has kind of avoided the corridors for the two existing transmission lines that crisscross over the facility site um and but the substation and switching station are more to the East End next to the road um because the applicant anticipates uh connecting into the UEC line that that runs parallel to the site so this is you know keep this in mind and we have another figure when we're talking about the the goal Inception and the locational dependencies is one of those sites that really minimizes facility components and other impacts because of its location relative to the existing transmission Corridor and existing access routes um let's see so part of the other leaders supporting facilities common to solar facilities is there will be a 34.5 KV uh collector lines there would be interior Service Roads um the applicant is proposing that the site boundary be a micro sighting Corridor so even though we're looking at this facility layout here this is not what they would be bound to they would be able to move facility components anywhere within their subject to the site certificate conditions so there are conditions that um represent a setback on this Southern portion where there the are those um pivot circles there's a um for setbacks from the fence line from there and then you know under the uh I think it might be cult the cultural condition Orlando's condition they're set back from the facility components to those transmission lines which is also related to a wildfire Etc I'm now going to move into the standards that I'm going to focus on so I'm going to move to the organizational expertise slide council members online um do any council members have any questions about the proposed facility so the council's organizational expertise uh requires that the council determined whether the applicant has the abilities and resources to build and operate a retirement facility um turning compliance with the standard the council considers the applicant's past experience with similar projects regulatory citations and evidence of technical managerial organizational expertise now part of the standard does contemplate the applicant's access to technical expertise and the applicant's past performance we know for um for the projects that are proposed to counsel most have the vast majority have a specific LLC Associated or Project Specific LLC associated with it however many applicants rely on the technical expertise of the parent company because the Project Specific LLC doesn't actually have it's proposing the application but it doesn't have um you know it's representative uh assets or operational base to provide that demonstration so part of the standard does contemplate access to those resources now to the the sen the second organizational expertise slide um this is again a summary of what we talked about um or what the applicant provided in response to comments on the draft proposal order from from Council and this is um or what was also in the Draco post order is that the applicant your energies uh past development experience of renewable energy projects um the applicant does have experience with a um a Wind Facility in Oregon and then other solar facilities in the United States and so these are findings that are also woven into the proposed order um let's see in the staff report and in a table of section 3C it's kind of the procedural History part of the proposed order the department included a table which is kind of a crosswalk in between the comments provided on the draft proposed order and ultimately the ultimate deposition or what what we did with that and where the closed order you can find that so the applicant did have some some comments on some organizational expertise conditions or one of them to which um the department uh I think the department predominantly agreed with all of the applicants um comments on condition language and and made those changes that set this organizational expertise condition the department uh maintains the original so um sometimes we remember back in time so we by the DPO hearing where members of the public and Council commented um on the on the record of the DPO and then after and then the applicant requested to leave the record open for two weeks to respond the comments and then that closed and after that closes that triggers councils for the next procedural step of its review of the DPO so um and so based on council's review of the DPO which happens in December um we had uh a pretty lengthy discussion we had tweetened this organizational expertise condition and had this kind of fine year review I don't know if council member council's members remember that that um we originally had some draft language a five-year review of incident reports and then we unpacked that and ultimately went away with adding in in this what I'm just kind of collectively calling the incident report organizational expertise condition uh this is what we reflected how we understood what council members wanted and it does relate to then this modification in the in the return Financial Assurance condition now these two can function together but since they also live in separate conditions they can also kind of function separately do the council members want me to read it or explain it or discount the number do accounts just cancel questions about ultimately what we did so it's a pause a second um council member Devlin talk to or truant do any of you have any questions or comments at this time Vice chair how okay well we're getting nothing so I um either councilmember Condon council member pond in here and just to say I think that you get a really good job about three um the extent of the conversation thank you okay we're Trucking all right we're going to keep on going and so and just as Council understands we do reflect and update in the findings you know support for for these revisions and I just like to remind uh the council members who are not present please just feel free to speak up we're looking and watching but it may even easier for you just to say excuse me uh so we don't miss you and you can be timely with your comments so I'm going to now uh move on to the Landview standard um and I will um jump in here so uh I've provided in the staff report um and in that summary table the applicant had several um comments about revisions to some land use conditions which the department conferred with and agreed with and we've reviewed those um in council's review of the DPO um so those um largely kind of updating tax slots and then removing semi-clickable criteria that didn't apply to the um as confirmed",

        "text": " timer so i may have missed a part of the end there um there's sort of like an overarching piece where in the northwest the hydropower system has such great economic benefit that payback is a lot longer for smaller projects without grants or subsidies so it's kind of an overarching comment that was a thread throughout but there is a local benefit from the installers that may work on smaller scale projects in terms of jobs in the local community and one of the specific pieces there was those types of dogs jobs are likely to be very local in nature and stay in the there was also a discussion about how in ashland there's been a lot of work to incentivize solar on rooftops and that's actually kept ashland from reaching the tier 2 bonneville rate um i think the the quote there was that it's a 20 average megawatts but there's 4.5 megawatts of rooftop solar and so even though currently tier two power is cheaper than tier one a few years ago that wasn't the case and the dynamics might be going back to that and then there was also indirect economic benefit as it relates to jobs kind of like a in terms of health impacts there is recognition of high heat events and having the ability to have cooling centers or warming centers depending on what the event is like there's also some discussion that a big focus of health impacts is really on transportation related emissions since the region is so hydro-dominated already has sort of less localized pollution from from that but in terms of climate and greenhouse gas emission reduction mark mentioned the gorilla in the room in in lane county is their landfill and they did do an rfp for some anaerobic digestion consideration but there's a lot of steps before being able to build that and the generation wouldn't necessarily compensate for the cost of building that out so it didn't really pencil out there's also interest on you know using methane emissions from landfill instead um replacement for um you know natural gas as an alternative and northwest natural might have a a different uh or higher kind of incentive to to do that rather than the electric utilities a lot of discussion i would say primarily on resilience impacts you know talking about developing especially in conjunction to public works buildings in in local jurisdictions where there might be opera emergency operations but it was kind of a note that even if there was um you know some sort of value stream for carbon emission reduction diesel generators are still so much and so a struggle to sort of get to pencil out on a micro grid even if there is interest in a microgrid the likelihood is you would probably still keep the diesel generator as like an additional backup from that tom also agreed with the sort of emergency operations center and data centers ashland as being a ripe for an interest in um in a micro grid there is also discussion about wildfire and public safety power shut ups shutoffs and customers being more in to find other options for backup generation and battery storage also net metered customers or looking for battery components as well to add that um storage component so while um you know wildfire is a huge burden for the state to navigate it is kind of making clear that those conversations about dispatchable generation and battery storage is is going to be helpful for resilience benefits let's see we talked about cooling shelters for communities um could be at the emergency operation center that kind of came up in the resilience um and then there was a interesting discussion about time of day pricing as well as other rate structures that could help encourage behavior like if you had a smaller scale renewable energy project that had battery storage and if there was the ability to switch to a different power source if there was high demand on the grid because of um ac use for example so we talked about residential demand work peak rebates time of use in general making better use of solar and storage that's more dispatchable lots of opportunities there um okay that was a sum up anything to add hannah mark ryan or tom all right um let's we're i i will clean this up before it goes out and gather more notes um just so you know i know this is a mess right now um but for the next one we are going to do one more breakout and this one might have to be just 15 minutes linda just because of time considerations to make sure we have time to wrap up at the end um but for this one we're going to focus on the other side of things the costs so the unique costs associated with small-scale renewable energy projects and we're going to come up with a similar list like we just did okay so linda if you want to take the show and get us into our breakout groups right are we just about all back linda do you know if there's still people coming back in they all should be back okay perfect all right so i scrapped my fancy table and i'm just going bullets this time all right so if group one wouldn't mind getting going with some of the costs that they are so the cost that we identified i think we're largely around um and again i want to invite dan and diane to jump in um at any point to add or correct but they were largely identified around there's there's expenses involved in these smaller organizations uh having to engage in the process of of citing of looking for interconnection all of these things that are more expensive to do because of the time involved for someone who's not a part of an organization that regularly works on these things so that could be a utility or maybe a large independent power producer and so you know specifically we identified some things such as there is of course a scale of of development you're always going to have a con well not always but often have economies of scale when you build larger facilities versus these smaller smaller facilities it's also there's a higher cost involved in the citing process simply because of the time investment that's needed for someone who's not familiar with or doesn't work through this process as part of their regular job there's a lack of coordination between utilities independent power producers communities and other entities that are interested in small scale community renewables and that also leads to sort of this lack of the developers small scale developers being able to um easily move forward in development there's just a lot of different pieces playing and um whereas a utility and a large independent power producer may be able to synergize some of their relationships to make these things run more smoothly again investments of time um was the the lack here um and uh let's see i'm looking one more just general knowledge and skill sets for people working on these smaller they may not have deciding requirements knowledge or the interconnection data or knowledge to be able to easily work through some of those those factors and larger utilities do this type of planning for investments through their irp work whereas these these projects are going to be done outside of that and kind of have to fit into planning work that's been done by others rather than sort of being done at the beginning of a opportunity whether that's irp or something else so i think i captured it but please dan diane if there's anything i missed jump i like it thank you appreciate the yeah i think i would just add one small piece which is it sounds like the california puc is um is starting to tackle some of that coordination between different groups may not be happening maybe we should look to as a model all right group two that's us right christy we were grouped sure nikita okay cool um yeah so i can kick it off and um if i forget anything or leave anything out um i think my team members can uh fill in the gap so we talked about um i think this was brought up in in the first one as well um the cost imposed by the learning curve so there might be a lack of experience um i think as the previous group mentioned particularly true for the interconnection space and contracting we talked about something that might not necessarily be a cost but a challenge that just needs to be navigated and planned for um so it's the uh like a relationship um uh between workforce development from large between larger scale and smaller scale um so you tend to get generally get larger workforce training hours and larger skill construction but it but we talked about the fact that there are ways to address this for smaller scale renewables and so this may just require better planning we talked a bit about what the current union um practices and opportunities are for for specifically pge um and some question marks that still exist and um maybe some challenges around um union density for utility projects or um or sorry for for public projects and wages tending to be lower for community scale projects um but that might be something that's changing uh and we talked about transaction costs that are associated with maybe bringing benefits to communities so through contractual arrangements so this might be more work and engagement during the development phase so also i would say a benefit and also a uh and then we spent some time talking about um investment risk um and so talking about like um the fact that capital development in this in this uh space isn't risk-free um that it could be exposing folks to financial loss we had some clarifications about this so to the extent that community members are investing in projects this could be a cost risk to them particularly around production and performance um of projects so making sure that projects are doing what their anticipated expected required to do um and if the projects aren't funded by community they're funded by investors so there might also be a risk um for investors of a project versus risk to a community and this depends on what the um how the how the project is attributed i feel like i probably missed a lot in that risk conversation um but uh let's see i think i had some other notes yeah so depending on who is exposed to the risks can have disproportionate impacts um on smaller communities who um in their ability to maybe where where you know whether an event um and again that's production and performance risk specifically um yeah i will i probably like i said probably missed a lot there so um if i missed anything i'll open it up to um to my group members or if i miss um uh communicated something that would agree to me all right um it was just uh steve huffleman and myself for group three um and he graciously allowed me to be the speaker um that was a joke uh invite we talked about the cost of environmental impact i'm not going to type these because i'm not",

        "text": " about what might come out of these conversations is added steps or requirements around Community engagement that would weigh down an already difficult path to getting a project built the goal of this work group is the least to avoid that while still finding ways to help ensure that communities feel the benefits of projects and have a voice in the process one possible idea that has been discussed is better enabling or incentivizing Community benefits agreements and giving projects that utilize them a faster track drop up I'll forecast what the next few weeks look like and also encourage anyone who has not yet gotten involved that there is still time to help generate strategies and help shape any outcomes I'm especially interested um excuse me uh we meet on Fridays from 1 to 3 P.M and today we're throwing a lot of ideas spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks we'll then take a much needed year-end break and return to flesh out the strategy ideas by identifying the agency venue the mechanisms such as rulemaking or legislation the timeline the lift and any key details it's important to note that not all potential ideas may not be legislation or any for that matter although as I mentioned there will be a vehicle introduced to enable that and that is legislative Concepts 1887 and 1888 which are the placeholders I also want to forecast some of the ideas that are percolating but are by no means inevitable that may impact FS work amending or making new rules for goal 13 to broadly incorporate renewable energy sources creating Pathways to expedite permitting that also help to improve Community process and local control whether through mapping or energy Zone identification to identify low conflict areas or through Community benefits agreements or by lowering thresholds for larger projects to go through the county aligning the land use goal exception process with fsec thresholds providing resources for communities local governments and tribal governments to better engage with the citing process improve tribal consultation and timing of consultation particularly figuring out how to implement uh the language uh in section 2 of HP 2021 that requires that that bill be implemented with attention to tribal consultation defining and supporting early engagement for communities impacted by project citing without adding steps to the citing process giving fsec more power uh to give input on transmission routes and changing the repowering thresholds to make it easier to add capacity to existing lines which is something that Lara Tabor from The Nature Conservancy mentioned briefly this work is a tall order and these are not easy topics I'm incredibly grateful for all the folks who step with the process and are now delving in with enthusiasm and creativity and especially to the people who felt concerns at what might come but have had Faith nonetheless this kind of collaborative work is only possible when we're willing to set aside assumptions and dig in with humor and Grace uh thank you for your time and the other presenters for their incredible leadership and partnership I'm happy to answer any questions as are the other presenters and have shared my contact information if folks want to reach out to engage or with questions comments or concerns and I'll stop sharing my screen uh for the question and answer portion thank you Brianna any questions comments from Council this is Kent and I have a question regarding the local process of student what are you seeing as far as the timing of applications being processed and going through the appeals for our assets at the local level I'm interested in what you're observing so far with that my personal observation this is Mike McArthur uh chair Grail um video eventual energy Association what I've seen is uh that many of the uh processes that the fsec is bound to follow are able to be expedited at the local level um I'm not I don't have a strong uh record on understanding the appeals process but I do understand that um those appeals periods can delay projects significantly and I think it's worth taking a look at the time that is required uh or is allowed for an appeal to go forward but developers tell me that the local process is quicker we're including Appeals and vice chair how I'll I'll jump in as well just to share some Reflections we've heard from local governments that one of the challenges with the appeals process not only is there that issue of time that potentially gets added but um uh in particular in a small community like the one I live in in Lake County uh uh County Commissioners who are in a very tight-knit Community are required to make decisions that inevitably make someone upset uh but then the appeals process may come through uh either through Luba um or through other uh venues in the state and then that overturns a decision that the county then feels like well we had to make this it caused Strife in the community But ultimately we didn't have the control to to make and stand by that decision as well so I think that that's a thing to consider as well as not only the timelines but the relationship impacts of how the state process and local process interact um thank you for the presentation today I am curious um it certainly takes longer it sounds like it takes longer I'm not sure it doesn't be interesting to see the evidence of that um but the F7 projects tend to be larger and do you not see that the larger projects may take just much longer and is the time for the process to that the process takes under epsac lengthened due to developers uh taking the time in their application materials or do stakeholders sitting at the table uh point to fsac or other reviewing agencies well I think chair Grail um counselor Condon I think you've got the expert sitting right there at the table I mean hanley's been through the process both both ways and I think would have a lot more expertise on this than I do and it just seems to me that uh because the fsec tries to do the same process for every kind of project counties don't necessarily need to do that so that can expedite the process to Graham yes and so thank you to uh Vermeil and the organizers this is Sam Meyer um just first thank you for having the Transmissions committee because I think that is a huge issue for us all to think about but also um recognizing the tension between streamlining any process while still providing opportunity for public involvement and that's something I know upset struggles with making sure we get comments while still keeping the projects on track so it's just something we need to all be cautious of as we move forward on an increase as someone said very complex issues so thank you for your efforts other questions comments Patrick Brian this is uh Patrick with the Department of Justice you mentioned that your the group is looking at uh legislative Concepts that might include measures for Expediting permitting is there a particular of the subgroups that you've broken up out into is there a particular subgroup that is looking at that or are you doing it as the large group there is not a specific subgroup that is looking at that particular issue um it is something that is coming up in a couple of the work groups uh one uh on um the local process side of the conversation and also in land use where we're talking about how do we reduce conflict in the citing process and how do we help expedite process when uh something like um citing in a renewable energy zone or a place that Community has indicated is a lower conflict area um that that could be a way to get expedited process we're also talking about in the value system groups with regard to community benefits agreement so it's coming up kind of across the board and there are a number of different strategy ideas that I think are starting to percolate in different work groups which is one of the things that I find heartening in this process is that there is a a clear set of issues that are coming up some of which have been discussed today that are coming up in multiple work groups which means there's a lot of resonance and that these are potentially very durable strategies and I know um Diane's got a camera on so I'll see if she wants to jump in and perhaps had some things to share uh about the the length of the offsec process and some of the the barriers that might be associated with that as well thanks to Ariana uh yes chair Grill and members of the council sorry my I didn't jump in during the I didn't find my camera button quick enough to answer when uh to commissioner condon's question earlier but I I thought that Mike McArthur offered a pretty good A very good explanation and I'll just add um you know referencing back to the April presentation that we made to the council is we did look at some of the timelines that renewable projects follow or take and um you know comparing the large versus small yes there probably is some element to that of the timeline around how large of a project and Supply finding Workforce all of those things however I think it would be worth and perhaps There's an opportunity in the in the upset review process coming up next year and in the survey that just went out to stakeholders of comparing what actually is different between the county and the fsec process uh from our understanding it it's the difference is quite significant um in the permitting timeline um and uh I'd have to look ask for some more input from our members to be feel confident in giving that assessment also however I can say with confidence that the other implication is the costs of going between the can the county level permitting versus the fsec process the cost difference is quite significant um but I don't want to downplay the the difference in issues or the issues that both small and large projects face in terms of interconnection transmission and then also uh the community outreach and engagement piece of it and making sure stakeholders have an equal Voice or a sufficient time to interact those are cross-cutting between those two so I just wanted to add a couple more thoughts on that thank you thank you this is a varsi grill I just have a question so I don't know so one of the things that I know we get pressured with from the public is we didn't have time to review we didn't have enough time to look and we so as you offer those comments I'm just curious if local processes have you know such structured requirements we have very specific ones that were mandated to do and many of you could comment on that I'd just be curious so generally renewable energy applications go through a conditioned use process there is a department of land conservation development lcdc administrative rules for solar projects and the exclusive Army zones and for wind that are specific and they do have um specific criteria for",

        "text": " Gantt. Thank you. Mike Huber. Behind Mister Huber, we've got Janae Brown. Thank you. Janice Garvinhouse. Kathy Chesteen. Come on down, please. You'll be behind. Mister Huber? Mister Huber. Name and address for the record. Mike Huber. 1715 Northwest 114th Loop, Ocala, 34475. I also own 43 acres just on the west side of 329, basically adjacent to the site we're talking about. Like the person that talked before, I also moved to Marion county for horses. I came from the Dallas Fort Worth area, where, similar to Miami, there's not a lot of regard anymore for horse life. And the farmland area is something. The preservative area was something attractive to move to with my horses, and it would set such the wrong message moving forward to developers. It would change everything. And Marion county prides itself on being the horse capital of the world. And I think if you go that direction, that could likely change. The only other thing that I would like to say that hadn't really been brought up. There's been a lot in the previous meetings about the schools and so forth and about the truck stops on the corner and the traffic. I get all that. The main through fare for the trucks that come through there are the crossover from I 95 to I 75. Those are the trucks that come down 301 to go on to 441, then they turn on 326 to get to 75 to go south. There are, having traveled that road from Jacksonville to Tampa numerous times doing horse shows. There are numerous truck stops, plenty of truck stops that are outside of our horse preservation area. And the need isn't there, in my opinion, for a truck stop in the middle of our area. There are plenty to choose from. In fact, there's a new one going in, I understand, I 75 and 27. So there's yet another truck stop here in Ocala. So I just don't see the need for this location in this type of land usage to, you know, jeopardize the whole thing. Thank you, mister heaver. I would just like to say, if you're referring to Bucky's coming in. Oh, okay, great. Thank you. Because that's not a truck stop. Okay. I believe that it's on the corner of 75 where there's a. There's a horse trailer place there right now. Okay. It's on 27 and 75. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, sir. And behind. Miss Chistine, you can come on down, please. I've got Karen coffin, who will wave. Mitchell McClary. Okay. Laura Fitzpatrick. Okay, Miss Chistine. My name is Kathy Chistine. I live at Northwest 126th Street, Cetra Florida 32113. I live, like, right there. So I dealt with the traffic every day. I could be your expert witness if you wanted to. There's crashes there all the time. And anyway, besides that, the cause. I travel to work both every day, trying to get onto the road and off the road. It's like saying prayer every day that you survive all the trucks and all that stuff that goes through. My thought is if you added anything there, even an ice cream stand or something, that would be even more pleasant. That would be wrong anyway. But just cause you're adding more to that area, there's truck stop 20 miles north and 15 miles south. And then there's. You got the ones that are 75. So there's real no need for it. Those areas that are there right now could handle a truck if they needed to get gas if they wanted to. But adding anything else there would be just terrible. They revamped that area a little bit, and I. Maybe it's gotten a little bit better, but there's still accidents there all the time. Coming home from work the other day, there was one going northbound, and like I said, I live less than a half a mile away. So what else was I. There's the schools there, and I don't know. Thank you, Miss Cheste. Before you walk away, our attorney would like to speak for just a moment. So a question. This particular type of limited commercial use, if it were granted in this area, the theoretical idea or the purported idea is for the benefit of the farmers. And I'm talking about the language of the code. But my question to you is, if it was there, would you use it? I would not. Okay. The only benefit I could see, potentially it might decrease the gas prices in the area. But, no, I would not use it. Thank you. It would give another challenge to the area for that. Thank you. And I had to plan to take time off today to come here. So I cannot come back on March 19, which I think March 19 is a long date out. Why would you have that date out? That far out? That's the date that was requested. And it's like two months. Yes, that is correct. But we also have other scheduled items that are already on our agenda. Okay. Would you like to share? I just would like to say. And that type of testimony is testimony. That's right. That helps in our decision making. Just for everyone that's there. Right there immediately. And also they're adding more homes to our area with is going to add to the well. And you're correct, that revamp did not. I think it made it worse. If you don't get in that left hand lane to go north and you're screwed. Yeah, sorry. The right hand. Thank you, Miss Chest. If you don't get in that right hand lane, I think it's worse. We're not going to debate that, but thank you very much. Miss Justine probably won't be back on the 19th, so thank you. But your testimony is part of the record today and it will not be forgotten by this. Correct. Mindy Morrow. And behind Miss Morrow is Gregory Baer. Mister Bean. Thank you. Mister Bean. And John Haver. Thank you. If you'd like to come on down and be on deck. Yes, Miss Morrow. Aye, Mindy Morrow. 12680 North US Highway 441. Citra 32113. My property. The north side of my property will be completely affected because it butts up to this racetrack. I moved here 19 years ago to live in an ag area, purchased here knowing that everything around me was agricultural. I run a non profit off my property for the last 19 years called horses and heroes. I work with young girls and retired show horses and racehorses and don't want the traffic, don't want the lights. My home is on that property along with my farm. And don't want the influence of what goes on at a truck stop, the kids hanging out there. I don't want the lights affecting like right now at night, it's quiet there. My horses have peace, my paddocks and my riding ring all back up to that property. And that's what I would like to maintain. So I didn't know if I can be here on the 19th, so I definitely wanted to speak today. Well, thank you. Your comments will stay on public record and they will not be forgotten when we meet again on the 19th. Yes, mister John Haven. Thank you, Mister Haven. I'm sorry that I'm trying to read everyone's writing and also have Margaret Lundock. Okay, go right ahead. John Haven. 22 50 Northwest 135th Lane in Citra. I won't go over the save the farmlands because I think we all get that? My wife and I moved here in 1995 because we wanted to live in an ag area and we have horses and we'd like to continue to do that. The traffic, I think your own staff highlighted very well how dangerous that intersection is. And barring having a more comprehensive dot solution to that whole interchange area, I feel like it's irresponsible to try to add something as extensive as a truck stop to that area and the amount of traffic that that would bring to that already dangerous intersection, which all of us commute through. Two schools worth of school buses go through, the teachers, the staff, etcetera. That's just a really bad idea. Beyond that, as our attorney asked the question, would you use this? Absolutely not. There is no need, as everybody else has said, for a fuel location. There. There's already two gas stations. They serve diesel, they serve gasoline. You can get propane. There's nothing that those of us that live there need. And as other people have already said, there's plenty of diesel stops for the big trucks that are already developed north, south and west of us. It's already on the flight path that those trucks go. We don't need to add at another stop. That's just going to add danger to the people that already live there. Thank you, Mister Haven. That's it. Thank you, Evangeline Linkus. Thank you, Dana Cawthron. While we're waiting, Mary Froth both. Thank you. Hello. Hello. Dana Cawthon. 150 West Highway 329 Citra, Florida. Last time y'all saw me, I was Van Wagner. So it's been a while quickly. I am definitely opposite of people have spoke here, but I think it's for different reasons than what they think. I am third generation farmer. I live and own the property across the street from North Marion High School. So I run 400 heads of cattle, and I also run a shavings mill that makes horse bedding. So I",

        "text": " we'll take over the presentation from here thanks rob so the program will provide grants for planning and constructing renewable energy and energy resilience projects uh opportunity announcements were posted on march 7th and there were four of them one for each of the project categories 12 million dollars was made available between the four opportunity and more opportunity announcements will be announced after this round closes uh with additional funds online applications are now open and we will only be accepting applications through the online application next slide please opportunity announcements outline the minimum required information for a complete application as well as detailing how applications will be scored during the review process this includes required information about the project the applicant and partners and consultation with different stakeholders and groups following a review of applications to make sure they contain all the required information and are eligible for the the applications will undergo a competitive review process assessing the strength of the project and its feasibility as well as how the project meets the program's priorities and targeted benefits the scoring criteria include topics such as the project leadership and involvement of environmental justice jobs and economic development direct energy cost savings for families and small businesses inclusion of inclusive hiring and promotion policies procurement of services from disadvantaged businesses assisting with natural hazard mitigation plans and geographic and project diversity the grants will be awarded on a competitive basis at this point we don't know how many grants will be awarded and how the funding will be distributed across the four categories how the funding will be distributed will depend on the number and strength of applications in different buckets along with the required funding allocation state and legislation next slide please so the online application is available now and after we get to the slides i'll be able to kind of walk you through it um but you can access it from the community renewable energy grant program web page uh the arrow points to one of the the links you'll be able to access it through next slide please you can also access it from uh odo's customer service portal by clicking the drop down and the financial incentives uh menu at the top next slide please uh before i get on to walking through the application i wanted to just kind of talk about the process with applicants and this is kind of the flowchart shows we've extended the deadline for applications until july um and if you have any questions about the opportunity announcements please submit them by june 17th again we've accented that deadline as well this will allow staff time to respond and post answers online before the flows of the application period there are resources on our crep website the community renewable energy program website uh including a checklist of information um the applicants will need to gather some q a uh summarizing questions we've received so far from potential applicants and our responses to those and also a list of resources that applicants may find helpful particularly demonstrating um how that community fits one of the qualified community definitions are in terms of the resiliency benefits following the close of the application there will be reviewed after which the successful projects will be offered a performance agreement while unsuccessful projects will be able to reapply in future opportunity applicants will be able to request up to 30 of the grant funding upon signing a performance agreement for the construction grants the applicant must have taken meaningful steps to seek site control file the request for interconnection with a host utility or appropriate transmission provider and met any other requirements provided by the department in the performance agreement to be eligible to receive that following the signing of the performance next though please so thanks for listening i'm gonna briefly briefly show you the application um and then we'll be happy to take uh any questions you have regarding the program or uh any specific information you would like more detail on um so i will just share my screen now one second so you should all be seeing the portal where we can access the digital so you'll see i'm actually signed in to the digital application so if you're coming in for the first time you'll need to register a profile or if you're coming in having logged off previously you'll need to sign back in you'll be able to access the application from this drop down menu um and if you have uh you can learn more uh you can complete planning or construction you can amend your applications that will actually withdraw your application until you submit any amendments if you're amending an application and you'd also be able to view the status of your application or withdraw it fully uh in consideration if you want to kind of work on your application then come back to it if you click back on the whichever application you're applying for it will take you back to the last saved place so here we go so uh once you access your uh select an application to apply for um you'll be given information about the eligibility requirements for the program and asked to confirm whether or not you and the program projects meet those so i've kind of all right so i can answer quickly answer that question from jenny it does save uh partial applications so this is me having filled out an application and every time you click the next button um down at the bottom here it saves the pro uh what you've put in um there are required fields so uh those have to be filled in before you can go to the next page but it will save at that point and if you leave that page and come back and you select uh you'll be able to kind of go back into the planning you will need to complete a planning application before you can start an another application now and so you'll be able to submit application information trying to see if i can see the chat uh i could i can help you with the chat i think i was gonna just wait for the questions because they're more like they're less about the application other than the one you just saw okay um there is one that is about the application now oh no there's a bunch of new up new ones okay um so one was we'll be we'll be able to get a list of the questions so we can prepare responses offline and yes there is a document like that um maybe patricia can grab the link for it we'll need we still need to uh publish that we haven't published it yet okay i didn't realize that okay well we do have one that seems ready to go we just need to get it online um but yes we'll have that it's almost like a checklist of like what information you need to have with and then information information needed is available already and published the list of questions that are in there is uh is not as different oh okay they're very like the thing that i'm talking about the checklist i think does the trick for what is being asked and then jenny followed up with the two two applications and i think you already answered that that you would need to do one and then you could start another one is that right yes you would need to complete one application if it was planning you could start a planning and the construction and you could have those going at the same time but you would need to complete uh planning uh before you could start another planning application and then one question was can multiple parties work on the same application i would assume they could if they're using the same um login yes so i'm just it would have to be the same login to be able to access the same application you probably wouldn't want to be working on two separate computers on the same application at the same time um but uh you would be able to kind of independently work on it yeah and then the next question was can we download a word version of the application which is i think the thing that you're talking about that we haven't posted yet yep we're working on that and then there's now a link to the check-in and then jenny hall again which is the login based on your email address uh you do need an email address to log you'll have a username and you can either use your email address as your username or you can have to create a as well and then the rest of the questions i see i think of is ones that are less about the application and more general so i will just work through those once we get to the q a if you want to finish going through so here first page is about the application information um and that is just about your applicant organization um and you'll also be asked down the bottom here to provide an applicant contact details uh and i'll be the person that odo will contact with commit questions about the application um or any how the application is progressing at the bottom you're asked whether you're partnering with another organization i'm not um to walk you through it i've said yes so we can kind of see this here you'll be able to fill in information about the applicants to add more applicants you just click on the add partner button um over here and it pops up a little screen and you can submit your information about the partner uh if you want to remove it or edit them you can select that either side there and then ask you whether you're as a reminder for some partners you need to provide documentation as well we find that information of what documentation is required for instance for a private business it has to be located in oregon and you can just uh upload those files uh down at the bottom um here as well and then for consultants if you you're using a consultant or contractor you can add in some information about uh the contractor if you're not it's not required uh you can also say if you get to this page also it's not currently known or you can um so that's fine it just allows us to better assess the project team if you put if you have a contract when you're using and then you put information about them in so then we go through um and you're able to start putting information in about the project itself and so starting with the description of the stakeholder and as you go through the application should be able to follow along with the opportunity announcement that you're applying for um as the flow of questions wherever possible follows the order of questions in the minimum required information section of the opportunity announcement there are a couple of additional questions that stem from the competitive review section that come into appropriate places in the but for the most part it kind of follows that minimum required information section of the opportunity announcement um and so if you have looking for more details you'll be able to kind of work your way through those as well so there are sections can i ask a question that's related to what you're talking about yes great are there word limits on these sections that you're walking us through um",

        "text": "sorry guys a lot of talking on mute always exciting i'm just saying we're getting ready to get started um we're just going to give people a few minutes because we just opened the webinar and so some people might have been getting like uh not open yet message and for those of you who called in if you want to get on the webinar um not on your phones because they see a couple of you on the phone it might have been that you were getting that message so go ahead and you can try now and the webinar is open now and thanks everyone for joining us we'll get started in just a minute or so okay hopefully by now everyone's had a chance to to get on um again if you had a if you had trouble getting on you can try again we just didn't have the webinar fully open and so some people were seeing an error um we're really excited to have such great turnout so thank you so much for joining us by way of introductions my name is christy split and i'm the oregon department of energy's government relations coordinator and i'll facilitate our conversation today i'd really like to thank the special districts association of oregon and the oregon association of clean water agencies for bringing us all together for what i think is an exciting opportunity for oregon's communities an energy resilience and renewable energy grant program that can support both planning and projects so as we get started i hope everyone can just take a minute and introduce yourselves in the chat be great to get your name um what sort of district you're representing where you're located that would all be really great information for us and to kind of help us all get to know who's in the crowd a little bit better so please take a minute to do that and hopefully my department of energy colleagues can do the same um so let's see so just a quick note on agenda today we're gonna go over the program itself talk a little bit about a project example just to kind of get those creative juices flowing and give you an idea of the type of project we could imagine being funded for for this program and then we'll also you'll also be the first people to kind of get a tour through our application process we want to save plenty of time for q a so you can expect that our kind of program here at the beginning will run about 15 to 20 minutes and the bulk of our time together will be for you to ask questions of myself and our program staff so um we will ask that folks raise their hands and then we can unmute you to have you ask questions and then you can also raise questions in the ch ask questions in the chat and i'll keep an eye on those and i might wait to ask and um ask the questions in the chat during the qa and in a part or i might interrupt along the way so um so that's that's sort of our basic we are in webex which for those of you who saw the corrected link is just always sort of an interesting beast and a lot of us are more used to other webinar formats like zoom so i just wanted to quickly share just a little guides of what your screen should look like for some people it's black mine's black not white i don't know but other people see why i don't understand how how it's different for different people but whatever you're seeing you should see something like the screen here and then you should see information on the panel list and a place where the chat's located mainly i just want to make sure everyone sees that they how to raise your hand you can raise your hand at the very bottom where little smiley face is if you click on that raising your hand is the top option there there's also an option to raise your hand next to your name on in the margin so um feel free to take a look make sure that you know how to raise your hand and we'll give people a second to mess around with that if you have it i see a lot of people using the chat so you figured that out but if you have any questions feel free to raise your hand and i can call on you if you have any specific questions about the agenda you can put that in the chat let's give a awkward moment of silence for that to happen and then we do have a couple of people on the phone a good reminder from a colleague just now um i believe you just i i it's one stars three and one star six and i always get worried but um i believe you click star three to raise your hand and then star six to unmute so um i'll confirm that and say it again in a minute um the next time i have an opportunity to talk because oh i did it right so star three to raise your hand star six to unmute so um that's how you'll participate so i don't see any questions in the chat although i do see lots of great introductions from around the state and we'll just move on to the program and like i said we'll get have plenty of time for q a after we kind of run through run through our pro prepared piece here so um for now i'm going to hand things over to rob delmar and to james cogle who are certified smart people when it comes to this new program so rob i'll go to the next slide and let you go thank you christy and i'm rob delmar i'm a senior policy analyst with oregon department of energy and i helped to put this program together over the last six months or so um house bill 2021 also known as the 100 clean energy for all bill established the new community renewable energy grant program and the purpose of the program as stated in the bill is to offset costs of planning and developing community renewable energy support projects in traditionally underserved communities promote small-scale community renewable energy projects and finally provide direct benefits to communities by improving energy resilience creating local jobs promoting economic development and offsetting local energy costs next slide please so one of the features that distinguishes this program from previous programs in oregon is that it's only open to public bodies applicants include tribes cities counties and other public bodies including these special districts and there is an exclusion in the bill for cities over 500 000 which in oregon of course includes only the program is also open to consumer-owned utilities the portland exclusion was done in recognition of the portland clean energy which can provide funding for similar types of projects within portland and so next slide please focus of the program another feature of the program is its focus on community energy resilience the bill establishes carve-outs where 50 or more of the funding must go to community energy resilience projects and 50 or more of the funding must be for projects that serve qualifying and we'll look at what that means in a next slide please so qualifying communities include communities of color low-income communities tribal rural and coastal communities and other traditionally underrepresented communities in oregon the definition of the bill is is fairly we're hoping to see projects kind of in every corner of the state according to these um you know the carve out to get 50 of the funds to these communities next slide please the bill also called for an advisory to work with the department of energy on program design and now program you'll see that clean water agencies had allen johnson from city aggression gresham representing clean water agencies we also have les perkins of the farmer's irrigation district on our committee and so we had a really good group of folks help us put this together and they're going to continue to help us implement the program next slide please since the passage of house bill 2021 we've been very busy standing up the new in the summer of 2021 photo staff were assigned to the project and developed an implementation plan including operational staffing and i.t changes within the agency in september we recruited the stakeholder advisory committee to help guide the program design develop the program rules and that effort resulted in draft rules being posted with the secretary of state's office on january 1st and those rules are now final our opportunity announcements for the program came out on march 7th next slide so we before we move on to the specific grant opportunities i'd like to walk a project that the eugene water and electric board completed a few years ago and the city of eugene like much of western oregon could be subject to significant damage from a cascadia earthquake and as a utility that manages both electricity and water services e-web recognized the importance of energy and water delivery and was well positioned to support a resilience and disaster recovery within eugene that could address both the energy and water issues next slide please um so eweb considered community energy resilience based on the rule of threes and that is in the first three days provide access to drinking water in the first three weeks repower critical facilities and in the first three months complete system repairs and restore restore service next slide please so as a result of their planning efforts eweb developed the grid edge demonstration project and pictured over on the right hand side of the screen some of the elements the project utilized an existing 50 kilowatt pv system on the roof of the howard elementary school and added a battery storage system and a new potable water well next slide please and the result is a facility that can serve as a potable water fill station for the community in the event of a power outage the school building is also provided with backup power and serves as an emergency shelter the system provides value to the in addition to the value of the water and energy resilience features for example the school benefits from energy bill savings and e-web is able to use the batteries on this site to provide grid services during their day-to-day operations next slide this is a schematic diagram of the microgrid system showing electric loads that can be served by the system during a power so the battery storage units and they are shown as bess they're the black ones on the bottom battery energy storage systems those are able to provide power to the water well and the backup loads within the school and you can see that there's a switch shown at the main breaker and that's to ensure that this micro grid is isolated from the rest of eweb's power grid in the event of a power outage and that's to provide safety to their line workers and so now that the program is essentially up and running we've we've got staff to implement the",

        "text": " many renewable hydrogen roadmaps assume that it will take time to stand up markets for some of the end uses of hydrogen while others like say heavy-duty transportation are assumed to uh earlier applications another requirement is the assessment for the potential of coupling renewable electricity generation and renewable hydrogen production to increase or to provide flexible loads production of renewable hydrogen using electricity represents both an electric load that needs to be met with electricity but it can also be a flexible load in that it's highly amenable to being controlled directly by an electric utility when they might need to reduce demand and then renewable hydrogen can also be a resource for meeting electric load either through combustion in a turbine or via fuel cells and so that's what we'll be looking at as that study requirement and then the study report must also provide a discussion of the forecasted costs of renewable hydrogen and how these costs might affect adoption in the state now we're not going to be doing um any forecasting ourself uh the build does ask us to rely on existing data but we will certainly take that data and then look at it through the context of and finally the study must identify the many barriers to adoption of renewable hydrogen in so that's what's required for the study um because there are a lot of technical aspects to consideration of renewable we have decided to put together a technical advisory committee or tac and the goal of this tack is to have a group of technical experts from the public and non-profit sectors who can provide unbiased feedback on data sources to the extent possible study assumptions and other aspects of the study in putting together the tac we very much sought out those who could serve as experts without necessarily serving as advocates of a specific point of view as i said as much as possible so thus the attack is comprised of academic a national lab the power council our sister agency odot who is working on a study related to hydrogen in the transportation sector and then we also have uh nia the northwest energy efficiency alliance we also have some other folks that we've invited to the tech that we're still working with um that includes stanford university another national lab and and then you'll see here we have a couple of folks listed as experts on and those were some folks that were unable to participate in the tap due to time constraints but have offered to serve as experts on call and so this includes the national renewable energy lab and jc dream which is a washington organization focused on reducing the use of rare earth metal metals pardon me in energy applications including hydrogen so the timeline for this study is that it's due to the legislature in september on september 15 2022. so we have started work on the study this fall but the timeline shows the time remaining between now and september so the research and analysis portion of the study is going to be completed between now and hopefully mid quarter one of next year um january or february though that depends on how busy the legislative session keeps us and then after that we're going to begin drafting the study report in terms of communicating with you about the study we have envisioned three stakeholder workshops so today is the first one and then we expect to have one in the first quarter of 2022 that details the initial findings of the study and gives us an up gives you an opportunity to provide us some feedback and then another one in q2 that details those final findings and so the goal is to keep you informed um on the results of the study and then as i said to to provide you an opportunity to give feedback on those results for example did we miss an important piece of data or forget to include a relevant sector are the assumptions that we made in our analyses reasonable we will certainly also be asking these questions of our technical experts on the tag once the study is complete and report and the report is submitted to legislature we'll certainly follow up presentations on our findings as well so that's the study in a nutshell and i know you have questions or at least i hope you have questions and comments um but first as i said we're gonna go right into the hydrogen 101 and so that may answer some of the questions that you have about hydrogen and renewable hydrogen in general and perhaps about the study but also hopefully gives us a little bit of common ground so on to the 101 let's go over a few things about hydrogen what is it i'm so glad you asked no really um so hydrogen is easily the most abundant element in the universe it's in the sun it's in stars jupiter is mostly hydrogen here on earth most of our hydrogen is found in water there is a tiny little bit in our atmosphere um but it usually just escapes the atmosphere hydrogen is also the lightest element and it has the lowest density of all and compared to conventional fuels hydrogen has a low volumetric energy density in both gas and liquid form now you may have heard people refer to hydrogen as an energy carrier as opposed to an energy source and it's true energy sources are the original source of energy so think solar radiation in the form of sunlight or wind or hydrocarbons and some energy sources are also the energy carriers like fossil fuels in that they don't really need to be you know they their energy can be transported and used by energy consumers in the same or almost same form in which it was found but many energy sources have to first be converted to what we call an energy carrier um before we can actually use them so for example solar radiation has to hit pv panel so hydrogen thus is a carrier of the energy found in another energy resource so for example if you do steam reformation of natural gas or if you use a resource to generate electricity which is also an energy carrier and then use that to produce hydrogen as an energy fyi i use this information at cocktail parties all the time that gets us to those pathways for converting energy sources to hydrogen this chart is meant to confuse you i'm actually not um it's actually really um in that it shows some of the pathways production of hydrogen um but not all of them and so we have pathways here for computing converting fossil fuels to hydrogen and then um you know we have in red uh conversion pathways for nuclear energy and then what we're really interested in are those pathways that are green and so these are some of the pathways for producing hydrogen and so here are some diagrams that are hopefully easier to follow and so these show some of the main pathways for producing hydrogen from renewable sources of energy now down here we have renewable energy which is going to include renewable electricity from wind and solar and one way that we use that produce hydrogen is electrolysis and that may be the pathway that most of you are familiar with and that's where you run electricity through water to crack it into its components of hydrogen and oxygen but it is by no means the only pathway so for example we have a few different pathways for biomass and this can include um uh dry feedstocks like agricultural residues i could also include wet feedstocks um like things from um and biofuels like um things from anaerobic digestion um at dairies or from wastewater treatment plants um we also i mentioned earlier steam reformation of uh like for example natural gas which is how most of the hydrogen produced used today is produced we can also do that reformation process on biomass and biofuels so these are some of the you know so these are some of the main renewable pathways for renewable hydrogen production that we're going to look at in the study one of the things that we should mention is how we define renewable energy or green i'm sorry renewable hydrogen or green hydrogen so we very helpfully have that definition for the study given to us in the bill but we haven't had any you know federal definitions or other definitions in in state law um until recently and so the uh the federal infrastructure bill that passed in august finally gave us a definition for renewable hydrogen in u.s law and actually it's more definition for clean hydrogen and it defines clean hydrogen as that produced with two kilograms or less of carbon dioxide equivalent produced at the site of production for each kilogram of hydrogen produced and so this is a carbon intensity approach to defining hydrogen as clean or renewable so you know you may have heard of gray or blue or green hydrogen the industry is really moving away from spectrum of colors which doesn't necessarily tell us a lot about the environmental impact of renewable hydrogen or of hydrogen from other non-renewable sources and instead is moving towards a carbon intensity which is actually how for example oregon's clean fuels program and california's low carbon fuel standard address clean fuels okay sorry and so hydrogen storage um hydrogen can be a little bit tricky to store uh it's usually so um there's two main ways that it's stored we've got physical storage here on the left and then we've got chemical storage on the right so physical storage uh it's going to be stored either as a gas or a liquid um as a gas it typically requires high pressure tanks where storage of hydrogen as a liquid requires cryogenic which is because of the boiling point of hydrogen um on the chemical side hydrogen can be stored on the surfaces of solids or even within solids um there's been a lot of work going on at national labs and academic regarding chemical storage of hydrogen and how to make it more efficient um and then we have down here at the bottom right um there's a mention of um ammonia and you may have heard of ammonia being used as a promising hydrogen carrier um and that's due to its high hydrogen content and there's already an established distribution network um ammonia is you know easier to move around and the hydrogen can then later be released on demand from ammonia so that's also considered a storage medium for hydrogen there's also geologic storage um such as feet in geological features such as salt caverns so this is a graphic some folks promoting a an energy storage project in utah called aces or advanced clean energy storage and their goal for this project is to produce renewable hydrogen and then compress it and store it in existing salt caverns and it is being billed as largest um energy storage project in the world the only problem with this is that salt caverns aren't distributed everywhere they are just in kind of narrow areas within the world and within the us with respect to moving around hydrogen um there are kind of three main ways that it's currently distributed so the first is within pipelines and there are some pipelines in the u.s that are dedicated to",

        "text": " I'll go through those but there are four main things here the sf424a the budget justification workbook there's an authorized application letter that's required and a Davis BAC an assurance letter so the authorized application letter um is basically written authorization from uh the applicant's governing body and just ensuring that you have permission um and allowing you to submit this application on behalf of whatever entity you're you're hailing from uh and then the Davis bacon Assurance letter this goes back to one of the federal requirements for this particular program which um includes um the Davis bacon act so if you're doing any groundbreaking construction activity um there is a Davis BAC Davis bacon component to the program um and this is just attesting to the fact that you're going to comply with that all right next slide please all right so um starting the application this is where um you will enter in all of the contact information so your organization name the address um the principal investigator and the business officer are two different contacts that we'd like to see it's possible that it may be the same person but essentially the principal investigator is going to be um likely your project manager whoever's sort of going to be the primary point of contact for the project itself and then the business officer um should be the person that's authorized to approve and sign the performance agreement with the state likely somebody who's going to be managing you know your your reporting um and just to give you an example for the case of um Odo here um Roger is our principal investigator for this Ward and I am the business officer and then um the tax employer identification number is pretty standard the other thing I want to mention is um the UEI which is a unique entity identifier if you've ever applied for federal funds before you're probably familiar with this number but if you don't have one it's obtained through the system of award management or Sam as we like to call it so um if you don't already have one of these um it's pretty easy to register and we'll give you a we'll give you a link for that to obtain that UEI number and then um lastly on this main screen you'll be selecting your blueprint which is um identifying your intended project and um I will pass it over to Roger to talk about the different blueprints there's actually a question in the chat about that last slide that maybe is helpful to stop right now an answer can um number three and four on this list be the same person yeah they can be for sure you know if you're coming from a smaller entity where you know you've only got a few people in your office working on these projects absolutely um uh that's that's totally feasible okay thank you all right so as indicated wanted to talk to you in more detail about these blueprint options uh these were designed by the US doe so they gave us some sort of context of what to offer and uh here's how we built them out under Energy Efficiency uh uh one of the options is to do building Audits and retrofits which include can include grid interactivity electrification and home energy scoring in this bucket the intent is really to give cities the ability to uh message their Community uh determine those households that are interested in these sort of me messages grid interactivity electrification and home energy scoring and then offer those on a uh uh free basis so I want to make real clear with home energy scoring there's usually a feed that the market uh allows and that is to the assessors out there that'll come to your home and charge oh around $200 for a home energy audit and there's lots of folks out there willing to do this kind of work Odo has an actual home energy score program and works with Earth advantage to make this so what what Oregon Department of energy will do if you choose this option we will work with you to make this happen you can use the eecbg funds to pay those assessors uh for their fee and then get home energy scores and other messages conducted within the lwi income Community our focus is really getting after the lowincome community because that's kind of an untapped resource that we haven't got to and it also satisfies some of the requirements for uh from the federal level with regard to justice 40 um I can talk more about that at the end of this webinar but just so you know we Odo will hire a contractor for you to work with and with that there won't there'll be lot less impact on your community to roll out a program for audits uh assessments and that sort of thing as indicated before there's the next one is Energy savings performance contracts this will be on you to go out and identify a contractor to do work on your municipal buildings I think many of you have done this before so you know the the uh path for that and then also you can break out and just do building efficiency electrification campaigns on your own and you use your funding to hire a contractor to go do that work uh under the Renewables category um we're focused on solar installations with battery storage um and you can work with your utility on that that would be the best way to do that so you're you're meeting all their needs for um how to contact the power from the uh resource to their their lines to uh go back and forth um that gets to be a pretty heavy lift if if you try to do that sort of thing without their involvement um also on the transport ation option uh we're including electric vehicles for municipal fleets that means go out and buy a electric vehicle for your Municipal Fleet and then the other option is for uh EV charging infrastructure for the community so some really um some good options here and uh I think I think you can easily choose one and develop a proposal under the implementation plan um you need have a list of the project team members the roles lines of authority and that sort of thing the experience with similar projects just something brief it doesn't need to be super comprehensive uh a detailed construction plan and project schedule with major Milestones including the target operational date of the system that's where you'd want to have a little more detail um the schedule there must show construction beginning within 12 months of the execution of the performance agreement and will be completed within 24 months of the execution of the performance agreement so it's got a shorter window than a lot of other projects but um these aren't really lengthy projects either to install um next bullet a description of how the applicant will manage planning construction and startup system startup include a commissioning plan if developed um if there is one developed I think uh having something that just to describe what your quality assurance will be how you might follow up and make sure the uh the uh project was completed designed uh next bullet a description of material availability and whether the materials are onand or readily available include an approximation of timeline for materials yeah it's been an issue in the past getting those materials so that's why this bullet lays in there uh Supply chains have been an issue um a detailed description of the project operations plan post construction the applicant should show how the project will be operated the estimated costs and how maintenance and operation will be adequately funded so those are the things in the implementation plan will be looking for I don't think you need to be heavily descriptive but I think you need to cross all those dots cross all those t's and Dot the dots um there's also a community community benefits and Equity considerations that you'll need to fill out a description of qualifying communities involvement in project development in operations this could include but is not limited to descriptions of surveys of the local community attendance or participation at public meetings and Community ideas and recommendations Incorporated in in the project plan also a description of any Equity framework used by applicant in developing the project a description of the level of direct energy cost savings to families and small businesses that will result from the project a description of the level of economic development that will result from the project and information on the number and types of jobs directly connected to the awarding of the grant that will be created by the project as well as sustained through construction and operation of the project so there's three categories there and then if applicable a description of how the project would integrate with broader Community energy and environmental goals and just so you know we've been working with the larger cities uh that got a direct Grant from the federal level and asking them did you connect with your local cities of the the tangential uh cities around them to to know understand what they are doing so we're all sort of rowing the boat in the same direction we know what each other are doing and and we can uh play off of that and actually benefit in Greater Dimension so also we have uh identify program process metrics this is a key the eecbg program requires quarterly performance reporting which includes capturing metrics available to your project please review the process metrics here at this link and identify which metrics item will be collected to report on should you your project be selected and also metrics should be selected from the third column and should pair with your appropriate project selection meaning the home energy scores should select metrics from metric area number eight such as number of buildings energy audits are performed if you're going to do home energy scorings it's probably a good idea to understand how many of them you've done out there in the community all right next slide Emily I think it's back to you sure yeah all right so um another thing that we're looking for in the application um and this looks like a lot but it's really not but one of one of the things that uh one of the things that we have to do as the state is um do a risk assessment and ensure that the the folks that we're going to be handing this money out to um are capable of managing award and Reporting upon it um so we're looking for um these bullet here I won't go through every single one of them um but basically ensuring that you um you have followed terms and conditions if you've ever had an award before um if uh if you've had experience with similar programs to describe a little bit of that um and then you know policies or procedures that you might have for ensuring comp compliance with the terms of the award um all of these things are uh listed in the application instructions which are also going to be on the web page um in great detail next slide please all right there's some um good stuff about justice 40 so um one thing I want to do is just give you a little bit of background",

        "text": " uh to check out all these different solutions and it's beautiful thank you to you Arch who do this work so that as we are investing The public's money and creating homes for people they're also energizing places not only for the people who live in them but also for the rest of us here in our community but it's not just about these new buildings and new homes we also through our resources have rent assistant vouchers as another critical to tool for providing housing stability for our lowincome families we here in Washington County alone we have nearly 3500 vouchers between all of the various Federal and local programs thank you Community Action for helping us get vouchers increasing the level of them through through additional sources but getting people connected but the reality is 3500 isn't enough weit lists remain long and it's important that we continue to Advocate with the federal government for resources for our community and because of that need that's why when we put together the Supportive Housing Services measure starting in October of 2019 through the referral by Metro thank you Metro for leaning into that um that was referred in February of 2000 and the voters thankfully approved it as the regional Supportive Housing Services measure and in putting that together and following through on that we decided to put significant investment into the new longterm rent assistant program remember that rental assistance program long-term you're going to hear that a lot some of you may already have that in your vernacular sometimes you might think Arla is a person nope it's that Regional long-term rent assistance program but that voucher is helping people transition quickly out of homelessness and into housing stability each and every day expanding the ground workor laid by Legacy Federal programs I want to shift a little a little bit from that housing to the shelter programs that we have because of our Collective efforts made with the Housing Services measure Supportive Housing Services measures resources have also been a game Cher across the board so remember how I talked about the referral February of 2020 right and then the voters approval May of 2020 feels feels to me like a long time ago even though it was only three plus years ago there was this little thing called coid in there right a pandemic um and we put together that measure before we had that Global pandemic that changed our economy right and increased need yet again it's like jamoi but at that time there were no year round shelter beds for adults here in Washington County whether you're an individual or a couple zero zip NADA we did have some year round shelter beds for families right with children which was good and boy I'm grateful for how you all work together to have those but because of the Supportive Housing Services measure we've been able to expand our service Suite so over the last three years you each of you have done the work to quickly expand our shelter capacity to better meet the needs for folks who've been sleeping outside we've been able to move from leaning on small community-based organization efforts that were always tenuous and our faith-based organizations that cobbled together a temporary Suite but wasn't necessarily year round anyway thank you for laying that Foundation Kim and teaching me to lean in and now because of your efforts to quickly grow and to quickly respond we have increased our shelter capacity meeting people where they are at and engaging with them you've ramped up quickly and we're not going to stop there last year alone we doubled you doubled the shelter capacity and currently offer over 400 shelter beds here in Washington County alone 400 that's a that's a lot of people who are now served right and it's not the same 400 people week to week so it's a lot of impact that you're making making shelter is a meaningful stepping stone to the housing stability that we want each of our community members to have and we know that the key ingredient for addressing homelessness has been case management and the Outreach workers how many of you either are case managers or Outreach workers or support them or work with them each and every day oh come on don't be shy yes thank you very much you're the folks who are ready willing and able to help people navigate the system right I'm part of government the bureaucracy we've got reports we have to make sure we issue and things like that you work with people to help connect them and make that transformative change but also thankfully fill out those forms that we need and those databases so that we can continue to get more and more funding to meet the needs but more than anything else these housing programs are designed to get our precious individual community members back inside and to get back on their feet again again to be part of our Community last year alone these coordinated programs Partnerships and you are communitybased uh providers have worked to align with strategic sources so last year alone we served together over 2500 County residents who were either at risk of or exiting houseless business one year 2500 individuals boy that's quite a scale and it's only been three years that's that's tremendous I am very proud of these numbers that reflect your hard work it's a big impact here and we're helping change lives and improve conditions here in Washington and I know there's much more to be done so I'm hoping that through the course of today you'll feel that injection of energy that you'll continue to do this very important work because you are making our community better brighter and providing a lot of people with a future and I also want to add this progress that's happening here in County it's happening in Clackamus County and Moma County as well so I don't think we have any press people in the room but we do have this video camera and I want the message to be clear that we are making significant progress in each of our three counties uh there's more to be done absolutely but there is a lot of progress we're transforming lives so let me transition here from trying to celebrate your success and your efforts to to help introduce one of our tremendous speakers today we have two uh Senator Casey Jama will be joining us later uh but we are blessed to have a tremendous uh resource today to try and further energize you but also to help me learn more because I have a lot to learn as we Forge ahead together to create more stable homes we must absolutely do more to ensure that we invest in our community with Equity at the Forefront and that's why I'm excited about our next speaker now why is equity work so important it's particularly important because our housing system is still impacted by systemic racism including Decades of redlining and predatory lending practices that have directly led to disproportionate numbers of people of color experiencing housing instability in our region some of you may see some uh new annual reports on our tables uh with both the affordable housing Bond measure and shs uh we've worked together to ensure that we're being intentional about advancing Equity right I'm an elected official I government and we know that government played an outsize role in creating the grave disparities in housing outcomes that we see today I can and should be held accountable and we at Washington County take our role in combating these disparities incredibly seriously which is why a big part of our Forum today will focus on equity and thank you for being here and helping me learn more so I can do a better job as an elected official and whack the mic but I also want to thank you as local leaders and my fellow elected officials that are out in other meetings right now which is why we don't have a a additional board members here today who have helped pave the way on Equity diversity and inclusion learning together leaders who are passionate about serving the public and providing a voice for marginalized communities if white people like me don't lean into this need and do this work then how are we to achieve it I I know this must be done I know I need to learn more I know I need to do more and that's why I'm excited to hear from our incredible leader coming up next leaders like hanif FAL he is the co-founder of the center for equity and inclusion a consultancy leading EDI Equity diversity and inclusion capacity and centering The Voice es of black indigenous and all people of color an equity lens is crucial for improving housing outcomes for the people who need it most I'm really happy to have the opportunity to introduce you because otherwise it would mean I have to follow his comments right me the generalist he's the specialist I can get out of the hot seat now but it's a all order but I'm really excited that you're here today I hope you pick up energy today but I know that we're going to get to learn more together from our speaker so thank you very much thank you for listening to me I greatly appreciate you and next our tremendous speaker Mr all right good morning y'all how y'all doing good good all right all right I'm not checking emails up here I'm uh I got 20 minutes and I got to say I'm Indian and Mexican which means 20 minutes could be an hour and 20 you could be a two so I am committed to not I'm not so I'm like I got my stopwatch here I'm going to try to stay on clock time as I call it um and see if we can do this uh in 20 minutes or so so uh so the name is hanif uh fosle it's a Muslim name and for those of you who are interested cuz often times when people look at me they get interested uh I am Indian and Mexican uh my father is Indian born in Tanzania Africa uh fourth generation Indian he actually never graduated high school but found his way to a tra from to a trade school in India and immigrated to the United States he was um a refrigerator repair person and I can always tell the age of people when I say this um he worked at mon rewards so see yeah trust me now as older I get sometimes I say Montgomery rewards and people look at me like what is that I'm like oh God every year I feel older and older and uh so he was the person who fixes your fridge and stove at Montgomery Wards um and my mother is Mexican uh born in Chicago and that's actually where I was born uh in Chicago with one of my sisters we moved out to Washington County when I was 3 years old so I um I grew up in Tiger for a brief period of time I went to Charles F Elementary School now Lowe's uh um off by I5 there um and that's where a lot of",

        "text": " make sure that we can help youall with this planning so awesome um John you have your hand up and then we have a question in the chat as well you want to come unmute yeah thanks um I figured it be easier to unmute and ask this one I I think I understand the the the um requirements from the hb3 3630 there's there's a couple I don't uh entirely understand and um back on I think it's slide eight it says um the requirement is identify critical Public Services facilities where development of alternate energy generation and storage resources will meet local energy needs what does what does that mean is that is that are we talking micro grids or can you can you maybe paraphrase that for me uh sure I don't quite quite understand um yeah that is a great question so I mean the idea behind it is when the energy grid goes down making sure that your critical Public Service facilities have an energy resource a available to provide them with power and that is I think the simplest way to phrase that it could look like micro grids those are excellent it could look like backup generators it could look like thinking about additional fuel storage for those backup generators um thinking about your fuel points of distribution so that you can receive emergency fuel supplies it's pretty comprehensive and I think there's a lot of different ways that it can look based on what's available to your county what your county wants to go forward so in type um you know that's it's there's not a lot of specificity in what you have to do the idea is just to be making a plan for how you're going to support your critical Public Service facilities should they not already have those resources in place and and maybe if I might just add one more thing Hanna um I might look at a critical Public Service facility like a water treatment facility or a Wastewater Management Facility uh as an example I mean it could be a fire station it could be you know a hospital or or a health clinic but think often times I think of water and waste water facilities and if they don't have grid power how much energy do they need how much electricity do they need to continually to operate to provide water Wastewater facilities and services uh and then I think the phrasing simply this is a quote out of the statute by the way so Alternative Energy generation and storage resources you can take that for what it means I think it's exactly what Hannah talked about maybe there's a backup generator that uses diesel um then you have to think about fuel supply chains and fuel storage maybe there's an alternative that would have um some solar and a battery facility Al though that might not be sufficient for all of your needs for a major facility but major some type of facilities so I think it's really getting to the point where if you can look at identify First those critical Public Service facilities and then understand their energy needs and then sort of working what options might there be available um to meet that needs if grid power was down I would also just add as like a a plug for one of our other programs the community renewable energy program um or project uh grant program CP um again one of those things that this plan can identify is those places like your um you know your police station or your sheriff's office or whatever that probably that might not have that backup or needs additional backup we have a program uh CP which is up to $100,000 for planning processes and up to a million dollars for construction of um renewable energy on um for public entities so again um this flow this plan would flow perfectly into a next step and a next phase of another program that we have access for so don't feel um overwhelmed if you know you have all these buildings that don't have backup power and you know they need them we also have um programs for that um the next question in the um in the chat is from Taylor R Bowski um when does this g g Grant gain approvals are they approved as they are submitted or are they all reviewed after February of 2025 ah Taylor that's an excellent question and um yeah I feel a little bit uh silly for not clarifying that up front um so we'll be reviewing applications as they come in so not waiting till February 2025 um it should be a pretty quick turnaround to look over that application make sure that's all filled out that we don't have any questions and then from there we'll move into the performance agreement process provided that it's all good to go so yeah perfect and then the next question in the chat is from Scott your discussion of plan requirement suggested that a plan must address a whole lot of things power ouges energy infrastructure resilience hubs energy consumption Etc must all those things be addressed or are those options per plan contents yeah Scott I I don't know if you're comfortable coming on to clarify because I think I'm a little bit unsure because I'm sure in going over the plan requirements I also mentioned a lot of examples of what that could like look like but I guess I'll just say all those bullet points on these slides like the one that's still up are the plan content requirements and we do have the statute linked with that it is laid out in the applications but if you do want to hop off mute and clarify to make sure I'm answering your question that'd be great yeah my my understanding can you hear me okay yep yeah my understanding from looking at your resource page page um was that a plan could address a whole bunch of different things doesn't have to address all of those things that you talked about it it could go down one you know about fuel it could go down a power thing it could go down a critical facility thing but the way uh you were presenting the plan requirements it sounded like all of those different components needed to be included in your plan so yeah yeah so all of these you know I don't really want to make you look through that and get SI going through all those bullets but all those plan requirements that we went over those do all need to be addressed to some extent within your plan however the exact specifics of what that looks like in terms of which alternate energy generation or storage resources um that's where it can be County driven um in terms of thinking about how you are going to put that on the ground or you know this one opportunities to coordinate and locate energy infrastructure development to align with and support critical public services facility what that energy infrastructure is and those opportunities are again County driven but um your plan does need to be uh meeting those mapping requirements looking at the energy inventory needs of your critical Public Service facilities if you're getting what I'm trying to say um So within that you know we understand there's $50,000 there's capacity constraints um for some of our counties that you know there might be a lot of critical Public Service facilities in that definition and I think we get that you do need to meet all those requirements to some extent if that means you're going to dive into further depth on your top priority critical Public Service facilities and you can um acknowledge your prioritization and why I think that is fine um but you should be meeting all those requirements to some extent if that is clear yeah they yeah I guess it's clear but it it still for me it compounds the the um the planning process in terms of all the things you have to address let me give you a couple examples we did a we created a fuel emergency fuel plan several years ago it needs to be further developed and it needs particularly to focus on fuel planning points of distribution and what that looks like but that wouldn't talk anything about power outages it wouldn't talk about resilience hubs necessarily it wouldn't address other things that it sounds like have to be in the plan another example doe many years ago 2010 I I think was the last time asked us to to create a list of all the uh backup generators at critical facilities uh in our in our counties and that list hasn't been updated really since 2010 2014 I think somewhere in that time frame uh and this grant could be an opportunity for us to go back and connect update that and connect it perhaps to some elements of what you just described but again it may not talk about uh resilience hubs or power outages or mapping the inter uh electrical infrastructure so that's where I'm confused about you know how would we do some of those other projects updating things and still address all this other stuff so yeah um so I think that I guess in terms of the confusion your your inclination to think that you do need to address those other components is true so you know if you decided that you were going to look at all your critical Public Service facilities and you wanted to support them all with back up energy generation and really think through getting fuel storage and fuel distribution as your approach that would be great but you would still need to think about Community resilience centers and mapping your energy infrastructure to meet the requirements of this plan um so yeah so I think that is the answer okay thank you you're um uh just as a note Tamara yes we are putting this slides on the um on the project page which is put in in the chat a couple of times um and the slides from the last um webinar are up and they have not changed that often so if you want to pull those up right now um it's a good option um there's a hand raised from Holly Holly if you want to unmute yourself hi good afternoon um I guess my biggest concern on this is the requirements and the money allocation um $50,000 in my experience is not would not even come close to covering the requirements for this so I'm just really curious how um others or brainstorm on leveraging you know does the technical assistance does that count against the $50,000 is it included in it like what's the Matrix to actually make this work I would imagine the majority of counties don't have a person who does energy resiliency so there's not there's not an entity within my County that's like oh yeah this makes sense I would have no idea how to write scope of work or even um you know start this project and then $50,000 to bring on a consultant to run it for me completely is not even close to that so how do we leverage the funding um Andor all of the things that have to get done when um this is kind of outside of normal scope of work currently yeah that's a that's a great question um",

forms of transportation and reducing waste among many other we also support other departments as they engage in externally facing climate and environmental work in the community and we are very much looking forward to taking a one Washington County approach in conjunction with our Public Health Partners to address climate change in the community this is so important because many of the same issues that our community was facing back in the 50s and 60s that inspired the original Earth Day protests are still here today and not only that those challenges are disproportionately felt among low-income low wealth and communities of color so that being said we are very much looking forward to partnering with you and with our Community Partners to really respond to climate change in a

make educated and informed decisions to address climate change and whereas Washington County has reduced its energy footprint by installing solar panels at County facilities participating in strategic Energy Management subscribing to Portland General Electric's green future IMPACT program and implementing the energy management policy and whereas Washington County has reduced the amount of waste it produces by transitioning to electronic processes donating deconstructed building materials providing reusable dishware for County events and composting at designated County facilities and whereas Washington County encourages its staff to take sustainable forms of transportation by providing all eligible employees with TriMet hot passes installing secure bike parking on County property supporting telecommuting where possible and procuring electric and hybrid vehicles for the County vehicle and whereas Washington County supports the Greater Community to be more sustainable by administering the commercial property assessed clean energy program green Business Leaders program wood stove Exchange program and home program and whereas Washington County was given the green business award in 2022 with the most points ever awarded in the history of the program and whereas Washington County participates in Regional sustainability collaborations such as the partners for a sustainable Washington County community clean air construction tree for all and the Washington County way shed technical committee to strengthen Partnerships ensure Regional consistency and share best practices and whereas Washington County recognizes that human-caused climate change is seriously impacting the health integrity and stability of ecosystems economies and communities on a global national and local scale and whereas Washington County acknowledges that Frontline communities including low-income and communities of color contribute the least to greenhouse gas emissions yet bear

pictures and let us know what they're doing on around their climate change and sustainability too if there's any um I think um I really appreciated this presentation it just seems like we've been working on this issue for a long time but I I really do think we have good people who are working on this issues and I think we'll make progress so I just wanted to send that hope to everyone who's working on and championing climate change out there to just keep working hard and that last quote that you presented you know it's hard to get that committed but we'll get we'll get there I think and eventually we'll make a will declare climate change it's real and we'll we'll have a profound impact and long lasting too so I appreciate all the work you've done at the county and and all the hard

question dear proof motion second has been a second or the discussion all in favor of raise your right hand please looks like all five of us thank you is approved and thank you for reading that commissioner it was well done all right boards and commissions appoint members of the to the aging and Veterans service advisory commission I don't know that we need a staff report we've heard this before is there any comments Vice chair Rogers if it's helpful I can read the requested action for your board the requested action uh before your board is to appoint George Howe and Robert Rhoden and I apologize if I mispronounce those names as regular members and Anna Laos as an alternate member to the Aging of Veterans Services advisory Council each with terms ending June 30th 2026. your board was presented with a staff presentation and had opportunity to discuss this item at a previous work motion to prove second anyone say a good job on this thank you very much for going through this process it's good all then in favor of appointing the two individuals so named raise your right all five of us thank you it was three individuals we have appointed all three of them per the staff requested action okay and I'm being told that I said too and that's if I did I apologize it should be three yeah all righty we have a public hearing on the urban road maintenance District the continuance Street June 30th of 34. I see coming up and he's going to make a your remarks good morning chair and Commissioners I'm Stephen Roberts director of land use and transportation with me is Todd Watkins our operations and maintenance division manager do one thing if we're going to take a public testimony I open the public hearing again right after after this presentation yeah we'll we'll run through just a brief presentation yep okay so uh with that I'll turn it over to Todd he's going to run us through a fairly brief presentation you had a work session briefing uh about a month ago on this and so we just want to run through a few of the particulars for members of the public that might be attending and listening in good morning Commissioners Todd Watkins operations manager real quick I'll just go through these slides there we go so irm was formed in 1994 actually formed in 1987 and first funded in 1994. at that time it had a population of 133 000 people today we currently serve over 200 000 people and if it were a incorporated city it would be the second largest city in Oregon secondly behind Portland at that time the evaluation of the properties within the district was 6.7 billion dollars and currently now it's approaching 24 billion dollars so quite an increase over the years when it was first formed the tax rate was 36.5 cents per thousand but with measure 50 that was adjusted and the current tax rate is 24.56 cents per thousand just quickly if you could go back I just wanted to clarify too I think the the district boundaries are essentially the urban unincorporated areas of the county so those areas within the ugb but outside of a city when it was formed in 1987 and then first founded in 94. it requires that the board continue it every 10 years and this will actually be the third continuation we had a continuation in 0-3 and 2013 and then now in 2023 your board serves as the board of directors and this is the time when we will get that 10-year approval if you approve yeah you're a board adopted this road maintenance party Matrix in 1987 and it's our guiding principle for road maintenance across the entire county-wide network the fortunate thing about earned is that it provides a stable funding source for the neighborhood routes and the urban local roads which otherwise would not receive the same level of funding",

        "text": " stated there's a condition that site 2 has to be granted an easement of access through site one we all are aligned on that are there any other things outside of the normal blocking and tackling you know minutia if you will that need to be called out no many of the conditions are specific to utilities thank you I have a question about if you want to go back I think it's two slides several of the comments that were um right nope uh right there perfect so uh we're concerned about opening up there's a blockade at the end of Holland Drive or whatever that that is not a part of this at all right that's part of when they when they submit the design for hey here's what we want to build on this place that will be part of the the design then right that is absolutely correct there is no proposal on the table in regards to parcel to the vacant right so yeah so that's just a future concern of some of the that's to be addressed the question we're answering right now is can we rezone this high density residential it has nothing to do with whether or not Holland goes through or whether there is a park on the place or you know what I mean like any of that stuff the criteria does not the only criteria that deals with transportation is making sure that the transportation planning Rule and again the applicant has satisfied that where the trips are Less in comparison to a retail commercial use and for clarification for people listening the transportation planning rule about trips is really about the trips that that site generates out in the region correct right as far as in the region it's not about local flow of traffic is that also just to clarify too it because in the language it states that the residential use would generate fewer or fewer trips than the commercial use so I think it needs to be made clear that the potential commercial trips that would have been generated on the site had it developed commercially are X and that number is less than x in the residential Zone it obviously the number of there's going to be new trips because there's nothing there now compared to an empty field it's more trips compared to what would be there if it'll do a lot commercially that's less trips I think that needs to be clarified I think the original planning for that area included those potentials right right so the roads leading to the site have already been built out to accommodate the commercial trips now they'll actually be less residential trips right one other um so when assuming this gets passed if it does at some Future Point the developer a developer would come forth with the site plan proposal for the site that obviously will go through a completely different public planning process right right and that process will definitely go to the Planning Commission or most certain almost I mean I I know I know it will but is there a scenario where it might not no no scenario okay so it will most likely depending on the number of units on that site it will go through the Planning Commission and will go through the required public notice so there'd be a community meeting neighborhood meeting first then when it gets to if and when it got to City to Planning Commission there would be at least one public hearing if not multiple right and notice again would go out to individuals within a thousand feet we'll post the site we will post throughout the five Community Billboards that we typically do and we will put it in the newspaper again in regards to the actual land use application for the future development that the applicant May propose thank you and again I don't know when that would be but this is the first step in regards to being able to develop and at that point in time there's all kinds of options on the table correct so it's a public hearing No Matter What in in theory if they put through it just uh plan a site plan request that met all the criteria as written you could go to a hearings officer still be a public but in most scenarios that we've seen of this type it would almost certainly end up applying the commission yeah right it could either be a planning hearings officer which is a type three or a Type 4 which will be in front of the Planning Commission I don't I mean I don't know that we've ever seen anything this size go through a hearings officer but I could be wrong and depending on what they're asking for and how it's applied it can even come to the council after Planning Commission yeah if it's a PUD which is pretty likely yeah yeah any other questions for staff great I think we got through the written stud do we have any additional written all right so this time we're going to open up the public hearing um and as a reminder for folks this is a chance for anyone to comment on the I'm um would you like to hear sorry we forgot that step didn't we yeah yeah that was in my Furious note-taking I missed that one sorry yeah so we're not opening the public hearings oh yeah but go ahead and we'll have the applicant speak first all right good evening and thank you for your time my name is Marie Holliday with AKs engineering and I'll be presenting on behalf of the applicant for the record my address is 12965 Southwest Herman Road Tualatin Oregon 97062 and are you able to see my screen not yet so it's gone there it is yes we can see your screen but for your consideration this evening is the zoning map Amendment and partition for the Sherwood Plaza and this project was a culmination of efforts on behalf of the applicant Six Corners LLC again my name is Marie holiday with AKs engineering we also have our civil project engineer Darko simik here on the line we have Chris bremmer with Kittleson and Associates who prepared the transportation planning rule analysis and also on the line we have Brendan Baker with Johnson economics Who provided the economic study for the project some Joy provided a very thorough overview of the project so I'll go ahead and stay brief so that we can discuss some of the public comments here this evening again the property is located along the south side of Southwest linger Drive Southeast of Highway 99 this project involves a two parcel partition again this that application is a type 2 application and it was bundled with this so that only the east side of the property would be involved in the zone change application and again there will be a future site plan review to assess any on-site improvements so here again is an overview of the preliminary partition you can see the new Partition or the new parcel is shown in purple on the east side of the site access is again provided through a 40-foot easement through parcel one on the south side of Langer Drive here's the preliminary partition plot approval criteria Joy went through all of these um on in your staff report you can see the staff findings um provided that the application Med off the approval criteria so the real meat of the application is again the zoning map Amendment you can see on the left side of the screen the existing zoning is retail commercial generally north and west of the site is continued commercial development again retail restaurants other commercial on the right side of the screen you can see parcel 2 shown there with HDR zoning future high density residential again to the south and east of the site is residential development including attached Town Homes multi-family a congregate Care Facility the application also included a conceptual site plan this was not required but it's good to see what could conceptually be built on the site it shows again a shared access from Southwest linger drive and the provision of any public improvements will again go through that site plan review process including design standards setbacks architectural materials everything like the zoning map of amendment approval criteria were also discussed in your staff report I believe it was on page 188 of of the large Council packet this staff went through again in great detail all of the approval criteria the project is consistent with the comprehensive plan goals and policies as was provided in the narrative the use complies with the transportation planning rule again that report was prepared by Kittleson and Associates and it shows that what could be built on site with the current retail commercial zoning would provide greater trips than than this application so changing the site to high density residential would incur less trips the me of the amendment approval criteria are in that section 16.080 B and these go through criteria involving the need for housing in Sherwood over 600 total residential units are lacking currently in the city's um in the city's housing needs analysis this site is a really good use for a multi-family development it's compatible with the land use pattern and character of the area you can see that there's a lot of walkable amenities around and it does set the stage to provide this needed housing as Dre mentioned the project received nine public comments in total and all of those were regarding site access and this application does not endorse approval for any means of access for any specific site plan the conceptual site plan that was submitted with the application materials just shows you what could be anticipated on site a future site plan review will involve a neighborhood meeting and everyone who received notice for the initial neighborhood meeting will again receive it if you're in a thousand feet of the site you can also get information specifically from our project team my information will be on the screen at the end of this meeting if you're interested in future meetings that application will also go through the public hearing process as we just discussed and um all of the criteria will be demonstrated to be met including say access so at the time of future site plan review a transportation impact study will be prepared and that will discuss the site access trip generation and site circulation and Chris bremmer with Kittleson is on the line who can answer any questions regarding any future Transportation documentation the applicant concurs with City staff that say access should be determined through the site plan process and when an application for a proposed use and relative tis is submitted it makes more sense to to get down that access so with that in closing the applicant concurs with the city staff findings and conditions of approval in the staff report the applicant also concurs with the planning commission's recommendation of approval and we would respectfully request your approval this evening and our team is available for any questions now right thank you very much any questions for the applicant very well presented no questions great thank you so much so at this point we'll uh take public comment and I have one person and I'm going to get your last name wrong",

        "text": " that was the best way to do it uh but we're certainly open to uh to ideas or people have feedback or or seen a better way to do it please let us know yeah the reason i bring that up is because we run into that with refunding permits when a general contractor applies for the permits pays for them requests a refund and then the question is is how does that money ultimately get back to the property owner that paid for that so it's just kind of the same thing on a lending agency side i'd imagine they'd they'd want their money back if they're lending money to a property owner we're paying or there's money going back to the property but not getting back to the agency it's just a thought maybe there's no grounds or even a worry about it just it's just kind of no i think that's an important thing to flag and that uh one i mean just you're talking about kind of the general contractor aspect of of them paying permits if we had a general contract or submitting permits and filling out an which we'd love for them to do you know are they putting up front some of the costs and expecting that incentive uh that's something to consider and we'll take a look at that great thank you so much chris um i don't see any other questions in the q a and i don't see any of their hands raised at this point so if anyone has any questions they can answer here or any questions they have about kind of what we're thinking with the program please let us know now and otherwise michael maybe you might want to doing the next couple slides and if we have some questions at the end we can oh we have one now kevin dial 802 perfect okay great so kevin adiana for a second it went right down but helen laura still has a hand up with some um then she's now unmuted and and helen you should be able to talk down thank you hi we can hear you helen oh okay i'm sorry um what are you doing right joined a little bit late and i was wondering if you could just briefly uh talk a little bit about 40 the 41 does that is that of qualification thing or um we had uh chris on the line i believe works for marion county in the building department and he mentioned that so far 41 percent of the homes that were lost have already been rebuilt and so that's what we're referring to at the 41 um there was a couple of questions about retroactivity of our program so if someone already felt can they take part and so we were just saying we're for some folks that'll be possible and um and that's what we're talking about the and if you're in the middle of rebuilding right now um is there something a person should do right away michael you can go ahead on that yeah hell that's a great question so uh we are kind of in the stage of right now designing a program and our goal would be to be able to offer something uh in in maybe around february or march of next year and so uh what we're designing is a program focused on energy efficiency uh and within that energy efficiency program there's a lot of efficiency gains in just getting people to build our current code so my first question would be helen how do you when you pulled permits was it to our current code and i guess i work on the assumption it was and so there there should be an incentive available to you if you built our current code and then there's also a certain opportunity to build above code so there's utility incentives and a variety of different programs to take advantage of of utility incentives and then we would also like to incentivize encourage people to build more energy efficiently and so taking a look at those different options and take a look at existing utility programs based on who your electric utility or gas utility may and then andy do you want to talk about with dcps fire hardening come the fire hardening options that are going to be sure uh like uh similar to department of energy we're still sort of developing the program but if you are in the process of rebuilding and you can talk to your contractor about uh things that's going to make the the building more resistant to fire damage things like ignition resistant siding and ignition resistant roofing things like that um those are going to be the types of things that our program is going to be incentivizing when it gets started up early next year ignition resistance is that the same as class a rated or yes classic rated roofing uh would be ignition resistant okay great yeah and all these programs so we've got program websites through the state agencies and we'll certainly share those links but there's also a feature where you can you can sign up to get email updates and so as we're starting to roll these programs up you can get those those email updates and and uh we'll start defining what kind of those menu of options and what those incentives are going to be and we'd love for you to to get those updates you kind of know how things are going how do you sign up for if you join our if you go to our website there's a a link that you you can click on and you can select what kind of information other updates you would like to receive on the program okay are you thank you yeah thank you alex um michael we do have a quick question in the q a and then we can go to kevin who has his hand raised so if someone wants to unmute kevin um i'll kevin i'll let you know when we're we're ready for you um but someone asked what about the gates area in linn county and just the flag that we have marion county here and and participating which is great um lynn county folks were also um but um but just know that the program will work in both places it just so happens that the marion county person is here and giving us a lot of information so it we um well it doesn't matter what you're in the program will be available and then um we can go ahead if that's that okay michael oh i just want a flag so it's available for uh any any uh survivors of the 2020 wildfires uh since there's been talk of of maybe including 2021 or or other other wildfires but at this point we're just focused on on damage from from those right and gates was heavily affected in the 2020 wildfire just happened to be on the other side of the rotor river over there um so uh kevin go ahead thanks for your patience so the two things the most of the energy efficiency will it also be linked with solar systems and solar power and then you talked about natural gas the second part of that is we have more restrictions on natural gas builds is that going to affect that as well michael yeah so kevin great question so these incentives aren't tied to solar i mean we would love for people to to engage and add solar to their property and we do have a separate program that's a solar and storage program that offers incentives for people and when they building a house or existing home or a business adding solar we certainly want you to take advantage of that and so i point you to our website to take a look at the solar and storage program and see if it's something you might be interested in and we certainly know a lot of utility programs offer incentives for solar and uh certainly take a look at all those different options but you don't you don't necessarily have to do uh uh solar or wind or any kind of renewable to participate in this program we're focused on energy efficiency and so that means just building your rebuilding that existing structure as energy efficiently as you can and so excuse me um and i guess your second question i guess about natural gas regulations so uh you know rebuilding with with natural gas certainly we're not going to impede that in any way and certainly we welcome whether a home is all electric or electric and gas or any kind of fuels we're kind of agnostic to do that we certainly just want people to still do our current code or build to above code an above code program and so you can certainly do that through electric utility or natural gas utility and um and there's for above code there's a reach code that you can certainly model after if you want to build above code and certainly if you have questions about that or that process feel free to send us questions uh in a next slide i will show you um actually here i'll just click it right now it's perfect it's 9 30 so thanks thank you christy and so uh you know we've got an intensive program page about this wildfire recovery incentive we've got kind of a process page of administrative rules you want to track how how the process is going and our additional meetings we've got a direct way to email us wildfire recovery at and we've got dcbs program here but ultimately what we want to focus on is kind of the program timeline that right now we're engaging all these community meetings uh we're going to start our rulemaking process there's a public comment period and we've got some draft rules to make sure uh we're doing what we can to help as many people as we and then at the end we're going to try to implement this program and be able to start cutting checks and helping people ideally in february of next year but in the end if you didn't have a chance today i know we're at time and we can certainly stay a little bit longer if people have additional questions but there is other there are other opportunities there's going to be future meetings and there also is a public comment portal that people can join and there's questions within that or there's a space where people can upload documents or or just write their thoughts and and their experiences and we we we're here to listen and we really do appreciate people taking the time to do that and it does inform our decisions in what we do do we have any other last questions that i need to hit on before uh before we go i believe you're on mute there's no other hands up and there's no one in the q a so i think we're good and then we plan on following up with people you have to give your email address to get in so we have your email address and we're planning to follow up with people with some of the links we talked about so that it's easier to access them so stay tuned for that okay thank you everybody for coming we appreciate it have",

        "text": " cultural resources study that's been taking place for a month or two now probably has about a month to go uh and that's sort of our our last study that we've been taking complete here uh will be completed in september 2020 but this is just some of the other diligence uh we're completing the project and uh definitional student is currently next slide um so energy period uh interconnection this is where we'll actually interconnect with the larger grid um so we're being studied for interconnection with both the umatilla electric cooperative which is where the project will actually interconnect with and with the bonneville power administration where um attila electric's uh transmission system will take us to a substation that also serves so we're being studied for interconnection there so that we can theoretically deliver anywhere in bonneville's service territory the facility will interconnect at the northern most uh northern and then westernmost portion of the project and it will interconnect to an existing umatilla electric uh 230 kv transmission line actually the line all the towers are constructed the line already already and i think that there'll be some reconductoring that will need to happen where we'll hang a new 230 kv line on one side of the poles for that line it was built with the idea of being upgraded to carry the 230 kb uh to carry an additional 230 kv transmission line so there so aside from the substation there'll be no new transmission towers or anything like that associated with this project yeah and i think we've covered the rest just again knowing that um we are unaffiliated with the ordinance transmission project um awesome um so just to kind of what we're thinking of our side and hoping to start construction by the end of 2024 uh obviously that will be dependent on on this approval and the timeline uh and any potential controversy there's as much previously um but we're estimating it'll take roughly two and a half years to complete uh putting it somewhere in the 2027 timeline probably have an average of uh 400 employees on site by but you know once it's it's construction it's fully up and running not possibly up to 1200 employees at one time yeah and then this uh slide just uh highlights what many of you already know and just that um oregon and northwest energy energy needs are growing especially this area has a lot of uh needs and clean energy buyers for buyers are seeing clean energy resources so we believe we have the opportunity to to serve those energy consumers whether those are utilities or corporate off you know help attract additional uh high-tech manufacturing or additional uh high-intensity energy users uh to the area and help support monroe county's economic development in that way and of course we would do our part to help good paying long-term jobs to the region as well without changing the character of our needs that's really it from us uh we have cars on the back table contact information to you so uh feel free to grab us after this or or shoot us an email of uh questions come up later thank you all right great so um thank you joe jeff um so we'll move on to just a question and answer session now um so folks in uh room i'll just remind you this little guy with the eyes on it here is kind of our audio set up today so if you're here the back of the room you may have to come up a little bit so that everybody can cure you but otherwise as long as you project i think you will get okay coverage just try to talk towards the little owl um if you are online you can raise your by clicking on the button that says participants that should be down by the right hand uh portion of your window once you do that you'll get a second kind of window that pops up and you can click the little hand icon to raise your hand and then once you're done providing your comment just please go ahead and click that icon again to lower your hand if you're on the phone and i see that we do have at least one person on the phone you can raise your hand by pressing star three and then again yeah just press start three afterwards to lower your hand um while people are figuring that out we can go ahead and start taking questions in the room so does anybody have any any questions or comments keep going to me um i guess go ahead and raise your hands in the room so please go ahead and if you could state your name i i have comments and i wrote something down there but my name is ken grave and this is my wife terry and actually my son logan's here tonight too but we represent ourselves and greek farms as property owners in the proposed echo solar project area we'd like to make a statement in favor of the project uh i'm a pastor morrow county commissioner participated in many meetings with big companies that come to our area in the past i know the benefits that these companies can bring to rural areas like ours the and extra funding for the schools and taxing districts in our county is very this project will bring both tomorrow i remember i remember several years ago when governor brown said that the area on and around our farm would be an energy four-door it certainly seems that it is becoming that our property only has three gas natural gas pipelines that run through we have two and a half miles of a large power line that serves the wheat rich wind and solar projects on our farm the proposed boardman to hemingway transmission line will go right through part of our farm and the ground for the b2h line may possibly be taken without our consent by imminent domain if we can't reach reasonable terms with the developer all of these projects have made it harder to operate because of the lack of production in certain areas and having to change our farming practices practices to accommodate as you can see our farm already has a long history of supplying the energy and energy needs for our region i am a third generation i am the third generation actively farmed this ground that's been in the family since 1952 where dry land wheat farm average size in our area in recent years it's become more difficult to produce its accessible crop on our acreage as input costs continue to rise we have seen fluctuating market prices we are in an extremely low rainfall area which often leads to low crop yields many years we rely heavily on our crop insurance payments to to make it through the proposed project will sit on very dry and marginal farm ground we have to be careful with the soil when we work it so that we don't have a blowing dust problem when we get the big winds that often occur in our area as mentioned previously the project will bring good jobs and money to our area during the construction phase the additional money that it will bring tomorrow county when the negotiations take place and are finalized will do many great things for our area a diversified economic base is critical to the future of our county we look forward to working uh continuing to work with the developers involved in the echo silver project and hope that we can move it forward um thank you and then kevin carrion for green farms thank you so much and um if you wouldn't mind uh if we could have a copy of you don't even appreciate that but thank you so much for providing those comments um is anybody else in the room interested in providing comments or asking questions i think again really good jobs my dad bill back here and uh the one thing i'd like to add is that when it comes to they're going to have needed special exceptions from the state and i think they use the term high value farm ground and it is a challenge to borrow where we and uh this project including fashion security the expanding the more these four families we have deep roots in the community and uh we will remain here and uh not only do we farm where we have focusing workers small engineer calling in oxygen among our families and and we will continue to be thank you thank you so much for listening please my name is mike baldrick uh i've been an iphone member of bourne and i have worked with several renewable projects for the last 25 years i definitely like to see these projects come to tuition i also like to see local hire in utilization uh big bill injuries i also served with vice president of pennsylvania's council in oregon and uh currently our membership and several other villages in the building trader building area rogers solar and so on and so forth and i would just like to see some kind of relationship between the local traders and buildings projects um we're definitely supporting them if the developers aren't supporting using global local hire apprenticeship utilization and things like that to ensure that the work stays with oracle thank you so much right anybody else in the room and feel free to jump in um if not before we look to the phones if you all want to respond to anything you've heard sorry i will apologize i'm so used to conducting hearings that i don't often uh respond to what's being said but i do have to hear that we definitely hear everything you all are saying and just appreciate it yeah i'll just tell you a couple things one thank you guys for your comments and into your cert uh yeah we certainly you know we can uh and you know wherever we are to use um local local employees and local contractors and so um you know obviously at a very early stage of the project right now but uh yeah i think it's one of the benefits of um of blue ridge power as i mentioned earlier you know uh it's it's not gonna go to the to a random vpc couples you know it will be with us kind of from start to finish um and you know happy to to to accommodate again for the last weekend with that i'll say all right nancy i don't see any answers so five before we adjourn i will say that you know department staff will stick around um of course as long as anybody is here and would like to talk to us um we're happy to be available for that we can also um yeah like i said happy to take phone calls or emails um or comments through the comment portal anytime you would like to talk with us and then i guess i'll just ask if by councilmember buyer or or stockholm have any comments they'd like to make before we adjourn council member buyer so uh this is todd cornett so i'm the division administrator for the sighting division i just want to thank",

        "text": "bing detail we'd be get our analysis with the text of ORS 469-5045 which means miles just walk you through so if your minds are numb uh there's a reason for that and the Supreme Court said that's okay so so again um just take some some solace in that I have with me not to uh uh forget this I have uh Matt Martin from Capital power with me and uh and he's been very involved in this case um as you know this project has been pending for now five years the the exceptions process has taken about a um the five years I'm not blaming at all on the council because in fact we amended the project halfway through to Institute so a solar facility with the wind energy facility but it's just it is just what it is the issues here in my view are fundamental state issues and there's a challenge not to the facts of compliance with the sighting standards but it's a challenge to the fundamental statutes and Provisions and binding organ Supreme Court Authority that unquestionably grants have said comprehensive Authority oversighting Oregon energy facilities so a better way of context in 2004 some of you may know or have known uh uh at um in 2004 I stood next to him in Klamath County arguing whether or not Statewide Statewide uh goal findings are an appropriate Avenue to resolve conflicting standards he was my law school professor and it was in it was intimidating standing next to him for about five hours in Klamath County hammering out the exceptions um he argued against the meaning of 469.504 specifically arguing against the council applying it through the Statewide planning goal framework there we argued over a somewhat complex statute and in 2005 we argued the meaning of ors-215 or excuse ORS 469 504 to the Oregon Supreme Court there in a unanimous decision concerning um how to apply the statute we established in the Supreme Court established foundational law that now really shapes every fsec proceeding and we have to be able to rely on it the Statewide planning goals are a foundation to Oregon's land use Authority here the local setback coordinates cannot bind fsec because it is not based on or required by Statewide planning goals you've heard that many times a day in many different ways with the with the state of our organ case we do have law and it is unambiguous and it does provide you this Authority Under the Statewide planning goals in nearly all of the County's exception arguments the flaw is the same the county simply disagrees with the law and the county disregards is burden to prove that the setback is required under Statewide planning goals instead we have a pretty confusing and redundant series of arguments that are not based on Plain unambiguous statutory and Supreme Court hence this is kind of an extension of further mind-numbing detail that was forecasted in the in the sorrow case but as Ms mileage and indicated and I just reiterate this we are lucky to have Supreme Court Authority we are lucky to have a foundation of regulatory background and statutory framework that allows you to make these decisions with some certainty that you're making the right decisions under the law and I have only seven seconds left thank thank you Wendy Killington representing Umatilla County so the the overarching issue here the most important issue for you to keep in mind is that there is no way this facility can comply with the goals if it doesn't comply with gold two and goal to expressly says that state agency actions regarding land use have to be consistent with local land use plans and implementing regulations there is no way to get to yes if you Faithfully apply the law the case that you just heard about with regard to Mr Sullivan and and Mr McMahon arguing that the Supreme Court completely supports the County's position there is no Oregon supreme court on the facts here where you have a county governing body that sits down goes through its code tells you what the standards are and you're being told to ignore their standards there is no case on that what save our Rural Oregon was was the county governing body didn't get around to identifying standards it's that first scenario let's go through very quickly what this piece of paper says with regard to those 5045 and the Big B standards there are three scenarios one starts out and says if the special advisory committee doesn't recommend blah blah blah then the council can apply the one b or c rule that says you get to ignore the County's code if you want to but the second one so that first one that's the one that was going on in save our rural organ the second one says if the governing body tells you what their standards are you apply it you don't get to apply this big b standard in that situation that's what the law says I'm not saying that that's what the law says and the last one is this more than three zones business and I will tell you you do not have to what a related or supporting facility is and we agree it's really important that energy companies have site boundaries to work in but you are required to Faithfully apply the law that says you don't get a hall pass on County substantive criteria under this third scenario more than three zones business if you don't have related or supporting that are in more than three zones and here there is no dispute on the record there's Jedi Mind Tricks you can apply but there's no dispute on the record that there is no related or supported facility as state law defines that term in more than three zones absolutely not what you heard is there's a site boundary or a an Associated area but that is not what state law defines to be a related or supported facility state law says it has to be a structure and there is not one structure that is in more than four zones so you can't you can't get to the you can't get to yes on applying the goals because the goals tell you you gotta comply with the acknowledge comprehensive plans of the you can't get TS on the ASC the the uh the standards that the county has recommended because the law doesn't say that you can you know pick and choose the goals that you want to decide local governments are implementing no here there's no dispute on the law that gold two told the county to adopt this very regulation they did exactly what they were supposed to do it's required by the goals it's really not possible to make a good faith argument otherwise and so it's an applicable substantive criteria that there's a two-mile setback and we have an objection to the claim over here that it's just a NIMBY measure no it is not a NIMBY measure it's a a decision that the county made based on evidence it was presented scientific studies that were presented that in Umatilla County they're going to protect property values people's Health all these things there's going to be a two mile setback and most facilities can seem to make made it meet me at this one seems to be having a problem with it but the fact the point is is that you can't collaterally attack the wisdom of the governing body after going through what gold two told them to do to adopt these these this two-mile setback based on evidence in the record the two mile setback went through louva back and forth It's been affirmed it's not a minimbi measure it's the real deal it's important and so to to wrap this up you you know you you can decide for you know the pcco and all of that if that's what you want to do but if you're going to apply the law you're not going to because the law doesn't support that pcco and we would ask you not to thank since my other Council both made comments I'll make just a couple quick comments I certainly want to go for five minutes essentially what the County's arguing is if we recommend it you have to apply it right disagree that's not what the law says go to maybe their setback is in compliance with gold two but it's not required by goal two and what the law says is that you need to apply the local criteria that are required by the goals okay uh thank you all um I think having heard uh the oral testimony from all parties and had some discussion and questions that doing a straw poll on this group three set of exceptions makes sense I don't think we want to go through listing each of them again um it might be most efficient to start based on kind of where we left things with asking whether uh any of the council members are have an exception here that they accept or on the contrary if you reject them I don't have any exceptions that I would accept my logic is if the setback's not required by the Statewide goals then it doesn't apply it's irrelevant doesn't matter whether it crosses multiple zones three zones um if the county setback isn't required by the goals then must reject the exceptions so that's my bottom line thank you other comments council member buyer thank you and I would concur with counselor Howe how um goal two is a foundational goal and um I think I agree with the Odo Council Lord that it just doesn't require this activity this setback requirement more credit to Umatilla County for adopting it but it doesn't apply to our it doesn't directly apply to our process it it just it just doesn't so thank you thank you council member Devlin I would concur with the two counselors that spoke before me and also would want to State for the record that because of this ultimate underlying basis that we can only impose those requirements required by the goal in terms of specific standards there are some of these exceptions which I do not have adequate evidence to say whether this is a part of the facility whether this goes through three zones or four zones because actually that whole argument is moot at this point once once you've made the decision that you can only apply the standards that are required by the underlying goals then these other questions are Moot and and I don't see any reason to decide based on each exception in that case thank you councilmember Condon uh thank you and I concur with the counselors who have spoken so far I can't make this can't can't get there for the exceptions so thank you so uh for the record this is Marcy Grail I um as I stated you know I have things that that I question but I do want to be clear you have council members who are representing uh all over parts of Oregon I think we all take our responsibilities really seriously I've I'm a very literal person I've read documents and I can't get past",

        "text": " on that first part which is is related to the new standards for electric utility wildfire protection plans and that's what the puc rule making is focused on as well the puc completed the first phase of that rulemaking in december of last year and uh then um and that established the minimum kind of requirements for the first round of wildfire protection plans from electric utilities uh all three investor-owned electric utilities uh submitted their initial wildfire protection plans to the puc in december and those all three plans were subsequently approved by the puc in the council initiated this rule making as part of its 2021 to 2023 rulemaking kind of tracking some of the same issues that that prompted the puc rule making when you put this on the schedule you directed staff to prioritize the project while also monitoring the progress of the puc rule making to ensure that we adopt any conflicting so kind of tracking the puc rule making the council initiated it's rule-making in october of last year in january we sent out letters requesting input from tribal governments and also conducted a rulemaking workshop for interested stakeholders and members of the public we have kind of gone through the advice we received and put together the draft proposed rule package that we have before you today so i i won't belabor this too much but we do believe that this new standard is needed to address the increased frequency and severity of wildfire that's occurring in oregon and across the west as a result of climate change there's just been catastrophic fires including the 2018 paradise fire in which have been found to have been caused by electric infrastructure i took a very brief look at the cal fire red book for last year which is just their compilation of wildfire statistics and they have some detailed more detailed statistics than other and according to that it looks like about 10 percent of wildfire in acreage was uh or by incident i'm sorry was caused by electric infrastructure um and that can be anything from a uh faulty transmission line making or a transmission line making contact with vegetation um to you know shorts at a residential area that leads to wildfire and i wanted to point out that while uh most of the most destructive wildfire uh related with electric infrastructure have been related to transmission lines there are also documented cases of wildfire at or caused by renewable energy facilities and i bring those up particularly because those are types of facilities that typically are out on the landscape instead of in more industrial like we would expect to see our more um power plants at um there's a picture here just of a a smallish wildfire that occurred in gillom county that occurred after a uh there was a turbine fire wind turbine fires are actually pretty common well not common but well documented there's a statistic going saying that you know every wind turbine creates has a like one in uh probability of a fire every year which is very small but considering the number of turbines that are now on the landscape you know there is some risk um there's also been some cases of wildfires at pv facilities while this is much more rare and i just wanted to point out that you know there's been some high document uh incidences of rooftop solar installations uh causing fire and then there's currently a big lawsuit between where there was a big lawsuit between walmart and tesla regarding some large installations luckily uh to the best of my knowledge there hasn't been a significant fire incident at a nafsac approved facility to date um but there have been some minor incidents uh including things like lightning strikes and uh birds making contact with multiple conductors on a transmission line like an associated gentile line uh and those birds combusting and falling to the ground and igniting the vegetation below so these are things that that do tend to with that appetizing thought i think i saw that your food was delivered you all want to take a break or should i keep if we could take 10 minutes and gather ourselves that would be great thanks for noticing on that note pac chris that's funny it's not funny um anyway we'll take 10 minutes and gather our food and reconvene if that's okay thank you or you're ready go for it all right thank you chair grail uh so once again for the record this is christopher clark the council's rules and uh i will just jump right back into where we left off which was here okay uh i am we previously just discussed kind of the need for this rulemaking and uh the second part of that is that the council doesn't really currently have a standard that specifically addresses wildfire risk you do have under your organizational expertise standard a requirement that the applicant demonstrates that the applicant can design construct and operate the proposed facility in a manner that protects public health and and then also the public services standard which requires the construction and operation of the facility not be likely to result in significant adverse impact to the ability of public and private providers of public services to provide the services and that includes fire protection services in the review of many applications the council has seen evidence either a facility is within a rural fire protection district and sometimes they work with those row fire prediction districts to ensure that the fire service provider can access the site and knows how to respond and address things at the site but the level of fire risk at the site or any proposed or required mitigation activities haven't specifically been incorporated into the council's review process to date we do believe that the council has the authority to adopt additional standards uh particularly as the council thinks is needed to ensure that the sighting construction and operation of uh an energy facility is consistent with the protection of public health and safety in the environment because wildfire is a significant public safety issue um we we believe that this would fall into that category um and so you know the council does not need specific authority to move forward with this rulemaking it would already be covered under your general rulemaking when we were going through the process of developing proposed rules we kind of consider three main objectives that is to uh adopt a standard that would minimize the risk of an energy subject to the council's jurisdiction uh causing a wildfire to ensure that the there are sufficient programs and procedures in place to ensure the protection of public health and safety in the event that a wildfire does occur at an energy facility site uh regardless of the source of ignition and uh on the second bullet point i do want to point out that we got some comments that in addition to ensuring the health and of public the protection of public health and safety uh during a wildfire response um that we also needed to or we it was recommended that we also at ensuring that sensitive resources including cultural resources at a site are uh protected during response activities and that you know we don't fire breaks or firing lines going in over uh sensitive sensitive resources at the site and we've included some included some language in the proposed rules to address that and then finally uh our objective with this rulemaking was to maintain consistency with the wildfire mitigation rules adopted by the puc to the extent and i think as you heard during the last agenda item the council and the puc do have different uh regulatory scope and regulatory practice um but we do think that there are enough in the way that the puc rules are written that we've um we've really adopted a similar approach there what the puc rules require um and what the requirements of senate bill 762 um are that each electric utility uh prepares a wildfire protection plan and then operates in compliance with that plan um so we've recommended that we follow a similar approach at least for some facilities facilities specifically that are in or near high wildfire risk areas i want to point out that the specific requirements of the puc rules really only apply to investor-owned utilities um but consumer-owned utilities are also required to prepare wildfire mitigation plans um rather than going to the puc for approval those plans are approved by the governing body of the the cou and then are just submitted to the ps puc for for reference purposes and to help share best practices amongst oregon's electric providers so i those new requirements uh cover both the generating and transmission assets of the the electric utilities but i want to point out that because those are really system-wide plans um i i reviewed the 2022 wildfire protection plans and they appear to focus really on um just areas within the utility service and then areas near transmission assets so i didn't see specific provisions or coverage for generating owned and operated by um those utilities uh that are outside of the service terry um uh also as i i mentioned those are system-like plans so they don't really cover any sort of facility level information but generally just establish general protocols that the utility will use to inspect all of its infrastructure and then the puc rules really give a lot of deference to the utilities to identify the methods and data sources that are appropriate for their service territories in their own risk analyses um and then they require that those analyses be updated to incorporate the most recent data that's available from reputable sources so there's some flexibility there but at least the minimum standards that um this is basically using uh incorporating the most up-to-date uh good practices that are are prevalent in the industry and there were some minor changes to the uh specific language around some of this uh in the um most recent draft of puc rules i saw but i think the underlying premise is still the same so we've recommended that the council pursue um basically similar approaches um specifically we're uh re recommending that the council adopt a new standard that requires the applicant adequately characterize wildfire risk within the analysis area um using current data from reputable the particular criteria that need to go into that analysis are based on the proposed puc criteria we're recommending that the council require a finding that the facility is not likely to result in a significant in wildfire risk at the site taking into an account both the probability and consequences of wildfire and then finally we're recommending that if the analysis area includes areas subject to heightened risk of wildfire otherwise high fire consequence areas that the proposed facility will operate in compliance with the wildfire mitigation plan approved by the council um i'm going to go through the specific elements of these recommendations kind of one by one um but that is in broad strokes uh what is included in the draft rules that we've presented to you or that we've included uh in our staff report um attachment too so uh so the first thing we looked at was um whether or not this new standard should apply to the review of all new facilities um or just applications that are submitted",

        "text": " and Oregon State University I I question since you know the the large outside of the Columbia River Corridor and stuff like that the large impact if we have a major issue uh at least to to our neck of the woods is agricultural that wouldn't be a really good secondary fit is the agricultural in or maybe the transportation communities because those are very uh uh tightly tied to Oregon's piece of the pie if you will when it comes to hand and the the the transportation of the the waste and stuff and through the 84 so I think that's a good idea Tom as you know we have a rep from Department of Oregon Department of Agriculture on our emergency response program um and perhaps you're thinking expanding that educational training opportunity maybe whether with local producers or with College of Agriculture something like that maybe yeah I mean it couldn't hurt to I mean if anything it gets some of our next Generation uh folks you know a little bit more aware of some of the issues that they're going to fac in the next 100 years yeah so what schools come to mind you know uh I mean obviously Oregon State's already been approached and and they're they're really big in the nuclear side of things but they're also really big you know with with their agricultural side um I youan know if if uh University organs not not want to participate I would step it down to maybe the community college level and see if there's one there uh BL Mountain's got a decent program and they're right right down that Transportation border but there's there's several of them you could you could really uh look at I think that might laen yeah I was going to say read they have a test reactor and also following along I'm sorry I don't know your name Tom I think that's a great idea and I think anything to do with water hydrology Rivers um definitely would be a good approach to subject I I believe we know a professor at Mount Hood Community College who might be on the line here even has his hand well U one thing I I I know that you approached uo in one particular Department focusing more on the nuclear um but uo has the public policy and planning management um school that might be someone a group to talk to um also my my doctorate is from Portland State's uh School of urban and public Affairs and there's a lot of transportation and planning um and environmental issues that come up there uh and of course you could always uh you could always come to my college um since I teach geography and we I'm actually teaching Oregon right now and one of the things that I talked about um is uh is Hanford so um there's there's several things um that that I think you you could do um I'm kind of surprised that my old school uh at the University of Oregon at least in the science side wasn't interested but that's just a couple of suggestions okay thanks um and one thing is uh when some yahoo that lives in Suburban Portland someone like me calls you know cold calls a um it's not as uh imp ha full as say a legislator who might open open that conversation for us well I would if you would like I would certainly be uh willing to help in any way you you might F than you up okay uh anything else on that topic before we move on it sounds like um we've got several I I think Reed because the fact that they have a program there yeah is it Jason Jason Jason there um I just wanted to mention that uh for either of the for all three of the the state schools it might be uh a good idea to talk to their govern people because I think it probably gets to the right person if you get that that's a really good idea yeah that the all the schools will have a government relations office of some kind and that would be a natural point of contact as well they mostly are outward facing they might be more open to right okay that's a a good idea thank you uh the next thing on this list was in August we provided uh working with Odo a what was it a two page update to the board and wanted to get a little bit of feedback on is that something we should do and on how frequent a basis just a you know a short update bringing over from Odo and from The handford Advisory Board and kind of reporting back as well as progress on some of initiatives any comments did anyone read it I had it useful I think it especially uh you know where we've we've met where we haven't met as often with the co stuff it's kind of helped keep everybody a little bit more informed of some of the some of the uh things that have been changing yeah the board meets three times a year that's to schedule so having an interim you know email blast with some links and information and even just I think that message had uh links to the uh just the newspaper Tri City Herald some articles right just kind of putting all in one place for everybody the idea does monthly make sense or I mean the H Advisory Board tends to be meeting quarterly these days do we want to to go quarterly um we'll support whatever the board wants but well most of the burden of putting this together is on you guys so yeah I I mean if we can find time to do it no matter what but just I don't want to blood inboxes with nothing's happening this moment my take on it yeah exactly if Hab is only meeting orderly and there's not going to be anything really coming to us except for predominantly from that that update and then I would be okay with that quarterly with the understanding that obviously if something big kicks off you know we're going to hear from that or you know I mean so so how about like we did this time about a month ahead of the meeting you know a month six weeks ahead of our next meeting we get an update out so that people are refreshed with Tim okay um so the other uh the next thing on this agenda was or on my agenda uh was what other measures can we take to fulfill the uh the cleanup board's mission and the the number one topic that's kind of floated to surface recently was to provide an annual uh report or update to the state legislature um because that would help fulfill our uh you know our obligation to help formulate policy in the long term so uh the idea was put together a say a yearend report on an annual basis where with the uh our legislative Representatives on the board to put that together so that they've got uh a deliverable if you will to the uh to their legislature so open discussion so I think it's a a really good idea um I'm thinking from a practical standpoint um it's not something the board has done in a long time if the board has done it and so there isn't a process necessarily in for how a product comes out of the board um is it consensus is it um majority vote in the past staff has done a lot of the the writing and then it's gone to the board for consideration and we're sort of changing things a little bit and that's not a bad thing um but it's important to be inclusive of everyone on the board and have everyone have a chance to weigh in so I don't know if it would be appropriate to start sort of a subcommittee to to work on that process i' supported I'm I'm sort of a process geek on the hab so I've got some experience figuring out how to write things like that so if if there are board members that want to join that or start a subcommittee um I would support it and try to get some consistent process that we can all say oh yeah this is what we're supposed to do next and here's the email list we're supposed to forward it to that type of thing so Senator gark and representative Gamba do you have any thoughts what would be helpful for you to me the top of my head a couple of things I would say just as practical uh one don't release it during session it won't get R um and keep it as and a high level uh practically interesting thank you one thing I would recommend this is mar would be uh and I have written such reports for the Le of Women Voters it's a lot more people will read it if you have at least one photo in it now Hanford has some glorious landscape photographs so you have a lot of material to work with but if you can put in just that one little bit of I can you will get a lot more people reading it Senator gon um I would just I I think uh representative gamb is right um I would make sure that you um address this report to um the house the Senate and also to the governor's office um it it should go to all three should be a nice concise um sort of report I I also think and I was a little disappointed in the one gentleman's um uh response to a question about safety I felt like he just kind of glossed right over that um I think safety should be a factor that we also talk about in terms of you know what's what's going on at Hanford to ensure that you know not just Tri Cities but Oregon which you know we're just a few miles down the road from the border um that there you know that we're considering that um I think is important I'm I'm very disappointed too in the uh the delegation the federal delegation uh Hanford is a huge and important issue uh and it's you know we're still living with things from World War II and this is the Colombia River and Agriculture and transport it it's it touches on so many things that um it's a little well I'm getting a little farfield but it's a little disconcerting that they were just like oh yeah well tell us if there's something important it it is important and I think uh anything in the report should somehow help to um Inspire that that view that this is an important place in many many ways had a very I want to say low level but at a very uh uh average person's understanding level zero acronyms talk about again what I said practical aspects of it because you sending it to a group of people who is a dentist is a surgeon is a lawyer you know in that building has the background to understand the science deeply they're going to need a very base primmer what's going on here what are the potential dangers like Chris said right is is there radioactive material that may weak into the Columbia River I mean that's a yeah you use the",

        "text": " that you do have the information but I do think the holidays did interfere with some of the responsiveness there Friday December 9th Friday facts thank you in what way are you comfortable in what way do you want to see this continue to be explored and what further information might you need well I've had a lot of conversations with others city of Hillsborough and then of course they're people that have been in this game for quite some time since we had the grand land bargain what was that 2015 conceptually I think if we don't do something like this we send a pretty negative message to our existing um private sector investors in in Washington County and all around the region um so I think we have to do this I I'm I really liked what we had done back in the uh defining the 50-year urban growth boundary I mean you talk about a million dollars that you put out there from Metro Catherine I would imagine many jurisdictions spent well over a million dollars individually and then corporately coming together so it was a huge task um I thought we came to a pretty good only to have that tossed out for me on a uh something reasonably minor but that's just me so I think we need to kind of go back to that and the land that was removed from the reserves from Urban Reserves specifically right out here on Jackson School Road and that around is the legislative process so I understand I think we're going to have to get into the Super siding part of it just because they took that out of Metro's hands when they did that can if if it can what I tend to do to go down details below that absolutely go right ahead uh when the when the state in 2017 enabled the urban and rural reserves program the the legislation and the rules were adopted by the state that said the decision would not go to Luba it would be subject to the court of so as the state moves forward with legislation that allows for the state potential state supersiting I think what we're suggesting is that they learn from that there is a floor there that we don't want to see this tied up in subsequent actions tied up in Luba but also they should think about what about court of appeals and Supreme Court and of course it'll have to be constitutional and that's why legislative Council works on all of that and I I'm declaring I'm not certifiably smart enough to know what all that is but rather I'm encouraging them to look at that experience so that we don't end up as a state jumping through all these hoops even potentially earning chip sack dollars and only have it sit stale and repeat the time between the 2015 and the lcdc affirmation process and then all the appeals that took us through to 20 I think it was 2019 because I was chair there's no long time like that I don't know if you've got a direction from me but I'm I'd be supportive of us taking a taken fairly aggressive position and encouraging that you're saying to be you're saying to be a hub yes okay I just want to make sure you're can I ask you a little bit more about that and those conversations I'm and I'm not debating your your position of yes as you put it we have to do this I'm thinking about once again the details below that and the enabling I've learned through our work with CWS of how important water not just the in-going water but the out going water from the semiconductor so I assume there will be a significant investment that needs to be made not just in education and some of this we did talk about in that work session but I think it's impactful it's not just about a Workforce right it's not just about building new factories but you gotta have the underlying infrastructure for such factories to perform which also gets me one resources part of that is a natural resource base there's water oh yes yes of course sorry once I think natural resources I think about air and forests which brings me back to air though um particulate matter Knox it's the knock side of things uh part of what enabled further expansion by both PGE and Intel uh was the Region's work on remember the CMAC funds and our work on on air shed uh particularly on the transportation side so that we were protecting more air shed that pie to be used for manufacturing so there's something there that there's a base my gut sense is there's a base that needs to happen there a base that I'm not doing a good job of articulating but that needs to be cost coverage there we learn the county was in Jeopardy of exceeding a a level right yeah we had made all that investment which allowed that growth and yet there will have that the DEQ monitors were showing that we had a problem which is why there was the wood stove that's now run its course and so there's this vulnerability that I don't want to go unaddressed or or such that we have to just come up with a solution by ourselves without a state and EQ resources I think I think think what you're saying in a larger context is what did we learn from from growing that that that sector and how would we look to the future if we if if we move into further growth of that sector and what are the you know what what are the learnings I think that's really the and I don't know that it's just limited to the things that you've talked about okay I have a do I do have a significant concern as well but I really I've been saying a lot here and I would like to reserve the right to speak last in terms of our conversation uh and raise that later so if if Commissioners Patrice Phi and Rogers if you wouldn't mind weighing in on these useful conversations that are these useful questions that Aaron is asking us there's hands Pam and Roy I'll go okay I'll go first um Erin thank you for this information um it's it's a really a complex issue and and I think it's a lot of conversation a lot of people are having especially in the elected official circles and I think what will be helpful for us or for me I should say and I think will be really helpful for the board is if we can have sort of like a letter in terms of criteria of what we as a board can live with in terms of this if we have that criteria then I think we can navigate around these conversations because I think um there's just a lot going on and I one of the conversation I was reflecting back and I don't know how it fits in so please also share as much information as you can in you know just feel free to toss everything on our mailbox because I really like to catch up and because I did I participated the manufacturing tour and I was really impressed with how it was organized and the sort of the energy and the enthusiasm behind what just happened with this CHIP app so and for us to be an active member in these conversations I think a lot information whatever information you could share earn for me I would don't feel don't feel shy to and don't worry about bombarding my inbox the other thing I was wondering and I don't know how it fits in probably the information you share will clarify this for me is that when I was running some of them give me community members that I met with and were around uh you know going back to this Urban Reserve rural reserves designations that some group of people that wanted to come to the other side they couldn't there's some legislation conversation happening not going forward and and then there's no uh not Multnomah County but Washington County and some similar things happening in Clackamas County so I wasn't able to track I I don't know how it fits in and I know I have a meeting coming up with one of the groups that met with me when I was running about that particular issue and I imagine it's tied with this CHIP app what issue I don't I still don't understand if I if I understand you correctly you kind of need you need the urban rural reserves 101 of how we ended up in Washington County with what we have and what the process would potentially be related to any reform of urban and rural research and then how it ties back into this conversation yeah you did a very well synthesizing what I did that but also there were a group of people who were pushing some I think I'm looking at Roy Rogers like the county the commission to get their switch to Urban rural Reserve yeah they're talking about yeah yeah that's so taken out of yeah I don't want to put in it so I I didn't want to maybe they've gone to the legislature each day over the last three Cycles so those groups like how did this all tie in and those efforts so those are what I was wondering uh that's the issues yeah I think it's um once there's a better sense of what the lands that are being considered for potential um designation related to the semiconductor as a potential large lot that particular property will probably look like something on a map that's under discretion um overall the urban rural reserves is a longer background memo that I will work with Lut to make sure that you have that background information and then I will make sure that then it ties back to what this conversation is about because at the end of the day in Washington County any redesignation of a reserve is only a legislative issue right do not control that and it it is intent those reserves are intended for a 50-year lifespan and so it is a big political question and that's why the super exciting question in rural reserves becomes a very big not accidental use a-n-o-t yes thank you was saying senator solman he's introduced to Bill as men and already what does that look like in comparison to what we're talking about um I have not seen that particular LC I also mentioned I forgot to mention this um there is a joint committee that is going to be addressing semiconductor work it is going to be co-chaired by representative Janelle Bynum from Clackamas County and Senator Janine solman from Washington County they will be the co-chairs of that joint committee so I enjoy my evenings in Salem uh but so I think that is a bill that she brings to the table year over year I don't know how it ends up folded into this conversation because I think that merely redesignating that land is very different than a super exciting Authority so it would have to be part of the conversation um but it's out there there's placeholders we",

very interested in being making sure that they are kept aware of projects and and sort of uh kept in the loop so to speak uh with respect to potential energy projects and and the possibility might have to impact you know dod you know defense space or what have you uh they just want to make sure that that they they're kept in the loop and uh so that that role making is on the schedule for that reason any questions about that one no um all right let's move to the next slide so here we have the projects for 2026 and Beyond so uh there certainly could be some I'm sorry I'd like having a delayed reaction to that when I'm I'm processing uh this for the record this is chair Grail are we has this been a problem is it just something that they have a need of yes sir please yeah thank you for the record to fet um this is a request made by um you know came on behalf of the dod in the in the Clearing House um because as Tom said they're very interested particularly with renewable energy projects and the potential impacts of those projects to either physical military assets or training kind of grounds either early on the ground or or in the air so renewable energy facilities you know can and do uh impact you know their ability to you know conduct military Readiness exercises and and so it's a very real thing um this issue came about several years ago with the um saddle but case um I think that predated most of council members it was a wind turbin proposed in military training routes around the bourman bombing range and there had been a lot of issues some County projects had been approved and had created incursions in those military training routes maybe some FC projects and I think when at that point the dod got involved was a little bit sort of late in the process you know and and had some pretty significant impacts to to that particular project since then we have been very um proactive in communicating with you know her Kim's predecessor Kim the dod it works fine right now there is good there is good communication and information um and I'm not aware of any circumstances where they haven't been made aware early of projects however that's not a requirement it's not in rule it's basically we recognize we staff recognize the purpose and value of that and and take it upon ourselves to make sure that that happens I think the issue and concern is what if we change our mind or or people in the future don't have that same sensibility so the idea is to put it in rule to ensure essentially what we're already doing um and so we're you know we don't have any we staff don't have any concerns about doing that um but like I said for for now with our current staff it's already being done um just not on a from a regulatory standpoint on a this is good um public business standpoint thank you for the clarification I just I think all of us in our work lives have had to um try to quote correct something for you know one situation that did not require a big thing to correct and I basically wanted to make sure we were not taking on an Endeavor to over correct thank you so I I don't have an issue with it I just wanted to understand and I do I mean since I just switch jobs I do understand what happens when a person who has been doing something is no longer there so you and your staff are there I can understand their concern so thank you for that clarification so uh yeah yeah I think any other questions on that particular one okay so for it's difficult to forecast Beyond I think at this point considering how ambitious our schedule is how whether we'll be you know what 2026 will look like um I imagine at least some of this schedule will see some slippage and and it'll and so there'll be some of these projects will slip into 2026 at this point the only thing that we know for sure is that there are a whole bunch of standards that we're going to look at as part of phase three and so as we kind of move forward and get through the 2024 2025 lists we're going to start seeing more more and more uh rule making projects that are specifically directed at various standards as part of our kind of phase three rule making effort so uh that's yeah that's where this slide looks the way it does any any other questions about and and obviously as we get closer we'll you know start evaluating which standards should we look at first should we group them should we do so we look at them by themselves uh you know what makes the most sense um yeah we're we're we're that's an eternity way but it is on the it is on the forecast that is where we're headed okay uh next slide so that's rule making projects this slide uh is just an informative slide about pending five-year reviews um you can see uh every time we have a a adopt new rules so it's literally it's just a sort of black and white if we even if we significantly amend a rule there is no statutory requirement that we look look at that if we create a new rule no matter how small if the new number is generated by the Secretary of State we are statutorily obligated to review that rule within uh five years to evaluate whether the rule had its intended effect whether the anticipated fiscal impact was you know underestimated overestimated uh whether we should repeal it or amend it uh whether we need it at all the impacts on small business so there's a there's a list of things we have to analyze as part of that but the next one just coincidentally or not is the uh review of the amendment rule making which is which is due on January 28th of next year so that is the next pending fiveyear review so we'll essentially be doing that as part of our Amendment rule making just you know as a matter of course uh and then any of the the rules that we generated this last year will be due in 2028 so uh which there were more than a few um but any questions about the fiveyear view or what's coming up okay well that brings us to public comments on the role making schedule so I will turn it over to Nancy to run that but if there are uh any any comments about what we've discussed so far with respect to the RO making schedule now's Now's the Time all right for the public comments period if you're on the line or online I should say um you're going to go ahead and click on the participants and you're going to see a little hand icon and you can click on that to raise your hand if you'd like to comment if you're on the phone you're going to press star three to um on your keypad to raise your hand and star three again to lower your hand at this point we do have a gentleman here in the room that is going to make some public comments if you'd like to go ahead and come up you can do good morning my name is uh Randy B I work for Oregon Military Department as the master planner for installations and I am here to uh make some comments for the record on the ru making schedule um I'm here early in the process because we're looking at essentially rule 241 the one that was discussed for the Federal agency coordination and and that's we know that that's probably not going to come up for discussion until next year uh but we wanted to put our marker down early and I typically speak extemporaneously but I've been asked to read some comments in other records so uh the Department of Defense through the Oregon Military Department and the department of the Navy has had a long and effective working relationship with Oregon Department of energy we have worked together and have consulted several times on proposed energy projects and that have potential impacts on military training and operations uh the Navy's Northwest training range complex out of Woodby Island and the Oregon Military Department's ground and air assets are critical to national uh are or a critical National Asset that enables War fighters to prepare for real world operations the NW TRC includes training and testing ranges and training routes throughout the Oregon in Washington which are connected to the restricted areas over Naval Weapon systems training facility in Borman within Oregon there are approximately 13,000 military personnel presently in this state including the Army and Air National Guard uh the Oregon Military Department manages and trains Oregon and Army Air National Guard uh and provides uh facilities and institutional support for them and responds to the governor's orders during peace time and during Naturals that natural disasters to sustain the military Mission and Associated required training the military is dependent on the support and cooperation of land use authorities and that includes Odo we have worked with the Oregon State and County stakeholders for years in support of compatible land air and sea uses utilizing DOD funding we recently completed a $1 million initiative to create an interactive mapping tool to facilitate notification and coordination with renewable energy and transmission stakeholders and Associated qualitative assessments this is known as the Oregon Renewable Energy site assessment also by its acronym oresa and another initiative looking at potential location for transmission infrastructure in support of offshore wind in southern Oregon and Northern California in 2019 House Bill 2329 included notification to the dod for energy projects permitted at the county level this is good it is necessary but it isn't in of itself insufficient We Believe notification by itself will not ensure early collaboration in favor of a win-win nor are there any assurances of addressing any potential adverse impacts to National Security uh currently we don't have a rule a rule or a viable process with odoe to ensure early notification of the dod for projects that are located in and around our critical training testing and operational areas the lack of notification has in the past resulted in additional time contested cases and outright removal of a project during construction is as Todd mentioned earlier with the vast majority of projects the implementation of a viable early notification policies in coordination with the military ensures that future land uses are compatible with military operations while fostering renewable energy and supporting of state regulations and policies the processes in place are ad hoc and create challenges with normal staff turnover and they don't provide a clear and transparent coordination process DOD is engaging early in this Ru making because proper development of these processes is critical for ensuring the",

        "text": " got a lot more to learn so that we can use these Economic Development tools effectively so that's all um I just have more to try and so these policy questions and these objectives so there's what you heard and now this slide so how do we marry up the fact that through your conversations with us one-on-one you've heard could we go back Wednesday we've you've heard these things so how do you see us incorporating these themes into either the current policy objectives or the need for new Standalone policy objectives uh it's a great question I think uh the staff can take a look at the nine policy objectives that we have and propose some modification or changes to uh to strengthen or to modify them to align with some of these things that we've heard or other priorities that the board has so I think uh you know one place that we might start uh that you all might start is as we think about um supporting economic Mobility the powerful slide that uh that Chris uh showed that shows that uh folks uh every Everybody benefits that there is a job uh pay premium all across the board um but in particular is shown in communities of color there could be an opportunity there as we look at Partnerships with Workforce Development initiatives that are tied to these Investments uh or other such initiatives where we ask that those types of initiatives be prioritized with these companies that they they work with kind of regional plans around quality jobs or economic Mobility so it's just one example that I have I didn't tee this up properly first of all these are the three themes that they've heard from us are we each thumbs up on these as three themes that we want to see incorporated into the policy objectives I have a question about that are are we talking you know I'm looking at the uh six policy objectives that have been Consolidated right and this is those are from those are are also from 2000 2006 six yeah okay and then I was just reading through the nine others and so these three are in addition they they seem to stand out separately than what we've currently got is that is that uh the three um bullet points here uh commissioner trees that we have in this slide are uh themes that we've heard uh from your board uh as as your conversations have evolved around Economic Development and so but the suggestion is uh how might these three themes be merged or modify or change uh the nine policy objectives that are currently in the 2006 or being made clear well in it I read the nine those three don't appear to be represented in the nine that's what that's I just want to make sure we're all on that same page that's what that's why I'm checkpointing yeah are we all I'm fine with those three I have a question last one yeah me too what if a particular development is Supersonic and it's outside of a city well how does that how do you apply that particular provision Annex equip but what if they don't want to or it's not clear what city might serve so I think that's how your program impact whether or not we don't have to sign an sip it's not a requirement under law so if your policy objectives are um somehow as as Matt and his team draft an update to the program objectives I think it can either enhance or be made much more explicit that there has to be a city partner at the table for an urban sip the I we're not getting into land use because we don't have Lut at the table and we're working on that and you'll hear a little bit more about that X presentation um but looking at that annexation requirement in the super sighting um as part of that conversation with the governor's office with our city partners and things of that nature but it can also be implemented through the program objectives which would set standards for us as we negotiate with firms that are asking us for an sip agreement is that statement I'm just gonna say I don't know if that answered at all but I understand your answer it's just that I I totally agree that Urban Services should be provided but there are rural uh ships we tend to forget that a lot of our counties were all and if all of a sudden remember Oregon I just picked in a remote place there was some thing very unique that somebody said we want to do is sip up there would that prohibit flexibility on the County's Park that's what I'm asking what's the flexibility for the future not today 2043 something else happens that's that's a good question I think that's something else to look into yeah I think it can also be written into program objectives where you clarify the difference between a rural and an urban sip set of program objectives where if you want to plan for a potential rural you can do that that can be done you know it's reiterate on that uh commissioner Rogers I think I think that's exactly where when we talk about strengthening these program objectives or adding to these programs objectives it's that kind of clear language that um that could be helpful to to create um kind of more clarity going on in the future about the board's expectations for urban or rural sap deals yeah I think that makes sense never know yep I think uh my question is the last two different way than how commissioner Rogers asked this isn't something that I brought it up in my conversations with you so I think uh I'd like to see if you move forward to incorporate I like to see some options of what that looks like um to consider um I think um I'm not sure where that last bullet is heading in terms of the conversation about annexing but it does seem like perhaps we need to separate the two this is you know sorry the annexation conversation versus this last bullet point I think in the previous slide Urban Services provision um and then annexation into a city is how that is is the Tactical step for realizing that I hear you but people that live in unincorporated areas we can't force them to Annex we're not talking about people we're talking about companies companies that are looking for our investment in an industrial facility and we can't we already know we can't do it alone um it's a magic Society people are companies I think um the the provisions are I think it's just bigger conversation about the the relating back to the history around Nike and how that um I think we just I I would like to see some options to consider as one Commissioners that didn't bring this forward and then the other the other thing I had the tax abatements being 15 years have we historically had less than 15 years or what are some decision points to consider yeah so the a good question commissioner fight um the Sip tool is built around a 15-year tax abatement um there are other tools uh Enterprise zones specifically that use the shorter term tax abatement but the the 15 years is built into that uh built into the tool for sap it's a statutory request yeah so we can't negotiate lower them they're lower than that or longer than that actually I was thinking less um and then the other question I had is in terms of who is at the table you know this agreement or the process of the application being city and county partner who else is missing could we or is that also a statutory commitment another revisit that process thank you another another great question um uh included in this Statute in the statutes for the Sip process is a public hearing there is a requirement to have a hearing about the draft agreement uh before the county signs off on it so that's when you look at the statutes that's the primary required step um now should your board have other interests in expansion of uh you know discussion with other parties uh something that staff could explore okay and then the last comment I had was for you Chris uh your company Economist develops a great report uh I was reflecting back the other night of my campaign materials and a lot of those came from your company so I appreciate all the reports that you develop and it really did show the quality of the presentation that you presented today so thank you thank you to Econo requesting Mr Willie what are your thoughts well um I'm going back to that conversation about Rural and I'm reading the definition of role and I don't know this is our agreement this is not a state agreement so I don't think we have any place that qualifies this rural the genenta Sip is a rural one well it is but it was no longer allowed I mean we can't do another rural one there and that one just slid under the wire so um and I don't even remember why it was done that way I think initially their their initial investment wasn't of the 100 million billion dollar size it was like 250 million or something like that again because they've certainly done more since then but yeah so yeah I'm looking at the rural thing I'm thinking urban service provisions and quite frankly we're any possible sightings that we're going to have from Chip's money is going to be one we're going to want to be annexed into the cities we do not want that responsibility because we can't handle so that's what I'm thinking so that doesn't bother me a bit unless there's heartburn about whether or not they should Annex or not which I think that should be a provision the rest of the rest of those are just fine I I have I guess just listening to the in the total dialogue um I'm okay with with what we're going on this I think it's certainly time that we did a little bit of a Refresh on this I don't know what other additional fees that we would be considering but it certainly does allow us to provide some or add some additional fees in there obviously negotiated so yeah I've read I've read everything else in the 06 agreement and I think I think there's a a lot of criteria in there I mean the program objectives and then you go to back to the part back where um they have to meet all this the review process and they have to go there pretty thorough I think so I'm I'm okay with this great thank you I'll I'll go through mine um so commissioner Rogers I heard your question on the third bullet on this slide as really trying to better um in rural areas for Rural sip so I I heard you're fine with with the themes as well and I know I'm I'm fine with these three themes uh with regard to an um and appreciating that as you said our next step will include your putting together staff proposals so uh the other thing that I don't quite have my head around is and would expect you to help us",

lights on nope you just turned it off and now there you go hi my name is Brent morce uh we have a business at 4750 the Hazel Green Road um let me get my prepared statement here uh good evening mayor and uh Council I'm here as a representative of our business located at 4750 Hazel Green Road we share a common lot line located along the east side of this development I'm here to convey my support for the development there has been some concerns brought up regarding the screening along the South property line abing the pg&amp; power line easements this easement has made the decision easier uh let me follow up we installed a large solar array on our back building along that power line easement because there's no trees it's completely clear so um that was one of my concerns coming forward that I like the decision that you made earlier and then the thought of possibly having a tree planted right in the corner could possibly affect my solar production but uh I really just want to say I support the development and understand that you know sometimes developments are so that's everything thank you are there questions thank you for your testimony is there anybody else who did not have the chance to sign up who wanted to uh testify in this matter yes step on up to the microphone introduce yourself with your name and either your address or your ward I'm Steven Shuli uh I don't know my w 4795 Apollo Avenue um the appealant your word five word five um I have no way to screen this out right I don't want to look at apartments from my backyard this is 10 feet from my backyard the parking lot's 10 feet starting at my backyard now yeah they agreed to put a fence in great well what about the trees why is it that I get robbed that right for me to be able to enjoy my backyard that's part of the code right liability and appearance that robs me of that I think I have the right to have not to be able to see that that's my big thing I don't think I'm at a line asking that um they have 15.6 acres to fit their stuff in the fact that my backyard's 109 ft long doesn't make any difference what what is the definition of intent on the C when it's asking when it's required to put the trees in if that intent that definition of intent is to obscure the apartments that doesn't meet it because they remove right can't can't happen it's not fair to me my tax lot to backyard thank you thank you for your testimony uh now it's time for oh do you have a question of the applicant sir could you step back up we have a question for you sorry about that uh councelor gwy so I'm I'm going to ask you the same question that guest counselor sultz asked and that was there was an email dated May 9th that says my client will agree to install the the fence wait no wait no it was toac I've been authorized to withdraw the appeal your um if your client will agree to install the fence and Landscaping not including trees as shown in figure one below together with a payment of $3,500 yes because I have been had to H hire counsel pay for an appeal because code won't be upheld and I figured I um try to work with the uh applicant if I got reimbursed but that's not the case they wouldn't reimburse me I I'm out these so that's not fair you know I'm still sitting here I still want the trees I didn't want to have to come here and go through all this but here we are and I don't think I really at this point need to give any more than I need to to be quite honest with you thank you I think councelor nishok has a question for you now thank you um I understand and hear your frustration the question I have is is there anything preventing you from putting trees in your own backyard it's the same rules I can't plant anything there I can't build a fence in but in the e in further inside your yard not at the easement but it's 8 ft no so there's those 8 ft and then the easement I I won't I'll walk out my back door and run what trees so then you're you're only 8 ft from the easement my back porch is 8 ft and then the easement is 109 whatever okay my rest the rest of my backyard right so but but is that the rest of your backyard yes okay thank you thank you all right so we're on to questions of Staff close the thank you so Mr panko if you want to step back up we have questions for you now then we'll have an opportunity for rebuttal after we hear from Mr Pano I wanted to ask you about the uh appellant attorney's assertion uh that our code overrides that easement have you had a chance to analyze that question and or should we ask maybe ask the City attorney about that I would like to hear more about what the City's take on that issue is um yes we did see that argument in the notice of appeal and we provided a response in the staff report um so the applicants attorney is correct um so the standard applies um to that area um along the southern property line um the BPA easement creates a hardship for the applicant um and the applicant has sought an adjustment to that standard um so staff is applying that standard and the applicant is Seeking a path um for reducing um or altering that standard through the adjustment process okay I feel like you just answered my question in a circle so yes our code overrides that easement do but yet the applicant is subject to both our code and the easement and it's not possible to perform part of it under the rules of the easement which still applies is that what you said yes so we're requ iring them to do our code requires them to do something that's not possible because of another rule right they're seeking to relief from that standard using the adjustment process which can be used in similar situations where there is a hardship unique to the property um the applicant can demonstrate that um they're equally or better meeting the intent of the provision and seek some sort of relief from whatever standard is causing the okay are there additional questions for staff counselor nishok you had one earlier do you have that question well I think it basically got answered with yours okay thank you councelor staple I was trying to find in the packet how many trees are on the site that will be planted eventually maybe not in this location but the the whole site do you know where I would find that um I don't know right off where I can point you to in that staff report um the applicants here and they can probably directly to that number um I can mention that um our code requires at a minimum from from multif family development one tree be planted per 2,000 square ft um so besides this um buffer area to the South um the applicant will be Landscaping the entire site and meeting um otherwise meeting code requirements for minimum trees and thank you um and is there anything in the code I think I know the answer to this but I'll ask it anyway is there anything in the code uh that talks about lighting concerns um I know both councelor nishioka and I are very uh big Dark Skies advocates um and um and I understand the uh folks concerns with lighting pollution um coming from this location is there anything in our code right now that addresses that concern where all of the outdoor lighting is directed down yes we do have standards for fixed Lighting on the site um and there are limits for how much uh light can be uh projected onto neighboring properties okay thank you so much additional questions for staff all right thank you Mr panko it's time for rebuttal from the applicant thank you Zack pels again is it possible to bring my presentation back up I think that will help answer a few of those questions just want to respond to a couple of points I can start with councelor stapleton's question about how many trees were planting I can't give an exact exact number but I have the planting schedule in front of me and just a quick glance I think we're planting nearly 450 trees across the and 3,000 plus shrubs across the site there's it's a big site there' be a lot of lot of new plants on site when it's all done um if I can interrupt you for one second staff are you working on the presentation thank you just wanted to make sure somebody's working on that thank you yeah I just want to respond to a few points from from the appellant and and I guess that's probably it uh just to I guess reiterate your staff's response about the easement um and whether it it applies here you know there's there's actually two sections in the code um that I think we can take your staff's word for but there is a section prior to 11060 that talks about private easements in relationship to uh the city's development codes there's there's a prior section that is 0.55 that talks about federal regulations and I think that might be the more applicable standard here as this is a BPA easement it's it's it's a it's a public easement it's it's it's benefiting the department of energy and it's it's kind of serving a bigger purpose than just uh private private property so I think um there is a question about whether that is applicable there and what that says in that 055 is that um in the case of Federal Regulations federal regulations Trump local regulations nonetheless um as your staff pointed out the the section on private e must just say that um the city's development code generally applies in the case of private easement so as staff pointed out the city's code also has a process to provide flexibility to the city's rules in certain cases and in this case we are requesting an adjustment and there's and that's the process we're following and the purpose for adjustments um is just is just this very situation where we have a unique development situation um in this case that does not allow treace right and we're requesting an adjustment and in exchange for that adjustment um we've offered some some other concessions I just want to show I I think regarding the screening",

        "text": " this offshore wind in oregon can connect to the broader western interconnection um really the whole system for the entire western connection act works together so we have to model all that at once and we'll look a little bit further afield from oregon um so i'll just give a like a one or two minute overview of the study itself and then dive right into the transmission takeaways and then hopefully leave as much time as possible for questions so i hope to be talking less than 10 minutes just myself so great yeah so diagram on the upper left shows our workflow for a lot of our large-scale grid integration studies so this is similar to how an integrated resource plan will work for just kind of your run-of-the-mill integrated resource plan for utilities where you start with the capacity expansion model that finds the cost optimal build out of a few for a future year and then you translate that into a production cost model which finds the cost optimal operations of that infrastructure so this just similar to travis's study this was a production cost model at the hourly level for the entire western interconnection and just on the bottom here shows a typical output for for study like this where we see a few days dispatch stack and showing what technologies are making up what percentage of the load so if you move the next slide jason i talk about a few of the scenarios that we modeled so generally you know we have a base system and then what's interesting about the study is various scenarios and seeing how those the broader grid operations travis's study had already looked at you know swept through one zero through five gigawatts in one gigawatt increments so they really dive dove down into different capacities we chose a few offshore wind capacities and then changed other things about the system and to show how those interacted with the offshore wind energy injected into the western uh the key one i want to call out here is actually number three upgraded and by upgrade i just mean increase the thermal limits of these trans coastal lines so these are the lines that connect the coastal communities like coos bay and new and uh oregon to the willamette valley where much more there's a much larger load centers there and then of course connects the points of interconnection for the offshore wind to the broader to the broader grid in oregon and then to the rest of the western connection so the this trans-coastal range is sort of like the the gate that nx offer went to the rest of the system and there isn't really besides a few key paths which i think i show on the next slide there are um there's not really anywhere else for the offshore one to go so in order to to look at higher penetrations we we increase the the limits of these lines to allow more of the energy to get get to the rest of the system uh so next slide please i think the next slide is just the the grid version of these scenarios oh i skipped that one okay um so we had eight key findings and there was kind of a variety of topics related to offshore wind and it's its value to the grid but because this is a short time and there's a lot to talk about uh and because this is focused on sort of the transmission value benefits of the offshore wind rather than just the technology itself um we're gonna i'm gonna just call it three key findings so the first one is that the existing system and this is referencing the existing oregon grid can support just about 2.6 gigawatts of offshore wind without leading to large-scale curtailment so when we say support we mean most of that energy is actually being used instead of being curtailed and you know not being useful um finding three is that this kind of goes along with finding one which is that if once we go past 2.6 gigawatts of offshore wind we hit some major curtailment and up you know above 10 of the energy just can't find a use in the system and this is mostly due to transmission congestion on those cross cut across trans coastal lines that i was talking about so lines going from the coast over the coastal range into the willamette valley and then finding seven skipping down a bit has to do with some transmission farther afield so we found that offshore wind increases the oregon to california transmission exports which makes sense right so we're seeing some of that offshore wind injected down to california and it's it's a little bit more nuanced you know as travis said you can't track individual electrons but we see that when we inject more offshore wind we see more flow on that line so suggesting that it might off displace some uh generation somewhere else in maybe eastern oregon or washington that was being sent down to california now there's actually more energy going down and that energy can be used more locally okay so skip ahead please the next just have one slide in each of these findings so we'll just go through them one at a time pretty quickly so here's another map that we've all been excited we've seen seen a bunch of these now uh but calls out the high voltage transmission that exists right now along the coast so you see those more bolded lines represent the higher voltage lines that can actually handle this this level you know hundreds of megawatts of power and injection and traditionally power has flown only from the east to the west across these lines so there hasn't been hardly any native generation along the coast so this will change that balance significantly to the point where the lines will be overlaid overloaded once we go above 2.6 gigawatts of nameplate capacity so i'm happy to go over the kind of method that we chose for distributing capacity and finding that but we essentially we use an iterative and kept bumping up the capacity until we started to see curtailment along those lines and we tried to put as much of the capacity as possible as you can see the wind speeds get significantly higher so you wanted to maximize those sites uh but we were still limited by this particular transmission topology and so this is this is the best we thought we could do without upgrading lines okay the next slide shows that once we go beyond that 2.6 gigawatts we we start to see curtailment oh right sorry some caveats to this um this is not a detailed power flow analysis and i actually think i saw a question that maybe i could just knock out right now in the chat um related to right so this is not a copyrighted power flow or resource adequacy analysis so it does not capture line outage contingencies or assess the reliability of the system give you know a a robust capacity credit metric to the to the offshore wind so it's really more a production cost it's most the production cost model is more measuring what happens in sort of everyday steady state operations to to minimize cost it doesn't model severe outage conditions or unexpected outcomes we do have things like forced outage rate and maintenance rates built into the model so that generators are forced out for a certain percentage of the time but we didn't model explicit line outages a few other caveats uh there's smaller scale transmission that would be required to integrate the software wind which we didn't look at because we figured that's all kind of built into the cost of the lcoe and it might not necessarily have a huge impact on the grid itself also because this isn't a capacity expansion model we our representation of transmission upgrades was relatively simple you know just increasing the thermal limits to allow the lines to carry more energy but we didn't get into the cost of those upgrades or what else might be required like reactive power support or you know other other complicated yeah so and and i think that will actually feed nicely into what jason will talk about next with the northern northern grid study but um they they're of course more responsible for the comprehensive power flow in really looking at what exactly these lines can handle and what exactly would be needed to upgrade the lines to allow this to be pushed through but we're really just looking at thermal limits saying if you can bump it up by a few hundred megawatts you know however that needs to happen this is how much more offshore wind could be injected and this is how much that would benefit the grid so i think that leads nicely to the next slide if you'll go ahead right so this shows curtailment in four different scenarios uh along the five different points of interconnection so going from north to south so cloud stop in the north near astoria and then fairview further south towards the california border you can see here that so the first two the blue and orange bars represent scenarios where we did not increase uh transmission the the thermal limits of the transmission lines but all of these four scenarios have five gigawatts of i'll throw in so we're seeing the max curtailment um in situations where we don't increase that those lines that you can see that we're seeing you know significant curtailment to the point where it wouldn't really make sense to add that much offshoring without upgrading those lines method of course for producing curtailment is to shift it to shift energy from periods of lower demand to higher demand using storage and we did study that a bit so we added storage in a couple scenarios it was only 10 of the max power but 24 hour duration and so it wasn't a study of storage by any means it wasn't you know meant to say this is all that storage can do but in this particular scenario in the way that we set up storage it did reduce curtailment by about 15 even without any transmission upgrades um but we're still at levels that are pretty unreasonable for for the investment of all that uh generation so we would still need to see transmission upgrades to make those worthwhile um so that's what's meant by the furthest the next two bars um the brown and darker red are near zero um across the board so you can see in claptop there actually are zero and then in toledo it's less than about five percent so that shows that in the transmission upgrade scenarios we avoided most of the curtailment there um okay next slide should be the last one i think finding seven um right so this is showing how offshore when we inject more offshore wind we also see higher imports from oregon to california and that these happen to coincide nicely with their peak net load",

        "text": " just lean into the microphone and then that way it'll ensure it catches so just for the voice vote on that so i'll recall that so and buyer for the record empire yes thank you you okay our next agenda item is a demo of mapping a reporting tool from wally adams odo operations and policy analyst he will present a demonstration of the oregon renewable energy siting assessment mapping and reporting tool good morning wally good morning council and chair grill just need a second here to get set up and to start sharing my screen when we're totally remote we don't have to have the time to physically switch okay thank you again um and good morning so about a year ago actually i did a presentation on the oregon renewable energy siting assessment project to council and i'll give you a brief refresher on the project but at the time we said that part of the project was to develop a mapping and reporting tool and that is now done and has been launched and that's really the purpose here today and we'll jump into that pretty quick and show you the tool which you know i think um the project team has called it the capstone delivery uh deliverable for the i've called it the crown jewel i mean it's i i think you'll like it it's pretty neat you know as we go into this um i want to some special thanks to the military for providing the funding for the project and we have kim peacher on the line and i think we can actually see her too so i'd like to give her a chance to introduce herself and say a few words thank you wally can you hear me yes who can okay uh good morning uh chair grail vice chair how members of the council my my name is kim peacher i am the northwest training range complex community planning liaison officer i am a civilian i've been doing this about 11 years and the other hat i wear is the civilian lead for the northwest department of defense regional coordination team which brings together all of the military services in the entire northwest which includes oregon and washington first and foremost i want to thank you for the opportunity to present here today um we have really been working on this grant for several years it's a significant step towards early notification and coordination with the military including the department of and really supports with providing transparency about where we operate and i think really opens the door to opportunities uh for future coordination and viability of our training as we all try to kind of co-exist in this environment where you know populations are increasing and renewable energy is growing with that um and with our critical um assets both air land and sea space in oregon this has really been a great opportunity in working with the the staff to move strides um on in regards to coordination and foster compatible land and see you so again thank you for the thanks kim i appreciate that appreciate the funding that dod provided for the so i wanted to mention two core member of the team is the oregon state institute for natural resources or inr for short they led the mapping tool development did a fantastic job on it i think as you'll see that'd be awesome you haul them over there all right excuse me this is chair grill someone needs to please put his or her phone on you harry can you please put your phone on i'm not using a phone so i'll continue um this slide just covers the goals for the eresa project overall of course kim talked a little bit about dod goals project goals included creating relevant educational tools for stakeholders and we're going to see of course the the big one the mapping tool here in a this shows you the major parts of the project and again i don't want to spend a lot of time going over these individually but there was a renewable energy market an industry assessment that was done very early on uh military needs and interest assessment we looked at opportunities and constraints and those first three were led by three different consulting firms that uh worked on the project the fourth one the sighting procedures review was something actually i led put together for the team and now we're into these very final phases the outreach and of course the launch of this mapping and reporting tool that we'll see today and the project is basically wrapping up at the end of this month one other thing i wanted to mention there is an arrested report that has been issued and you can find a draft of it on odo's website and i'll show you the website in a that's kind of a hub for the project and a good place to look if you're trying to find other information on the eresa project the draft of this report is is out there on the website so again the mapping and reporting tool was developed by it is housed on the oregon explorer which is for people in the in the planning and development business is i think pretty well known in oregon as a place to go it's a it's a good for data and data layers associated with planning the team the eresa team reviewed more than 600 data sets as part of the development of this tool and then inr conducted some significant user testing with more than 100 participants it was their largest ever engagement to test this before it was so the tool itself has three main pillars or parts there's an explore data function which is where we'll go in a little bit there's also a reporting function which is aimed more at if you're a renewable energy developer and you're looking for a site that you can use in order to to do that and then get a report on the characteristics of the site that you've you've mapped out and by the way when you do that that information is only available to you as the user it's not stored anywhere so um and that of course is a big concern for developers they they want to keep their information confidential for very understandable reasons until they're ready to to release it but um there's no risk of that happening through the use of the tool and then finally there's a learn section as well where you can find information citing procedures for example and other things that would be would be relevant the citing process okay so i'm going to go ahead and switch applications here so that we can do the okay so what i'm bringing up first is just the odo website and i wanted to point out that if you scroll down a little bit over here on the right you can see there's a link for the orisa and a lot of information here on the project then if we scroll down a little under key deliverables you see arrested mapping and reporting tool i have a quick question or really clarification sure make sure everybody's listening um you don't need any special software for this you know i mean this is an online mapping tool so you don't need gis software or anything you can access this just with a computer and access to the internet that is correct and i think the only um advice that they give is to use a modern browser so you know google chrome microsoft edge firefox are the three that they've or the inr people have tested and know work with this if you use something else you may run into an issue so thank you for pointing that out todd appreciate it okay so this is the screen we saw earlier i'm pick a different window here because i've got some things cued up that we will need for the demo so as you if you go into the explore section you will see something like this i'll zoom out a little because you're just starting out in here you're going to see map of oregon what you're seeing there right now those lines so there are of course different map layers that you can turn on and off in here and the one that we have turned on at the moment are transmission lines so you can immediately see that zoom back in a little bit the first thing i want to do um and i'm i'm there are different ways to approach this because different people can use this tool for different purposes like i say a developer might be you know prospecting for a site i'm approaching it from the standpoint how would somebody within our citing group use it how would they use it maybe if they were supporting fsec and of course it would be looking at one of the projects that comes to us so i have uploaded the site boundary for a new project that's in here and i can click that data layer on now and i just need to zoom in a little so that we can see it and this is the echo solar project and we can make this look darker or we you know change it change the transparency so that you can see the layers underneath so you might wonder well well how can you do that how difficult it is is that to do that so i'm going to upload a second project here just to show you that it's pretty simple so there's an upload feature i just clicked on and then it says choose files now these do have to be in a particular format people who are familiar with gis typically will know how to do this and i'm picking another project that has not officially come to council yet but uh maybe in the in the near future and this is the wagon trail project and i'm going to say upload and then it just asks me what i want to name that i think that name is fine and i say proceed it asks me if i want to customize anything and there it is so you can see this one fits really kind of like a jigsaw puzzle together with the echo project it's directly adjacent to it so now that we've done that let's um let's take a look at some things related to this and the first place i'm going to go is with the military layers since the military under this and we've talked about uh we should talk about the potential conflicts with with military uses i want to click on some of those layers so as i do that bear with me just a second because one of the things that i know is nearby is the boardman geographic area of so you can see up here at the top we get some overlap here with one of these layers i just clicked on so if you're using this you might want to know what is that exactly and hopefully you can can read that and maybe i need to make that a little bigger and it off the one i wanted there we go so up here when i click on that you can see it highlights that layer and it tells you that's the boardman geographic area of you know as we if we're looking at a project like this",

        "text": " and that those improvements only grow on themselves rather than spending money on something that doesn't have the insight that you know we're just putting something into something one year and then that isn't even where the emphasis of the venue is looking towards so that was money that wasn't well spent so having a really comprehensive understanding of the direction of the venue is really much of the day-to-day work is um and that is done from the office hours of paperwork emails and exchanges goes into every single event that happens at the venue and the coordination between the different um and efficient processes always trying to get those as smooth as possible a really exciting area of development is programming and this is where we have the ability to really impact our community directly and that's with what we offer at the venue itself and we want those engaging enriching experiences Community collaboration and of course the revenue and economic there are a lot of details I could go into every single aspect of this we could spend a really long time diving deep into What It Takes and what it would look like to manage a a venue and every venue really does it differently there's no one way to do it there are multiple options for managing performance venues gen generally they involve varying degrees of contracted services and providers in differing levels of City control but no matter what structure is chosen it's probably going to evolve over time and achieving success will absolutely recover require steady investment of resources in time it should also be expected that oversight and coordination of the venue will always be needed by the city it is an incredibly unique and beautiful venue because of its location right downtown in a beautiful Park and the reason it's so unique does mean that there's considerations that you're going to want to take into when you are getting customers to the venue and there's also the opportunity because the city is in a really unique position to provide experiences and offerings that reflect those desired goals that we can go back to as our guiding principles so we can make sure that whatever events are coming through the amphitheater we're setting everybody up for for Success ourselves our customers and also our in a larger sense so this is a very general overview but I really look forward to seeing this venue continue to be incredibly successful we had a great first year we had an amazing variety of different events and I know that this will continue to be a common Gathering space for our residents and visitors that we will bring in world-class artists and we'll get to be that platform for local talent and Community organizations and this beautiful new venue so that's it for the presentation are there any questions I can answer hi Kathleen thanks for the presentation uh oh I see Galen has a question um I'll let you go first daily oh sure thanks Kathleen that was really helpful and I appreciate the work you clearly put in to prepare for it um I have a couple questions they mostly have to do with the slide you provided with the revenue projections can you go to that slide yeah this one yeah so I'm um usually when we see something like this we see the revenue against expenses um because that's when you kind of would know where you're going to hit your um you know at least make your costs uh do you do you have that yet I I don't I think there's a lot of expenses that are um paired with the parks expenses such as like Turf maintenance and things like that so I think it's really hard to kind of separate those and especially when you get into um the day-to-day maintenance and things like that so I don't have those I'm not sure if um anybody within the city would be able to compile that information I think maybe Jennifer Keller was going to join us on this call and she might have a better idea of what that might look like is Jennifer on no I'm sorry okay I am sorry hi Chris um so we have uh in order to try to quantify what those expenses are since it was the first year let me introduce myself I'm sorry my name is Jennifer Keller I'm the parks operations and Recreation services manager um so in order to kind of quantify the first year and then moving forward since we weren't really um in a position to know going in what those expenses might look like what type of of response we would have for use in the amphitheater and the revenues we derived we actually established I actually established a separate project number to differentiate the new Amphitheater piece of Riverfront versus the other areas of Riverfront um before the amphitheater was built um that we provided maintenance in so we we do have uh it's limited obviously because there's not a lot of historical data yet because the amphitheater is relatively new but we do have some some data from the first year to be able to quantify that level of of expenses that were particularly dedicated to the new if that's helpful right so that would be good to see you know combined with the costs of your Staffing on this just to see what the trends would be because strangely on this scrap it looks like in year five you're going to have um 50 events but you were your Revenue line is still pretty low and usually for business models you want to see the revenue picking up because you have some some basic sunk costs and so the revenue should accelerate a little more than that so I'm I'm a little concerned that that that doesn't look like it's ever going to pencil out for you if you're feeling like 50 events a year is kind of the the maximum so what we can do if uh and provide it to Chris so that he can share it with with you folks is kind of pull that data that I was referencing from from what we start you know from what we have for this year as kind of a building point so at least you have that as a comparison we can kind of look at that comparison on the expenditure versus the revenue um again it's for a limited period of time but that may help us better um you know what that may look like in the future so if if that would be helpful I can we can put that together and give it to Chris and he can share that with you folks right and I I should have started by saying um I don't know Kathleen if they told you our initial concern was um your position was paid for out of out of taught funds and we wondered if if the the facility itself was ever going to be able to support it so it wouldn't be pulled out of top button so that's that's our our that was part of our discussion of it so if I can just you know interject really quickly so so we are cognizant of of that and um you know that's obviously not how typically the tot funds are utilized um to the extent they have been so just as an update you know we we are working with budget office and city managers office on um creating what Kathleen is in a limited duration uh position in making that a career position and the options that might be available to support the cost of that position um either in part or totality that would not be uh taught funds so so we're we're aware of that and we're actively working um a remedy to that great thanks so much for thanks for coming and thanks for filling Us in on that thank you all right next up was Ryan with your hand up go ahead Ryan thank you for the presentation so what processes are currently in place to solicit feedback from vendors and renters in regards to the event space um right now we just have open communication with them so we here uh from our customers when the venue is done or when the event is done there is a number of customers with the larger events that we usually have a post-event meeting with and that's where we discuss improvements or changes for their next year if it's an annual event okay and typically what are the issues that you know people tend to have the most that you're actively working on that's it so I would say one of the things that we run into uh is that permitting events and getting people into this space and making sure that they have all their permits filled out correctly that's a challenge for a lot of people they're not used to navigating I will weigh that against it's really it's a really handy and helpful tool to make sure that everybody is well planned before they book the amphitheater they have to go through the process of filling out the permit and making sure that they have all their vendors in place and that they know what their layout's going to be and that they know their their event plan really clearly before the event is actually booked at our venue but it's a challenge so we just have to work with them on that process to get through the permitting and get into like our payment system that sort of thing and so some of the process is difficult but otherwise people have really enjoyed the venue and really enjoyed using it it's been a it's been a great facility for a lot of the yeah so what you're saying is that people tend to not have a problem with the venue itself is more the logistics of renting getting the venue and getting all the stuff set up yeah yeah things that you know permitting things uh like our short-term concessionaire permit process is really involved for vendors who want to sell Goods that sort of thing so getting all of um the entities involved uh permitted so they can use the venue that can be a detailed process but it allows us to be really thorough and really well planned by the time they get there all right sounds good thanks awesome and I see some questions in the chat so I'll keep going with the those who had their hands raising and I'll get the chat questions here so Scott you're up next uh thanks uh Felipe um I'm just wondering how many of those 30 events were paid versus yeah I think we if off the top of my mind I think we only had um three events where fees were waived last year okay there was only a really short period of time where we were doing that before Council went back and um no longer waved me so there was only a handful of them last year and so of the 27 that generated Revenue do you have a ballpark of what that was I can I don't do a thousand dollars an event is it two thousand dollars an um so if they rented the entire facility it's going to be about 2500 I would say a good number of them it was hourly rentals okay so those hourly rentals is only going to be about five hundred dollars",

Selena yeah morning thank you Ben good morning everybody uh those of you not familiar with me my name is Alan Zena I'm the assistant director for planning Innovation the and planning Innovation is the uh division that's heading up this uh work on the the Oregon State energy strategy and we've got a great team with us uh working on this so rest assured you got your a team working on this uh with our um with our Consultants from kernen West and SEI not that se uh and uh Edith bear is our is our project manager so um next slide please for those of you that uh many of you of course familiar with oo so those of you that aren't this is uh our mission statement and what we do um you can go back and read that but uh it is about the clean energy transition and protecting the environment and shaping shaping all of that and so uh what we're trying to do uh here is live up to that mission statement so today I'm really excited about this because we're kicking off the the uh the working groups of which you guys are all members um and many of you know that HB 3630 directed Odo to uh do this state energy strategy and in addition the energy strategy will help inform uh the second part of our uh climate pollution reduction Grant the comprehensive climate action part of it we have a lot to live up to since we just you may have heard that we have got the uh uh just received $197 million from US EPA uh for the priority climate action plan to do a whole bunch of climate actions so we've got a lot to live up to we're in the first phase of developing this strategy and that phase is focusing on the modeling and the work groups play an essential role in all of that um we've been meeting with our sister agencies and data holders to help shape the the inputs into the modeling but now uh we're turning to you to help us shape and inform the modeling inputs and all the questions that we need to answer so I know we're asking a lot of you uh but we've uh we we we very much appreciate your time your expertise and your dedication to this over the next couple of months um in this first meeting we will present to you the modeling approach uh Jeremy from uh evolved is going to go over that along with uh eileene from seti and uh it's the foundation of the work that we're doing it is not the the complete set of work that we're doing uh it does not give us an answer it gives us information from that we will develop the the the state energy strategy so um during this meeting and following each of the breakout meetings we'll have the opportunity to ask questions and contribute your thoughts uh we realize this is we're been doing this in a short time frame so uh uh for this reason we have set up an online portal for written comments and we encourage you to share your written comments to us uh so we don't miss any of your great ideas um for those of you in the public who are joining today welcome thank you for showing up bright and early in the morning you're also invited to submit comments on our comment portal uh and you have that link in a bit in our presentation so we're looking forward to working with you all uh and learning what you have to say sharing your perspectives and uh helping us get our energy strategy in place so thank you for showing up and and now I'd like to hand it back over to Ben Duncan to help facilitate great thanks Alan uh appreciate the the opening and some some initial grounding which will really be a theme of of today so I'm gonna I'm going to do a little bit of housekeeping uh we have a lot of folks in the room um and so everyone who's participating other than folks you might see on the screen or or the project team here um is participating as attendees and that means that you're not going to be able to actively engage in the discussion unless you're promoted as a panelist and and I'll talk a little bit about how to do that and so I'm going to walk through the agenda in a minute but our time together is really built to onboard all of you in this working uh in these working groups to the project um and so you're going to hear some presentations um that will be followed by some space for question and answer um at that time um as you see on the slide you can use the raise hand button um at the bottom of your screen where it says raise hand that function or if you are on the phone you can press star nine and that will raise your hand and get you in the queue so at that time when you raise your hand we'll call on you we'll promote you and you will be able to um speak and be heard um and responded to in in the main session I'll just note that with with this number of folks we may not be able to get to all the questions that that come up today but we're going to provide some other avenues um at the end of our our conversation today both for asking additional questions of the project team and getting response or submitting public comment um so the chat function is available um you can be uh use the chat function for technical requests uh we have uh some project support folks that if you're having any problems kind of accessing features or or tracking the conversation just let us know um you can also use the question or use the chat function as questions come up for you throughout the presentations and and we'll do our best to answer answer uh as much as we can today I'll just note when using chat I'm going to ask you all just to to be mindful of not using chat for what I call virtual side conversations um it can both be distracting and and uh really not helpful for our conversation but rather to ask questions um and then just finally we do have members both of working groups and some members of the public so just note that your chat um will ultimately go to everyone um so we can go to next slide so as I said as we move through our time together you're going to have two substantive uh presentations one kind of an overview and onboarding to the Oregon energy strategy and then another presentation on the strategy modeling so we're going to ask that folks hold their questions and we won't be calling on folks until both of those presentations are done but we have built in about 30 minutes for working group Q&amp;A for conversation and discussion so um and then we'll we'll land with with some uh next steps hopefully you all seeing your journey as it moves forward um will provide an opportunity again around how you can also get questions answered reach the project team and submit public comment um going forward so with that I'm going to uh pass it to oh actually no I'm G to pass it back to myself for working group agreements sorry so as we're um we can go to the next slide thanks Gil um so as we spend our time together and as as you all leave um from this uh kickoff meeting and go into your working group spaces we're going to offer the following both as best practices um but also as as an Ask um because these spaces are are really meant to provide U and result in productive constructive conversations and discussions and we know that you know the deliberate attempt to get folks with varied perspective from different interests um around topic areas that are critical and important to the the work that we're all doing together um that it's you're not always going to agree and and and importantly you know where you get to consensus where you find agreement is really powerful but also being able to disagree and deliberate um with intention is also incredibly valuable and informative for Odo as it um does its work and and for CTI so these agreements we offer in the spirit of productive constructive conversations so one is is to listen carefully right to really seek out and try to understand why someone might be bringing a perspective what is their um their interest what's their expertise what's their experience that lends itself so really listening to understand to try to learn from each other as you do this work together and to do so in a way that is respectful um that is candid and honest and open um but But ultimately leading towards constructive and and progress right we're we're we're trying to move together to advance this work in ways that uh will meet the the the most needs across across our state we ask that you have an open mind right again that you all may not agree you may be coming from different perspectives but that um you're open to other ideas you're not coming in so grounded in what you think um that you're not willing to listen and learn and hear other perspectives that you are Cur ious and ask questions and you clarify and you try to understand the why with with again deep curiosity um that you're open transparent inclusive accountable that you respect differ opinions a lot of this is building off its of each other um but powerfully right seeking to resolve those differences in these spaces is going to be one of the the could be one of the most important aspects of the work that you do finding common ground uh will be incredibly as difficult as that may be um in certain situations and then just recognize that you know we all uh come into these spaces with different levels of experience uh we have different personalities and just really being cognizant of how much space you're you're you're taking up so it's kind of the Step Up step back uh model if you're you know the first person to raise your hand every time we ask maybe you you take a moment take a breath create some space for others and if you're one of those folks that sits back and processes and takes more time you know push yourself out of that uh not into the anxiety Zone but into the growth Zone and really allow others um to contribute and encourage yourself to contribute so that's an ask you know as you all go into your spaces together uh these are these are the best practices to try to ensure that you know the conversations that you have the deliberations that you will um undertake will will will be productive and and be meaningful um for the work going forward so Edith now I'm gonna pass to you thanks Ben and thanks for for kind of set setting that ground workk I think that's those are really important points and and I",

        "text": " SUP sign outside, puppies for sale. There's no mention of noise, lighting, odor, anything listed in the code violation. Question, what do you know about odors with kettles that could improve the situation. That could be a recommendation. If the board made a recommendation, we actually discuss that on site. They are in the process of basically improving, enhancing their facility. And there was a nice, very, very nice facility. It probably the most elaborate facility that I've personally witnessed in Marion county. And they actually poured concrete areas for their runs. They have a drainage system that is built into it, which is a containment system. It has its own septic system, so it doesn't go into the surface water, actually gets put into a septic system, but basically it has channels down the middle of the runs and they're sloped in. It makes cleaning easier, more expeditious, and would be easy to add to the facility. We actually had that conversation on site. And how do you feel about installing them? If it's part of our recommendation, absolutely. The only thing we were waiting on was an approval of the kennel. We didn't want to spend it if it wasn't approved. But if it is, it'll certainly be the next step. Anyone else have any questions? Bring it back to this board. Any discussion? I would entertain a motion. I'm torn on this one because we've had plenty of other kennels, but when you pull up the plat map, it. It's a pretty populated area to bring in the. I mean, look, there it is right there. Five years, though. No, please. This is what you don't want to do at the county commissioners meeting, I assure you. Let me ask you, I can understand how do you deal with this urine smell? I mean, this goes into the ground. That is one of the things that we can put in the motion as a recommendation. We don't know what they have. The condition that there needs to be an enhancement. They'll need to install a separate septic facility, which is how this other system was designed. Outside the cages is. Yes. Basically, Mister Bonner, the way it works is you're going to have a central building, and then you'll have extensions of those kennels that go to the exterior. So technically the animal is still in a kennel, but it's on the outside of the building. They're not in the runs yet. So the systems that I'm describing is, it's basically concrete as it is there now, but it has a drainage system that's built into it. And those drains run to a septic system. So it collects the urine, it collects the wash when they're cleaning the stalls. That doesn't just go into surface water, it goes into the septic collection system. And if you make a motion, if you want, if you wanted to make a motion, you can include that in. My biggest thing is just the bark in, because the rest of it they can handle. And Mister chairman, it was just indicated to me by Jody Kirkman that the utilities department do not have our excuse. Utilities department, I'm sorry, septic systems don't have a treatment system within them. It would be at the request of the utilities department for an advanced nitrate reduction system to be utilized at this location as well. So that would be something that we would need to add into their conditions. If you go to doing something like that. Hand system, enhanced system today, still, I'm not mistaken. Ten or $15,000, right? Ten or twelve, I believe. Yes, sir. I mean, that's a lot bigger expense than 3500 up and down. That they would be in favor of that, though. That they would be in agreement of that, I should say. Is that correct'an? Enhanced system? Yes, sir. That certainly would take care of this medal. Yes. Or Miss Pisher, I know that even though it'ownone agricultural, but the land use is low, low a one is still compatible with low residential. It's not ideal. It's not a one like you see, 90% of the rest of the county is, but a one is compatible with the low res. And if they weren't operating, if they just had regular dogs there on a one, you wouldn't be able to do anything about the barking whatsoever. If they had 40 of their own personal dogs on the property. Right, I got that. But now it's going toa be a business. It's been still. I mean, if they got turned down, they could just quit selling them and have 40 dogs there and leave them outside all the time to bark all the time, you know, is I catch 22. I can't make a motion, but can say that if I could, I would be in favor with the enhanced septic system. Are you trying to push ye? I'm just saying the way I feel, they've been operating for five years. And I think that with all the conditions that are in here and the additional, they know that it's a special use permit, so they violate it. If the Balkans's becoming a problem, they know that they' in trouble with this special use permit. You know, the one thing I would like to say to the neighbors is the barking is just something that if they were turned down to quit breeding those dogs and turn them all out 24 hours a day and let them bark. You know, unfortunately, one of the things we battle, and it's hard to say, we've had kennels come through here over the years and they're all a struggle because they've got a neighbor somewhere. And I mean, these folks do seem like they've been willing to spend more money than the majority of those that we've seen in the past to try to make their candle the right way. So I am looking for a motion. All right, I'll take it. I, Greg Lord, agree with staff's findings and recommendations and hereby recommend approval of special use permit based on the following findings of fact. It is consistent with the LDC section 282 D and is consistent with the Marione county comprehensive land plan. With the conditions that have been recommended by staff. And adding a condition to put an enhanced septic system that. Solely for the use of the kennels. Solely for the use of those kennels. With the amendment to the 35 and amend number six to 35 dogs instead of the 30 current 30. I have a motion. Do I have a second? Well, then one of the two that are in opposition of this motion needs to make a motion in reverse. And there's four of us here. I'll second it for discussion. And are you. Is the building department orver? They're going to verify that all this is. All this is taken care of before they give them this special Mister pisher. Item number eleven. As written by staff, the applicants shall maintain up to dateop. Pardon me, an appropriate major minor site plan shall be submitted within 180 days of approval of the SUP. That full illustrates all development on the property to dates. So. Yes, sir. In short, that condition is already included. That is what we will be recommending to the board of county commissioners is 180 days. They have to be fully documented on the site plan and the permitting process will have begun in earnest in order to satisfy that condition. So I would not put a hard date on that right now just because of the magnitude of the number of permits that are actually coming through. I wouldnt want the them to get caught up based on us, but they have to show good faith in having make sure that they havegun the process. The site plan, they need to be get on that immediately in order to get that one moving. Once the site plan has started moving forward, then the permitting can beginning in earnest after reviews have gone on by the departments within Marion county. So it's going to be in their best interest to get this started as quickly as possible. And if we're still in discussion, if I may or may put the cart before the horse, but is there an ordinance for excessive dog barking after a certain hour at night or is it. It's subject to the standard noise ordinance. 60 decibels, 55 decibels for residential areas before 07:00 a.m. after 10:00 p.m. up until that point, if there are certain decimel levels that if exceeds 65 decibels typically within those areas in a residential area, then if it's continuous, someone can be cited. As far as all of the details are concerned, we probably need code to really kind of back me up, but usually the louder level of decibels is reserved for commercial and industrial areas. So you have a lower threshold in the residential areas, but these are a one as well. So you do have farm equipment that operates on a one as well. I know this is primarily residential, but most a one is primarily residential as well. Seven and 10:00 is basically what you need to look at because that's county wide, pretty much. It needs to be quiet before 07:00 a.m. and after 10:00 p.m. and I brought that up basically for y'all so that, you know, 11:00 you happen to say, hey, let's let them dogs out. They haven't been out all day. You violate any of these conditions, you guys lose your license and you really spend a lot of money and you're in trouble, which is what allows the neighbors some comfort to know if you're not adhering to the conditions, then, you know, you possibly could. So to make sure that. Yes, ma'am. Mister Lord, if I may, there doesn't appear to be a condition regarding barking",

        "text": " already working at capacity were unable able to add unscheduled additional deliveries to their already packed schedules and so we found ourselves having some probable so what we had to do is work with all of our um regions in the west which is where the uh petroleum collaborative comes in but we were able to get on a call and work with some of our neighboring states for example Washington state provided us who weren't they weren't addressing Wildfire issues but they provided us a list of fuel distributors from their state that was able to help us uh support some of the fuel deliveries to the Medford Airport in southern Oregon so that was very helpful so that event just shows us that we don't need a catastrophic event to experience fuel issues in Oregon and so um we have worked with the Department of Forestry the department of Aviation since the 2021 wildfires we now have a fuel coordination group where every Wildfire season we stand up and we just monitor the situation and we facilitate um fuel requests and fuel deliveries to make sure that Wildfire response goes on time in you know without delays to keep oregonians safe so we even worked with a private fuel vendor that's now dedicating a truck and Driver every season when we need that support so thank you Max okay thank you very much uh I have the last energy security and insecurity story here to talk about uh unfortunately becoming more common scenario the public safety power shut off um across our state while this example is from September of 2022 uh PSPs is as they have become known uh are used seemingly on a regular basis um uh I'll say regular they used seemingly in summertime um across our state and perhaps across the West on a perhaps more frequent basis than previously known uh Gusty winds extreme fire conditions um often can lead to fire risk that is uh uh quite elevated particularly in forested areas and as a last resort um when when necessary utility companies can and have shut off the power to to a a region in order to reduce Wildfire risk um either that power lines could start a fire or that they could worsen a fire that is already existing power shut offs affect thousands of oregonians uh in our and people across the western region and communities all across our state turning off power causes challenges and hardships for communities and for individuals power shut offs can uh as an example um Power shut off in Lane County as our colleagues from Oregon Public Utility Commission know quite well uh can affect evacuation orders can evacuate can affect communication issues uh when power is not available um and can affect coordinating traffic or distribution of vital resources can affect water for fire suppression a whole host of things so it's not done um without consideration of what the trade-off would be but a PSPs is done um this is perhaps one of the more high-profile examples of energy insecurity or energy security that we will talk about or that does affect um our state uh and fortunately that there is there are plans in place to help uh mitigate the impact of PSPs when done Oregon Public Utility Commission as well as organ Department of energy um work to coordinate resources and coordinate communication um with utilities and local governments and state agencies to help reduce that impact um but it is an example of energy security energy insecurity um as we that we face in our state and finally uh just on a on a personal note since we have a little extra time here um I'll I'll have a just example for my own my own house like many people in Western Oregon I live in a forested hilly area with above ground power lines and in winter storms whether it's snow ice or high wind tree branches fall onto the power lines and uh uh almost reliably my house will and my neighborhood will lose electricity um I have a backup generator uh and if uh I keep it stocked with gasoline but that's a risk that I don't have the ability to get that fuel needed for um for my generator uh and folks who may rely upon uh electricity for medical issues or for just Basics um for health and safety are at risk um perhaps some of us myself I have the resources when rows are clear I've taken my family to a hotel to stay during the situations when it extends for more than a few days which sometimes it does not everybody has that luxury so just one more example of energy security energ insecurity uh to to point out here and as noted throughout this presentation we would love to hear more stories more examples of these types of scenarios that affect everybody across our state with that I'm going to pass it back over to Dr Casey stemman to finish up our presentation thank you much thanks Max so now returning to this survey that I keep promising you guys so on the screen you can see a QR code this will take you directly to the survey so prev viously the QR code took you to the comment portal but this one is a different one so please do go to this survey we're also going to post the link to the survey in the chat um so that you guys can click on it if you if you don't have quick access to use the QR code and so this survey is going to ask you guys to provide information about yourself your profile information such as your interests um which region you're associated with name title that sort of thing and again we have the email address and the comment portal web link at the bottom of this screen um so that at any time during the life of this project if there's anything that you think may be of interest to us you have the opportunity to share it to us if you if you question if it will be interesting please go ahead and share it we will probably value it very much um the map on the screen right now highlights to different regions so in the survey you will identify which region you want to be invited to so take a look at which county you're in and identify your region and we'll leave this up for reference for you while you're filling out that survey so we're going to give you a minute to complete the survey um and then we'll I'll have Odo come up to to say the final goodbyes and thank okay again this is Max woods from the Oregon Department of energy and we thank you this is the end of our presentation we are going to give you back 25 minutes out of the day um the presentation we recorded here today will as soon as we can be posted to our website uh so that if you didn't quite get the QR codes or the link to the um to the survey uh you can find it when posted to um the website the survey will be open until December yep we'll make it open till mid December if we can get information by then that would be great uh of course you can always call us or email us our contact information at the AO staff is right here uh we have a special email and website uh email inbox dedicated just to this project shown there on the bottom of the slide and the comment portal link is also at the bottom of this slide as well again want to thank you all for joining us anybody who's watching this recording as well uh the comment period and the survey uh will be open until mid December you can complete it and of course you can always call or email us directly thank you again for your time and we look forward to working",

        "text": " have consulted all of the standard required databases consulted with the appropriate reviewing agency in this case it's odsw make sure that they have updated literature searches habitat data a lot of this is all on computer now so they go in and they look at gis layers they look at all of these different repositories of the information and then use that as the basis of that desktop analysis so basically it's everything but the field like you've done your updated review they know that they have pre-construction survey requirements on the site certificate already to true this all up so that will occur in all of the conditions that come out of these are based upon that final true up survey based of actual habitat okay thank you so much there's not one sort of addition to page response is you know because we consult wfw if for whatever reason they would have said there's something that they're aware of now that's different than before that an on-site you know you know survey they would have told us that and then we this is the more typical situation where you know there are you know the time frames are you know relatively short enough where there's probably not new to justify that and so you know we don't require it just because we would require it it would be if w had some justification for it so i just want to make sure that you work with the impression that this is the only way to do it it's based on consultation with odfw and they determine what's needed at this point in time based on as as kate said or reliance upon the information that's available to them you know digitally or in writing but it certainly could result in an on-site survey if they had determined that was thank you and then just as one final note um the certificate holder has already identified an hma of approximately 78 acres and at the last calculation the estimated hma is about 73 acres so it's still adequate but that was part of why condition 5.5 makes them make sure that they have an adequate impact area our hma area for the actual final total impact areas so if there was any change that could be adjusted for so on to threatening endangered species there's two species of concern that odfw has identified as being within the potential potentially within the cardi solar corner area as in um it's suitable habitat and that's for lawrence milkvetch and washington brown squirrel so this is a good example kind of to follow up the the information that was submitted for rfa1 that included the initial survey and the consultation with odfw identified the potential for these species to exist within the cardi solar farm area um surveys that were conducted for rfa1 did not identify these within the cardi solar farm area and we did not identify any new species of concern to add to that list as a result of updated desktop review literature search and odfw that was conducted for rfa-3 but it is important to note that there are existing pre-construction survey requirements for party solar farm area to make sure that those species are surveyed for any other thing you know so there's this final survey that needs to be completed in order for them to ensure that they have avoided any tne species it's got potential there was no specific species identified within the previous survey but because of that high potential and odfw comments it's going to remain so for scenic resources and basically identified that there were the blue mountain scenic byway and a portion of the boardman segments and the wellspring segment of the oregon national historic trail are important scenic resources they're within the analysis area and the closest one is two miles from the cargo solar because of the nature of the cardi solar farm itself the facilities are not going to be over 11 feet tall for the solar component the existing transmission lines are only 70 feet tall there's no new transmission line being proposed with that there really would not be visible from that two-mile distance and that has been um council's previous mining for rfa-1 when they reviewed the party solar farm and we evaluated the updated information we found no new or existing scenic resources closer than two miles and we also feel that um you know the previous findings of council still hold and then just to know even though it is not necessarily required by odeq because of the potential of temporary construction noise on the onht the oregon national historic trail segments council did previously impose condition 13.1 and that is basically to help minimize that any potential construction noise to less than significance okay so for historic cultural and archaeological resources um i will note that the area has been extensively and pge has worked with shippo to get prior concurrence for previously identified sites archaeological sites 2017 and 2018 and in rfa one and again reaffirmed for rfa too simple has found that there are there are no significant impacts to any eligible resources as a result of party solar farm there were sites that were identified in rfa-1 they went through extensive evaluation determined that they were either outside of the boundary for cardi solo farm or they were not eligible um so we're not planning on having any uh new findings coming out of that like i said area has been extensively surveyed shovel tested and and gone through multiple shipping um inadvertent discovery plan is already a requirement under condition 11.6 and the certificate holder did update that idp and it is part of the attachments in the proposed order and really the only update was just to make sure that the contacts were current with lcis and just as a note the confederated tribes of the umatilla indian reservation or ctuir have been included in both the monitoring and survey protocols for the existing site certificate so and and they are also will be contacted under any inverted discovery plan and they have not submitted any comments on any of the preliminary the draft proposed order or the the proposed order and they have been coordinated with so under recreation um again we had mentioned the oregon national historic trail and within that five mile analysis area the porchman of the onht is presence again it's about two miles away from the actual solar farm site in previous analysis conducted for rfa-1 council found that the construction and operation of the solar car would not a significant direct or indirect noise visual or traffic impacts on the use of the onht primarily because it is so far away two miles the access would not impact the traffic to access the oht sites just the the height and structure of the facility would not have a visual so as part of rfa-3 again the certificate holder conducted an updated literature review to make sure that there were no new recreational resources we evaluated the information that they provided us and agreed that there were no new recreational resources identified that would be subject to rfa free and we have a previously imposed of 13.1 again to kind of reduce the impacts of noise construction just for any potential voice impacts for use or something okay so public services um just to start um in general public services are the big is a big topic we cover a lot of different areas but the certificate holder did engage in updated coordination with fire protection and police services in 2022 to demonstrate that they have that continued ability the providers to respond and meet any demands or level of service that the certificate holder might need for card and solar farm we found no changes in the service level or demand for public services as a result of party solar farm um construction or operation and we also um did not find that there would be any significant impacts as a result of sewer treatment or storm water dairies or service levels because all of that is actually planned to be provided on site once the facility is constructed so i wanted to jump into the the comment received on on the 12th which was the david comments close um from the oregon department of aviation how we incorporated it into the proposed order and the site certificate that went out on friday last week our ongoing consultation with oregon department i'm going to call them oda but organic department of aviation on on both their comments the intent of their comments and um how whether or not this proposed recommended amendment to condition 5.6 um which was specific to the aviation comments at this juncture so i don't want to get too confusing we understood their comments at the time we issued the proposed order and wrote the recommended language somewhat differently than we understand today as a result of clarifying with them what it was that they were recommending so i'm going to jump to the next slide i do we have an existing site certificate the existing operational piece recommended that that condition 5.6 be amended to add the cardi solar farm based upon that initial feedback we got department of aviation coordination with them it is clear to us that at this point the basis of oregon department of aviation wanting was based on kind of a misinterpretation of what the extent of rfa 3 was in regards to transmission line the transmission line oregon department of aviation was responding to is not part of and it was basically kind of a misinterpretation of the map where we would have recommended this language i think what we're going to do now and sarah you can jump in and help me clarify if i need to but um is that we're going to actually recommend that we reject this proposed recommended language because we do not at this point feel it is applicable because again the facilities are not the height requirements or distance requirements that would have triggered all of this and it would have been triggered if those external transmission lines were part of rfa 3 but they're not that is my best assessment of what that is um so for that reason even though we put it in the proposed order and we put it in this amended site certificate we're actually going to recommend that we strike that and just keep condition 5.6 as it is in the existing sex certificate with no change kate have you this is marcy for the record have you communicated that to thanks uh yes we have and we've also um updated that with the certificate holder as well just to let them know in advance of this presentation what how we were going to address this and they had no comments thank you so we're keeping anything in red is basically going to go and we're going to keep the actual of the existing condition which is what's in black the before beginning of destruction of unit ",

        "text": " before we wrap up it too is local local reliability and local resilience so people can learn a lot if they're interested on these energy topics at the april meeting so just doing a plug for that and i guess my short answer is um we just don't really know we just know that we need a lot of clean energy and california is doing some work on this and and oregon is following close with our utilities they're eager to do some modeling on this as well so we'll get a better picture kind of as time moves forward and then a timeline plug might be good too just for offshore windows it will take a long time for this to come so i wouldn't expect anything too soon which is why we need to talk about it one other area of context that jason covered in the kickoff meeting which had sort of big picture energy context that may be helpful that there's a lot of technical analysis that's been done to understand what the pathways might be to meet the various clean energy and climate change targets in oregon and across the west those targets um kind of go to 2040 and um so putting like the three gigawatts in context um to the efforts policymakers have made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change in some analyses it calls for about 80 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2050 in the pacific northwest just to give you some context to what three gigawatts might mean compared to the transition that um some of the technical analysis is suggesting may be needed um i saw that shannon had her hand up but then lowered it but has a great comment in the chat so let me just go through the chat here and check to see um renfies has a comment about echoing some past statements setting apprenticeship goals allows for opportunities for oregonians to be trained and work on these projects setting goals for women black indigenous and people of color and coastal communities ensures further localization of economic benefits shannon has a comment about investments from industry resulting in direct benefits to fishing communities the pacific fishery management council's climate and communities core team issued the 2040 scenarios for west coast fisheries and she's added a link to a pdf in the chat climate change and globalization of the market aging infrastructure fleets and workforce instability are all factors threatening our pacific coast fishing communities i'm just wondering if there might be a holistic approach to our port facilities that might include not only direct infrastructure investments for the support of floating offshore wind but also strategic investments to ports like port orford designed to strengthen our sustainable fishing communities and families it's actually reminding me of a comment um ron piece made earlier about thinking about what other sort of port investments might be helpful to the ron piece also added the utilization of community benefit agreements could create harmony with multiple key communities and further ensure local benefits thanks for that comment i'm just keeping an eye on the time here we have two more topics to cover and so i'm going to um just check to see if there's any last hands or comments then i might move us ahead to the next just going to take a quick pause you're not seeing any hands we'll really appreciate the discussion on this topic and look forward to any additional feedback through the written process by march 25th um go ahead to the next topic jason thank you okay as i mentioned um kind of keeping it local to some extent here with the topics today local reliability and resilience this um you know it is an energy topic um but kind of a local energy topic and so a refresher on the questions we were interested in is um transmission power supply reliability i think i have a picture in the next slide that can help explain what what we're thinking with that but that would be like the local reliability and then power system resilience and resilience and reliability are a little different concepts resilience is more for like extreme events that are completely out of like the maybe forecasted expectations local reliability are still kind of brown out or outage events or power quality issues but are more more common to some extent um and so the map you know it's probably bigger for for some folks it looks a little small for me but the main takeaway here um is just to kind of put up a picture of of how the coast kind of currently gets um really the lions share almost all their electricity is supplied to them via these transmission lines that cross not only the coast range but then a lot of the bigger generating projects um are even further east of the cascade range so you're kind of going over really long stretches of transmission lines um i'm not sure what the best analogy is off top my head but at the end of the line you're getting a weaker weaker you know there's a lot of uh power engineering that helps boost that and ensure um you know power supply is as best as it can be um but there is some some thinking and some feedback and some studies that have looked at this at a high level that suggests um offshore wind you know coming in interconnecting to the coastal grid would supply you know some pretty power and it would be coming you know via a shorter transmission pathway and so that could help kind of increase the power quality up and down the coast to some extent um so that's kind of the feedback we got related to that it would it could help reduce um reliance on those transmission it could help um avoid inland transmission constraints let's see what's the last year yeah and all these uh all these benefits could be kind of um of increasing importance and heightened so to speak if the loads on the coast increase like projections are forecasted across other parts of the state with electrification of buildings um everybody's pricing a lot of commercials more recently for the electric vehicles that are getting getting made by our auto manufacturers so as those get get bought and as more people drive those and more charging infrastructure gets put in loads could increase and so anything to kind of help bolster supplies and power quality what could be beneficial for that the other common themes were related to this resilience that i tried to give a really high level definition of so wildfires would be a great example of something to think about when it comes to resilience like um i'm not sure if there were any outages that affected the coast in 2020 but this was a snapshot from back when we had those labor day fires that were pretty bad it looks like there were some smaller fires that did impact the coast and i guess the takeaway is um there's lines that get de-energized when these wildfires happen and then that that can just kind of limit the amount of power that gets transferred to the power grid and across the power grid and so the coast is kind of um vulnerable with this so a lot of the feedback we had was related to um you know kind of bolstering resilience for the coast with offshore wind giving it um access to a new resource from the west which you know currently is just a wide open ocean um with no power and then i think we'll talk about next next month in april about how this could also even spread some benefits beyond just the coast and help help the power grid as a whole so also some references to storage um you know the more the more storage you the more resilience you're gonna have um the time scales you know are different um but it could really be good for um shorter term events micro grids at home storage community center storage and that can also help integrate offshore wind and kind of help maybe balance a little bit of the need for transmission so that was kind of the feedback we had um and we're doing pretty good on time we did carve out some q a time at the end it sounds like we've kind of been front loading a lot of questions which is great um and then i'll wrap up a little bit with next steps so let's spend a few times hearing about reliability and resilience great thanks jason so this is that time to just think about the um themes that jason synthesized from the comments we've heard so far on this topic if you have information or perspectives that might differ from those themes want to elaborate or emphasize something if you have thoughts on topics for more study or engagement or just some brand new thoughts this is the time to do that um next slide please and then here's sort of a summary page of what jason talked about and in the chat i've put the same questions i read out loud pause to see if there's any hands raised while i look at the chat um i see a comment from mark freeman big difference between power quality and power capacity and resiliency no issues with power quality on the thanks for that comment mark i'm curious if the power quality issues comment there is something that's based on your uh your experience or if you if you might have some data or studies to share on that if so we could include that in our report if there are some studies to reference we see a hand up as well um from harvey so harvey we're going to call on you next um uh i are you i i just i just retired from bottle of power administration uh i'm a mechanical uh years ago back in the 80s bonneville had an experimental uh superconducting magnetic energy storage study and that that device is you got a cooled about nine degrees cabin and they used that to store electricity and also it also was a good way of cleaning the the power uh the experiment was ex it was it was dismantled but i think the technology has improved over the years because of this wind energy you know that one of the problems is there's a peak demand and those low demand this might be one way of providing storage electricity while there's a low demand the electricity be uh pumped into the not pumped but uh stored in this uh door or there's a there's coil super gutting conducting and then when you need the power you just tap it and then yeah you can put through a inverter to convert it to ac i'll just say maybe uh the other way is large storage batteries of lithium batteries i'm just suggesting maybe you ought to do a study on that see what the benefits there's also hydrogen uh converting the electricity to hydrogen then converting back to electricity through a fuel cell i'm suggesting maybe you ought to do a study on maybe on storage methods for electricity and see what is most uh economical or what uh you know they've got to look at maintenance uh a reliability and",

        "text": " characteristics of those assets the flow of the commodity Etc and through this analysis we could then reach a conclusion regarding the vulnerability of each region this technical analysis is very data intense and for the liquid fuel sub sector we were able to secure the data in order to perform the technical analysis however given the time constraints of this project we were not able to secure the data for the electric or natural gas sub sectors so what we decided to do was pivot and we created what we're calling a hybrid survey which gave each of the utilities an opportunity to do a self assessment and was structured around our technical analysis so the information that they gave us we could streamline it and ultimately come up with the same output that we got for our technical analysis so for liquid fuels natural hazards we did technical analysis forri natural gas we used the hybrid survey for the natural hazards can you explain the difference I mean what what is the difference in the quality of the information yeah I'm okay good so for human C threats we obviously can't create a hazard Zone as we can for natural hazards just to the nature of these threats and so for consisten we we decided to adopt the hybrid survey across all three of the sub sectors for the cyber attacks and physical attacks so this is how we structured the analysis first we divide it into four categories we're looking at exposure and so this is primarily focused on the assets that are exposed and how frequently they're exposed then we have sensitivity so this is considering the inherent qualities of the different assets and how that informs um how a different asset would be affected by the branch threats and we're looking at just how many of the system elements are sensitive potential impact is looking at the customers that are impa and the time it takes to restore service after disruption and then adaptive capacity is looking at a collection of different measures that can be physical or operational and we're using operational in a very broad sentence here and we're also looking at the maturity of the implementation of those measures and we simplify all of this down to a simple rating system so each of these four categories would ultimately have a rating falling somewhere between zero and three and we simply add those together for the final overall vulnerability ranking so in a scenario such as this one we have a high level of exposure so we have a score of three high level of sensitivity with a score of one high potential impact with a score of three and then very high adaptive capacity meaning that in this region for this system they've got a great length to adopt measures to adapt to that threat and the score in here is inverse so they would get a score of zero so we add those value together and the final score is seven which would be considered a moderate level of vulnerability is are there any followup questions on this structure before the bond the approach is it based on the sector the utility and when you say evaluated by utility by utility or or the Electric System the natural gas so we repeat this series of steps for each of the sub sectors so electricity natural gas and liquid fuels for electricity and natural gas it was literally a survey so we designed a survey that collected robust information gave it to each of the utility companies and then they would answer the questions and we would put them into a raing system that would ultimately give us these scores and then for the technical analysis we go through and do geospatial analysis of each of these steps based on the robot data that we collected that far so we need to know like how many participated and that'll be in the preliminary results I'll walk you through that as well is is this um utility type per region is that how that categorically it's looked at so let me yeah I'll get into how the utilities break down in the preliminary results but ultimately what we did is we started which region if each utility serves and then that would be counted as what what we would call our potential sample size so the potential number of utilities that could represent that region and then we offer the survey to to all the utilities across the state and then can see which regions each of the utilities serve and then we also considered which regions a utility might have assets in even though they don't serve it and then their responses would be um applied to each of the regions that we know they are associated with whether it's through serving those customers or having Assets in that region does that clarify sure I'll stand by okay yes um regarding the earthquake risk and I think this is an exposure thing that cascad is production zone is clearly the pooser child fig perhaps most likely but are you thinking about the local earthquake to like smaller non Regional Falls we're not we're looking at the the big one as it's often recurred so we're looking specifically at the N the 9.0 might a analysis yeah the example Port Hills and it has smaller earthquakes less frequent but maybe more devastating right there at that spot P yeah and I will say there were there were a number of threats that were considered in the beginning we were narrowed down to this one and obviously we had to cedit off at a certain point for this first project okay so you guys now have the the big overview of how things are structured and oriented with the project what we're doing why we're doing it how we're doing it the next portion of our time together is really going to be sent getting um feedback from you guys and so I'm going to present preliminary results which will include the um who was participating in giving us his feedback um and we're going to take a lot of time to ask questions of you guys to see what's resonating with you anything you disagree with and then also prioritizing our risk mitigation measures that we put in forth and so if you have not yet connected to slido please do take a minute to do so if you have a laptop that's the preferred device because it can be a bit cumbersome on a smartphone if you prefer to do it in writing in the room we do have card copy of the questions um we will be going through these questions a small section at a time so please don't feel like you have to go online right now and start blowing through all questions we will pause in between sections of the talk give you a moment to respond and then we'll move on to the next topic so at this point before we break are there any questions online or in the room before we move on yeah we have two questions in the chat first one being have you looked at what other states are doing on energy security ground F storage other states like Texas mexic New Jersey so we do have some resources in our broader literature review um I don't know to I don't know how I could summarize right how that may have influenced our comprehensive review I could I don't know that I summarize that quickly that might be something that have think about and talk in the future it's about pyic risk tanks um that might be something to discuss in the future um you know all major gold tanks exist everywhere in the country I suspect that you know engineering standards based on risk is something that might be influential and second question is UN and US studies show significant increases in frequency and intensity on National C climate change over the last 20 to 4 years did you assume a forecast increase natural PS yes we use climate change Pro projections RSP 8.5 in some of the risk Hazard the natural Hazard zones in in identifying those areas so we could not use the climate because of how these projections apply to the different threats it wasn't appropriate to use them in all scenarios but for example um drought is one where we're using precipitation projections moving forward in the most severe climate change modeling scenario 8.5 you any follow questions please feel fre out okay anything else in the room is it just for this region or for the state as a whole when we're evaluating this today we're interested specifically in the Portland metro region so that's why we're traveling to each of the regions one at a time want to understand how what your circumstances how they inform your prioritization of of the risk mitigation measures and then also I'll be giving you a summary how little summary of what people have been telling us thus far and we want your impression of what other people are telling us do you agree or or is there something you feel like should be in our radar that no one else has told us yet and so we want those unique perspective from each of the regions and then also from the governs question you may go through it when you talk through the assessment results but um either for the survey or where you guys assessment s are you only looking at their location within these natural zones are you looking at things like facility type age you know like fuel tank construction style and for the surveys is that self-reported information anything that is um either if they actually knew the age of their infrastructure and is something stay ver yeah so I love that's a great question for the technical analysis the answer is yes that's exactly the type of information that we're analyzing we're looking at those characteristics to the extent we can collect information on it whether it's through interviews with the private sector whether it's through data it exists on infrastructure and so on um our primary focus is what overlaps with the hazard Zone however we also are looking at Downstream impacts right so we're looking at the flows and what might be affected something happens Upstream because of Hazard Zone and downstream again very data intense we couldn't take that approach with electricity and natural gas so with those it we couldn't get into that much detail with the utility um we wanted them to actually complete the survey so we had to you know be be sensitive to everyone's schedules and so we were much higher level with the utilities whenever they would sell for report okay and then a followup question for the assessment are we looking at these energy storage facilities only is this distribution and transmission as well um is this a systemwide assessment I'm what did you start with stor like energy stor okay for the assessment are we looking at energy storage facilities only or distribution and transmission as well distribution sorry I think as as a point um you can imagine how much data and information could be collected in this set I you could look at every distribution line state every mile pipeline St um which I would love to do if they couldn't um but you know one might anyway and see it's pretty labor cost tys of exercise um so maybe in a future generation",

you for item e is um deliberation and discussion and decision oh sorry I was reminded and a report how how does this affect the people who've already testified in terms of how it affects them what they've already they haven't testified in this matter the public heing is closed they've made comments to you during a public comment period um just like quite frankly anyone on the street could make a public comment to you about anything in Under the Sun but it's not testimony in this matter because the public hearing has already closed right which gets me to the point that was being whispered which is if if you want to take the testimon the the the comments that you've already heard or any other testimony you would you would need to reopen the public hearing but I'm I'm not certain I'm feeling um a majority of you are there but there's two question I'm answering a lot of questions in the hypothetical in other words and I'm very uncomfortable continuing to do so okay um I was looking at Council rather than a screen so I don't know who was first to speak milman commissioner will okay milman milman commissioner mil okay millerman thank you I have I have two things if we're on agenda item e now do we then go back to a next I think you meant uh B certainly the sure yeah I meant three minutes where you talk about not agenda things yeah U presuming that people will still be around and want to talk to the commission after you're done with this item I I again that's a it's a hypothetical I I don't I don't know less so because it's the agenda right it goes e and now be but in any case uh motion to reopen the public testimony on item 899 second thank you commissioner Kaiser I didn't quite hear what you said I'm sorry second thank you it's been moved and seconded to reopen the public hearing discussion commissioner will I don't know if you want to speak on this or else you're you're muted yes I think the question I was going to ask is is fine to be asked uh after the motion um it's related uh had we not got off track and arrived at uh agenda item e in normal fashion may I ask was they going to be a staff report and recommendations for next steps by the staff um that might be pertinent to hear prior to the motion being considered and if so uh perhaps uh commissioner milerman would accept my uh request to withdraw the motion until we hear the staff report first and then get to that point because it might inform the decision in the vote no and I'm going to motion again if we have to sit through like these people are here I would like to hear from them I do understand there's a staff report but the community folks are they're here they're ready should I guess we could all sit the staff report how long is it do we want to hear the staff report first regardless of the outcome of the motion or does that matter is is a question like are we gonna go straight to testimony or we gonna do a staff report and then testimony I guess that helps me to consider the motion so point of order um the the order would be for the staff report um Planning Commission questions and then if you do determine to reopen the hearing then the hearing um so I you could probably vot that sounds great sorry for interrupting I like let's move this along so we have a motion in a second on the table um so at some point in time you're going to need to call the question chair unless the motion and the second are withdrawn okay is there discussion this motion and second no discussion I think we should re open the public hearing because I think it's important to hear from the public we just add as the individual who seconded it I'm all for hearing from the public again as long as we're not hearing the same testimony from the same individual again is all I would I would profer but I don't know that we can do anything about that at this point because frankly I don't know everybody's testimony so um it just would be nice to keep it to the stuff that's that's relevant to the topic as all it's been moved and seconded that we open the public reopen the public hearing on ordinance 899 um shall we commissioner oh poter thank you uh so when when we talk about opening the public testimony since this referendum uh ordinance has gone to voters and it has to be voted on what are we I I made my notes uh so are we going to have to redo all of this work after the May ballot again so are we going to have all of the public testimonies again are we going to read through all of the information letters again are we going to make the community right in all over again and uh after the may vote how how will this go does community spending time right now with all of this information information our discussions anything have any relevance whatsoever in ensuring that the community the larger North F Community gets to hear this and sees our recommendations we cannot be recommending something that is now gone to voters sure we can we absolutely can uh will will this have an how will this have an impact when um the county uh again maybe the directors the staff report needs to come into play because uh the county chose option two from 1 two and three the county chose option two to not even listen to the PC recommendation after the vote so there's a a if I am I Madam there's there's a couple of compound things in there um first the notion that you you can't make a recommendation while the referendum is in in place is not accurate you can make a recommendation if you choose to proceed to make a um and then there was a second part sorry um there was a lot baked in there um um the second part of your question podar was um uh since the County Commission the Board of Commissioners have chosen option two um there were three options that were presented to them by the staff right the county chose to uh the board of Commissioners chose option two right um where they said continue Board hearing until after may vote instead of saying continue Board hearing until after may vote and PC recommendation after may vote would have been ideal because uh we can make best recommendation based on what the community is asking for right now we are only going so how does this so I how does this help yeah so if I talk about this ordinance I I get it at now so your interpretation of option two and my understanding of it are are fundamentally different so option two as presented to the board was really two parts do you want to um take action before the vote and the second part of that was what would you like to see the do and they basically said deferred it to you you could proceed now um uh they were totally fine if you wanted to proceed and make a recommendation now or you could choose to wait also um that was I think the clear message that I got from the board so I think you're in an option to it it it really is entirely up to you it would have been up to you anyways you would still have those same options you can proceed make a recommendation you can proceed and defer um you can defer um but all all those options will be presented to you by um Miss Wardell in her staff report here um which sounds like it's going to happen in a minute or two so uh in order uh could we make a second uh motion uh I know commissioner milliman's uh um uh uh request uh is already on the table so do we have a second that can I now uh request for tabling this ordinance for now until after the may vote right now or do I still wait well I mean that that's up to you but right now we actually do have a motion in a second on the table we're in discussion of the motion to reopen the public hearing we haven't taken a roll call vote because we're still in that so at some point at some point in time you'll need to take I think we should stick with discuss discussing this motion rather than bring up another item sure so will the community let me clarify will the community should we take this over again we are listening to community now we are opening up the community discussions public hearing again so will the community um have to do all of this again after the may vote should we defer it to them I'm not really even sure how to answer that hypothetical because it assumes that you've reopened the public hearing and you haven't done that yet so I'm I'm not even sure I'm not sure how to answer it okay commissioner will this discussion of the motion correct thank you yes thank you chair um I really think it's important that we as commissioners before we vote uh try to express um what we think about the motion or the the outcome uh to kind of explain a little bit why we're voting the way we do um and I just want to say that I'm going to vote no on this uh motion because I feel it's out of uh order and context I would prefer to have heard the staff report first um and so I also feel that um there was some uh consideration for the likelihood that this whole process might be moot if the um uh referendum is passed and and voted on and and is and and is passed um and so when we finished our last Planning Commission meeting it was my understanding that one of the reasons continue um the hearing uh even though we' closed the public hearing for comment but to continue the hearing for deliberation because we wanted to wait to see what happened um we haven't got that yet so to reopen the public hearing as proposed by this motion and to take further testimony I think is not an efficient use of the commission's time because um it's possible that after hearing the staff report and after uh taking a vote to either F further continue the hearing or or move to make a decision now um uh that that it be a waste of time to hear testimony on a on an item we're just going to continue it would be more prudent to reopen uh the hearing in the future if we decide to uh to extend it so I think it's out of order in my opinion so that's why I want to vote no Mr Millman was next that's neat I would like to hear from the public and",

        "text": " area agreement with city of tiger adopted in 2021 and it is incorporated into Tiger's River Terrace 2.0 concept plan as a future area this slide summarizes our prior hearings and board actions we've had a long journey along this ordinance so our initial Planning Commission hearing was December 15th of 2021 our first board hearings were January 18th and March 1st at the March 1st uh 2022 hearing the board directed engrossment to address case law regarding exceptions findings necessary for roadway extensions we then held engrossment hearings on July 26th and August 2nd at the and January 24th we continued those hearings to allow time for Metro to complete a decision on whether or not to expand the urban growth boundary and the vicinity of this work the Metro process took longer than we expected and so that was the reason for those three continuances we held the fourth engrossment hearing on March 21st of this year and at that time staff recommended additional engrossment to the ordinance to reflect the urban growth boundary expansion as well as recommending engrossment to refinement areas at that time the board continued the hear the hearing to to allow continued coordination with city of tiger as they were moving from their concept planning into their comprehensive planning so we are here today for our fifth engrossment hearing and we are recommending again a second engrossment of the ordinance the city of tiger proposed a midcycle urban growth boundary expansion for River Terrace 2.0 in late 2021 after we had already filed the initial ordinance and began our hearing process Metro Staff recommended that Metro Council consider consider using a land exchange process instead of an expansion of the urban growth boundary The Exchange process has been used elsewhere in the state of Oregon this is the first time it had been used in the Metro region and so it took a while for Metro Staff to do the technical analysis so it took until February 2nd of this year for Metro Council to approve that land exchange and it was acknowledged by the department of land conservation and development in May so on the slide you see an area identified in green that area was identified as Urban reserve and it was brought into the urban growth boundary as a part of that decision this slide shows the River Terrace 2.0 concept plan graphic prepared by city of tiger staff the city of tiger is planning for between 3,000 4,500 housing units plus commercial uses in this 500 acre Urban growth boundary expansion area it's actually two separate areas that are not contiguous with each other the comprehensive planning work which tiger is beginning now will will create detailed implementation and funding plans for the area and include Community engagement the planning is expected to be consistent with our adopted urban planning area agreement which was again adopted by the city and the county in 2021 as I said the graphic on this slide comes from Tiger's concept plan you'll notice the t flat extension is included in the concept plan and it's identified in the legend as the tile Flat Road future study area and the considering it as a future study area area is consistent with what staff are now recommending to move towards a area Washington County's transportation system plan includes a goal goal seven connectivity which states that our transportation system should provide improved and new Transportation connections within and between developed and developing areas within this goal there are two objectives that relate to this work the first objective is to provide an interconnected Transportation Network that offers multimodal travel choices and minimizes outof Direction travel for all modes it also includes objective 7.2 identify as refinement areas where new arterial or collector connections or other improvements are necessary but the specific location mode Andor function has not yet been determined within our existing transportation system plan we have 11 existing Road refinement areas eight Regional Trail refinement areas so the need for multimodal Street connectivity in the River Terrace 2.0 area has been ident ified through multiple prior planning studies um it's also consistent with Metro's Regional Transportation functional plan connectivity standards and with the updated um changes the that Oregon state has made to the transportation planning rule through the climate friendly and Equitable work so our proposed changes to ordinance number 882 given the urban growth boundary expansion ongoing need for coordination with city of tiger while they conduct their comprehensive planning effort efforts and sensitivity to what we've been hearing from the community regarding the undesignated areas that have not yet been brought into the urban growth boundary staff recommend changes to a engrossed ordinance 882 these changes would remove the previously proposed goal exception analysis and strategy text it would replace the functional classification map Amendment and exception Corridor with refinement areas and it would clearly label the proposed refinement areas essentially refinement areas are a flag in our transportation system plan that more coordination and steud are needed before we can identify a specific Improvement for illustration purposes we created these Graphics to show what these refinement areas could look like in our transportation system plan we would have three separate refinement areas because there are three very different types of areas here so on the left you're seeing the tile Flat Road Extension within the rural undesignated property to the south of of schf road at the intersection with tile Flat Road we would then identify the tile Flat Road Mountainside Way Extension within Tiger's new urban area we have received some Community feedback that the refinement area we've drawn goes outside of the area that was brought into the urban growth boundary that's something we would correct before we bring back this engrossment to use so we would keep it within the area now in the urban growth boundary and then you see the mountain sideway Southern extension this is another designated area it's the very southern part actually that was just brought into the urban growth boundary and then an undesignated area south of there so again probably a long-term area to be brought into the urban growth boundary but something that will need study the graphic on this slide shows Tiger's concept plan with these three refinement areas laid on top of it and so you can see that the refinement areas lay on top of the tile Flat Road Extension as proposed within their concept plan the proposed refinement areas would allow for additional evaluation of the alignment and function and multimodal Street connections we would do this through City County coordination through River Terrace 2.0's comprehensive process we would also do further work through future planning efforts for the areas that are currently identified as undesignated that would likely happen as a part of a future Urban growth boundary expansion ask and that is a ways in the this slide summarizes the community comments that we've heard throughout this process we have heard a lot of concerns about bringing Urban Reserve lands into the urban growth foundary which as your board knows is a Metro and City process not something that the county has a decision-making role in we've heard a lot of concerns about the proposed width of the street in our initially filed ordinance there was a lot of confusion around an exception Corridor and what that means for the width of the street we heard a lot of concerns about potential environmental impact of building Transportation infrastructure we've also heard a lot of concerns about housing affordability impacts of infrastructure costs and how building out these new urban areas is very expensive um building the infrastructure is expensive and that makes homes expensive people are aware that we're facing a housing shortage in this area and that homes are very very expensive we have heard concerns from City of tiger and the community has echoed those as well um concerns about the timing for funding and building of a future Street um identifying a road in our transportation system plan is really only the first step there usually isn't funding identified at that time there usually isn't specific timing identified at the time that we make the plan Amendment but that's something that we work towards once it's adopted so that we've had a lot of questions about what the timing would look like and then as the initially filed ordinance and the a engrossed ordinance would require goal exceptions because the exception Corridor was proposed and a collector Road was proposed in the rural area there were a lot of questions about the exceptions process and what that means for um Oregon land use planning we also heard a number of concerns from City of Tigard and I know that the board did receive a letter from City of Tigard yesterday which is now in the record so this slide summarizes some of the concerns we've heard from City of tiger essentially city of tiger would like to be in control of their own planning area as they move into their comprehensive planning and they don't want to have other outside requirements on them the County's concern all along has been that we're the regional transportation system provider but the city's concern is that this is going to be their new neighborhoods and they want to have control over planning for that so a lot of our conversations have been around how we can reconcile those two different viewpoints and those will be our conversations going forward with the city so there have been some concerns about whether or not this infrastructure is Justified and needed there have been concerns about environmental impacts of infrastructure and of course as the city moves forward with their comprehensive planning that's a part of the tradeoff of doing Green Field development and planning for new urban areas you have to figure out how to manage those environmental impacts the Ci's also Express concerns about housing affordability they're certainly seeing with the homes that they're building in River tariffs one right now that those homes are pretty expensive and they're concerned about people being able to afford these homes um infrastructure is expensive of course and the County's committed to continuing to work with our city Partners to identify ways that we can reduce that burden um the city's very concerned about potential for cut through traffic bringing other people into their new neighborhoods uh they're concerned about creating induced travel Demand by building uh new network connections and then they're concerned about the opportunity cost of building this infrastructure over other infrastructure that they may want to see as well and so these are all valid concerns these are all conversations that we'll continue having with the city of tiger as they move through their comprehensive planning uh building out Green Field urban development areas is very challenging and it's very expensive so we're here for those conversations so for this evening our staff recommendation is to conduct the public hearing and deliberate on the proposed engrossment the staff recommendation is then to order the second engrossment of ordinance number 882 and that would reflect the changes shown in attachment a of your staff report which",

        "text": "not yet sorry do you need a microphone over here can everyone hear us yeah we can hear all right looks like we are Live on YouTube so I'm going to call this meeting of the climate action plan committee to order for Monday May 13 2024 president aroy Gonzalez you councelor for joining us remotely um public comment we received some public okay are there any members of the public who want to address the climate action committee all right I'm going to turn it over to you for oh sorry approval of the I SK right over that I move approval of the minutes from our March meeting second okay any discussion all those in favor say I all all right now we're on item four strategy and 12 all right good morning I am actually going to pass this over to Marissa West and Luke Gonzalez this is about the Salem navigation Center upgrade and can everyone hear me perfect so thanks for letting me join my name is Marissa West I'm with Energy Trust of Oregon and I worked with Luke to close out the incentives for the City of Salem navigation Center project uh we enrolled this project in 2021 right as you guys were sort of kicking off design we were able to provide an early design assistance in incentive of $2500 to you guys as well as our standard incentive route which we have listed those energy efficient features we have the data closet minisplit the commercial kitchen appliances such as the gas convection oven the hot food holding cabinet the dishwasher and the ice maker for a total of right around $4,700 in cash incentives to this and then also you can see those sort of estimated energy cost savings those are just based on those incentives that we provided so just those energy efficient measures so of course the project is probably saving a lot more energy um but that sort of gives you an idea of what we've calculated um yearly what you guys will save annual energy cost savings Marissa what's the data clauset mini split I know what the data closet is but I don't know what a mini split is yeah yeah so that's just a mini split it's just an AC unit so when you have a data closet it gets hotter in there so they provide that sort of um mini split system so it's got its own separate AC unit in there thank you yeah of course and any other questions for me I just wanted to go over our um this is sort of a slide that we've created so that way we can sort of highlight the project moving forward um so if there's any questions I'd love to answer those for you guys and if not I think Luke probably has something to say yeah thank you Marissa um are there any more questions yeah I had one if that's okay um what was the reasoning behind the gas oven versus going to Electric I think that's a that would be a question for Luke and the project team uh we don't make those kind of decisions for the project we're just here to support uh where incentives are available and what's going to best you know work for the project but I do see a lot of gas convection ovens and these sort of larger commercial kitchens yeah and that was my my question I I understand it more on the residential side but I don't understand it in a commercial setting so would love to understand that better yeah I think that's a fair question I am by no means a a commercial kitchen expert uh but I could certainly ask the designers my thinking is that um you know we had the service there um there's some convenience to it um as far as you know it it heating up quicker and being ready to go um so to speak comp as opposed to an electric convection oven um but I'm not certain if there's any other other reasons to that I could certainly ask the the folks that helped us design the kitchen and I apologize if my connectivity is is poor uh I'm in Bend celebrating my Big Brother's 50th birthday so I'm remote on a Wi-Fi connection that I know nothing about so I hope I'm coming through clear you are thank you yeah if you could get back to us on those questions that would be great okay I will look into that and then one thing I wanted to ask Marissa is I don't see anything about lighting in this and I can't remember on this project if we um if we had any any incentives for the LED lighting um or if that's just more um par for the course these days and so we do that and see an energy savings as opposed to an incent incentive yeah so the lighting the lighting incentives that we have have really decreased um based on I actually did a lighting calculator for this project and you do have to reach a certain percentage better than code and I think due to safety concerns and things like that um you guys were sort of right at that code a minimum for kilowatt hours per square foot so we weren't able to provide incentive for lighting but you guys did go with LED fixtures it's still very high efficient lighting that's going to last and save you guys money it's just we are going above code is where we're going to provide those incentives right okay I just wanted to make sure that that was mentioned and yes see if the committee had any questions on that so I think what you're saying Luke is we did other energy efficient elements in this project it just doesn't rise to the level of re reaching an incentive but that doesn't mean that there AR things that in addition to this list that's correct another one that's not highlighted on this this slide is that um we we made uh took steps in the electrical design to make the um a perces required for a a solar if we ever wanted to do a solar addition to the roof some of the some of those um some of that equipment is in place and so we put that in as part of this project knowing that we had um a roof replacement in the not too distant future we we stopped short of actually putting the panels up and making the complete uh didn't make a whole lot of sense to do that work when we knew the that the roof was going to need replacement within the next you know five to 10 years thank you yeah that's good context any other questions this this all right well thank you for your presentation and congratulations to your birthday your brother his birthday oh thank you so much yeah it's uh he's he's pretty excited to have us all around him so appreciate that you bet enjoy thank you all right I'll get back to the question I I'll try and get back to um Juliana with a with a response to the question on the gas convection oven so I'll follow up on that appreciate it thank you thank you thanks everyone all right now we're on to strategy en 23 which is incentivize Implement small scale Renewable Power Power micro grids in pipe micro yeah um so we brought uh I think it's a pretty exciting project to Juliana when she started it it's something that keep and I have been had looked at several times over many years and um it just seems to you know it seem to really align with the climate action plan and uh the incentives that are available these days have really started to make this type of project affordable so what we're talking about is um hyper power so if you know or don't know right so we have a water treatment plant at Garen Island which is just outside the city of ston uh water is transmitted through two trans transmiss lines to the city of Turner where it fills Fran and Reservoir Fran and Reservoir it goes down the hill again uh through our Turner control flow facility and into town um so what we're what we're proposing is utilizing the existing head between Garen Island and fransen Reservoir to do a inline in conduit hydropower generator and then that water feeds into Franzen from Franzen it goes down the hill so we're proposing another one at our Turner control flow flow facility that will then utilize the existing head between the FR and Reservoir and Turner control go to the next slide I think it shows a better yeah so it's a lot going on but this is Fran and Reservoir these are our transmission lines that come from our water treatment facility um the two locations that we're talking about are on the inlet to fren Reservoir and then Downstream at our Turner control facility and just to give you an idea I mean so our Max water surface elevation at G is like 475 is um down here we have a water surface elevation of 414 so you've got a you've got a nice head differential there um we don't really need to worry about the pressure here we sometimes have to burn head uh as it comes into Turner as it is so it's just wasted energy you keep saying head you mean that like momentum oh I'm sorry um so so uh the elevation differential right so the driving so it's basically a difference in elevation from the water surface at Garen Island to the water surface at of gravity yes so everything is coming down from Gravity yeah so that um that differential in the water surface elevation creates a driving head um that can be used to turn turban and then at Turner control down right here uh we actually have to kill a lot of head to meet okay so hold on what does that okay sorry why are we killing water's flowing too fast too fast so if we if if we let it go from gon Island straight into town then we would have so much pressure in our pipes that we would be blowing okay we'd be blowing pipes up Plumbing Systems things like that so so we try to maintain pressure in town of around 60 to 80 psi if we were to not burn this excess head off we would be in the range of what 125 130 PSI so to operate our system efficiently we have to kill that or burn that excess head how do you do that so what we do right now is we have control valves right so think about it's a it's a like a ball valve that you would see you know like on a on a PVC pipe so we we crack it a little bit right so the the the KE do you want to explain it he's he's my he's my process engineer so picture you're watering delicate flowers and you've got all this pressure coming on your right sorry turn your spigot a little bit down I just did this yesterday so I know so you turn the spigot down and the pressure decreases so that your flower survive being water that's consistently killing head and and and and",

        "text": " want to go to Salem it was a big town and I was intimidated by the bigger cities but after about two weeks of driving through town and you know I was just like the rest of them go in and out and off you go we spent about three years in Salem uh we wanted to get back to the eastern part of the uh the area and the company was building a new store in Kennewick Washington so we applied for that got that store it's been about four years there and an opportunity in Hermiston came up so we were excited we we moved to Hermiston bought a little place out in the country with a couple acres and uh you know it was home it was about halfway between where she grew up and where I grew up so so we had a good time uh coming to Hermiston and raising our family we had uh we have five kids um and they're uh they're all excited about this West End solar project the uh the thing that I we had an opportunity to buy some land several years ago and with the intent my intent was to farm this land and I knew that there wasn't water it was dry land and I knew that I could uh I worked when I was a kid out in the they're out in the sticks where they could raise wheat plus the on dry land and so I figured well I could do it here so I bought an old combine my son-in-law their family borders our property on the and they Farm about 2 000 Acres you might as it's a Walsh Lee family and they have uh watermelons and cantaloupes and so any of this you see that with stores around the country they they're big into that my son-in-law says hey we can we can make this thing we can try it he says I don't think you're going to make any money but you can try it so anyway we um we prepared the ground we bought the we planted we put fertilizer on it in the fall in November October November and then it it uh you know you hopefully you'll get enough moisture that stuff will grow and we farmed it in 2013 and farmed it again in 2015. there wasn't in 2013 we had our our best crop and we we averaged 14 bushels of the acre which did not pay for the seed and the fertilizer and the diesel fuel and and all the stuff that went with that so I I'm one of those guys that doesn't actually give up on stuff like that so I said we're we're gonna we'll slide it uh summer follow for the year and then we'll try it again and so we tried it again in 2015. and again fertilizer and and the price of wheat was down and and we had it we had a what I thought was a decent crop but when it got into trucks it got to the um elevators it just we just couldn't do enough with fertilizer we had to have water and we just couldn't one of uh and and we averaged I think 11 bushel per acre at five dollars and fifty cents a bushel at that time and it wasn't enough to pay the expenses so we kind of backed off the next year's and and then we got an opportunity to uh to find out about the West End solar project and that was uh I want this we wanted this land to be productive and and to do something for not only our family but it you know around the community provide electricity and and it was uh that was kind of our goal so it was uh it was very I Rob and I kind of got in touch with each other and uh went through the the steps and and kind of put it down on paper and I thought I grew up farming that was what I did I bought Bales I irrigated I drove wheat truck drove combined as a kid in high school and and I love that but I couldn't make the ground that I bought productive and my wife said if you're going to have Farm you're going to have to make a little money on that farm so anyway we we decided that that we would work with with uh West End solar and uh help them along I love solar you know when I look at all the forms of energy from you know from hydroelectric to coal and all of that solar is to me the the best way to do it it doesn't make any noise it's not bad to look at and there's there's no uh exhaust there's no carbon you know and what a great thing to do with the piece of property that that doesn't have irrigation and so you know that's that's been our focus on it is too is to try to help this process along um I thought it would be helpful so that you guys could you know know the family that uh an art will be up here and and tell you a nice story a better than I can and um but I think that it's a it's a great our community the Hermiston Community is growing it's the largest community uh on the east side of that Cascades I was 20 almost 20 000 population in Hermiston and umatilla's growing like crazy they're building houses like crazy um the schools they've built several new schools just to take care of the you know the population that's that's coming I don't know that they're going to run out of electricity but haven't uh Power available is going to be a a great thing uh and and power that that doesn't make of that uh you know it's not bad to look at and doesn't have an exhaust uh I think it's great that's kind of the direction we are we're uh we'd love to see this project if I thought there was anything about this solar project if and one that I have taught if if if we thought that that this wasn't going to be a real benefit to our community uh and the people in eastern Oregon uh we would have never jumped on board what's this this is a great project great any questions that I could answer I've treated okay go ahead sorry this is Hanley Jenkins um council member um and so I understand you know you attempted to uh raise dry land wheat yes on the um and do you done any investigations into irrigation water uh opportunity to access irrigation water you know I have your statement here yes that says that it you know it won't grow crops without irrigation so uh the the first thing that I did when when I so looking at this was to get a hold of Ray Kovacs he was in charge of Stanfield Irrigation District and that's where the water would have come I was convinced when I bought the land that I was going to give water I've known Ray for quite a while he's got a place close to where we are and they've got a business in town and so I I went in and says what do I got to do to get water right and he says you have no clue what you got to do to get water that was uh it wasn't he says Steve we've got people that have been trying to get water for years he says there's just not there's a certain amount of water and if you don't have water rights you're probably not going to get water I went through the uh the the counselors uh are the people that that run the Umatilla County and they had a kind of a program going that they thought that they could get water and so I worked with them for two or three years and it just fizzled and went away because there's not any water there's not excess water okay so this is handling again um so talk a little bit about you know that's a ditch company um did you investigate groundwater the the property that we're on is a art can probably talk about this better than I can but it's a critical groundwater area and they won't let you drill okay so Oregon water resource department has said that this and so water groundwater resource is already over appropriated in and your understanding is that you would not have the opportunity to grow well on for irritation purpose that's that's my understanding yes and that's what I was my son-in-law is a as a lifetime farmer that's all he's ever done from the time he was old enough to walk and he knows everybody and so I've been able to use his uh influence in the community to try to get some of that stuff and just hit a brick wall do you farm any anywhere else no just this piece of my two acres oh we got a pasture and we put some cows out of it again thank you so yeah thank you Mr Scott Cindy content and just really a um and you might expect me to speak earlier about drought um what that may mean for other projects um but it sounds like in 2013 this was as it was even before that drought situation with them now and you were denied water more recently because 2013 2015 you were asking for water because you were doing driving I was inquiring before 2013. okay from the Stanfield Irrigation District and and also we talked about it well but you know we run up against a roadblock with the critical groundwater you know issues there my son-in-law knows all about that because they've got property right next to to where this property so and I I guess that situation has not gotten better in that 10 years I would say it hasn't gotten better for me just in terms of water the water situation does not emerged yeah it has not improved so it would be nice if it did but it's your friend just more this is empire for the record just more on the water thing I think it would be helpful if staff can get some documentation on a critical grandmother um designation and I can't I I worked in Umatilla coming years ago and I can't remember if that's a state designation or in part of the County's comp plan so just coming around because I've looked at the Aerials and I thought well it's a donut hole that doesn't have water how did that happen and the rules changed and and water is less available but but um documenting the critical groundwater area would be really helpful knowing that we know that the Irrigation District can't or can't serve has done more water runs but that would help really say that no this this can't be formed we aren't taking away um Brown that could throw watermelons because there's just not enough water so thank you so I have one more question for you okay this is handling we have in the graph or",

        "text": " on a couple of Grants here of course one of them being eecbg which we're talking about today I want to start out by giving you just a little bit of background on where this funding came from which as some of you may know is the infrastructure investment in jobs um this piece of legislation includes 62 billion dollars for the U.S department of energy to deliver a more Equitable clean energy future for American people by investing in American manufacturing and workers expanding access to Energy Efficiency and clean energy for families communities and businesses delivering reliable clean and affordable power to more Americans and building the Technologies of tomorrow through clean energy demonstrations additionally this program like other Federal Energy programs is covered by the justice 40 initiative this Federal initiative directs that 40 of the benefits should flow to disadvantaged all right next slide please we should be on slide seven there we go perfect oh thanks Tony all right so um just a little bit about our guiding principles here after the passage of both the infrastructure investment jobs act the end of 2021 and the inflation reduction act last summer Otto recognized the state would be receiving millions of dollars from the federal government to invest in clean energy Energy Efficiency and resilience among other important priorities through a series of public webinars and discussions with our energy advisory work group and other interested parties we developed the principles that you see on this slide to help guide our approach to the federal funding I went through read through all of these but as you can see we will consider Equity at every step including Geographic diversity we want to make sure that the benefits of this funding make it to the oregonians who need it most and are distributed equitably around the state in designing programs and distributing funding we'll coordinate with tribal governments as much as possible and communicate clearly inclusively and efficiently to ensure stakeholders in the public are informed and supported and where possible and internal resources allow we hope to provide technical assistance to build community capacity and support Grant recipients there's a position funded in the governor's requested budget excuse me to help with do just this we're also working across agencies to leverage expertise and support historically under invested work to further energy and climate goals and to provide other community benefits and then finally we'll try to take advantage of high priority funding opportunities while ensuring quality work that puts every available dollar to its best use these are the principles we'll try to apply across all federal funds where practicable as we think about program design and implementation and hopefully you'll see that the program we're discussing today is aligned next slide all right so in in regards to eecbg formula grants in particular the purpose of the funds as outlined by the U.S department of energy is to reduce fossil fuel emissions in a manner that is environmentally sustainable and maximizes benefits to communities reduces their total energy use as well as improves Energy Efficiency and transportation building and other next slide please all right so the application is due to um April excuse me in uh July of this year so July 31st 2023 the full application is due um the application is currently in development we're first required to submit our pre-award information sheet to the Department of energy by the end of this week which we already have in process and then um the full application later this the department of energy is the state agency that will apply for receive and administer These funds slide please a little bit about the eligibility here for these grants under this program States tribes territories and our state's largest local cities and counties will apply directly to the federal government those large local governments have already been identified and they can be found in the um the Ard from the Department of energy if you're interested in who those local governments would have been once awarded Oregon is required to run processes to issue at least 60 percent of the funds as sub Awards to eligible entities in terms of those and eligible entities we're looking at local governments who are not eligible for direct awards from the U.S department of and I'll be eligible for a sub-award from the state as well as governments with a shared project applying as a next slide please all right so the legislation provides a one-time formula-based allocation to each state Oregon's allocation is a little less than 2 million you can see the exact number on the slide there while two percent or 8.8 million dollars of this funding was set aside for a separate competitive Grant process for smaller local governments the recently released funding opportunity announcement shared that these Awards would prioritize communities in the least populous states of which Oregon is unfortunately not included I think they were specifically looking at states with 2 million people or less all communities from more popular states like Oregon are still able to apply for these competitive funds it is recommended that the entities that are seriously considering an eligible project to apply for a state sub award additionally there is no match requirement for this grant next slide all right and you'll see a lot of different eligible activities on the screen here while I won't read through the entire list some of the eligible activities permitted under this award are development and implementation of an Energy Efficiency and conservation strategy retaining technical consultant services to assist the eligible entity in the development of such a strategy conducting residential and commercial building energy audits establishment of financial incentive programs for Energy Efficiency Pro improvements the provision of Grants to non-profit organizations and governmental agencies for the purpose of Performing Energy Efficiency retrofits development and implementation of Energy Efficiency and conservation programs for buildings and Facilities within the jurisdiction of the eligible entity development and implementation of programs to conserve energy use in development and implementation of building codes and inspection services to provide building Energy Efficiency application and implementation of energy distribution technologies that significantly increase Energy Efficiency and many more and while there are many activities that qualify under this program there are just a few that are explicitly unallowable such as the purchasing of new land and new construction of a building or facility next slide please hey Emily we have a quick question in the chat um yeah about the the pre-award info sheet does that need to be submitted by applicants by April 28th or is that when Odo will have the pre-award sheet put together to distribute out instead of uh and out interested parties great question thanks Angela that um pre-award sheet is filled out by the state and in fact um we have it pretty much already ready to submit just needs a couple of signatures so um nothing that anybody else at this point needs to worry about all right so here are a few of the federal requirements for these projects and these are pretty um typical requirements that are coming through on the iija funds as well as the IRA funds um they come with requirements that apply to the project as a whole so um when we say that um that means that even if a portion or a partial amount of the funding comes from the um the eecbg funding or other iija um these stipulations do require you to um follow the whole project we'll have to follow along with these these requirements some of these Provisions that potential sub-recipients may want to familiarize themselves with or hear highlights include the Davis bacon Act the National Environmental Policy Act and build America by America next slide please all right and I'm going to hand it back to Roger thanks Emily so as you view this slide here are the project priorities of the proposed eecbg program that we've put together do these potential projects align with local government needs what projects do communities have planned and have capacity for and need you can see on this slide we noted the home energy scores EB charging stations City lighting retrofits and upgrades to municipal buildings we thought those would be some projects that we could get over the goal line and that all of you some of you may be interested in so consider those next slide please as Emily mentioned earlier Oregon's formula allocation of funds is expected to be just shy of two million dollars the funding requires that at least 60 percent of the funds are made available as grants to eligible entities with the remaining funds used to support program Administration information sharing and technical assistance we propose rounding that up to a minimum of 65 percent to exceed the federal compliance requirements and maximize Community impact next slide please here is a budget summary showing the carve outs in terms of percentages as well as expected dollars there's an estimated total budget of 1.9 million estimated sub-grants budget that 65 percent would be 1.2 million proposed sub-grant minimum budget we're proposing 50 000 in a proposed sub-grant maximum Award of a hundred thousand this leaves us with an estimated number of sub-awards of anywhere between 12 and next slide please I like this interesting tool provided by the federal level the federal requirements will also require us to demonstrate that at least 40 percent of funds subject support projects that bring benefits to disadvantaged communities we propose using the climate and economic Justice screening tool made available from the White House the areas shaded in Gray on this map are census tracts identified as disadvantaged communities by this tool some of the darker gray areas indicate where tribal lands are located as well you can see in the Box the level of detail that you can observe from the tool if you zoom into Medford Oregon for example we believe this mapping tool provides a simple means of demonstrating when a project serves a disadvantaged community but we are also willing to consider other means next slide Tony we are proposing to make Awards with a competitive grant program opportunity announcements will be posted for a minimum of 60 days and will include the application prerequisites a scoring Matrix a q a period and the timeline for review and awards at the end of each application period Odo will confirm project eligibility and complete a competitive review the process will conclude with a notice of Awards in Grant contracts we recognize that federal grants can have a few extra strings attached so we plan to develop resources to support attendees with compliance and Reporting next slide please these are some of the metrics that Odo is considering to measure our progress toward these objectives these metrics will be incorporated into grant performance agreements where applicable we invite you to review these and comment on your ability to measure and report on these items we particularly seek your feedback on these metrics to help us determine if there are more relevant data sets that we can help asses assess our success on this project you can see some of these that we came up with are the reduction of fossil fuel reduction of total energy use and the",

        "text": " that was the intent of our changes to condition one uh which we were trying to get at the entirety of the folks and as i read condition two it doesn't necessarily require that kind of notice to everybody in the that kind of notice being the kind we proposed of here's your rights outline in a simplistic form and here's where you can find more information that does not appear as i saw it in condition two instead it focuses in on the process and the plan and that's great and sets out those things but it didn't provide the notice and that's why we proposed the language at the beginning of condition one i think we've heard from patrick good idea we have filed condition two that way i'm sorry you don't read condition two in what way condition two does require that you go back to condition one that's the way i read it i mean i i this condition was as ms rachner pointed out put in in response to concerns raised by stop i read the condition as if the plain language of it says certificate holder not the department the department does not want to get into the business of sending these notices that's that's on idaho power we all agree on that certificate holder will send the notices to the landowners in the attachment as director indicated that attachment is landowners within one that notice she'll tell those folks you own a noise sensitive receptor and what the requirements of noise control conditions one and two are now i agree it's not clear how they will tell the landowners what the con what the requirements of those conditions are so what council needs to determine is is are you satisfied with this is it appropriate as ms rachner suggested to provide them the language of the condition or do you want to do something that mr anuta has suggested uh or yeah or potentially both and have uh you know kind of a easy to understand summary of it yeah i i think that's what we want to pose to the council right now um to move forward so councilor condon cindy conan um i would prefer both i mean there are people who i i think mr newt is correct can get lost in the conditions themselves and a list would be appropriate there are others that would want to say where did this list come and dive deeper and so i i would prefer we have notice in plain language for the to clearly understand plus the stop would certainly agree with that jenkins i don't have a problem with that i don't know how todd's going to reflect that but sounds like we got somewhere right then cindy condon i just i'm i'm not clear on all the exhibits and i just want to make sure that attachment x7 what is what's the title of x7 does it include everyone within one mile is that the yes everyone within one mile and um and it needs to be updated because it is old and a few things have changed um over time right and just to follow up to distinguish between um x four and five in that are um in condition one those are the identified nsrs yes and exceedances yes or it may not just be exceedances but actual i believe i just want to understand the difference and those are the folks for whom oh yeah okay thank you okay so we've got have we dealt with condition one or just the first paragraph stop did have a few other additional proposed changes to condition one and those would be in paragraph what was an exhibit one excuse me in condition one the first paragraph if i or excuse me the second paragraph we had suggested adding language what was i think sub i'm remember reading it right started whether we're on condition one condition one i'll be back um yeah be right there there we go um we had suggested adding some language in the six about six seven cent lines down there's a sentence that says if this review is deferred to the apartment to the stop had suggested adding language to clarify that appeals from the department would be taken to fsec that's sort of implicit in your rules as i read them but we wanted it to be clear in the uh material uh and the condition that it would go to fsec ultimately and that in the if you look at the lines up there it's the uh where it says if this sentence on the left side that the line that starts with review to the we suggested that the words appeals would be to taken to fsec be added after that to make it clear in the condition that any appeal would go to fsec next one down that review of the department metro doj i guess i'm not quite following that because the way it's set up is that the the dispute does go to the council unless the council chair we don't want to handle this one we're going to defer it to the department that's the way i read that all right i'm sorry slur buyer the default assumption is that any dispute comes to the council if the council made a decision to direct the department to weigh on it that's separate but the default assumption is any dispute comes directly to the council that is the intention and that's the way i read this language so yeah carol with our our concern was it um it actually says that the council chair can defer the dispute to the department not the council and we wanted the council to have the last word um rather than just saying oh well there's a dispute it goes and then the council chair for some reason uh i'm sure that probably wouldn't happen but if they did just defer it and the rest of the council council's going wait we we want to hear that one i i follow you there and todd may want to weigh on this some more the intention of that is because council has a ton of business and and we don't have any sense right now of how many of these types of disputes might get referred to the council council chair coordinates prior coordinates with the department prior to every month's meeting as to the agenda for that meeting so if in a particular month a dozen of these disputes and council already has a lot of business on that month's agenda the council chair has the has the discretion to decide would have the discretion to refer that if that if those 12 disputes automatically go to the council then the idea of trying be efficient with the that month's council meeting is lost because now that the 12 disputes are already in front of the council that was the intention behind that so you understand why it says council chair rather than council and we understood that we're uncomfortable with just having the chair do the deferral and stop is also uncomfortable with the idea that if there was a deferral and the department says oh here's our decision there should still be an appeal back to the council ultimately that was the stop's position so that the council should be the last okay the department's comfortable with this provision so now it's it's clearly in your hands council and i don't know ms ragner if you have anything you'd like to add no not at all okay where's the council on the suggestion this is hanley and usually in the situations where the council chair makes a decision it's referred to the next council meeting as an information item where that has if we have an issue it's probably going to come up within the next council meeting so i i'm comfortable with this language i'm not concerned that the council chair is going to abuse that opportunity cindy conan i guess i do have a bit of that so there's there's no appeal if the department makes a decision reviews and makes a decision so there's no right to come back to the council am i as i read it once it's been deferred to the department we have now washed our hands of it i mean with no opportunity to voice as a counsel the way the condition is written yes but again the default is to the council this is only in a situation where the council chair determines that for this particular these disputes or this particular meeting we're going to have the department handle it the assumption is it's going to the council it's difficult i i guess for me i mean with the current chair um i wouldn't have any any issues but but we're making the decision it's this is a long-term decision i guess i i have i do have concern about that the record todd cornett just from a practical standpoint council also sets policy so if in some circumstances you know the council chair did defer that to staff and there was no appeal rights but and as as councilmember jenkins indicated you know in my secretary report at the following council meeting i would provide that update if council was uncomfortable with that you would set the policy to say we do not want to have any of these done by staff we want all these done by uh council so there is i mean there is a check in there council has that as a body has that authority to put a check on the council chair if you believe um that that you know is being abused for whatever reason okay so to try to keep us moving on does the council feel we need to make any changes to that language okay and uh counselor chalk tooth you're okay with it yes okay so i think we can move on we have a a majority of the council uh is okay with that language so the next do we what do we do did that take care of condition one that completely this is mr noodle that takes care of the stop recommendations for condition one okay let's go to condition two okay and your suggestion on the first paragraph are there any find my version it's not the same language for the for the record kel and tardy weather i have a clarification question so mr anita you were proposing that the notice language in front of condition but the notice language is actually in condition two are we addressing the having the notice conversation in the context of potentially changing condition two are you comfortable with that mr newton because then basically we aren't trying to add the notice portion to condition one whether you add it to one or two as long as it's there if it fits better here that's fine but the more detailed the the and actually i'm more comfortable with what uh mr rose suggested sending both a notice that has the kind of summary that we suggested and then actually the and putting that here mr vice chair for the record uh todd cornett so whether it goes in condition one or condition two i think we can evaluate and as you know jesse indicated you know that would be a material change the language that i have and this is not actual language because we have to",

        "text": " questions are being asked right for like the EJ community outreach or plan what makes a really good one what makes you know not a really good one um and so just wanting to get a little bit more context of like um yeah why the equity framework is 2.5 but also like what does the equity framework mean um for Odo and when other reviewers are going through the applications yeah and I think um so first off is that breaking this up really just allows based on the related information and response in the application for that particular item such as is this located in an environmental justice Community is this is primarily served in is this project primarily serving environmental justice Community which would be the impact on that Community um and that would become that single score combined single score item um and then the same example through uh the Outreach or the plan to engage the public and and the current iteration as you you know as you described we can have reviewers going through you know 12 to 15 questions with a lot of information that's that's revolving around the environmental justice impact uh across the board but some has more specificity and details uh in some cases uh some of that information is um maybe it's not directly related but there's still information there but in the end a reviewer gets to the end of that and has to score all of that and then you're thinking okay now it's what is our what's our roundabout score in this case in this type of a chain you can go through those items as you're reviewing the application responses and you can apply relatively accurate scoring which will then come to that combined score um and we just you know our intent there and our thought was it really does same with the project strength area it creates more specific and consistent and even scores across these priority sections of the application the equity framework 2.5 score there that's listed at 2.5 because we to get to a couple of these scores we had to tweak uh we have to tweak some of the other scoring down the line through the criteria this would not necessarily be a final at this point it's just where in our Matrix that we were playing with this is where that one came out one reason why is uh is the equity framework uh as uh Equity framework as an item moving through the various public bodies throughout the country in the state is still a relatively New Concept in terms of already having that in place utilizing that into a specific project and so one of the reasons we were looking at that including that in but at that lower score was also to create a little bit more balance between uh between public bodies who have those resources and have already been on top and moving through and some of some of those entities that are maybe still working their way into these programs but obviously understand these Grant programs here Federal need that information and they are requirements for Grant submissions now in the in the um application it is basically kind of a yes no question in the statute and and then it you know rather than the application does your program have an equity framework or use an equity framework in this project you know or related to this project will it apply a policy or an actual Equity framework yes or no and that's why um we gave it that score because it's just a kind of a blank question and if you look we've we've givvied up what used to be 10 or 15 points now into a 17.5 point total and again each scoring criteria is going to be a hundred point total and that was you know in that balance and adjustment Alexander did we did you feel like we were able to answer that for you did you have a photo that that was perfect thanks thanks so much for that and that makes a lot of sense um I I mean I agree with this type of adjustment as someone who's read grants before it's nice to be able to have more specifics and even when you're talking in the full group being able to go back to your notes and have those like really specific of why you maybe their uh Community impact is great but their community outreach seems to be lacking right and being able to um touch on those things um this is more of just a kind of like General process for reviewers but do reviewers get um examples of what like a good community outreach plan is or what Odo is considering as an equity framework um just so like as reviewers are going through it that they have kind of that um yeah that like example of what a successful kind of community outreach plan would look like um or Equity framework like is is this place accessible like is it Ada is it right like um just so that the reviewers also have kind of uh like are on the same page of what that might mean the um when we go through with each reviewer to provide kind of you know provide our initial guidance uh through the program um they are provided with a lot of the details about what is driving the program the benefits the priorities and the benefits but the other part of this is that we also try to take a step back and and not not influence um those uh those scoring those reviewers and their scoring and so in a in a lot of that to answer your question it is we are open to receive questions for more clarification or where they could go find that information and what they may expect to see um but we actually try not to be very uh influential in that um because program team is also some of the reviewers the internal reviewers for the projects as well so we have to walk a very fine line about providing guidance but also not being influential to ensure that we have unbiased scoring and flexible scoring at the end of each opportunity round yeah thank you for that I know how that could be um it could be you know difficult to to try to walk that line um and try to remain kind of like as unbiased as you can and like mitigate those things um I do think that sometimes it is good to have um not everyone works on like Equity work or in community engagement and things like that so sometimes I do think to have just like a basic understanding that all reviewers could have would be uh good but I think just for right now um the topic at hand I do uh like this adjustment thank you thank you on the sun appreciate it uh Clay did you have any follow-up with well I've got one question just a quick one from the chat um for projects turned down do you offer a debriefing and the answer is yes you contact everybody um whose application was not selected and offer um to to meet with them or offer them our own analysis of where they had weaknesses and where they had strengths in the competitive review process against the their com their competitors so yes we do provide that debriefing um and I'm running through the questions real we have do you know the completion date for round three construction projects yet no um that will be a long time off because once we have a contract signed or as we call it a performance agreement grantees have three years from the date of signature to complete their uh the construction of their Renewable Energy System so Scott if you need more details on that please reach out to us um at our email community.grants at oregon.energy.gov and we'll post that too in the slideshow at the end okay and I do see um another question uh from uh Jennifer does Odo consider whether applicants have already received grants in previous rounds versus new applicants again each opportunity round is an individual a separate round um and so various entities can apply for a new Grant in a subsequent round even if they're award a grant the prior one but as we had mentioned earlier on another question uh that that application project cannot be for additional funding for the same project that was already awarded it would have to be for a new and different project or potentially some kind of a substantial expansion of an existing project and and Clay did you have any clarification did you mention that the um the diversity aspect of the scoring that could affect repeat locations and yeah builds built into uh built into the scoring criteria is another scoring item of profit diversity so of course in the review process uh you know it would be up to individual reviewers to decide if a program uh that they knew had already been prior awarded around uh in a prior round uh if that would impact the overall diversity and whether they uh would give a lower uh or an equivalent score there would be up to that individual reviewer and then potentially would show up across the uh the mean average of all those reviews and there's another question that I think we're probably going to wind up wrapping up here in a moment with kind of a combination of our public and our member questions here I apologize for that went a little over um uh and Susan asked could you include for both the reviewer and app and a template that would say uh to effect zero does not at all answer the question and two is somewhat um basically to that if I if I have that uh paraphrased um that that actually does occur uh when we do our uh initial meetings with the competitive reviewers prior to the Confederate review process we do walk through some of those items without getting into uh specific details of a prior one a prior application that would be this uh or that but we address it more from a way uh with clay and I of what of what we were looking for what the program is looking for based on responses and then also just our experience of applications where we've seen uh you know very specific and On Target responses as well as responses that are uh you know that are trying to answer that particular question but it's not really related to answering that question and we just try to guide them in awareness of that and then apply their scoring appropriately as they see uh as they say fit and um so I think with that that we have uh any other public questions in there I know that we're a couple minutes over right now there is one from Toby he says there has been a historic unwillingness to develop green hydrogen projects in Oregon if a solar green hydrogen Storage Fuel Cell system which provides both electricity and clean fuel were proposed would it be uh Clayton you want to go on that one on yeah I'd have to we'd have to look at the specifics of what was being proposed um energy storage is one of our eligible um the fuel would not be because our Technologies are for energy that is",

        "text": " and uh since covid I you know kind of brought it back to life and our committee our three priorities is Outreach education both internal and outside and as well as recommendations and research about various um ways we can improve as an agency and then also um the sustainability Committee just initiated a greenhouse gas emissions inventory over calendar year 2022 we just got the results about a month or so ago and they were presented to our board at the August work session and then from the Baseline information it's going to feed into our climate action plan so we're going through writing of the scope right now and the procurement process in order to bring uh consultant on to help us develop the kind of action plan that isn't complementary to our local Regional Partners including City of Salem and then also the county and the state level organ ODOT and then um so the climate action plan is a huge Initiative for the district it's one of our 13 activities for two fiscal year 24 which we're currently in right now and uh to kind of get started we're also Marion County Earthwise certified since 2013. uh and then we're signatory for after sustainability commitment after is the American public transportation Association we committed to aligning our initiatives with um with APTA through a commitment program and then finally uh just a highlight that you know in everything we do in regards to development of Transit centers both ktc and future projects uh we're always keeping sustainability at the Forefront of our mind really and almost you know every decision we're making as a district and um so it's it's something I would I would like to point out as well and that concludes my portion of the presentation but I'd love to answer any questions if I if I can so I could help but notice the picture of the where all the buses are yes do you have any plans eventually putting sort of like solar canopy or anything over the parking area no explicit plans of course with um charging infrastructure everything's kind of been brought up I don't know if that's an immediate future but I yeah I do know there would be some regulations coming online about um Sheltering uh parking lots over a half acre just going from the state oh okay so I don't find out a mandate to go and do what it's already built something to be aware of thank you thank you so what's going on ridership he has a perfect person in here and that's the same goal is really cool but if nobody's getting on the bus ridership on the increase uh month over month ever since 2020 we've been seeing double-digit increases which is exciting uh a lot of that has to do with our youth ridership program that we're partners with City on we're really excited about our electronic Fair program and how that's going to be creating more opportunities for for folks uh it's it's more Equitable program with the fair capping system where you basically earn a month pass as you pay as you go and it takes about 28-29 Brides so about 14 or 15 days to earn that month pass but uh for those consistent writers a lot of them were it would be hard to pay out the 45 dollars in one payment but a dollar sixty or three three dollars 20 cents for a day pass each day is a lot easier for folks especially families um so um yeah I we've just been tracking up and up uh so that things are looking good I have a question about the electronic uh bear system so I I downloaded the app and loaded some money onto it and I'm just curious so I I haven't used it yet but I did download the app and have money for someone I did I'm ready to go okay do you have that money or is that like sitting with this app company like if I haven't actually used further I was just curious yeah yeah so I believe it's in a chariot's account okay you wouldn't be able to go to Eugene and no no no no no no I just meant like some app company had do they have it or does chariots actually get the money once I love it uh Chris do you know the answer to that I don't know the technicalities I was gonna we'll have to check into um I am not a hundred percent sure on we can get back to you good question I was just curious I'm just wondering also how is it impacted ridership have you noticed and people have you received many complaints from people not being able to access the platform or how's that going it's really going well uh Chris do you have any information on that I think yeah so I know in the first month we had over a thousand uh people sign up for the program um and that's between the card and um and the new and the app um we haven't abandoned any of our previous methods so uh so all of the previous uh Fair media that was um is still in place uh it takes time to to to move that stuff out and so and getting the adoption so you can't we don't we didn't want to just change day one and force everybody so all of the previous options are still there and slowly over time we'll uh move those out uh for as we get more adoption to the e-pair program so you can you can still play cash is that what you're saying you will always be able to pay cash there's uh we there's uh Equity issues with removing cash as an option there will always be a or as far as I see into the future a cash option thanks I wanted to ask a little bit more about the um the business I don't know what your program's name is but where businesses can purchase I know that that's been a challenge um I think personally my I think because of the requirement that had been in place or if you want to do it you have to you have to purchase one for every employee so for instance the City of Salem has 1350 employees but not all of them would be riding the bus wouldn't be practical but there could be a nice core number of people where it would be and I'm wondering have you thought about it or have you implemented anything to relax those requirements so we maybe we could purchase a smaller number than that that's a great Point um our chief Planning and Development officer Sophie Zoom is on and he may be able to answer that we just had a discussion last week about this very yep good morning I'm not sure if you can see me it's really weird um all right can you hear me though I mean yeah yeah all right sorry about that I've been a little late um yes I can expand on that so and this is my second month so I started on July 31st and uh since then we have started expanding and exploring different Mobility options including the group Pass Program so uh Kiki has been working on this and she kind of like informed me that there has been some additional demand for flexibility in the program and we are as we speak working on those criteria how we can reach out to more people and to fit their needs and especially the employers need and to answer your question yes we are working on it and then we will be in touch with you if that's the case and then see how we can better serve the need of the community and the employer as well um yeah so two short answer is we'll get back to you and see how thank you I really this one's really important I mean of all the questions I've asked that you might get back to me on this is the only one that really matters so again this is the only one that really could impact climate in our you know climate action initiatives in our city and how and actually have a meaningful impact on greenhouse gas reduction so and not just with the City of Salem I've heard it from others I know uh there are other large employers who might be interested as well or even maybe even not so large employers so I think that as much flexibility as you can build into that I think it will increase your ridership and I think um you know that's good when your ridership goes up that's you know we all benefit yep right on I have a few different questions I've tried to group them in topics for you um so I want to start out first with an easy question and that is how are you educating the public on the youth uh free ridership program that you're offering there's been a lot of communication with the school district uh there's a video that has been developed that will be released to all students and through I think the app that Salem Kaiser School District uses here in the next couple um I have not been on that initiative I don't know if anybody else has more to yes I can chime in sorry um yes so that video is going to be it's going through final review right now as we speak sometime mid-september if that I can say that sometime this week or next week we would be able to go live and then that we're working with the Salem uh School District as well and uh working on a roll-up plan so how we can better Outreach to those communities and working with other stakeholders so yeah that work is in progress and sometime this week or by next week hopefully we'll be go live great thank you aggregation system Plan update happening soon I would love to hear more about your rapid transit goals for the future um any kind of ideas on how we can work with uh bus lane or bus lanes and bike lanes and how those two things should function really well together um in the space that we have um we're a pretty well built out so we need to use the curb to curve that we have so how do we use that and benefit both of those types modes of transportation and I'd also love an update on any kind of South Salem Transit Center all right I'll take a stab at those questions first and then maybe Chris and trophy can chime in uh yeah I guess I'll start with the South Salem Transit Center we're working with the consultant pivot architecture as we speak and the board is going to be I believe looking at the the conceptual drawings that have been developed at their work session on the 14th of this week um so we're really in motion to get to a point where we can get the point where we're choosing the the actual plot there's two choices right now one on the north east corner of Wilton commercial and one on the Southeast so they need to make a decision of so same intersection just",

        "text": " just looked at and here we are in october and really through february we're going to be doing this rule making and you will serve as a rules advisory committee or iraq which is a common term um for oregon rule making committees so we're hoping to get your input and feedback to adopt some rules we're hoping that we're hoping you all share ideas and advice for definitions and methodology so that we can get this these program rules put together to really honor the intent of the bill we're really going to get into when we write the rules this is the this is where we codify all of the details for the program and so we are looking for really the detailed level of program design in the rules and um so we're hoping that we get really good feedback in this meeting in the next meeting i think there i will pause for a moment because i believe that nick has joined i was just prompted let me see i don't actually my list may not show but nick are you have you joined us yeah i think that he might be an attendee and um might be uh or sheila might be making sure he's promoted so he can unmute himself and just introduce himself yeah can you guys hear me hi everybody my name is nick johnson i'm the executive director of lake county resources initiative a small nonprofit in lakeview oregon all right and one of the things that we talked about in the introductions nick was to ask the question do you have any projects that you may visualize applying for this grant program so any community scale renewable energy or energy resilience projects do you see anything in in lake county we may see come to this program yeah i think there are a handful of projects um that we've kind of had in the pipeline for a while now that would fit well with this program i think it's very applicable to lake county specifically as well as other parts of rural oregon as well so i think it's a great opportunity and certainly excited to participate in this process so thank you great well thanks for thanks for joining us we're really happy to have lake county resources initiative join us you know lake county is kind of always swung for the fences when it comes to renewable energy and it's uniquely blessed with renewable energy resources and kind of the will to get a lot of these projects going so we look forward to more great things out of lake county so thank you for that introduction i will think that that's um i think that's it for our next round of introductions here um so i will i will move on i noticed a couple people rob came off um on camera and mute and i was wondering if anybody had uh thoughts they wanted to share on that roundtable question prompt it's okay if you don't but um wanted to check and see that pause for a moment um i know some of these are thinking questions is the current website or is there a thought of creating some type of a collaboration portal where if we come up with ideas or if we want to look at how maybe some other states or other you know non-profits applied similar programs or any you know case studies that we could share with the group that's a great idea that's something maybe rob and i can take back and see what we can do with that that's a great idea though yeah that is a good idea and it seems like something that should be possible in today's age of online collaborations so that's a really great idea and rob i also notice in the chat that phil said that he's here if you wanted to pause for a moment and have him introduce himself oh great so um commissioner chang with um deschutes county i believe has joined us so phil chang if you are on an introduction and if you are on your likely muted because we can't hear you oh there it is uh hi everyone i still can't figure out how to turn my video on uh when i i was uh tuned in almost this whole time uh and driving but um when i was on my i couldn't i mute myself to to answer earlier and so uh when you were going through how webex works and where to look where to click to do various things i i missed that as well um but uh i i'm phil chang i'm a newly elected county commissioner here in deshoots county and um very much looking forward to engaging with this advisory committee great and do you have any kind of vision of projects that um you would like to see enter this program oh we got you phil on the video i was out in the woods this morning i was out in the forest this morning and um one of the projects that i've been tracking in my community um is a biomass thermal energy uh at now bachelor which kind of falls in line with a number of other biomass thermal energy projects that have been developed in eastern oregon in the last 10 to 15 years byproducts of forest restoration activities and hazardous fuels reduction to offset fossil heating fuels lots of other ideas but that's one very specific i'll mention yeah no that's one that um you know thermal energy is often at the top of everybody's mind when it comes to the energy discussion but for those of us that live in eastern and central oregon there's a whole lot of space heating that has to happen over here that space eating is certainly a big part of um having a resilient community and having warm places to go so i look forward to a discussion about thermal energy and especially about the use of biomass i know within the bill when it defines renewable energy project biomass is actually the first on the list of a lot of different technologies that are considered to be renewable energy technology so we are likely lucky to have commissioner chang with us he's a long time leader in thinking around biomass utilization and forest health in central oregon so thanks for joining us phil and um i think that the only member that maybe we haven't had yet is danny martinez and so we'll we'll keep trying to get danny but i know it is busy time so we don't expect that every person can attend every meeting and when that happens we a recording of the meeting and we we will still get everybody's voice heard so we'll keep trying to get um danny on the line but if we can't um it's no problem i think that's uh maybe since we have a natural pause here are there any other um thoughts or i see ruchi is smiling so i think we're probably in um good good order here yeah i was just joking earlier that we are getting used to awkward silence because we just have to sort of pause and see if people have questions and that's okay if you're sort of still thinking about it and feel free to use the chat or just speak up if you have a question or a comment all right so on to the kind of advisory role for this we recognize that um what we have here for committee roles kind of preliminary and we want to get your ideas as well but we really hope to this team helping to conduct outreach across oregon to get projects rolling and in some cases you will all be in positions to actually reach into those communities and support their efforts there's a lot of small rural communities in oregon that may be understaffed and not used to filling out grant applications and dealing with the kind of bureaucratic and administrative process associated with grant programs and so we really hope that we can have this team helping to get the word out and support communities whenever possible in some cases if you if you're not directly involved with a project that is entering our program we may also reach out to some of the committee members to help us with that competitive review of applications this is something that's not yet determined but that will have to work out in rules and so that's another potential role is to serve on sort of a competitive review committee to help us sort through the projects and determine which projects are going to get awards recognizing that those recommendations lead oto to um be the final word in in announcing grants and just as a little bit of background we have reached out to the doj and also to the oregon ethics board to make sure that we don't have any conflicts of interest associated with any of you as members of the advisory committee also being involved with projects that enter the program and um we have we've had a back and forth with oregon ethics commission and they've informed us that there really is no conflict there and so long as if you are involved in one of these let us know that you're involved in one of those projects at the beginning of a and um under those circumstances there's really no conflict we still are excited to um to work with you as those projects go through the application and selection process but obviously if you are involved in a project we won't ask you to serve on a selection committee so that should go without saying but um that just for this last bullet here where odo director may consider recommendations in making grant by having odo as the final decision maker that's what really cleared up a lot of any of the potential conflicts of interest associated with um with serving on an advisory committee but also being active out in the communities and drumming up projects so with that said i think we've already kind of touched on this question of um do you have questions about these roles or ideas for how committee could how the committee could support the program in this advisory stage so if there's any other thoughts we'll have a moment of either awkward silence or or thoughts coming in and if you don't have thoughts now that's fine we can um we can come back to this as we go so any thoughts hey rob i raised my hand so i guess i'll just go if nobody else is talking this is mark um definitely on the outreach activities we can be helpful with that we have regional staff that live in the regions in which they work so they can be great contacts to get this kind of information out to the communities and then we also have a couple of other programs not that i run but that others run that are somewhat overlapping with these so i could see you know my going being a liaison with them to see if there's anything they can provide to help and i guess the last thing i would say is that while i'm sure we're going to do an amazing job writing these rules i'm also sure that somebody will come up with a question or an idea during the first time you put out a call for proposals that we won't have thought of so",

        "text": " very clear that at least on the he side of things they want this to really benefit low-income households and I think in a lot of situations it's it's very difficult to expect those households to pay anything out of pocket for some of these upgrades based on previous program experience and and what the research kind of supports um so I do think that that's where that goal of covering 100% of cost for those households come comes from is to make sure that we can serve those communities um and that and we certainly are sensitive to the issue of Fraud and to that concern um and that's something that we would very much enjoy having a discussion on and are it's one of the top priority items as we design the program for figuring out how to have the appropriate levels of oversight and I'll just add that every state is dealing with the same issues and so there will be some resources from the from the federal government to help States navigate those kinds of challenges great um there's really just one other thing that I want to say from the current sort of Stack well first I'll say Brian for your Ashlin question we have a really I got a nice answer from our federal grants officer Emily for you in the chat if you want to look for that and then there was some talk about um about job training and I just want to share that there is I call it a sidecar there's a sort of a side car to this program that we're working on an application for in November regarding um training Workforce training um and there's also competitive funds likely to come down the road the FED saw that there would be Workforce considerations with launching this program in the states and so we do have both uh $2 million from the state an additional 2 million formula funds from the Feds that we are applying for very soon and then additional competitive funds to help bolster our existing training programs we have lots of good training programs in the state already so helping them either reach new audiences help people help create um more avenues for people to like enroll in those programs that work for them um lots of different ideas that are out there so um kind of stay tuned on the workforce stuff but just know that's definitely um something we're working on and I think on that um will go ahead and have us go to the next um next slide I know there's still some more comments but I just I can't read everybody's out loud and yes eron I we know the application is due in January we're still turning it in a little sooner than that so we can turn our Focus to getting this one in early um oh I guess now there is a question just let's just go ahead to go to the next one so how can Odo ensure rebates reach low-income and disadvantaged communities that live in multif family housing and what consideration should be made to encourage land landlords to allow for energy efficient upgrades that benefit their tenants so we're looking for your ideas here the chat is fine and or raise your hand and we can call on you there were a couple of earlier comments that maybe fit in here there's a note um about uh Outreach to people of color and under represented group um that there's been a challenge making those trainings and Outreach culturally appropriate for communities that have not historically had the same opportunities or connections to participate thank you for for that comment there's also a question about funding to community- based organizations to help with Outreach to lowincome um populations um so appreciate both of those comments we're still exploring how program implementation is going to look um and figuring out um what portions of the work we want to either Grant out or contract out with others to help support the implementation and Outreach so those are great suggestions for us to explore all right I don't see any hands up I do see a lot of um we're definitely going to need to spend some time reading through the comments because I'm just not able to verbally get out to all of them we do have a couple of questions in the mix now um even though they're a little off topic right this second I just they're going to get lost if I don't ask them um have we I there's a question that's about augmenting low-income authorization programs and I think I can just say there does someone want to kind of get into how like we're able to kind of work with those programs but we can't replace them however you want to you know what I mean if one of you two could dig in on that for a second oh and then I'll get to the raised hand in just a second yeah so we have been talking with um our partners um over and housing and and really thinking hard about how our programs integrate with the existing um low-income weatherization programs um those programs have uh a couple of changes that are coming online kind of around the same timing as the start of our proposed programs um and it's going to allow us to do some work um together within um these programs um specifically we're seeing that the here program can come in and do certain upgrades um and it won't have an impact on that same household being able to access the weatherization program when they they come up in in the the queue or once they get got to in those programs because as you may be familiar with those programs are kind of longstanding and ongoing but they can only help so many people per year so we see these programs layering together and not being mutually exclusive and we hang out with our friends that work on those programs to talk about this a lot so and we'll continue to talk more and more to them um as we put these together it's really important that we work together um I got a question about what options there are that renters can access without landlord approval and that they could take with them when they leave and I don't think is there anything for that scenario yeah is a portable heat pump or an induction stove yeah that's that's a very interesting question um I don't know off it's on my head I think that's something that we could discuss with the um US Department of energy d understand what what their thinking is on that but my understanding is that it's based around the household and the building at this time there's some other comments in here sort of related to that push poll between kind of getting benefits to tenants but not setting it up so that a landlord can um get take advantage of these programs and then um and then the tenants are not protected when those when when there's um Market affordability changes as a results and some feedback about making sure things aren't first come first sered and then I guess I need to get to Clay but go ahead Emily I'm sorry if I could just chime in on that last question there is guidance in the alrd which is the the rules from the federal government um so if rebates are directly requested by renters written permission from the building owner or authorized agent for the Home Efficiency project must be obtained before commencing um clay go ahead you're on off mute hi thanks Christie and just kind of this aligns with with the last two comments and and conversations we're seen some uh uh renter customer segment or consumer segment penetration in California in my understanding is it's because the state doesn't require landlords to uh make a refrigerator or most appliances available in the unit they rent uh which means that a lot of renters end up having the leeway to uh take advantage of uh you know Statewide rebates or utility rebates or what have you uh to get appliances that they can so it' be interesting to see if Oregon you know what the Oregon statutes yeah thanks for that clay that's that's helpful and something we can we can check on what Oregon requires regarding appliances and rental units I have a question again just one that's kind of random I'm just going to take it I don't know how else to deal with the random questions and I want to be responsive um so sorry if it's like we're all over the place but also trying to be responsive just know I'm like trying my best to deal with that struggle um there's a question of if a heat pump install cost is 12K whether the program would cover 50% % of the cost or just $ 450% of the $8,000 cap and I'm pretty sure that I know that the answer is it would cover 50% of the cost up to the $8,000 that's right yeah um okay so I think everything I'm seeing here are comments um there's a lot of um and a lot of different like hey you should talk to Oregon Community solar you should talk to um uh just different there's a contractor who's got ideas so saying we should G giving us his email address and everything um and things we should think about like have we talked to landlords getting to um yeah energy utilities we've totally had them help with Outreach for our new Heap pump programs they're a great partner uh question about does it cover mobile home parks where the residents own the mobile homes but not rent the space but rent the space we're in yes that qualifies interestingly by the way that's th this is a um Scott Morris listen to this answer on mobile home parks where residents own the mobile homes but rent the space they count as renters for Oregon's rental heat pump program and therefore that program Statewide so you may want to look into that because that's open now and has a a decent Siz rebate available don't ask me is that how much right off the top of my head right now but check it out okay um I think I'll move us to the next slide lots of really great ideas and comments and just because I'm not saying them doesn't mean they're not great we'll make sure we take a close look comments and then rebates will also this is the next question rebates will also support the economy and jobs such as contractors who will install energy upgrades how can Odo use these funds to meet the US doe goal of supporting minority-owned and woman-owned and Veteran owned businesses and then thanks Emily for once again posting the link for folks to either raise their hand answer in the chat or um there's a form where you can provide us answers to all of these or any of these questions and get back to us that way with that I'll see if any hands come up and otherwise feel free to continue to add things to the chat for us to review in the detailed fashion later and cover a little bit now yeah I'll just jump in I saw a question someone asking if this is this is separate",

while you know this final order the council concludes that The Advocate has satisfied the requirements for instruments and the site certificate for the proposed board maintaining weight transmission the Council includes pursuant to RS 469 and 401 a chair can execute the certificate authorizing the applicant to construct operate and retired facilities subject to conditions set forth in the site to become a second I'll circumstances the environment okay we've got a motion in a second um secretary cornet and then also to make sure that I think between probably uh legal counsel that they're comfortable with that um that reflects everything as well okay so let's open it up to the discussion or deliberation this is probably a lawyer question to make sure that not only the material changes but all the editorial changes and the other changes we've talked about today are reflected in underwater so just I don't hopefully meetings um yeah Council councilmember buyer so the motion included material changes and I don't have exactly which I will get but and the changes that were made today okay I guess the question then was do they need to be specifically articulated in the motion itself um certainly it's on the record we have enormative transcript I think it's very clear we had information on the you know on the screen to show what changes were but it's a council would be more comfortable we could make that specific into the motion itself I'm seeing the council agreed that the prepared should reference the changes made today as opposed to eating that specification yes Catholic chocolate your degree he does deliberations my question for Jesse or Patrick is you know I included the findings of reasoning inclusions conditions and conclusions is that enough to fold in the basis for the final order I think he supports that question to Jesse yes it's easier yeah yeah so yes I believe so so what's uh on the table here is essentially everything that is reflected in the draft final um as modified specifically today and I think we have a pretty good sense uh from the combination of the transcript and and uh you know notes as to what those changes are um that the intent of the motion is to reflect that draft final order um which uh I walked through the ultimate findings that were made there in terms of the standard statutes and uh Council statutes and rules and other sources of law um that that has been satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence uh so as far as I'm concerned uh yes counselor Jenkins you captured everything that you needed to any other deliberations all the question I guess some secretary Clinton please call Bro Ken how yes your trip yes and Byron yes and the Jenkins yeah silicon yes very chocolatey yes yes but she carries Mr McDermott um with that now that they've concluded the Boardman to Hemingway agenda item I'll end the meeting back over to chair Graham thank you wow so it's 11 34 I was spent months already for a break at this time um how long would y'all leave we don't have lunch or together so it'd be good for you a couple of comment I'll be late for lunch I think that's I see that because so it is 11 35 of we will be back at 11 45 please the time is now 11 45 this time is reserved for public comment period this has to served for the public to address the council regarding any items in Council jurisdiction that is not otherwise closed for common I don't suppose for comment include the board Vincent Hemingway transmission line proposing orders proposed contestant case order the Nolan Hills proposed order the protected area Scenic resources and recreational resources standards and The Perennial Winchester station proposed retirement plan for those of this person please fill out registration cards available on the table near the entrance to submit to Sarah esterton for those using the WebEx you will need to use the ranger hand feature for those on the phone only you will need to press star 3 which will alert us that we want to see Mr secretary is there anyone in the room that would like to survive public we have an individual who's completing the forms and we'll give her a moment Schwartz Irene Gilbert members in public entrance and uh actually I had a council member state to me that uh that person studying the statutes and paid attention to what they said when making decisions on the Cyber certificates generally and so I would like to just read you some statutes um that in the event that some certificates doctors thought of them they opened councils and stayed up to one being a forest 772.2104 explains the process for determining the minimum payment required in foreign there's a state statute that says a proposed facility shall be found in compliance with Statewide planning goals ors-469503 in the council determines that the facility complies with the substantive criteria from the affected local governments acknowledge comprehensive plan and land use regulations required by the Statewide manuals and in effect when the application is submitted so in other um the county plan must be in compliance with the state statutes regarding a goal such as going forward in order to apply the county rules to decisions about horseback and statutes do specifically designate the amount of compensation that must be awarded by a judge in the invented Forest fund is condemned seconds between that and the fact that there is a different procedure for authorizing the vaccination like across Forest event compared to Agriculture and I'm sure you can see the need for a careful consideration of whether or not the applicant and the application that accurately reflecting the action force plan that's being impacted 169 503 and I'm using State statutes here primarily because in any appeal the state statute is about to primarily want to be a consideration to the courts in order to issue a site certificate the energy facility citing Council shall determine that between preponderance of evidence on the records supports the following conclusions the facility complies with applicable standards adopted by the council in orex 469-501 so the statutes requiring the final to your reapplication to show that they put in five with those neighbors of the the another issue is I believe there may be instances there may have been instances where the council has been asked to approve a goal for exception the course use statute or Google they're in a support case just versus Lynn County 16 or Loop of 74 stated 2009 it says land cannot be removed from vote for protection absent data required by 660-006-0052 and it also provides some statute language so in the event that you're ever asked to allow or approve an exception to Forum for alternate practice which is under the course Practices Act um I'm encouraging to make sure that it is in compliance with that um didn't require the uh also reporting Department of energy rules uh say they shall contact agencies when there's disagreement regarding meetings in the disagreement regarding what the impact or the application of the rules of another agency say so for example if there are disagreements about land use issues what qualifies what doesn't qualify the appropriate procedure is for the Oregon Department of energy to contact LCBC and obtain their opinion regarding whether or not a decision being recommended actually is compliance in compliance with the state land news and it does say that any waiver Allowed by Council cannot cannot wait State Statute so if I would like to provide you've stayed attention that is the final Authority let's see the uh there's also ORS 197.250 which says all comprehensive plans and yet land use regulations adopted by a local government to carry out those comprehensive plans and all plans programs rules or regulations affecting land let's see land use adopted by a state agency or special district shall be in compliance with the goals with one of in one year after the date these goals are approved by lcdc so there is a statute that says we cannot apply and there are multiple Court decisions that think you cannot apply County rules within a year of any state change in the lcdc rules get those local governments are not looking for clients with the state statute there's also a statute rs-527 and I'm I'm not meaning to I I just want you to be really aware of what the actual language of these statutes is because there are multiple Court decisions that say number one um for their statutes and they the courts have to typically provided efforts to an agency interpreting their own rules of statutes but also in order to do an interpretation it's required that the rule of Statute being uncleared and and uh you know the recent uh U.S Supreme Court decision on Kaiser who said philosopher who says that uh in addition any interpretation cannot result in facing surprise to the people who are impacted by it but for instance if you if the council has been using a certain interpretation of the rule and then they they do not have the ability to change that interpretation for what development and then change it back to another like significant problems understand where that kind of appeal of management could occur um the uh It also says in the statute I'm just pulling some things here from my notes regarding potential actions um forests 5G 7 722 restricts local government adoption of any rules regulating Force this statute States local governments cannot adopt any rules regulations or ordinances or take any other actions that prohibit limit regulate subject to approval or in any way effect Forest practices on horselands outside the acknowledged Urban growth boundary so for instance unique how people or any other County cannot have local rules that are not consistent with the staying um I could go on with more but I hope I think that probably enough for right now and I hope you seriously consider whether or not future recommendations coming from the Oregon Department of energy are consistent with the statutes and rules rather than requiring the public to appeal to Oregon Supreme support when the decisions that you make fail to comply with the actual language of the statues submit are required to apply thank you thank you Miss Gilbert are there any other versions of the work wishing to speak and received and no I'm not okay well last call for anyone who's to make comments during this open public comment period those days we will consider the public comment period closed at 11 56. that gets us up to venture yes so we are running early on the agenda lunch is not here yet so if you take a break now we want you to come for um we could uh start and see if we can get through the next

He says the other side. It's across 830. Who did you purchase it from, sir? It's the one in between and it's the one in between the wings and wheels airport. And Mister McGovern. Yeah, he's on the opposite side of Mister McGovernous. So in this general area the airport is. Oh, you see the airport Runway where it says O'Farrell Michael from a scrutiny directly to the right. To the right of that. He's the east of it. How many feet he's away? 2000. 3000? Probably close to 2000. Probably based on the diameter that was indicated earlier. Right? Probably more than that. But I can't. At that shelter that's on baseline, how many. I mean how many dogs y'all currently have? Dogs and cats? Yeah, I think about 300. And so I mean just to speak to some of those, the comments, the cats are inside, right. They're in a conditioned space. Obviously putting some type of filtration system is not only good for the public but it's good for our employees. Right. Because when sound. I know we're addressing the public and we care about what they hear. We want to stop the sound from where it starts, right. We have employees that are in there right next to the dog. So we're going through things that are called, like, no fear. There's different tactics. There's modern technology of trying to reduce that sound before it ever even gets out of that kennel. And so it is partly indoor and outdoor. These are the tip. The design we have right now. They're built in 50 dog pods, and each one has ten dogs per section. So they're sectioned off. So if one barks, you might only get ten barking versus today they can all see each other. One barks, everybody barks. So we're trying to do everything possible just to reduce that sound. What time you put them in? In the evening, like 06:00 or something like that. I'd have to ask Kira, the director, to come up, if you wanted her to come up, talk with me. Usually they inside by five, six pm type. And I would gladly offer because we wanted to have that community meeting. And we really think that it was very positive because everybody got a lot of their anxious questions out. People were like, I want to sell my house. And once they got done, like, all right, maybe I don't now because I thought you were going to move in and do all these big stuff. So I'd gladly offer that up in between the next meeting as well to try to get a hold of everybody and get them out there again. Yeah, absolutely. Kira lynch, director of animal services. I also want to mirror what we're talking about right now. We do have approximately 300 dogs on site. With the expanded programs and services and a little bit more room for our vet clinic. We are extraordinarily hopeful that we're not going to maintain those numbers when we move out there. And the 400 that are mentioned at the moment is the extended build that we were talking about. So we're not building 400 kennels in and day one. So that's way down the line right now. Also, we do have the 58 staff members, but those are 58 staff members that cover seven days a week. So it's not 58 every single day. So one more question. How long the facility is there? How many years at baseline? The one. The one you're talking about here. The new one. The new one? Yes, yes. There's nothing there right now, correct? Just that you're gonna build a brand new one. Yep. The only one that gets on baseline. Okay, so right now it's only one. I had no idea. No problem. I think there was a question about how, what time you put the dogs in, what kind of facility you have, you thinking, I'm sure you are concerned about citizens, so. We absolutely are. And those are the things, that's why we haven't put anything specific in the conceptuals yet, because we are trying to be good neighbors where we are right now, because we're next to the landfill, we leave them in and out, so they have the option to come in and out. But those are all things that are up for debate and depending on the build that we move forward with. I know sound is a huge concern. So we are definitely looking at all the buffers and the aesthetics. We're putting pretty much behind the gorgeous barn that's out there. So that'll be a big buffer all on its own as well. So what is your operation hours like? What time dog goes out and then I have a walk and then you put them back? Because I put, I have two, three dogs. So they have certain time they go inside and certain time they come outside. Yeah. So right now we have staff that are on site that start taking care of them between 730 and 08:00 a.m. and then they're out of there by 05:00 p.m. then you got people coming in for adoptions. They can take them outside, walk with them to see if they're compatible, and then they'll come back in. Yeah. Hours of operation. Right now where we are on baseline is five days a week from 10:00 a.m. to 05:00 p.m. that's what the question was thinking. Yeah. You just wanna know what time everybody. That's what I mean. Everybody goes back in. Yes. So when people come from the work, it's a quiet and it is significantly quieter once everybody goes home. Still a lot of animals. Yes. Yes, it is still a lot of animals. Three acres, a lot of animals. But it's 137 acres. There's no more high acres, you know. Yes. I guess the one thing I want to say to you for the record is, you know, our land development code under a one does allow veterinary with kennels, doesn't allow with outside kennels and where we want to build the hybrid outside kennels. And Kira could probably speak more intelligently than I can about it, but the dogs have a better environment when they have the ability to go. Some dogs like inside. Some dogs like to go outside and see. So that's the reason we're doing it, is to try to calm the dogs and have them have a better environment. Well, the one thing is it's a special use permit. So special use permit. If there is a problem where code enforcement is being called in because you're not taking care of the noise level or the odors, they can pull that special use permit. So you have to be good neighbors. Absolutely. Yeah, I just want to bring that out so everybody actually hears that loud and clear. By it being a special use permit, it is an extremely helpful, it's a great zoning for it to be there to have a special use permit. Because if they do not abide by keeping the odor down, keeping the noise down, they will lose that special use permit. And Ken, could you go into that a little bit? Just explain a little bit about the special use permit, would you mind? And as I had mentioned before, Mister chairman, that's exactly why this is going through as a special use permit and not as a solicitation to rezone. We didn't think that was suitable for the area. Everything, this is an a one rural parcel. Everything around this is a one rural. As I mentioned before, government uses are allowed anywhere, under any zoning, anywhere in the county for any purpose. We didn't think that would be suitable in this location. Berrien county wants to be accountable for their own actions, their own facilities. That is why this is going under a special use permit. Exactly like you just mentioned. There's a level of accountability that has to be maintained with the maintenance of a special use permit. There will be phases to this. This area will expand. But we are looking at the long term right now on what we where what has been requested. 100,000 sqft might not be. That probably won't be that from what we've been instructed, but we're looking at that there is a legal aspect to the special use permit. If you violate these conditions, there is a legal recourse for that. That special use permit can go away. When you rezone something, you don't have the option to take it away. This allows a level of, I wouldn't say scrutiny, but monitoring by just regular citizens. If this special use permit is approved, Marion county has to adhere to the conditions that are installed specifically for this use at this location. Thank you. Thank you, Ken. Okay, we're going to bring it back to the board and bring it for discussion. It makes sense to me right now. They're on three acres and it's a special use permit. So that layer of protection is there? Absolutely. If they don't hold up to it, then they'll lose it. So I think you're making a motion then, yes, I am. I knew you were. Yeah. I, Jerry Lorenko, agree with staff's finding and recommendation. And hereby recommend approval of the special use permit based on the following findings of foundation. Is consistent with the LDC section 282 D and is consistent with Marion county comprehensive plan. Mister Lorenko. And that's the special use permit with the conditions as outlined by staff? Yes, ma'am. Thank you. I have a motion. Do I have a set any honor? Second. The",

Graphics if you have to take trucks and drive them 60 miles to go activate something it takes a long time and it can make the PSP PSPs well Cindy bar for gonna be long no matter what because we have to patrol everyone in the industry shape from having one yeah because if they're Patrol everything because you turn the power off you can't just turn it back down without starting at the you know the Inner Line and working your way out and energizing as you go because for all you know the tree came down because everything was off you didn't get a notice that there's no one's fall there and you re-energized the power outage online then you you've had the issue you were trying to put so this is one way to kind of help you manage with PSPs is better than also just manager system and provide more that's a big big problem we're working on I think also the increase data through our assistant users like Phil said more more information we can tell specifically okay if a tree hit from this point down versus uh some of the blood and some of the broader monitoring that we do we can tell that a tree hit a beater with our current status system but the the deeper we can get the the more isolated we can isolate where a problem is you know a lot faster and I think particularly Wildfire but it doesn't really have to be Wildfire anytime you have more information that fills that down faster basic faster response to the area where it is maybe you should stop in a fire before it gets going uh and you you've been dispatched a lot quicker the alphages are shorter just gives you so much more information and uh it gives you uh also the ability to change fees in certain circumstances and and do things that uh shorten that out jump even further than it could be because they know

to be working if to not contribute to any any sort of uh you know I was trying to learn yeah we're not doing that that's a great example and it seems like one but then the sort of funding window that you all are bringing a third batch and this program will bring a few hundred thousand dollars but in the following a very little difference be a difference major for us it would it could be a difference for the we can't afford to wait always on funding but I'm doing this at how I was getting out from the state and the federal government helps us offsets on these costs for rate of interest whether they're gonna Cooperative ionu municipality we're all set and it all ends up coming down to how much electricity costs yeah and you know helping to kind of Stave off those rated for instance is beneficial for everyone because then the Raiders have more money it's better for the Department because I don't want to spend on other things or they have money for food for gas or those kinds of things so we're trying to be very conscious about this here you know just kind of piggybacking I think some of the the projects are not going to be like the sexy sort of Odo Community renewable grant program type projects that are really you know flashy and you know lenses laters get excited about I think they're going to be examples like that's just been given um and I hope that Odo will keep that in mind as you're reviewing and and categorizing these things is that a lot of these are kind of bread and butter things that are expensive um for rate payers um even just these fuses I mean if you put in in a large section these one shot they're very very expensive and and I it's my understanding that they're you have to get rid of them after they're yeah yeah some of them but then there's also the real closures we put it all over the place because the goal was always reliability and the utility industry we've probably we have I know only gotten better at maintain air resistance turning right was but the environment has changed around on us we've got more fuel than we've ever had it's drier and hotter people can argue about what causes it doesn't matter sometimes it's here um so we have to we have to think about things that we put them up to do this in so that oh if we lose this there's only five people from them well now we have to think about I like that fuse there and that was part of our Fusion study we wanted to look at every single news and design and we looked at fire danger or that location and decided I'm just taking nothing it's too dangerous to have there what we'll do is we'll put the current limiting to reclos are farther up so it may affect more people but it's safer in the long run and there's less likely to get a proper damage so sometimes and resiliency but not the same thing and then also as you as you as you reduce your liability it's almost unfortunately proportional to your reliability to degree because and it's very hard for us it's not intuitive for people in the utility business our full focused 24 7 all times keep the lights on always well it was really hard for us when we started talking about PSP I suppose I about Public Safety Powershell and then you you you can get it you can learn more and then you know the paradise fire happened and some of these other things happen you know as well and members have a hard time we have livestock and diabetic medicine and all those other things very useful and Powerful maternity power on purpose for 8 hours it's good for you at the time maybe torches so explain I think that the more we can explain that and why and it's very helpful but it is what it is it's reality that's what we're all going to do it's not really it is to there's always worry about liability to put your own by consumers it's their luck there are they're really exciting and legislators do get really excited about but I think one thing to connect with what you're saying on this idea of community benefit is helping us think through how to define that Community benefit as it relates to what we just described a wood pole with a steel hole I think it comes down to outcomes so a community might be very excited about the benefit of having the power on for longer or mitigating some of that historical outage so they're they're interested in that outcome and so communities that maybe are not you know versed in the utility business will feel excited about a poll being replaced but they would be excited I think about the benefit of that outcome of having massages or having more power availability but I think we're going to need some help in figuring out how to define that in in a way that's um translatable for the legislature into other votes just to pop on that I I think that's a really tough problem that you just described because if you put in solar installation and you can point out look we generated 20 000 kilowatt hours if you never have an outage you don't realize that you didn't have enough knowledge right so it was really tough to make that point and to make it to make it sexy or whatever the term is you want you know it's tough because you have something that you can actually point at on one and like if we're successful and we mitigate our and then there's there was no fire because of something that we did you never get to prove that it's perfect there's a negative yeah yeah so it's it's a tough problem I think but truthfully if we're going to do our job right it really gosh I hate saying we can't really worry about what we're trying to sell we got to worry about the actual thing that we're trying to do we're trying to mitigate fire then you know let's do the things that mitigate fire and if there happens to be less buyers then hopefully we know we're right but we'd be hard to prove that to the public that's like a good way to help message this program like in the PSPs events were devastated and many people but it gives us a very real points in recent history to say and you know that asterisk uh microgrid was all about scaring this to these bread and butter facilities Red Heart projects and we've already defined all the benefits of solar Microsoft program now we're focusing on this grid of our names so I think that'll be a key part of our best experience leveraging the PSPs and um so yeah thanks for that example I know that we had some other folks who were lined up to share um I think the next Slide the kind of my follow-up on that so it is and I just wanted to say too I don't think we've gotten any questions in the chat that I've seen But if there is anyone virtually wanted to comment on that discussion just a minute obviously sure there's been a lot of good conversation about CBI and some of some of the recent work yeah what CBI yeah Community benefit indicators indicator yeah so the Public's Utility Commission recommends utilities adopt one CBI for each of the following topic areas resiliency health and Community well-being environmental impacts energy Equity economic benefits so just alignment between these and then what the program priorities are for burgers Lane system there's been some conversation around that but yeah if anybody would like to come off from you um you're welcome to raise your hand and provide feedback virtually as well still Public Power or the investor and Utilities Fall um for large retailers we said it is the three items plus give it to one essay and Retail Academy West is that it depends still particularly something I think it's interesting something can you take Christina off mute for an opportunity to win it's beginning to wonder if it was functioning can you hear me clearly yes hi Christina hi this is Christina Medina calling in from Pacific Court thanks for the opportunity to kind of be in this space with you um we're very enthusiastic about any conversations around Community benefits particularly when we're talking about finding opportunities to calibrate and reach shared understanding um around them so you know I put in the chat some reference",

        "text": " Maine have also have who also have a Statewide utility program administer are using a similar structure to implement these programs in their state as well once the programs launch oo will continue to work in close collaboration with our implementers to ensure that the programs are running eff efficiently and that we continue to meet all of our program requirements and goals so next slide please so we uh wanted to give you an idea of our overall timeline although the projected dates to begin issuing rebates is still uncertain uh we wanted to share with you some of the major Milestones that we're going to have to pass along the way so right now Odo is developing the first part of our application to us doe which is due as Emily said in January of 2025 that we intend to submit at the end of this month while we wait for USD to review and approve that submission we're going to continue to develop a lot of the details that we've been discussing today through what usdoe is calling the blueprint um this is going to describe how the programs will actually operate all the nitty-gritty details who will do what all of that so once we are close to finalizing that plan we'll schedule and host another public webinar to share more of the details about the proposed technical requirements and how different entities will apply for and receive rebates for both programs uh as we develop these final plans we're going to be working simultaneously to issue the RFP to bring on an entity to issue rebates and coou and Idaho Power service areas and to finalize and formalize our proposed relationship with etto to issue rebates to customers and IOU service areas another big step in the process is developing or procuring the systems that we need to operate the programs as I mentioned this includes everything from the rebate reservation and processing system to systems for income verification systems for data collection management validation contractor training education Outreach installation procedures project auditing program auditing processes for home assessments and energy modeling and more as stated previously oo plans to issue an RFP to find a contractor to help us build these systems and so once that work is completed and usoe has approved our implementation plan and we have all of our systems built out our implementers will be able to begin issuing rebates to customers so we have a lot to do before homes in here are ready for prime time we've been pursuing an aggressive timeline to try to begin issuing rebates as quickly as possible with a goal of beginning to issue rebates under the he program by late 2024 however it is likely that the earliest rollout dates especially for the homes program are probably not going to be until early 2025 so as you can see these programs have a lot of complex components and requirements so we can't really accurately predict um how things will shake out and most of these tasks have to happen in a very specific order and are subject to both usco and other state approvals that have timelines that we at Odo just don't control so but regardless of the time frame we're going to continue to provide updates through our list serve on our website and on the programs frequently asked questions document and uh yeah we're going to be working hard to ensure that everybody who's interested in participating is going to be well prepared before we launch so if there are no questions I will turn it over to Christy split our government relations coordinator but I suspect there might be questions there there might be but I think what I'll do is just do my one slide and then we'll be into Q&amp;A anyway so let's just do that okay chrisy split everybody hi I'm Christie I already talked without introducing myself um I'm our government relations coordinator but I also do a fair amount of other work at the agency including working as one of the team members here on the home Energy rebates team and I'm really excited because when we turn in the application later this month for the homes and here program I will be turning my attention to or actually even sooner turning my attention to the One-Stop shop and um many of you may remember that in House Bill 3630 the agency was directed to create a single resource to provide interested persons information technical assistance and assistance in identifying contractors and financing options related to available Energy Efficiency incentives and programs so not just about homes in here but broadly about the types of programs that could provide increased Energy Efficiency for homes and that includes those programs but also lots of other programs too this all kind of Rose from realizing that there are a lot of programs that can be kind of braided or put together as we've talked about today in order to create a maximum benefit for for folks that are looking to make these upgrades so with all of that said um I just wanted to make sure that folks knew we were still working on on that but it's still on our radar our goal is to have this single resource which we view as a website to start with and hope over time to build out into do something more um and so um so we'll be working on that starting now we just hired the staff member that we have to help us with the it part of this work so anyway more to come on this but just didn't want people to think we'd forgotten about it or that we weren't working on it um in fact we are and are getting ready to really get down to it so expect there will probably be a chance for folks gather to help us build um the best One-Stop shop we can for the state of Oregon um in the near future and with that um we can go to the next slide thanks will so um really we we already have heard a lot of qu questions from you all we also are totally open to comments um and so um like I said before you can raise your hand if you want to talk to us that's great if you want to go in the chat that's fine too it's a little bit more exciting for me and then um we can go to the next slide and just some questions to sort of like frame up our conversation what else do you want to hear from us what other questions do you still have and what else do you think we need to consider as we finalize the design of these programs really we didn't want to have us turn our application in later this month without another chance to hear from you all and talk with you about our plans but as you heard we'll do another conversation too down the road um as the details get sorted so we already had some questions in the chat um as I mentioned um I would kind of ask Neil's last question and then move on so um we have a question from Gregory could funding for these programs be cut by a future Congress Emily here yeah I'll jump in here this is a fun one um yeah you know we we never know what the political landscape is going to look like um you know months from now um and what Congress will choose to do you know what they did with the IRA is they budgeted These funds to the US Department of energy um and once they're budgeted then then through the process of applying and negotiating an assistance agreement with the Department of energy is how they'll be legally um committed to us so once they're obligated to us it's kind of a legally binding agreement um and and I think that it would be very very hard for them to claw them back but that's again another reason why we are really trying to be on on the f track and one of the very first states to be applying for both the homes and the here program um at the end of this month because once we have those agreements in place I think that it'll be much more difficult for the funds to be clawed back I hope helps great thanks Emily um charity wanted to know when Justice when we mentioned justice 40 communities in Portland do you mean justice 40 census tracks and yes that's the way that the justice 40 Map works um and then let's see um unless somebody else disagrees with me I think that's an easy one um Alex wants to know is it not in the statute that it cannot exceed 80% cost for homes program and is Oregon planning to supplement to close that Gap yeah I can answer that question so yes the federal outline initially limited the homes program to 80% of the project costs for low income but it does include an opportunity for the state to increase that for the lowincome only um so we are proposing that we do increase that to uh allow for project costs up to 100% um for the homes program acknowledging that even bumping the cap up to 10,000 is unlikely to cover the full cost of the projects um but we are are actively working on braiding programs together um to deliver projects um especially in the low income space uh to ensure that the the maximum benefit is being offered to those that couldn't otherwise afford the up grades let's see um uh for other energy programs P mson has seen that the contractor costs I'm sorry if you guys can hear crying my kids came home and wanted to see me and I closed the door and now one of them is like moaning outside I'm hoping that WebEx is like keeping it down anyway um for anyway uh for other energy programs I've seen that the contractor costs have increased when the rebates are included how do we make sure that they don't do this here I understand some increase due to modeling requirements that is one issue that's been identified in the application that we is something that we're going to have to monitor and consider as we Implement these programs so we will be coming up with a plan for okay um what does implementer mean they going to issue actual funds or program manage and what is their capacity or limits yeah so we're still hammering out all the details for our implementers but the idea is the implementers would broadly be responsible for reviewing and approving projects and issuing actual funds um the extent to which they're managing the programs all of that is going to be ironed out uh as we um as we make those agreements let's see um but I do think the General Vision is like that's who you would go to for the program or what it's worth I think that may be helpful just frame of reference they'd be the ones writing the checks I think is what we imagine right I think we envision a centralized location for people to go but the um yeah but who would be managing your project would be",

        "text": " one, making a better educated decision, no matter what happens. So I would like. That's why I said I would like to move the special use, do the study, and figure out, can we have victory here? Can we be a great neighbor? If we can't, that's fine. I completely understand. We move to the next option. But I'm not willing to throw away a gift to the taxpayers without doing the right study to make the best decision, in my opinion. So I think, Commissioner Zalig, the comments that you just made are so profound. Of agreeing for a special use permit does not mean it moves forward. I mean, we build it does not mean that the building happens, but it does mean that we continue to at least explore what would it look like, and we get those sound studies, whether it goes on this property or anyplace else, because we're going to have to put it somewhere in Marion county. It's not like we can ship our dogs out or our cats out of the county like we do our garbage today. Why don't you just table it, then? Why would you pass it? We have to pass it. We have to pass it. Well, why do we have to pass it? Because the property is lost. Because it's the contract, isn't it? Commissioner, is there an agreement that would allow us to consider, the board to consider this up to the end of this month? We can request an extension. I don't know if they would be willing to extend it or nothing, what the agreement was. Will you get this information back by that time? No. Would like to speak. Well, so, under the agreement, if we fail to develop the property as a animal shelter, then there's a right of reverter in the agreement and it will revert back to the Robert. So if we don't. So from that perspective, if we, if you all approve the special use permit today, go through the studies and you can't meet the criteria that you specify, we'll just revert back to the Roberts. But we still gave, we still at least tried to execute the opportunity. That's true. Right. I'm just, I'm in favor of trying to, if you approve the special use permit, you either feel like it's a good piece of property to do this or not. I don't understand that. But in all actuality, if we approve this, if you approve this special use permit, you are saying we are going to move forward with this? Pretty much. We're saying, I can't spend one penny without your guys's approval on the next po, you know how this works, right? Out, us approving this special use permit? Can we not really? I mean, we'd be wasting money. And here's why. No, according to commissioner Zalick, we need these studies for wherever we. But again, if we don't pass the special use permit by the 30th, then we don't have the property. I understand that. But, so, so then we are telling our donor that, yes, we're approving the special use permit, but it's going to be based on what we find, find out. The studies say, wouldn't that be the fact, no matter what, that would be correct. She can get it back if it doesn't work, right? If it doesn't work, we're going to, we're going to give it back if it works. Well, very honestly, I thought the hearing tonight was going to be to bring information forward to make a decision or not. Right. I'm making my decision based on the information here tonight. If you wanted to do that mitigation study, you should have done it ahead of time. Absolutely. So I would say then this would be where I believe. If it's meant for that, then we get the excess time from the donor to allow us to really get an answer on this property. So with that, I will vote no on the special use permit today because I believe we can go back or I will, I will just pause a minute and say, would you all agree then that we table it and if it get, if it gets tabled, we go forward with the study and the donor agrees to give us the excess time to get the study, then that's a better plan. All the way around. I just don't think it's the right place. I'm a. No. No matter what the studies. Yeah, I don't think it's the right place. I don't think. I think that the property is a lot, and I think that it's going to be a lot for us to take care of. I don't think it's in the right place. And I do think that we will be harming the, especially the adjacent property owners. Is there any other new comments that we haven't talked about, chairman? If we can do a motion to table it, then I'll support that. We can make a motion. It needs to be a specific period of time. Okay, then I'll step forward. No, and I'm. Thank you, Commissioner McLean. I make a motion to move that we table this item until the studies come back and that date certain is on how soon we get those studies back to tell us whether or not we can mitigate the sound for the neighbors so that they will be protected from hearing barking dogs. How long does that take? I need to talk to the consultants, see what their availability is. I mean, that's one of the things I was going to mention earlier is if we don't have a design, that study's not going to be accurate. Right. So we still have to go back and do finish exact, exactly how those buildings are going to look like, what the kennels are going to look like. Right. The different properties. If we combine some properties we've looked at, we couldn't have detached kennels because of the compactness of the. We have a conceptual drawing here, and that's exactly what I would ask that you utilize to talk to the consultants to determine whether or not we can mitigate the sound. That's. Is there any. Whether or not we know you're out? No. You made a motion, right? I did. Second. And we've got a second. Okay. To. For. Until the study comes back. Well, we don't know how soon, so. Yes, sir. Until the study comes back. So that may be 90 days, that may be six months. We don't know what the consultant. You can give me a goal and we can push the consultant to do that, but I'm not sure what that level of cost. I would like it by year end. I mean, that's 90 days to be able to do that. If we're going to do that, is there any opportunity to look at the value effect on the properties? No, my motion, I mean, the noise isn't the only issue. That's involved. Well, yeah, that is what we can do all those other things too, right? But the motion is mostly about the noise. But we can do all those other things, too. Well, I just want to include it in the motion. They don't know what. They don't have their marching orders except for noise ordinance. Study the value commission. You. You are talking about the impact on the value of the adjacent properties. Yeah, I mean, what are you going to get a real estate appraiser to try to stay the freezer? You've mitigated the sound. The sound being the issue. Okay, well, we got a motion. That's why we pass it. Give ourselves the time to do the study. Mister chair? Yeah. What other option for consideration? It may seem similar, but you can withdraw to give you withdraw the application to give yourself more time to consider it. Either way, you'd have to go back to Miss Roberts whether you table it or withdraw. So if you withdraw it, then you can take however much time you need to to do this evaluation. But you're going to have to go back to Miss Roberts either way. But that's all. Continuation will give us the same thing. Yeah, it will. It would not continue into a date specific. When it's ready, we will advertise it and bring it back to the board when we have the information. If that's what you wanted to do. Well, that's where I'm at. The motion is whether we continue it, table it, date uncertain, until we have evidence that we can make a good, sound decision on this property. Second. A motion? A second. Let's call it. Okay. Is there any discussion on the motion? All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed like sign aye. So that passes three to two. There you go. Move the ordinance, mister chair. Yeah, one other thought about that. I mean, looking at these. These cases. Some of the cases deal with the specifics of having the animals in internal facilities as opposed to being outside. So I don't know that you necessarily have to do it here based on what you did, but obviously, if you're going to consider that, it's going to be more expensive, but that would affect whatever study you're going to have. So maybe you need to decide that before you direct the consultant on which way he's going to go. I'm not sure if I have enough education on that type of facility, but in between now and then, I'll definitely do some research. Right. I think. I mean, from the sound study perspective, though, they can bring us back. We know what it will be if we put it indoors. Right. And we'll know what it's going to be if we have the setup that we are asking for today. So we'll have both options in front of us when Jared comes back with the sound study. All right, so what just happened? There was a vote",

and and processes and whatnot so um really appreciate you serving in this role and it's just been such a change over the last year to have that leaz on position so thank you so much for for making that possible well thank you I really enjoy it all right well thank you for sticking around and I I hope your next event goes just as well thank you see you all later have a good evening bye-bye all right let's move into our board items and presentation so our first one is developers proposal to construct a portion of a street within the Hazel Green Road Park property Rob think we're Shing it over to you yeah thanks shared mcdal um Rob remac Park planning manager go ahead and share the screen so everyone can look at what I'm gonna up on this computer okay uh tonight I'm here to talk to you about a an IEX isped by by a development proposal that the city has been uh the city has received uh for a land use application and this is a development adjacent to the um excuse me for a second here adjacent to our Hazel Green Road property so here on the screen is a map of the city I'm just going to orientate everyone to the location we're talking about tonight where I'm zoom in here in the Northeast and although it does not show on the city's base map this large property here right here is owned by the City of Salem as a future Park property held in reserve we call it the hael Green Road property a couple other things I want to mention about the development of the site before I get into the details of the development proposal is Hazel Green Road is designated as a Parkway and uh what that means for the development of the park is we cannot take Direct direct driveway access off of that street we there's rules about new driveways and and we just like any other developer will not be able to have a driveway directly off of the street so we need a public Street off of that street to access to provide access to the park in the future there exists to the South uh some multif family housing and some single family housing and between those two there are two streets stubbed to both our property and our neighbors property that is uh Courtside Street Northeast and lunar Drive Northeast so so here I'm putting these are the two stubs last thing I'm going to highlight is when the SE comes in to develop the site as a park just like any other developer we'll be required to do Boundary Street improvements and that includes improvements to Hazel Green Road which is underdeveloped so we'll have to dedicate some of the park property for those Street improvements the street will have to be wider we'll have to have sidewalks and we'll have to we'll have to designate that area over to to the uh Street as part of the development of the site now that kind of context I'm GNA switch over to uh some of the plans that have been submitted by the developer and so here we are now orientated yourself again here is the north Arrow so North is to the left on this image this is the city park right here um and the property line is right here where my cursor is and here is the development site the developer is proposing to extend lunar drive through their site and uh realigning the street pretty abruptly and then the center line of the street would be the current property line between the two properties and then also so the the hashed area here both on Hazel Green Road and for the future proposed extension of lunar drive would become dedicated public rway it would be developed as streets that's the developers proposal here um I'm going to share you some other sheets in a second but I just want to stop there and and just say that from staff perspective we're looking for support tonight uh to support for this development proposal um because one of those streets does have to be extended to Hazel Green and we need access for our future development and quite frankly the developer is giving up more land than us and they're also required to develop what's called a three quarter Street Improvement uh and so they will be developing not just their half but slightly part of the street that's on would be the city's portion as this is the just I'm GNA I this is an engineering plan and I know you may not be used to looking at it so I do apologize but I'm just this is what they're proposing here is a is a development what when when I mean three quarter Street Improvement the quarter that's missing is the sidewalk on our side um so they would develop the sidewalk on their side the street and then here you can see they developing storm water facilities to treat the runoff on the street and so a portion of that Improvement would would be on the city's property under their proposal um here is a crosssection that I will Zoom attempt to zoom in on so right here this this Center Line is the current property line again they would develop a sidewalk the planting strip the curb um a travel Lane another travel Lane and a curve but then not the other sidewalk on this on on the Future property can I can I clarify so you're saying there would never be another sidewalk or that would be up to the city to this is this is what the developer would provide as part of the conditioner lanes and then when we come in we would we would install that sidewalk at a later time so the goal ultimately would be two sidewalks that's correct and likely they would plant Street trees on their side but not on our side until and we would do that at a subsequent time so I'm going to keep my presentation short and just open it up for questions but again I I'm looking for support um and if I can suggest a motion I can do that as well tonight but happy to answer any questions I have a quick question on um you mentioned the The Boundary Street requirement where is that dictated is that like transportation system plan is that how is that in terms of what has to be there of sidewalks you know are there bike lane additions are there width Lanes things like that yeah um the standards are set in the transportation system plan but the the actual requirement for the city to or for any developer to to actually Implement those improvements are in code they're in the city's Revised Code as part of the unified development code and so when the city comes in uh for L our land use approval we would they would the city would tell itself you know it's kind of awkward situation but these are required improvements that have to be components of your project are there is there room for bike Lanes in those I'm just thinking about like you know future Mobility things our Salem other tsp considerations happening right now and knowing when this would get built it's always good to try and include room for bike Lanes if possible curious how that's built Hazel Green Road I'm pretty confident we'll have bike Lanes as part of the standard Street section that would be required um lunar drive here is a local Street and bike lanes are not are not typically provided on local okay I think Debbie came off mute for Debbie did you have a question yeah I had two questions uh one is how many acres is the park and um ALS Al the development is that for housing or is that uh commercial or what what are they putting in there um as I recall the the the park property is 45 acres and the development proposal is for multif family housing apartments and I I recall it's over 400 units is is this the park where they're going to put baseball fields in that we're talking about possibly yes we we have not completed a master plan yet but um there's been a lot of discussion about this being a great site for a oo separate question when you're ready go ahead Al the developer Street going north bends to the left and creates a bit of a segment a triangular area on the corner of their property separated from the main section what is the plan for that little segment that triangular segment cut off on their property yeah I'll share my screen here again I think it's on the south west Corner if I have my directions right oh I see some parking here you here you can see there there's a an building and parking okay they're goingon to use it I I just was wondering about that thank you you bet and and again I while here I'll highlight you see the uh this would where where the parks property uh uh it's no longer Park property so you see they are selling sidewalks at that point I think it would sure look nicer if it was consistently done all the way through but then you know that would mean we the city would have to pay for the sidewalks the same time that other one gets done oh well what is the time lag probably like in terms of when do we get developed on the city Side after the um I I think the city could do it at any time I think it would be better if master plan was was completed first um but you know if if funds were identified the project could move forward at any time that's the sidewalk in Phill um yeah I think I'll leave it there so it would probably is that the kind of thing that would then become a CIP project other things like that most likely so it it would probably be several years now yes is there any possibility I mean just to Alice point about sidewalks I know in West Salem that's always an issue where you have like one side Sidewalk and no on the other is that something where there's additional there's pots of money that would be sidewalk specific the city could tap into I'm asking a lot of questions I'm just curious um typically no there's not another source of funding the the sidewalk is a is a park development costs okay so you know we think about um D Street Park uh we the first thing did after we acquired the property was put sidewalks at the city's park at SDC Parks expense um Fairview Park um we have the improvements that have occurred that that site are primarily Boundary Street improvements so we completed sidewalks around the site and that's all come out of sdc's very good question",

think that's appropriate yeah okay this is hamley any other question or any questions we're to the if we do what we've been doing on in the past we won't continue we'll go ahead and do a a straw poll on r2 it's just this part of r2 right yeah just this exception right yeah i think i i'd like to do that keep them okay so i did better talked about the uh expanded distance for the age frames was there uh agreement that council wanted to include that and make that a representation of that condition yes i'm seeing enough head done okay so then agree with finding the fact conclusions of law and conditions of approval in the proposed contested case order pertaining to issue r2 with the following again general concept hold the applicant to the representation to require the expanded distance for the shorter h-frame towers adjacent or in proximity to morgan lake and then we'll get the actual language for that when we write the draft final order which will be the mile post yeah okay sounds good okay and buyer perry choctoote cindy condon hanley jenkins ken howe jordan truett yes thank you council members council rat clef i guess we move to r4 okay so issue r4 we have one limited party lois berry the issue statement is whether the applicant's visual impact assessment for morgan lake park adequately evaluates visual impacts to the more than 160 acres of undeveloped park land and natural surroundings as visual simulations were only provided for high use areas so the hearing officer's opinion on this uh the hearing officer concluded that uh the applicant's supplemental analysis uh of morgan lake park adequately evaluated the proposed project's visual impacts in the undeveloped areas of the park and in the preceding issue we heard a little bit about the extra analysis that was done through the course of the the contest the hearing officer also found that a preponderance of evidence establishes that all the though the park will result in long-term visual impacts of varying intensity within the park these visual impacts will not preclude visitors from engaging in recreational opportunities and the parks impacts will be less the project's impacts to the park will be less than significant so that's all i have on this one and it's time for oral argument from miss berry miss barry you can come on up you skipped um issue r3 yeah okay so i just wanted you to know that there's going to be more after this well when i wrote issue r4 the applicant had provided only eight photos taken from the boat dock parking area as their visual impact assessment of a 204 acre city park furthermore they provided no data for determining high use clearly judge webster's decision to accept that visual impact assessment should be reversed based on that initial meager effort idaho power concluded that quote although the project will introduce moderate contrast to the landscape it will not preclude visitors from enjoying the day use area and overnight facilities offered at morgan lake park applicants exception now argues that visitors need only engage in recreational opportunities but enjoying is the term in their asc that's page 155 of exhibit t you could engage in mud wrestling or skydiving but it's not like sitting alone for an hour in the quiet enjoying the sight of ducks swimming through yellow water lilies on little morgan lake in addition to developed day use areas natural areas of the park are other day that hikers and birders tend to avoid the developed areas scenery is recognized as an important aspect of recreation enjoyment of recreation in the park will definitely be precluded by the line of nine 130-foot transmission towers marring the views from the park's natural areas idaho power claims that only 16 of the park is natural i would say quite the reverse the lakes are natural and unless an area in the park is accessible by car it is natural that's more than 75 of the park this year's analysis admits the pro this year's analysis admits the project's impact on the park is high because towers would not be screened by vegetation as was previously claimed nevertheless still using the skewed definition of user perception looking head on or peripherally applicant concluded no surprise there would be less than significant impact visitors to the park words and logic matter it would be clear by now that the visual impact analysis for the mill creek and morgan lake roots is worse than inadequate it is deceptive thank you miss barry any questions from thank you thank you good afternoon council members again for the record this is jocelyn peace for idaho power company um in her exceptions filing ms barry argues that the hearing officer had dismissed her concerns about idaho power's analysis of impacts to morgan lake park but that is not true ms berry raised concerns that idaho power had not adequately assessed impacts to undeveloped areas and idaho power then addressed those concerns by providing additional analysis of impacts to the entire park this type of process is what the contested case is for folk the limited parties get to raise issues and idaho power has an opportunity to respond and provide additional analysis and address those concerns and that is exactly what's happened here and while miss berry will will seek to go back and criticize what idaho power put into the initial application idaho power has since responded to the concerns that have been raised and provided a more complete analysis including the undeveloped areas of the ms barry had also made a comment that idaho power had asserted that only 16 percent of the park is natural that comment seems to misunderstand idaho power's analysis instead what idaho power demonstrated is that there's only 16 of the park that would from which uh the project facilities would be visible it's a question not of what area is natural or what what's not or what's developed recreation instead it's a question of the view shed and are barriers such as trees or topography that would block the view of the project ms barry had also made a comment about language in the in the hearing officer's regarding engaging versus enjoying a resource and on that point miss berry is correct that idaho power's initial analysis referred to the enjoyment of recreational opportunities rather than engagement but regardless of the word that's used idaho power's analysis provides ample evidence that the impacts will be less than significant and for that reason ms barry's exception does not identify any error in the proposed contested case order and idaho power respectfully requests that this council affirm the hearing officer's conclusions in connection with r4 thank you thank you miss pease any questions from okay thank you council road the department doesn't really have any comments on this we agree with the comments that ms p's just made we don't see any error in the hearing officer's on issue r4 okay so we're and i are there any changes needed we ready to have a straw poll uh councillor condon cindy conan and this might be for miss peace but um in the um contested case and the alj's and it's talking about idaho power statement the company determined that viewer perception quote viewer perception will range from low to high throughout morgan lake park unquote and that because of this range quote viewer perception for the park as a whole will be medium unquote and i just want to ask so medium in idaho power's analysis would not be uh that's correct okay just it's language that thank you okay with that i believe secretary cornett we're ready for straw poll you can give us the language specific to issue r4 agree with the findings of fact conclusions of law and conditions of approval in the proposed contested case order pertaining to issue r4 ann buyer henley jenkins jordan truett cindy condon yes with some reservation i mean i do think um that public perception could be better analyzed but yes perry choctoot ken howe yes thank you council members council ratcliffe we're ready for all right so r3 is uh limited party is also ms the issue statement is whether the mitigation proposed to minimize the visual impacts of the proposed facility structures at morgan lake park park in parentheses a hundred thousand dollars for recreational facility is insufficient because the park's remote areas will not benefit from the proposed mitigation a hearing officer concluded that the funds paid to the city of le grand the hundred thousand dollars are not intended to mitigate for the proposed facility's visual impacts at morgan lake park rather the funds are intended for recreational improvements as mitigation for potential impacts to the park as a recreational resource recommended recreation condition number one provides the mitigation for visual the hearing officer also found that the memorandum of agreement between idaho power and the city of legrand is a matter outside of the citing process and therefore outside the council's jurisdiction and scope of review and that because the memorandum of agreement is not intended as mitigation for visual impacts it's immaterial whether the park's remote areas will benefit from these funds and that's the summary of the hearing officer's opinion and so ms barry can provide her oral argument idaho powers first extensive survey of morgan lake park identified the 67 acre morgan lake as the entire 204 acre park of course they missed the remote areas of the park altogether the remote area still had not been analyzed when the proposed order stated in 2020 that with appropriate mitigation there would be no significant impact on visitors to the park this january just before cross applicants expert witness provided a supplemental analysis of the park she admitted that the remote areas of the park would be highly impacted the four proposed 150 foot towers would be replaced with 13 130 foot towers most with no vegetative screening judge webster aired in citing the supplementary analysis and proposed mitigation as convincing evidence of no significant impact on park visitors the applicant is careful to mention lower towers but not that they have tripled the number of towers impacting the park's remote southwestern view shed this is not appropriate mitigation these remote areas with natural scenery are highly prized and to have such fantastic open views of distant miles of rolling hills available within a five-minute drive from town and a 15-minute hike in the park is a priceless opportunity the remote areas of the park will not benefit from the proposed mitigation they will be destroyed by it if the line were needed the only reasonable mitigation is to bury the portions of the",

Jacqueline Jones Jaclyn can you hear us yes good morning chair Harrington and Washington County Commissioners my name is Jackie Dyke Jones I am a steward of the land and fourth generation farmer and also board member of Farmland first I farm in North plains Roy and Banks would like to take a moment to um share a couple statistics about our farmland every day 2 000 Acres of American Farmland is lost but in Washington County Farmland is disappearing extremely rapidly in just five years 23 percent of our Farmland was converted to other uses in comparison 24 of Farmland across all Oregon was lost over 60 years this is so sad I'm looking at the priorities for Washington County and I see that there is great intentions for livability sustainability and taking care of everyone in efficient my ask today is for you to deeply reflect on the North Plains Urban growth boundary expansion that you will be presented to later today every single picture in their slide Deck shows you agriculture every single one they're going to explain the process I've been to many of the North Plains they are staff LED few North Plains residents with the perception that everything is just going to get passed anyway North Plains residents have been silenced I look forward to collecting signatures for the referendum so that the people can show North Plains in Washington County that they do not want to double in size that they do want to protect our highest class soils for our future thank you for valuing Oregon agriculture and your family farmers thank you very much and I don't see any other hands Jared and thank you clerk Moss I also want to highlight that in the back of the room oh my background is fuzzy so you can't really tell there are these information cards just highlighting uh

zero I just can't get the words out of my mouth fast enough next we have some presentations we are really proud of the achievement as you may know we are the Washington County Board of Commissioners we're also the board of directors for clean water services our waste water and Recovery utility here in Washington County we're really proud of how all the employees of Clean Water Services strives to do a marvelous job each and every day to care for our community but also to ensure that we are restoring clean water to our Tualatin River and taking good care of the Tualatin Watershed so we have two of our great employees before us today to tell us more about some operational awards that they have achieved good uh thank you chair Harrington and members of Clean Water Services Board of Directors my name is Mark jockers I'm the chief of staff with clean water services and I'm here today to really to hand it over to a long time colleague of mine CJ Baxter who's our water resource recovery services manager position that he just stepped into very recently actually to tell you a little about about the Peak Performance awards that we've recently received from the National Association of Clean Water agencies so with that I'm going to hand it over to CJ thank you Mark again I'm CJ Baxter water resource recovery manager and greetings to the board of directors chair Harrington and this award is from the National Association of Clean Water agencies naqua and this Peak Performance award program annually recognizes naqua and their facilities for excellence in wastewater treatment as measured by their compliance with our national pollution discharge elimination system permits Clean Water Services received two platinum and two gold Wards for the calendar year of 2022. the Durham and Rock Creek treatment plants are largest both receive Platinum Awards which are given to facilities that have had five years of consecutive perfect compliance with Rock Creek having 19 years of perfect compliance and Durham seven years the Hillsboro and Forest Grove treatment plants also receive gold Awards this last year clean water is the heart of Clean Water Services strategy to protect public health and the environment and requires complex process technology training and the four water resource recovery navigated nearly ten thousand compliance instances in this period covered by the the water resource recovery department staff worked 24 hours a day seven days a to clean more than 23 billion gallons of used water transforming it into energy fertilizer clean water ready for reuse and return to the rubber if it pleases the board of directors if you could come down and we will have a quick photo op with our CEO Logan olds the Durham wastewater treatment superintendent Dustin higbin and The Rock Creek superintendent Mr Tom Stone and we will have to do our best to also be thinking about the Hillsborough treatment plant and staff as well as Forest Grove these are exciting achievements and for all of our young people out there clean water services does really cool science and so if you're looking for careers out into the future we've got some good stuff for you to consider indeed all right let's memorialize and celebrate this achievement thank you thank you well and for our community members who may be wondering why is it so important to have these recognition

going to do it uh you know kind of walk you through the different areas within west if we're going to use as well as describe a little bit about the transfer equipment that will be used at west and the vertical concrete cast themselves where the capsules will be stored so i'm kind of a visual visual person so i like to kind of start off with that and i'll kind of give you an idea of the process again so then as i talk to you about the status you'll have a better idea of what i'm what i'm you know what i'm talking about okay i'm gonna okay ready to start whatever you want okay thanks so much the u.s department of energy and contractor central plateau cleanup company are reducing the risk in the 200 east area of the hanford site in washington state engineers have developed a safe and compliant process to remove 1936 highly radioactive cesium and strontium capsules from underwater storage inside the waste encapsulation and storage facility or wesseth to a safer dry storage configuration in the 1970s cesium and stratium were removed from waste tanks at hanford to reduce the temperature of the waste inside of the tanks the capsules represent about a third of the total radioactivity on the hanford while they are currently in a safe configuration wessef is an aging transferring them to dry storage would eliminate the possibility of a release of radioactive material in the unlikely event of a major earthquake that might result in the loss of pool storage water and subsequent overheating and breach of the capsules teams of well-trained personnel will accomplish this work safely and compliantly benefiting from the lessons learned and proficiencies gained from training with the equipment at a full-scale non-radiological mock-up to begin the removal process workers on a catwalk will use long reach pole tools to access the capsules that are stored under 13 feet of water which provides adequate radiation shielding for the workers will retrieve the capsule and move it to the transfer chute connecting to the hot cell or g-cell from outside g-cell workers will use manipulator arms to bring the capsule near a shielded window to inspect the capsule for damage they will also verify the capsule's identity to ensure the correct capsules are loaded in such a way to comply with the capsule storage thermal analysis if operators find a damaged capsule they will place it in a larger overpack then workers using the manipulator arms and a special insertion tool will place the capsule into a universal capsule sleeve or ucs the ucs can hold up to six once the ucs is full the air inside will be displaced with helium which helps dissipate the heat from the capsules following a successful leak test the ucs is ready for transfer to the truck port using cameras workers will guide a grapple over the ucs hoist it out of g-cell and into the shielded dry transfer system or dts the dts is a large shielded cask that will transfer the ucs from g-cell into the west canyon to the truck port using a 15-ton crane in the truck port is an 11-foot tall 10-foot diameter cask shielded with reinforced concrete in the cask is a storage container capable of holding up to 22 universal capsule sleeves a robotic welter will seal the lid of the inner storage container the air will be removed and then the container will be filled with helium to aid in keeping the capsules cool once the helium is in place a second outer lid will be placed on the storage container and welded in place once the loading process is complete workers will open the truck port roll-up door and remove the cask the equipment used to transport the cask has been repurposed from a previous doe project avoiding millions of dollars of the vertical cask transporter or vct a specially designed hydraulic lift unit is used to lift the cask the tug will tow the vct and cask to the capsule storage area a 90 foot by 90 foot secure outdoor storage pad located approximately one quarter mile from the cask will be placed on the pad and will be connected to a temperature monitoring system the cast will be placed in one of the 25 locations on the pad once the final capsule has been retrieved and the final cask has been placed onto the storage pad wesson can be prepared for these cesium and strontium capsules will remain in a safe and passive condition until a permanent storage location is the u.s department okay thanks anybody have any any questions on the video before we we move on to kind of give you a status of where we're at with the project so i see a couple hands up dan you were well i'm not sure it's on the video it's it's what happens afterwards uh is um is there plans to keep a hot sellers another hot sell on on site that they those the ceasing caps can be removed in case they want to put them in the in the high-level waste by little bit ways yeah so absolutely now there is no plans to to keep uh uh g-cell uh or less of uh operational uh we plan to put it in a cold and dark configuration and then would be indeed with um with the plant you know right now we haven't determined the disposition path for these these capsules there's been discussions about potentially i'm going to the high-level waste repository which which obviously is not available at the time and so we will have to there is other spent fuel here on site that we will have to and we will have to build that capacity to do that at a later date um once once repository is available and so the idea would be if if that is the destination then we could uh we'd have to kind of rebuild that that that capability really at that time okay thank you another question the uh the the old uh the old hot cell are you gonna do some examination of that just to get a sense of what radiation does to uh concrete um again i don't know if there's any any plans to do any studies i know there has been some discussion about how radiation has impacts concrete and i know that's been a concern you know with with the pool cells because there is a high amount of activity that have been there for for a long period of time and there has been calculations done that has demonstrated the concrete is still has a structural stability to you know where they currently are but that is a concern and so that's one reason why we're moving forward with with this project right to get them out of there so but i'm not aware of any uh specific uh um actions that actually do any sampling at this time okay thank you one final question i listened to a nuclear waste technical review board meeting on on spent fuel management age extent fuel aging management and they mentioned something about a lead cast project in conjunction with with the pad there where they're going to take one of these if i understand it right one of these storage capsules and instrument it and then see how the the environment affects it over time yeah that's correct so we do have an extra we have uh right now we there's gonna be a total of 19 vertical concrete casts will be loaded and stored on the capsule storage pad and we do have a 19th vertical concrete cast where we plant we're going to have an aging management program to kind of monitor that as you mentioned so we can see over time if there's any impact on on the vertical concrete cast and whether or not they're showing signs of wear or deterioration thank you so a related question might be does the radioactive decay in in these uh canisters result in any hydrogen gas build up um so it's my understanding that uh so i don't know if i can answer the question i'll have to to get back to you on that i know they've done quite a bit of uh of thermal analysis and and radiological analysis to to demonstrate that that that the you know the vertical concrete cast and the dry storage configuration will be safe but i can't specifically do with hydrogen build up inside of any okay um mary lou you're up next yeah i was wondering what the mass of those casks yep so um the fully loaded vertical concrete cast will weigh about 169 000 um again it's you know each each cask is basically able to hold about 132 to capsules that's that's the max you got six six uh capsules in each universal capsule sleeve with 22 universal capsule sleeves loaded to each each task of course again not not all of them will loaded with 132 we do have again a load plan to make sure we maintain the maintain the cast below the temperature so you say the vccs weigh 169 000 when they're fully loaded fully loaded that's correct yeah and uh is there any possibility of monitoring the concentration of helium in those as they no so they will be completely sealed as you saw in there there will be the vertical the transportable storage container will be welded shut so the only thing we plan to monitor is the so is the surface so you're talking about surface temperature that's correct so with all those layers is surface temperature really useful well the surface temperature is really just to to monitor the outside so if we so again we have to maintain that the salt and uh capsule temperature interface below a certain certain a certain amount so through the again thermal calculations we've basically will just kind of monitor the outside of the temperature make sure it stays uh you know to just kind of see if if we have any blockage of the vents that might see it you know the capsules kind of heat up and and we don't expect to be any issues but if we see that uh temperature increase then we know to get out there and kind of clear the fence so that the passive cooling system that's designed in the vertical concrete cast continues to work as needed so what happens if that passive cooling system fails well again they've been designed so that they that even if it fails we'd still be we'd still be able to maintain the temperature below that that temperature um the salt uh capsule temperature interface uh limits uh but again we will have like say the temperature mining system will be monitored on a daily basis and and if it shows any increase then we'll get someone out there uh to clear those those vents during",

meeting minutes everyone had an opportunity to review the minutes um chair this is hanley i moved that thank you hanley i'll second thank you kent we have a motion and a second do we have any further discussion on the minutes hearing none mr secretary please call the role mercy grill kent howe hanley jenkins cindy condon perry chalk too motion carries madam chair thank you and i will just say that i will absolutely be depending on staff and anyone else to for those wishing to speak because i clearly can't see anything at this point so i apologize for that at this time mr secretary if you'd like to present your council secretary report thank you madam chair um let's first start with staffing updates so on march 30th i sent council members an email um indicating that chris clark is our new senior citing analyst so we've been looking to fill that position for a little while he formally started in the position on april 1st i'd say it is of course for us a mixed blessing and i'm sure for council as well so we're very happy to have him become our newest senior sighting analyst because i think he'll be great in that position his learning curve will be short but it also means he'll be moving away from doing the rulemaking uh he's done an excellent job in the rulemaking got a lot of projects completed and been very kind of inclusive and i think just done an excellent job so it is it is certainly a mixed mixed bag for us um but just so council knows he chris is the appointed rule-making coordinator so just because he's moved positions that hasn't changed yet um council will actually need to appoint a new rule-making coordinator at some point in the future and as we seek uh his replacement we have begun that process of seeking his replacement chris will still continue to keep the rulemaking projects that are currently active going and he will still officially be the council's rulemaking coordinator so just wanted to make sure you all knew that so we weren't falling behind so his transition will be really related to you know how long it takes to get a new uh rule-making person on board so we'll we'll start working him on projects but he'll continue to do rule making projects as well one other recruitment so we are currently recruiting for a limited duration compliance officer position so somewhat similar to dwayne's we've actually had the ability to recruit for that position for this biennium and last biennium we've not done that because we didn't have the foreseeable work for many of people within the division um you know we we're largely fee based so about 75 percent of the funding for all of our position comes in from fees so we have to have the the forecast that we actually have the workload necessary to you know have those positions or fill those positions we currently have a lot going on there's a lot of construction going on you know for projects and so we definitely have that forecasted need for the compliance officer we're also making the request for next biennium for that position as well because we see the at least for the next year or two beyond this biennium the need for that position so i'll keep you up to date but we are still just sort of at the beginning stages of the recruitment for that position the questions before i move to project okay secretary cornett this is kent and um i just like not a question i just like to echo your comments uh about chris he did an absolutely fantastic job on rule making projects that he worked on couldn't have been better it was thank you and chris is on the line so thankfully he can hear all these nice things that people are saying about him so and and they're all heartfelt too thank you all very much and looking forward to that chris now you get to wear two hats all right thank you vice chair howe uh moving on to projects so the first is the port westward renewable diesel project so on wednesday of this week we issued a draft of a proposed order slightly different than the draft proposed order because this is uh there's really just the proposed order kind of requirement but we issued a draft of that for public comment um so the project capable of processing 50 000 barrels per day of renewable biomass feed stocks would be located in the port of columbia county at port westward the applicant is seeking an exemption from fsec so what that means we haven't had one of these for quite some time but there are certain projects that meet certain requirements that they can make a request to not have to get a site certificate from fsec and this is one of those projects that that at least theoretically can meet those requirements and so that's essentially what's happening is they submitted their request for exemption we're in the process of reviewing that and ultimately it will come to counsel so the authority for that exemption or exception as it's indicated in statute there's a slight difference in is allowed under organized statute 469 320 and then in rule it's the oregon administrative rule 345.015.0350 and those indicate the types of projects that allowed to request exemptions and then the the steps and the requirements for each type so in order for this type of project to meet an exemption they have to show that they meet five specific criteria and those are the source of the materials for conversion to a liquid fuel and i'm not going to go into the details we'll spend more time on that next month i'm just kind of giving a preview so that's number one number two is that they've received local lane use approval number three is that the project does not require a transmission line or a pipeline that itself would qualify as an f-sec jurisdictional facility number four is that ninety percent of the fuel that is produced will be used within one mile of the production site it will be transported from the production site by rail or barge and then finally there is a specific emission requirement that they have to show that they meet as well again not getting into the details of this we provided that notice to council i believe it was on wednesday um and all the details are in there so the applicant is next renewable fuels oregon llc and then the remaining timeline includes we sent out the notice with a comment period or a written comment period so the deadline for receiving written comments will be may and then may 13th for our production cycle for that council meeting will be the first packet so we will turn around those comments and then make any necessary updates to the proposed order and and send those to council on may may 27th is the next council meeting we will present an overview of the project the requirements and if you feel you have enough information at that time you can make a if not you can certainly continue it to a future council meeting as well but that gives you just a kind of an overview of the timeline and wally adams is the project lead for this any questions on that before i move to the next one the next update is the nolan hills wind power project so on tuesday of this week we issued the draft proposed order the project is a combination facility which includes 340 megawatts of solar or uh wrote that down wrong i think it's 300 feet maybe 340 megawatts of wind 260 megawatts of solar i may have flipped that and 120 megawatts of battery storage the facility is proposed in northwest umatilla county uh nolan hills wind llc is the site certificate or applicant they are a subsidiary of capital power so the draft proposed order public hearing will occur at the next council on thursday may 26th starting at 5 30 p.m and that will be at the red lion in pendleton and kate sloan is the project lead for that project",

So, for community Planning Month, this proclamation we present to you guys, change is consistent and affects all citizens in the community. Planning helps to manage the change in a proactive way in making better choices for people to enjoy our incredible county where they work, live and play. Whereas the community planning provides an opportunity for all residents, citizens, appointed boards and elected public officials to meaningfully involve in proactively making choices that determine the future of how our community looks and feels. Whereas the American Planning association and the Community Institute of Certified Planners have designated October as the National Community Planning Month and have endorsed this month as an opportunity to highlight the contribution of sound planning and the plan implementing makes to improve the quality of our counties, municipalities. And the celebration of National Community Planning Month gives the Board of County Commissioners of Marion County, Florida, the opportunity to publicly recognize the partners and participation dedicated to the citizens. Appointed members of the Planning and Zoning Commission, the Land Development Review Commission, the Code Enforcement Board, the Board of Adjustments, who have contributed their time and expertise to the improvement of Marion County, Florida. Now, whereas the Board of county commissioners recognizes the many valuable contributions made by planning professionals serving the board, the Ocala Marion County Transportation Planning Organization, the East Central Florida Regional Planning Council, St. John's River Water Management District, the Southwest Florida Water Management District. Now, therefore, the Board of County Commissioners of Marion County, Florida, by the virtue of the authority vested in us, proclaim October 2023 as community Planning Month. So, thank you guys all for being here. You guys certainly make an incredible difference in how our community looks, how it feels, how it moves, and certainly how we live and play. So thank you guys for all that you do. Give them a round of applause. All right, and we'll present this to Chuck, our, the head of our planning for Marion county. Here you go. Hey, thank you all. I'm just part of the team. It's an awesome, diverse team of planners and citizens, but also appointed boards and just grateful for a time just to highlight the efforts of all of us who try to work to make Marion County a great and awesome place to live, work and play. And just one note, too, a lot of the appointed boards, they're volunteers. So they volunteer their time and effort to help make Marion county an awesome place. So I'm gonna hand this off to Ken Wayrock, our deputy director. I think you said pretty much everything. I just would like to thank the board for all of your support and for the community, for what they do. Yeah, I wasn't expecting. No, I wasn't expecting to talk, but I always have something to say. It's not always good, you know, so I get to work with pretty much every one of these guys on a regular basis. And I gotta say, it's real honor. You know, we bring forth a lot of new communities to this. To this county, and I feel like they help shape them. Everyone we bring forward, and they always come out at the other end, you know, better than the beginning. So I appreciate all the help that we have and all the work that goes into each and every one of them. It's a community effort at the end of the day, and I really appreciate it. Mike serves on our planning commission. You want to say quick something? He volunteers his time and gives it to the community, and so we really appreciate that. Somebody told me I didn't have to say anything. You don't have to say anything. I just. I'm honored to be on the board, and I just appreciate the privilege it is to work for Marion county on the planning and zoning board. And Bo steps here from on top of the world. You don't want to say anything. So, of course, on top of the world is one of our huge retirement communities, and they certainly make a huge difference on the west side of Oatmerian county. So thank you both for what you and your team do to make that happen. And anyone else. And Kalessa. Yeah. So they've got multiple disciplines out there. So anybody else? All right, you want to say something? Sure. Well, the transportation planning organization is built on partnerships, and so this is a great reflection of that and just a pleasure to be here and be recognized as a part of the community. And, of course, we have our Chris. He is one of the guys that makes it happen every day, in and out. He's been around for a long time and has truly shaped Marion county into what it was, has been. And over the last ten years that I've gotten to serve with you, Chris, I certainly appreciate the knowledge and the expertise that you bring to our board every single week. So thank you. All right, one more round of applause for these guys. Thanks. Right. Okay, so next on the agenda, we have National Fire Prevention Week, and Chief Banta, chief triggers, and I see some others from our fire department out there. We want them to come up as well. Oh, they can't come up for this one, too? Yeah, come on up. You guys are a part of this. Come on. I've never known firemen to need encouragement to come up to the stage. Y'all get to stay up here for double time. Good morning. Good morning. Good to see you. Good morning. Good morning. Good to see you. Morning. Good to see you. Good morning. Y'all didn't know you were gonna have to come up here for all this, huh? You get to be center. Yeah. There you go. All right. So this proclamation is a proclamation by the Board of county Commissioners of Marion County, Florida. Whereas fire is a serious public safety concern, both locally and nationally, and homes are the locations where people are at greatest risk from fire. And whereas unattended cooking is the leading cause of home fires in the United States, with more than half of reported non fatal home cooking fire injuries occurring when the victims tried to fight the fire themselves, and whereas, Marion county first responders are dedicated to reducing the occurrence of home fires and home fire injuries through prevention and protection education, and whereas, Marion county residents who have working smoke alarms, in addition to a planned and practiced home fire escape plan, are more prepared and will therefore be more likely to survive a fire. And whereas, the 2023 fire Prevention week theme, cooking safety, starts with you, pay attention to fire prevention effectively serves to remind us to stay alert and use caution when cooking to reduce the risk of kitchen fires. Now, therefore, the board of county Commissioners of Marion County, Florida, by virtue of the authority vested in us, do hereby proclaim October 8 through 14th, 2023, be known as National Fire Prevention Week Marion county, and urge all the people of Marion county to check their kitchens for fire hazards and use safe cooking practices during fire Prevention Week 2023 and to support the many public safety activities and efforts of the Marion County Fire Rescue and emergency services duly proclaimed this third day of October, 2023, signed by all five county commissioners and attested to by Gregory Harrell, our clerk of court. So I know that we've got Chief jiggers and Chief Banta here, so I'm sure that you might have something to say. Okay. They're deferring to each other. Well, thank you. Thank you for this proclamation and recognizing fire safety Prevention week. So I always say the best call I ever ran was the one I didn't have to. And that's what fire prevention is. We just encourage everybody to please be safe. Check their smoke detectors. If you don't have smoke detectors, please reach out to us. We've given away thousands of smoke detectors in partnership with American Red Cross. So there's no reason for people not to have working smoke detectors in their home. In my 30 years of service, I would say over 90% of the fire fatalities that I've been involved with did not have working smoke detectors. So it's extremely important they save lives. So, you know, please take that serious. So, two questions. I know the focus this year is cooking, but can you tell us other things that people can be careful with for prior fire prevention? And then also, where do they reach out to us at for those smoke alarms? So for smoker alarms, you can just call the main number, 29180. Reach out to us, and then we'll will direct you in the right direction. So when it comes to fire safety, cooking safety, your smoke detectors, smoke alarms, escape plans, some of our best educated citizens are our children because they get the education in schools. So parents, when your children come home and tell you we need to do something, listen to them, because they typically know better than the parents do. So with that, I'll turn it over to Pam. This is definitely her expertise, and if she has anything else she wants to say, well, thank you, chief. Marion County Fire Rescue has partnered with the American Red Cross, and it is a partnership that has blossomed. We are one of the best and busiest counties in the state of Florida with the smoke detector program we have installed. We have gone out in two neighborhoods, the lower income neighborhoods, installed over 1000 smoke detectors for free into homes to help save and protect our residents of Marin county. That's one of our top priorities. We have also partnered with the Marin County School Board. So we are in every school, elementary school in Marin county for the month of October. And we're also into",

utilize those existing channels we've heard feedback from a variety of communities that there's community websites or existing channels that people are using and checking and hopefully we can take advantage of those to get the word out about our program so that's a a broad kind of overview of what we plan to do in our program and so we'd like to kind of pause and see what questions people have about the program concerns or any kind of feedback that we can try to answer those questions or take that feedback and help us with further program design people are raising their hands or pressing star 3 on their phones to raise their hands and figuring that out we did have um a follow-up on the first question that we had from jenna and she had asked about multi-family units and she followed up and i just missed it um but she wanted to also know let's see that was the multi-unit incentive wait where'd it go oh webex come on there's a total for property huh sorry i'm oh there we go okay there's like a couple different ways that i can look at q a who knew she wanted to know if there's also a low income bonus for multi-family in some that's a good good question so uh at this time we don't have a bonus in commercial and multi-family but that's something we could consider uh either for uh low can service providers or or uh actual structures that qualify that or structure owners that qualify themselves typically in commercial structures those people that own those structures typically don't qualify for loading modern income but we might be able to do service providers that might be a way to do it but certainly jenna if you have some feedback or thoughts about that we'd love to hear it if you you'd like to be on muted and provide some feedback and jenna if you want to raise your hand we can call on you um i could just take you off me but i don't want to put you on the spot so i prefer it if you raised your hand so i know you want to be called on um but we can talk more about that if you want but we'll eventually note it on the question and otherwise just as a reminder for others um you can raise your hand uh somebody's clapping that's exciting um you can uh you can raise your hand by in the bottom of the bottom right of the i'm a host so i can't exactly remind myself how to do it i don't see any hands raised so oh there we go jenna great perfect and you are now off mute and you are welcome to talk thanks jenna can hear me researching oh okay sorry yeah no i'm really just interested in um low income or properties that have um you know uh either section 8 or our income restricted uh properties already uh even in both the public and private sector so that's that was my question about whether there might be a incentive for those types of properties but it's a great question jenna so the thing that the data we had on on the structures loss on the commercial and multi-family side um wasn't comprehensive across the states we have kind of a limited scope of of multi-family structures that were actually lost if if you have um i guess visibility to that or know firsthand um the need for that you know we'd love we love that data or that information yeah i mean i work for a company that has um low income properties and we lost a development down there and um and we are in the process of rebuilding but um it's just been it's been difficult and complicated and because of the type of building and all rural development um restrictions on it so we'd like to get it rebuilt and as energy efficient as possible and then move the residents back in but we're just having difficulty so as just just looking for more incentive money or funding of course and jenna when you said down there do you mean in jackson county or or what what area of the state did you lose some structures phoenix oregon okay in phoenix okay and do you have an idea or could you give us an idea of kind of the scale of what was what was lost oh gosh i'd have to go look it up but i think it was probably a i want to say it was somewhere around a 30 unit uh building and it may have been a senior building 30 unit senior housing but i'd have to go up and look at the details to get you the specifics okay well thank you for for sharing that we can generally consider how we could do that or how we could uh change our incentives to make sure there is something available for for people who are rebuilding commercial structure multi-family structures that are um when we say serving serving those communities that need it the most what would it be best if i just went to the public comment section and wrote oh that'd be wonderful i would love it i mean the because there is the draft rules are available right now right so i could go there and just make a comment right here yeah so i you can certainly make a comment here um we have a public comment portal that you're certainly welcome to either upload documents or write in or answer there's some questions on there you can certainly answer there will also be a follow-up email after after this or you'll get that email from me and you can just email me back directly if that's for you uh i'm happy to hear from you either way i get okay great thank you so much yeah thank thanks jenna i don't see any other hands up at this and i don't see any new questions oh there's eric swanson there you go eric you should be able to talk now where i put my hand up and i accidentally clicked on it and it worked so thank you oh good thanks yeah so i'm to also from phoenix and just wanted to echo the comments about potentially looking at multi-family incentives and um and looking at those specifically because those are you know um for the market here um you know there's there's a lot of uh issues with folks being able to you know actually own homes so if there was some way that you could developers that could provide that housing you know those housing options you know the the more the better um and so i think i would echo those comments and then also to put it in perspective uh for phoenix um we love we lost uh close to um i think it was right around 600 a little over 600 structures commercial you know residential you know end up in a population of uh of uh you know less than 5 000 so um pretty pretty dramatic uh impacts um and you know our largest mobile home trailer park is i think somewhere over 200 units it's completely gone and it's a national company so i don't know you know how you could do any outreach with them it's it's it's it's kind of different differently structured but certainly it's something um i would just make you aware of in terms of the scale of the impacts on phoenix but um the the only only couple things that i i will also point out um that sometimes um depending on how you look at it um does impact availability of property or land it's the commercial side and i know we're not here to talk about that but it it does impact people's ability again to uh property or at least rent property um in this in this part of the of the and i think you know we don't want to lose sight of that i guess and and just that that those commercial properties although you know again they're not kind of the focus of this which is residential they do drive you know people's ability to stay in a community to live in a community and so ways to incentivize that i think important in addition i think it's also important to recognize that our current land use system process you know getting urban growth brownie uh projects are uh you know completed done it is really uh pretty pretty difficult i mean and i'm you know using uh you know terms that you know that are i guess i'm just saying that they're very difficult i'll just leave it at that and kind of all and sort of flies in the face of the idea of providing you know at least the raw land for some of these kind of this kind of development that we're we're trying to incentivize here and that's really really an issue that arose in in phoenix when you know shortly after the fire you know we had all sorts of people showing up and asking us you know prioritize property that could be rebuilt and you know we'll put you in touch with the development community you know to see what we can do as far as you know getting them interested in and you know investing here and we had nothing we had nothing available we were all built out you know we're pretty much we were maxed out um and so you know and and that was a problem before the fire i mean housing was a problem before the fire because of that situation of being maxed out in terms of uh uh any kind of developmental uh bear property for you know our you know land that could be could be developed for housing so i just add that into the mix may not totally fit into the um the criteria with the discussion we're having here today but i think it's important to note and it also there's also a commercial aspect of the of the urban growth boundary expansion that we've been working on for literally years here and in the sense that it it also uh has the opportunity especially here um near near phoenix to actually provide uh high-end jobs is the uh is the goal there in terms of campus style type uh development and anyway so i'm just i'm just kind of giving you kind of that perspective that may be a little bit different than the conversation we're having today but it's certainly i think important to know and has had an impact on our ability to rebuild so thank you so much for sharing eric um we did get a question asking what role you have or like what it's you said you're from phoenix we're just somebody else i'm sorry i'm uh i'm the city manager oh you're the city manager yeah yeah i'm sorry oh no worries no i wouldn't have i wouldn't have necessarily asked but somebody else wanted to know so thanks so much for sharing it right yeah well that's that's how i kind of have a little bit of a insight into",

        "text": " too we would have to also analyst okay to bring them into the Incorporated okay my call the question is if they were inside the city limits at the end of it is this like proposing that they wave like sdcs or that's a whole different conversation I'm just trying to leave all our SECU ugb is this area right but this part is not Incorporated okay into the city so that it would be another it would just be expanding this outer boundary but not bringing them into the city okay yeah because I'm just trying to understand you know what what are the financial costs to us if the governor decides to add these inside or UTV that's what I'm ultimately trying to figure out it's it's providing services to which a lot of times sdcs do should require if I understand this what they're looking for is of a scale that's outside what would be available in our area I believe so yes they're looking for hundreds of Acres not correct in the Acres or someplace like that like we yeah and I think for the federal case definitely the the committee does sound like what one of the things they are looking at though is for and I think that's where they're waiting to kind of get this report on what everybody has because there are some areas where you have a good amount of land but it's not enough to cite you know something like this and so they are talking about a lot of Workforce kind of things and you know where can we set up sort of these educational Workforce to get the employees to then get them out and where do we have maybe sites that would make more sense for things of that nature so they are trying to look more globally at kind of like yes we want the big chip manufacturers but there's other pieces that would fall into that and maybe there's a way that in some communities they could get that where other communities maybe get the larger chips so there's there's sort of the r d piece there's the workforce piece there's kind of these bigger incentives and then there's the land use and that seems to be how they've broken out what they're trying to piece together right now um in a very complicated way yeah can you tell me what the list you you were saying there are some skills that are listed what are the cities she's thinking about and I will tell you right now it is um so the way they have it written it says uh in designating sites under this section the governor shall give consideration to the cities of Albany Boardman Corvallis Gresham Happy Valley Hillsboro McMinnville Medford Newport North Plains Redmond Scappoose Sherwood The Dalles Tualatin and Wilsonville so Albany McMinnville I mean even though not us I mean I can certainly have some sort of Downstream impacts people who've been here to take advantage of urban semiconductors but again it's not an exclusive list again right so just a minute right I understand that yeah so yeah and we could be added pretty much A lot has happened we're tracking we're watching we'll keep everybody updated it's just it's it's getting high profile and I think it's going to get more and more high profile especially with the the land use case obviously you've got that kind of fight that's aren't even happening and then you know the whole push for money obviously semiconductors are going to other states it's been all over the news and so I think this particular bill at a high level is going to keep hitting the media circuit at a minimum and I just kind of wanted to make sure we were updating you guys thank you so much I have a couple questions uh it has Albany McMinnville testified in support in opposition have you heard what they feel about I don't remember off the top of my head I I tracked but I I they are not one ones that are hitting or against I think Albany has said that therefore a lot of communities that said they're for the concept um that's been the big thing Wilsonville is the only one I know for certain that has come out and said they do not want to be on this list and they do not want to be considered um very specifically but a lot of the testimony and the letters have been more of or in support of the overall concept or were really opposed to the land use so far thank you I would wanted to chat for just very briefly about meeting Logistics I know we have to run because I have to get to another place but next our next video is scheduled for the 17th um and that's the deadline day right would there be is so is that list coming out the deadline we wouldn't know until the end of the day right yeah so I have my challenge for that day is uh uh funeral at 11 o'clock our um our intent was to get a report to you about the bills that were still um on that day but we didn't feel the need to conduct a meeting yes we do but I was proposing at the bottom of the agenda to take just a report to you oh okay um only because that day we don't we won't know until the end of the day so we're going to cancel our Mark something new if that's okay with the committee well somebody 's a couple days before so okay our needs are insignificant ly that's right so that's what really matters exactly we would prefer to Etc okay because we won't know until the end of the day so the next meeting would be March 31st if you wish we could look at the other date which would have been 24 if you want we could hold a meeting on the 24th it's it's your prerogative if thank you it might be helpful I would say everybody just hold down on the calendar and get this in case but I will wait to see what happens okay um the only other thing I wanted to just notice quickly is the packet construction and whether it's of use for you to get those three different kinds of reports so one that is focused on the bills for today for a conversation in the meeting one that is a complete watch list things that we've already talked about and you've asked us to continue to watch and then the last one is those things that have been approved by the council for uh our position statements yeah I think that's great okay yeah I I appreciate it um it's you know it's keeping track of the things you've already said or supported it's really helpful I don't have a photographic memory so yes it's very helpful okay great thank you",

        "text": " about that exception okay thanks and is there a definition for whole building energy analysis or something similar in the it's all in there okay um I will we will look at that thanks thank you um JP as a hand raised yep that's right um just going back to the qualified person I just have a question um that qualified person is is that I'm just trying to understand the scope of that is that a person that would udit the reports before they get stent out or is that the person compiling the report um yeah so I I think that's the person that would be kind of responsible for General like energy management and reporting of the uh of like up building his energy use I guess the only the only concern there is you know within the you know commercial building sector there they professionals working in those in those companies that are responsible for doing um you know Carbon accounting and reporting to various third parties including you know state of Oregon um they might not have these qualifications um I guess that would then mean they would have to go out and get them um and I'm wondering if there's some way that you can capture that experience that's in the industry like a certain number of years of experience or another way of like capturing those professionals you know um otherwise it's just going to be adding an expense CU then the company's going to have to hire a third party when maybe they don't need toh just an idea because it just seems um could could be a little bit a difficult wrinkle for for commercial property companies that actually have departments right okay yeah I I understand thanks for the comment I'm just taking some notes here okay um looks like Rick Hodes has a hand rais too sure thanks um I'm just kind of going we're jumping around a little bit but back to Clark's whole um and some of the solar aspect the thought of you could have two identif buildings and if one had say a a battery or a hot water storage tank and was able to shift when they use energy their euis are going to be the same but their emissions will be um a lot less if you're optimizing um there's been a lot of more recent work on cre optimized buildings and others on the skull could probably speak to that but um I know that's not really captured and that's you know more cutting Edge but the idea of a battery and shifting when you use could actually be one of the bigger greenhouse gas you know reduction approaches and it's not really captured by eui so Park's whole building kind of triggered that thought for me but not sure how to address it maybe out scope yeah thank thanks for the comment it's a you know definitely something that we support you demand flexibility um is uh you know I I think a a valuable component to building operation I but I think it might be somewhat as you mentioned kind of out of scope of the building performance standards just because they are explicitly based on site energy use um and not without necessarily taking into account any sort of demand flexibility components in there too yeah definitely great thing but yeah maybe tie back to the solar as well though I mean we don't want to just encourage adding more Solar without that ibility of when it's coming back on um and it does have a pretty big impact on on emissions so yeah yeah understood thanks and then as far as um other modifications to the uh to the definitions I think that was actually it the the it does the asro 100 does include these abbreviations and acronyms that honestly I I kept in there um some of them probably aren't all that useful um for for BPS purposes but just because they're part of the standard and they're probably used elsewhere in the standard um we I figured just to kind of keep keep them in there um we probably can remove the ones related to grain out gas intensities and targets um you know there's kind of engineering specific abbreviations for things like fault detection and Diagnostic and spatial daylight autonomy VAV and things like that that um won't be real applicable for I think most VPS users and building owners but they're they're part of the standard and I don't know if um keeping them in there really causes any harm other than just taking up space in our rle making so um although as we go through the process we might recognize that there's a need to add other acronyms in there too just for definition to make sure that they're they're clear and that that brings us to the end of our Draft rules for purpose scope and definitions um again if you know thanks for all the great kind of comments as we walked through these today definitely took notes and we're recording this so we'll have it as a as a way to go back but certainly encourage anybody that wants to to also provide comments in the um using the comment portal and that way we have them as a kind of documented comment if you made comments here don't don't feel like you need to go back and like reenter those comments but if there are any new comments that you want to provide then please do so through the through the portal that would be great um I guess I'll just take a moment and pause to see if there's any any other questions or comments with regard to the purpose scope and definitions draft that we just went through yeah yeah Blake it's Ray Douglas uh just listening taking a lot of notes Here uh I made some comments in the portal I just want to say thank you for pulling this together and you know given other people an opportunity to weigh in appreciate it from uh from Oregon's perspective thank you yeah thanks Raymond okay I wanted to make one more comment um just regarding the there are multiple definitions around the savings to investment ratio and uh my concern would be that if that's not very clearly defined because there's some cost estimating involved in that um that that would be an easy out for compliance that just to kind of say simply say oh this is especially if there's not a verification or any certification around it or liced professional like putting their license on the line around it um that and I've been concerned from the beginning U when I first read the language and the bill that U if if I had a property I might see it as like oh this is the the loosest part of this compliance is that these are easy numbers to kind of say like oh like you can you could back calculate this is the savings investment ratio that I need to not comply and then play with the different versions of what's the data that's out there and there's lots of data sources um so I do get concerned about that and I would be if this is the identical data to Washington State I'd be U um advising you all to really check in with them to see how that's playing out in terms of compliance and what is the um how do you even enforce something that okay yeah noted thanks I appreciate that that comment that's a good one okay uh well that kind of wraps up the draft rule review I'll pull up the ums I'll pull up the uh agenda here briefly too um so we we've reviewed the scope the purpose the definitions now we're kind of at the wrap-up next steps section of the meeting um kind of heard a bunch of comments so our next meeting is scheduled for let's see so this is April 24th our next meeting is scheduled for about a month uh May 22nd and what we plan to go over in that meeting would be the um the sections the chapters of standard 100 with proposed or organ modifications for compliance requirements developing an energy and Emissions management plan and an operations and maintenance uh plan and requirements so um you can look for that draft similar to the format that we worked through uh today just like Draft rules up on the SharePoint site with a notification sometime in advance of that meeting um I'll try to get it out as far in advance as I can um with uh providing you guys the opportunity to review uh ahead of time and then we'll kind of plan just to walk through it similar to what we did during this meeting although recognizing that some of these future sections are going to get a little bit longer so um we may have kind of a more streamlined review process where we focus on maybe certain certain parts of the rules and then rely upon the committee to spend some time reviewing outside and submitting through the comment portal and then coming coming prepared to the meeting to make comments on on elements of the rules that are particularly um of concern or that you have questions on so because you know this I think these drafts rules were just a few pages long but in future meetings we'll probably be reviewing Draft rules that are you know T of pages long so 10 20 30 pages long um are there any other questions or comments at this time happy to happy to chat anymore if there are any otherwise we're uh Cara go ahead yeah first I just I put a compliment in the chat for you just really appreciating um the way that you provided the Draft rules in advance with the redline and the comments explaining why you made the changes it was really helpful to just sort ground running today um just curious about the comment forms uh might helpful I know I always learn from others do you anticipate that you'll provide comment comments to the rack members um just it often inspires dialogue or thoughts you know thought of so just just a flag to maybe think about how to provide that information to us yeah so are you are you saying you're interested in like after we receive comments making those available to other members yeah yeah yeah um I I don't see any problem with that I think we can we can do that okay um I guess like going once going twice going three times any other final comments before we wrap up for today and um I'll with future ones I know I provided the Draft rules just a couple days in advance but I'll try to do that more in advance for some of the some of the next ones and I'll also try to continue to note in the sidelines there like where the proposed modifications come from and why why we're making them so um okay well uh again thanks to everybody for joining um I really appreciate everybody's time and dedication and um you know service to to helping us work through these rules and look forward to the next meeting and working with everybody so thanks a lot have a have a great day thank you bye thank you thank you",

        "text": " would double that what that was available during the American Recovery and reinvestment act at this moment we're in the very early stages of ushering new programs and increased funding into our state agency but also into other eligible entities and Grant programs and financing um not all of this funding will flow through the Oregon Department of energy however different programs will have different eligible applicants and for example um we don't anticipate any funds from the chips and science act to be available to the state energy offices but the funds from that that particular law will likely support research for new or improved Technologies which will just Foster the energy environment in which we're working the available funding under these pieces of legislation will be program and purpose specific that's based on the federal law that authorized it beyond the specific programs we'll talk about more in depth later into this presentation I want to emphasize that there's a wide variety of funding opportunities to support energy and climate projects across all different types of applicants this slide highlights some of the opportunities available under the infrastructure investment and jobs act funding if you're with a local government business or organization considering applying for these funds we want to encourage you to begin researching and preparing for the opportunity as soon as possible and we'll later share how you can request formal letters of support from the Oregon Department of energy if required in in that endeavor similarly to the infrastructure investment in jobs act the inflation reduction act covers numerous programs across multiple federal agencies these are the different categories of funding available under the inflation reduction act specific for the energy and climate portion each category may represent numerous specific grant opportunities or tax credits so just to highlight the historic scale of the inflation reduction act each one of those numbers and in each of those boxes above ends in a B for billions and that's some part of the the scale and the size of the the moment in which we find ourselves I also think um that it's important to note that this is the um the largest investment under the inflation reduction act for energy and climate comes through the form of tax credits offered through the U.S treasury you can see that they are estimating that value there at 277 billion for the funds that are expected to be released in the form of federal grants there's a unique pathway for each Grant but it's my hope with this slide that perhaps we can share a general overview of a typical process of a Federal Grant and how that interacts at the state level but I do want to mention that each Grant will vary somewhat in the exact in general after the federal law is enacted the federal agency will take a look and review the legislation and if needed establish a program at the federal level but a federal agency May solicit feedback on the new program through listening sessions or a more formal process known as a request for information and it's through that the interested parties can be invited to respond to targeted questions and share their thoughts on how the program could be designed when the federal agency is ready They will announce the funding opportunity announcement whether it's through a formal foa funding opportunity announcement or something that's called an administrative and legal requirements document that is essentially the announcement that the application period is now open and at this point potential applicants will have probably the best source of information to evaluate the terms and conditions of the award and determine whether the purpose of the grant aligns with the projects they'd like to see move forward during the application process the federal agency May provide additional clarification or guidance to applicants as they go applicants then can then prepare the materials required and submit that to the federal agency if awarded these materials effectively become part of the scope of work in any future award agreement paid agency there is an important step before or after submission of the application the state agency must seek approval from the state legislature to apply for the Federal Grant now the exact timing and process of how this occurs varies based on the legislative from there the federal agency will after it receives applications will process it as a procurement activity and sometimes that occurs as part of a formula word where it is more of a compliance check to make sure the application aligns or a competitive review in which the applications would be ranked against each other this process can take several months before an award agreement is offered and once that award agreement is fully offered and executed then that's the point in time when the work of the grant can actually begin as a state agency we may need to return to the legislature again at that point in time to request authority to spend the funds and to hire any additional positions that are needed related to that funding now the Biden Harris Administration is seeking to invest federal dollars so that the benefits serve communities that have been historically disadvantaged under executive order 14008 the Biden Harris Administration is seeking to provide that 40 percent of the benefits of these funds serve disadvantaged communities this complements the administration's comprehensive approach to advance equity in line with executive order 13985 there's also broad broader considerations for Community benefits specifically seeking to integrate benefits related to labor and Workforce at the community level as part of a community benefits plan and so we're seeing aspects of the justice 40 initiative in every Grant application that's being offered now under the justice 40 initiative each Federal agency may approach this a little bit differently and I wanted to note this is particularly relevant where there's a natural intersection between um the work of different federal for example the Department of Transportation and the U.S department of energy may approach justice 40 definitions and tracking a little bit differently so for a topic like installation of electric vehicle Chargers and charging infrastructure it's important to understand which federal agency is leading the effort to understand what the justice 40 approach will look like the U.S department of energy has issued General guidance for justice 40 but they noted that each Grant opportunity may have specific guidance directed towards it as to how justice 40 will be interpreted for that unique program or in general we anticipate using a map called the um the sea just map which we'll review on the next slide although there may be some opportunities for states to use a predefined state tool for this purpose if the data can be reliably compared and tracked to the existing map and um we are also um through the EPA they are taking a programmatic specific approach to justice 40 and you can learn more about that by following the link um that is on the slides to the epa's now I had mentioned the CGS map which is an acronym that stands for the climate and economic Justice screening tool and this is available from the White House the area shaded in Gray on this map are census tracts identified as disadvantaged communities by this tool some of the darker gray areas indicate where tribal lands are located as well while in the tool it can provide census tract level classification of whether or not a community meets the definition of disadvantaged you can see in the box that is pulled out here the level of detail that you can observe from the tool if you zoom into the Medford Oregon area for example so you can get right down to the neighborhood View using this all right so next I'm going to hand this back over to Janine to talk about some of the places within and some of the things we've been thinking about as as we've been considering how to prepare for these funds great thank you Jen we are so lucky to have Jen help us navigate all of these um so as we apply for spend and disburse the federal funds we think it's crucial to engage oregonians to inform consult and collaborate we really appreciate the folks who've engaged with us so far and we're really glad to be meeting with you all today on this slide is a summary of some of the ways that we've connected with communities and stakeholders over the last year so we started with two public webinars back in July of 2022 along with sharing information on our website newsletters and blog Ruchi has been putting some links in the chat to where you can find some of this information on our website we've held discussions with our energy advisory work group and we've met with representatives from investor and consumer owned utilities we've also conducted Outreach to tribal governments we Dove deeper into Workforce issues and a special discussion that stemmed from an eawg and we held a listening session with community-based organizations representing environmental justice we've also presented to legislative task forces and committees so we've tried to get the word out there about the general opportunities and then we've also held public meetings and discussions on specific funding opportunities such as grid resilience and the hydrogen hub from all of this engagement so far we condensed what we heard into a number of guiding principles which I'll show in a second on the next slide but we hope to apply The Guiding principles to our decision making surrounding these opportunities they will help us determine what to apply for and then how to spend the funds that we receive you also help us tailor Federal guidance to work best for Oregon next slide please Jen all right so here are those draft guiding principles that we attend to apply during our approach to Federal funding available under the inflation excuse me the infrastructure investment jobs Act and the inflation reduction Act so under these principles we will consider Equity at every step including Geographic diversity diversity and this will help ensure that the funds comply with the Biden Harris administration's justice 40 initiative that you heard um from Jen a few minutes ago we will try to coordinate with tribal governments and we'll work to communicate clearly inclusively and efficiently to ensure stakeholders and the public are informed and supported and that they're able to participate in federal funding opportunities where possible and where internal resources allow we hope to provide technical assistance to build community capacity and support Grant recipients there's actually a position and a program funded in the governor's budget to help us do this we're working across agencies to leverage expertise and support historically underinvested work to further energy and climate goals and to provide other community benefits and we're also trying to take advantage of high priority funding opportunities while ensuring quality work that puts every available dollar to its best use and with that we'd like to pause and ask you does this ring true What's missing do you have a reaction to you're welcome to put any thoughts you have in the chat or raise your hand and we will call on you to share your and I will give it some awkward silence while we're waiting for folks to either type or raise their hands um Janine now just could fit in the chat a reminder that you can just type right in there if you have thoughts and these really",

secretariats for the development of lighting and community actions and we have worked diligently to try to create collaborative partnerships which is ideal and I don't believe that we have received so much attraction and I am here to defend the city so that it can support the objectives that the council has already adopted in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, climate change and also transportation, the city does not ask new developers that meet those goals we as a city are never going to meet these climate change goals and that the council has already adopted it is simply Eh good public relations to say that the city has a climate change plan unless we have action that the companies are carrying out and I understand from speaking with several people who are here in the room that there is the possibility that there are conditions that could be attached and I wanted to tell you that we are 100% supporting the purchase and we support affordable housing, we are not an organization that does not want it in any way, but we ask that this development also comply with these objectives of the change, support against climate change, I want you to approach the conditions of the sale of the property in terms of transportation climate change pedestrians and access to bicycles and even more important safe pedestrian crossings on these streets because in those developments there are families and there are three schools where children have to cross this street and it is not safe because there is no asphalt on the side of the street Thank you for the

numeral y and and and b So the r60 a uh GB And then uh number uh Roman the evidence must be sent to The criteria where other criteria that the person believes applies the decision and therefore that initiative before the close of the public hearing or give evidence of clarifications with specificity to provide the parties and the council the opportunity to respond to the issue and appeal to land use on that issue Failure to do so and create issues may create a consideration and action for damages is required the court we will begin with a presentation and the applicant has 10 minutes the association limited to 5 minutes and the other parties involved 3 minutes and also for the testimony it has to do with the testimony And then I see the Lord bishop is with us the microphone that good evening mayor today members of the council and the development department here to present the annex that of the property in the northeast part 562 that has to do with is a zone change to change the use of the land that ap the society in accordance with this annex in terms of the property itself here on the screen you can see in the map on the left side the western part of the western part we have the center la piedad in action we have uh the eastern part of the city and the corridor that is being shown with a red asterisk between the center uh And the northern part of wurn And again it is contiguous in the North part and in the south and in the east and it is ready for its annex so uh this one I apply to uh To develop this map of the plan and with this application for annex the applicant is requesting to change the assignment to Multifamily Residential to continue with the development to continue and extend a second phase on that property as you can see in this map the assignment around the property has a yellow Residential zone eh And also the orange one is multifamily and also develop Residential as a house assignment and and housing and to accommodate the southwest part where there is a school and it is like a mix in terms of the allocation and then we have another use where we have a Ja area for the neighbors in terms of the tions follow the county has been allocated for urban development and the property that you can see that the ones that are in color uh the uh gray ones are in the county with this proposal we are going to change the assignment of the property with the request to a multifamily rm2 that is with medium density and we have an arm a two and three And then that would be the rm2 and and for the assignment of the property to the north to continue with the appropriate states for the multifamily development for the apartments the unification is to the east and it is Residential And we have an equivalent of zones where we have single family homes and we have a hob and also other unification that will allow a little more use for commercial opportunity along with these multifamily services and as far as the site is. s Acres in size and adjacent to an apartment development and the property in question is marked by a white frame in terms of natural resources it is flat there are no trees and it is attached to uh the the river on the west side as you can see in this report this We did a wetland study and consultants decided that there are no wetlands on the property and to the north. There is a city and we have services available to the property next to the center on downtown street Although the The address is uh it's in highlane which is an area private there is not going to be any proposed vehicle access from this development through that access towards albor Road everything is going to be north through the multifamily developments downtown Street is going to be the the the downtown But there is going to be vehicle access of eh For example eh For eh for vehicles if emergency required That is the second phase of the multi-phase development the first had 120 units that were completed as far as construction and This is going to allow for a proposed additional building shown on the plan and we are going to build seven that is going to be the new building uh that is here and uh the red line is where the building is proposed and that is going to be on these lines on the city line is requesting this annex so that the development is completed and we have an additional building of 18 units parking and and as identified in the report the requirements are met And then those services can be provided and there is density and we are going to have to withdraw some services from the District as soon as the and They are going to be annexed to the drainage services and they are going to be built to solve our housing deficit and as for the changes and the area, we request that you listen to that request. The commission reviewed the request and this they comply with. applicable codes and it was recommended to the council that the property be changed to residential and the zone be annexed to rm2 and it is better that the current assignment of that property allowing the multifamily development to be completed be extended in a logical manner to that there is an organization and the recommendation is made in the commission to adopt these changes in terms of the testimonies received the properties in eh is Lancaster we see the testimonies of the neighborhood associations they have no concerns about the noise of the construction and really in response we We have an ordinance where activities are limited between there are no activities such as you cannot start construction and work after 10 at night or 7 in the morning when the second phase enters construction is something that will apply so that noise requirements are met we have a written comment that was included in the packet from a person who used to live at the property indicating support for the request to have family members have more multi-family rooms and in agreement with them we are recommending that it be approved the annex is to change the assignment of eh Residential development to multiple family and remove eh have the district one and have the adequate drainage district and move forward with that first reading there is a testimony Stevenson good evening I am Mr. Stevenson I am the legal advisor before I have nothing to add to Bry's report, which was excellent, but I would like you to know that the applicant is here and can answer any questions you may have and I also wanted to point out an important piece is that we identified the application as having a",

        "text": " its requirements to recognize specific risks presented by each project but as a matter of law the council does have that flexibility and as a matter of policy the council should exercise that flexibility in this first as a matter of law the council's rules quite clearly allow the council to exercise its discretion as to the appropriate amount of the bond the rules state that in order to issue a site certificate the council must find uh that the applicant has a reasonable likelihood of obtaining a bond or letter of credit in a form or amount satisfactory to the council that language satisfactory to the council plainly indicates that the council is to exercise its judgment as to the appropriate amount of the bond it's also consistent with mandatory condition 8 which repeats that the bond must be in a form and amount satisfactory to the council ms gilbert's interpretation would require the council to completely ignore the critical language in the rules which is inconsistent with basic rules of statutory construction as a matter of policy b2h's application confirms that a phased-in bonding approach is reasonable and i want to quickly say the bond doesn't stay at one dollar for the entire life the bond is designed to increase up to the full decommissioning amount by 100 years so it starts at year 50 increasing on a regular basis the cost to the maintain a bond is high and as mr ratcliffe said would be borne by rate payers moreover the risk that the company would ever retire b2h before 100 years is extremely low high voltage transmission lines are designed to operate in perpetuity and the company couldn't find any example of a 500 kv line that was ever additionally it's well understood that one of the most daunting challenges to achieving the greenhouse gas reductions required of oregon's electric utilities is the need to significantly increase close to doubling the amount of transmission capacity that we have given the urgent need for this capacity it's hard to imagine that b2h would be retired before the end of its useful and finally even in the unlikely scenario that the line did need to be it's highly unlikely that the company would default on its decommissioning obligat obligations given its financial financial strength and its status as a public utility that's been in existence for a hundred years and i do want to briefly mention ms gilbert points to the fact that the council did not allow a phased-in approach for the bake oven solar project but that decision isn't on point because bake oven wasn't similarly situated as was pointed out by the hearing officer specifically in that order the council stated that the developer is an independent power producer and not a public utility which would have access to rate recovery authorization from the state puc to dismantle and restore a facility for those reasons we ask you to adopt the hearing officer's recommendation to adopt a phased-in approach thank you hey miss rapner any questions from councilman condon member condon um thank you for being here today for so long and something tells me the next few days just a question for you um as you have done transmission lines in other states i think i'm allowed to ask this um do you have security instruments on any of your transmission lines so before we do answer this question uh we do need to stick to what is already in the evidentiary record if i don't have the full record in front of me right now so i can't um you know completely assure that that's the case but i would ask that we do stick to what's in the record and i am really sorry but there is nothing in the record on that question all right thank you very much thank you miss raptner thank you if i may i'll quickly share the department's position with regard to this contestant case issue patrick rowe with the department of justice don't want to repeat too much uh we do ms rachner stated we disagree with ms gilbert's position that uh this is that council is bound to require uh a bonding more than what has been proposed as ms rachner pointed out the rule gives council discretion uh it's essentially what council finds to be satisfactory to uh to comply with the standard or to provide assurance the department believes that the proposed gradual of financial assurance is appropriate because it recognizes the low risk that the proposed facility would be retired in the first several decades of operation and the low risk that the applicant would not be able to pay for decommissioning and restoration if it were to be retired early this facility is distinct from other energy facilities that come before council for the reasons that ms rachner noted it is just an energy facility it's a transmission line being proposed by a utility with a long history of operation and inability to recover costs from rate payers if necessary a couple comments that ms gilbert made in her oral testimony uh she referenced and it might have kind of slipped through that council is precluded from applying a balancing to the retirement financial assurance standard that is correct and i'll remind council what the balancing determination is the balancing determination says that if an applicant comes to the department of counsel and says we don't think we can meet this particular standard they can ask council to apply a balancing determination and assess whether the overall public benefits of the proposal outweigh the adverse effect on the resource that's protected by the standard so for example if it was the fish and wildlife standard they say we can't meet that well council could deter to balance and say well do the benefits of this proposed facility outweigh the impacts on fish and wildlife that's not happening here the applicant has not said they can't meet the standard and the department has not uh applied a balancing determination to this standard uh ms gilbert also mentioned court decisions that say that say council is prevented from waiving again that's not what's happening here the department is not recommending that council waive the retirement financial assurance standard it's to the contrary the count the department has recommended how council can find compliance with the standard see i'm running low on time so that's all i have for now thank you any questions after condon uh council member condom for the record um mr rope um i think i think this question is appropriate um in the material um it the uh cost to rate payers is um included and as far as f-sec is concerned that does not come under per view or it's not within our jurisdiction how much it's going to cost rate payers is that correct that's correct that's a that's a public utility commission issue yeah thank you okay so um once again now that we've heard from everyone um you are free to ask me any questions that you might want to in terms of uh legal issues and this is open for deliberation as far as the contested um case is concerned i i don't have any um questions or concerns about that but i do have some concerns about the proposed order and so i are we going to wait we want to wait for that discussion or excuse me for the record todd cornett so we can either consolidate and make one sort of straw poll like i talked originally but if you're concluded that you have uh you agree with the hearing officer on the proposed contested case order and you just want to deal with that straw poll right now we can deal with that and then you can move back to the proposed order it is entirely your choice it'd be nice to check that off okay so i don't have any objections to the contested case order mrs hanley sorry it's the council member content for the record thank you uh the contested case order is taking into consideration the proposed order as we see it right i mean she's the administrative law judge has made a decision on the contested cases i don't have any issues with that so as long as it doesn't touch as long as we have an opportunity to question the proposed order you're good to go okay so you want me to call the cholesterol poll so i have the council agrees with the findings of fact conclusions of law and conditions of approval in the proposed contested case order pertaining to issue and if that sounds good i will call cindy condon jordan truitt and buyer hanley jenkins yes harry choctoot ken howe yes thank you so we're back now to the proposed order retirement and financial assurance standard one counselors have comments counselor condon and i'm i'm i'm telling tardy weather here i'm uh passing the ball and i'm to the extent there's a little bit of lag but i'm trying to pull it up here excuse me this is the court reporter um yes chris yeah i wasn't sure if um council member condom was saying anything because everybody was muted okay thank you um what was the what was the last thing you have recorded it said so counselors have comments and then it went to you so i'm saying if ms uh or council member condon said anything it was not recorded thank you this is councilmember condon and i will repeat it i would like to turn the attention to recommended retirement and financial assurance condition five and i think it's now brought up on the screen with respect to that i think what we as we've discussed this project is very different than some of the others we've discussed in the past but i also think that 50 years is a very long time and obviously 100 years is even longer i question dollar for the first 50 years uh this is a changing industry i think we're going to see more change in the next 20 years than we've seen in the last 70 and so from a financial perspective it strikes me that we by conditioning this project as we have suggested here we are putting oregon taxpayers as the should something happen it might not be likely but it could happen and certainly given the changes in energy per generation um just everything that's going on in in energy and what i would like to see here right now the added language what in red in the document is the department shall review the five year idaho power would be obligated to do a five-year report and i would like the report to be annual or i'd like to see it as an annual report and in addition that um or at any time required by the council should something happen bankruptcy some event that would um cause us concern in terms of the the conditions we put on that thing they obligate taxpayers of the state to be that backstop i'm uncomfortable so i i would like us to retain the ability to always um come back and say we need a bond to speak to the wrist risk cindy i'm i'm not clear",

        "text": " thank you we can go ahead and Skip ahead to the next one again my name is Dale pan I'm the state affairs partner at CFM and as Kirby mentioned Wayland And I also have the honor of representing the interests of Chariots at the Salem Capitol which is under a heavy amount of construction right now and this is the first time we've actually been able to be back in the building for a couple years so this is fantastic and semi-new experience for a lot of people so this is the agenda that I wanted to talk about today we wanted to provide a little bit of a primer on our state affairs team talk about the 2023 legislative session some of the important timelines and dates and processes that we're working through some of the major issues and tensions that we see in the building topics that either directly or indirectly can impact Transportation conversations and then we want to discuss the 2023 State Legislative agenda which your legislative committee has discussed go through all of the concepts there in Greater detail we put together also some bills that either again directly or indirectly can impact transit or transportation that we are closely monitoring and then we want to also go over some of the new legislative faces and some of the new facts around the building and how that can impact some of the advocacy efforts that we are going to be pursuing so if we can to the next slide there we go so this is our state affairs team at CFM we have five full-time lobbyists we have a legal extern from Willamette and we also have an intern for Willamette who's helping us this session both Waylon and I do the bulk of the work for chariots and so you'll see us in the building pretty regularly we have offices in here in Salem and because we are back in the building it's a fantastic opportunity if legislators are in this area to get some of the board to to meet them as well so we can go ahead and Skip To The Next One so the 2023 legislative session lawmakers lobbyists members of the public all of us returned to the Capitol this past week to start the 2023 legislative session it is during the the odd numbered years which 2023 is one of those we have a long session which is a 160 day maximum where it starts January 17th and that 160 days can go to June 25th we can adjourn early but that doesn't always happen there's a lot of discussion horse trading and budget debates that happen towards the last month of session that can really stretch that out uh one of the next big dates that's very important is February 1st traditionally Governors will release ahead of a long session their Governor's recommended budget in the around December 1st or right around that time before a legislative session but because we had an election and a brand new governor they're going to be releasing Governor Kotex going to be releasing her Budget on February 1st and that starts the long four or five month process of a budget discussions with the legislature and that is the kind of the starting starting Pace legislators then take a look at that and make decisions whether or not to what they want to keep what they want to toss out and then proceed so um early days of a legislative session are often kind of dedicated to briefings and updates to ensure kind of the incoming and returning lawmakers have all the information and relevant background details and they need to do their job we have 38 new legislators who have not been in the building or have only been in the building since the 38 out of 90. that's a huge chunk and as you can imagine each one of them brings unique perspective perspectives Insight education awareness about certain issues to the building none of them is a is a expert on everything and so there's going to need to be a lot of education on Transit and transportation for those legislators very few legislators who are around for the 2017 package the transportation package are still there those who are are Diamonds in the Rough and we need to um continue to meet with them and educate them so that they can help their legislators or other fellow legislators who are new to understand what went on there the fact that we passed a historic dedicated Transit funding source during that period and we need to continue to protect that some of the major issues that we see this year include houselessness and housing Behavioral Health discussions around the I-5 Bridge up in the Portland area tolling the semiconductor industry Investments there's going to be quite a bit of discussion around how do we in Oregon take advantage of the chips act and how do we invest more in that vital industry and then also as I mentioned the umbrella of the capital renovation hangs over everything if you've been in the building before and many of you probably have you've been under the Rotunda you've been to the the the meeting areas outside of the the chambers all of that is closed off to the public right now it's just that main hallway outside of the hearings and then the member offices so you can imagine how challenging that can be to considering how much room we had to how much we have now and construction noise is constant during hearings if you listen on olis the Oregon legislative information system you can often hear jackhammering or hammers or saws or whatnot in the background it's going to be part of the legislative record for all time so it can sometimes be a distracting measure when you're discussing something very sensitive and then to have that kind of noise so it's it's a different environment but we are back in person and that's fantastic we had 1900 bills introduced last week and we expect several hundred more so it's quite a bit to go through and we've gone through that first bucket of bills we've worked with a general manager Pollock and your teams to identify ones that directly impact Transit and that's what we want to talk about a little bit more here so this next slide is our state legislative agenda this is split up into different priority levels level one two level one is the highest priority levels you could imagine this is one that we were going to directly Advocate on as issues pop up the most important thing that we have on here and we have this on here every year is around preserving maintaining and enhancing the public transportation Investments particularly those from House Bill 2017 from the 2017 session this is the stiff money that has helped provide Operational Support and funding for you and all the other Transit entities around the state dedicated funding which we have never had before in the state of Oregon protecting that is our number one priority because there's always an interest when there's a pot of money in the legislature to say well maybe I can take a little bit of that and use it over here and we've had that already happen before even the first dollar came out of that pop so we always have to maintain that we also want to check and monitor any discussions around zero emission Vehicles as Kirby and the federal team have indicated uh your future is in low Mission or electric vehicles and we want to make sure if there are any opportunities either from a policy or a budget standpoint where we can chime in and educate lawmakers and try to direct some of that spending appropriately is um we also want to make sure that we support any and all Investments around footpaths and bike bicycle trails as a robust Continuum of Transit and transportation systems is necessary and then we have several other bills House Bill 277 and I realize there's a typo there House Bill 277 is an issue related to public transit surcharges on parking violations and other things around the city this is an issue we're going to be tracking it's introduced I think by representative Evans it's going to be something we're going to be tracking very closely I-5 Bridge replacement as I mentioned that's a huge conversation directly impacting transportation TNC legislation Transportation Network companies these companies like uber and Lyft we often see one or two or three pieces of legislation each year around those how they can operate their regulations and whatnot so we're going to be tracked excuse me tracking that very closely tolling I already mentioned that's a huge component for transportation and then the nemt legislative concept that's non-emergency medical transportation that's actually House Bill 2845 that has been introduced now when we created the State Legislative agenda that had not been identified yet but that's when we're going to be tracking very closely the non-emergency medical transportation issue traditionally provided by the the Coordinated Care organizations the ccos around Oregon how those and those entities manage the transportation for senior people with disabilities and others there's been some concern around how that's provided and there's going to I think be a robust discussion around that that is led by Senator Deb Patterson who is a your Senator or senator of a component of the service area that you have so I want to stop there and take a moment and see if anyone has questions on any of the 2023 State Legislative agenda items director Navarro thank you president Davidson so the question that I had is could you repeat the the bill for the non-emergency medical transportation yes 2845 House Bill 2845 awesome and then so just this morning we had received a uh email about House Bill 2662 and that's asking for support of um a commuter rail that would come to Salem and it would be stopping in Woodburn and Kaiser I I believe I mean I'm not sure because they're still investigating it but I think that that would include the the Kaiser Transit Center so my question is where would that lie on our priorities or is this something that we haven't made a so uh thank you for the the question director Navarro that is an issue that popped up after we had developed our legislative agenda and so that one is one I think under discussion and the board today uh and the the good thing about this legislative agenda process that we have is it allows us some flexibility to Pivot because we never know going into session all the bills that are going to be in front of us and we need direction from you and to our manager Pollock to give us the ability and flexibility to meet with other Transit Advocates with these issues pop up and be able to Advocate appropriately and so I'll wait for direction from the board tonight and then we'll we'll be willing to Advocate and work on this issue awesome thank you other questions okay we can go to the next slide",

        "text": " It's a great question. And, you know, I want to echo and empathize with the frustration of the person you're talking about. It can be challenging. There is a prioritization system we use. It's not a black box, but it can feel like one when you're trying to access services. So I just. I want to make sure that's acknowledged on the record. Do you have more to. I mean, yeah, I'll just say services have expanded in all three counties. Right. So that's less of a factor. The implementation of time place manor ordinances has changed. The population was generally more mobile throughout the region. And again, we do track how many people, where people spend the bulk of their time and where they order last homes, but it's a variable population, so the data is not super reliable. I'll just say, anecdotally, most of the folks that we're serving, especially in street outreach and shelters, and I freehand thing, are both community in this community for quite some time. And I say this community is Washington county. And then my other question was, I've had some people approach me as they're doing taxes for the year who are angry at not you, they're angry at us because of the metro tax. So I direct them to Metro. But I was wondering, lethally, by the way, anyway, I was wondering, is there any concern in pr, like you were talking about data? Are you aggregating data and giving it to Metro for PR purposes so people know where their money is going? Because this is what I hear. I'm paying all these taxes and I still see homeless. What is going on? Does that make sense? Absolutely. And, councillor, let me just say, yes, we do extensive quarterly reporting that includes all of our outcome data by race and ethnicity regularly going to Metro. And they've been working to build up their homes team, so they're getting more folks on board and they are trying to get together and have more collaboration with the counties of how we do communications. I'll just say I've been doing housing work for a bit at the public facing side and we always need help telling our story. So if I can make an ask of you all to help tell a story, we're happy to give you resources, but there's a lot of good stories to tell. There's. Those aren't always the exciting slashy stories that you see on the front page. So there is some work to get more communications and public pr out there. And if you're able to help, happy to give you some materials. Great. Thank you. Thank you each for asking the hard questions because those are the ones that I, all councilors probably hear from time to time. Why is there still a problem if there's so much money to be devoted to? Are we in fact import from people who are canadian that find our services better, usually more easily accessed? One question I have, I'm pretty familiar with the whole program and their onboarding software and how expensive their background, the information they gather about a particular person can help them. What are you guys using for that database? So that we're following them through their journey from homelessness to, let's say, housing and hopefully jobs down the line and whatever. Whatever helps them become a productive citizen. I'll start and pass over to Kathryn. And I just have to say I'm so excited by these questions. Thank you for your interest. We use the homeless information management system. It's regulated by HUD that we use what is known as hmIs. And there's kind of different models of it. Different communities have implementation plans that look different. In the metro region, we use a company called Blue Skyd that is operated by the joint office. It's in transition, but it's a regionally held database that we use to maybe talk about intake, but we use to intake folks, and then it does help us track them throughout the system. It's also used for prioritization. It's an incredibly helpful tool that is not just a place for information to store, but also program through the help deliver resources, supports collaboration with providers as well as move from an outreach program to a shelter housing program. There's that record stays with them. I understand also it's helpful in garnering like federal resources and stuff if they're available, if they qualify or whatever. So that's good to do to kind of follow up on that, I think it's also, I don't know where it's documented, but I always feel like when we have these conversations, I wish we had more reminders, like you're talking about comms and stuff, is reminding how many different ways houselessness can look. You know, being in a school, families that are considering title ten McKenna Bento qualified. They may look different than what people think. A stereotypical house, this person looks like on the street. Right. They're still within the same category, but different needs, so to speak. And so when I hear your information, I wonder, what do each schools look like? My sister, for example, would work. A lot of moms that had just escaped domestic violence, and now they were homeless children in the program that they access might look different than others, but they also kind of fall under that umbrella of need. And so whether it is developing something more pr so people are aware, maybe there is an impact. You're just not seeing the ones that you would see from neighbors on the street, as opposed to people who follow through different profile of what houselessness looks like. And then the second question was, unfortunately, is, I love the numbers of how many outreach people you have. Like, that is amazing. Like, where did you find these people? But at the same time, I also know one of the biggest challenges is retaining those numbers and trying to not have a bunch of turnover. And I know you guys are the experts on this and have probably experienced a lot of that. Is there anything kind of woven into this model that will help retain amazing people who are doing path? That's part of the structure. Questions and I'll start. Okay, your first question. Yes, absolutely. Homelessness looks different for every single one of the people that we serve in their pathway to getting to the place where they're reaching out to us has been different. One very exciting thing, because family homelessness does look different. And those McKinney schools are an incredible resource for finding those households and getting the connections in Washington county are actually able to do assessments. And so they're in the process of being able to. To be that entry point for those families and youth as well, to come into the system and access housing resources. And the way our prioritization system works, we do prioritize families with children and youth as well. And then the second question, can we go for the second? Just one more on the first. And that's to kind of put a term to what you're describing in terms of homelessness looking different. One thing particularly for families of color that we see is they're more likely to be doubled up. So that's one, two family living in one unit, which puts them at great risk for addiction. So I want to call that. Thank you for mentioning that. It's incredibly important thing we have to look at and consider what is the face of homelessness? Who is experiencing homelessness, how are they experiencing homelessness and what interventions are they committing? So wanted to call that out and maybe I'll take question two and toss it back to you. So on your second question, retention is a key part of the common things we're having, and that's why we're so, we're so careful about living wage and pay equity. That is going to be key to keeping folks, as you all know, with your city staff. If you pay them off and treat them with respect, they're more likely to stay. And it's incredibly important that our organizations are doing that, as well as our counties and, and our members. I would just add that part of our work plan for the current year is to working closely with supervisors within those organizations and supporting them and giving them the tools that you need to support them. For individuals and families experiencing homelessness, they're most likely also experiencing hunger. Is there some type of food access programs that are being incorporated. Incorporated into the services that we're providing? In access centers and shelters all provide food. It's also a standard part of the intake and assessment process is identifying are you an eligible person out? And if not, and if you are, have you sure that folks are able. They're accessing all of the mainstream resources that they are eligible for, but also teaching them how to find resources in their communities that are happening. They're accessing all of those available resources and, as needed, able to access support through that. Thank you. And then what are we seeing? These spillover with veterans, with assistance to veterans? I know they have their own system. Do they behave? But there may be exchange meeting. Are you seeing spillover? Yes, we also serve veterans. We have a veterans case conferencing. And so veterans are able to access both VA resources as well as resources through. But the VA doesn't provide homeless services. No. Yeah. Okay, so I'm wondering. No, there are different services they provide through. You were saying spillover as though the VA provided multi services, which they don't. As far as the primary program serving veterans are the grand peridum program, Vash vouchers, SSVF program. Those are part of the veterans continuum. And yes, there's crossover between ensuring those two systems. Thank you for recently adopted camping ordinances and culture sections in Washington. County. Have you seen any impact from that, those decisions collectively on the homeless and other reactions? Yes, we've seen an impact. One, the number and size of encampments has decreased. I'm sure you all noticed during, especially during",

        "text": " go through this the biden administration is has been referring to this funding under the infrastructure law as a once in general once in a generation investment in our infrastructure systems and energy is certainly included as part of that overall investment the biden administration also has concerns about investing these federal dollars so that the benefits serve communities that have been historically disadvantaged while there's many details and definitions still to be set at the federal level it does look like the biden administration intends to direct 40 of the benefits of these funds that are energy related under the infrastructure investment and jobs act disadvantaged communities and so here at odo we'll be keeping this requirement in mind as we shape up all of our relevant proposals and program and you can see some of the federal executive orders that that touch on some of these issues related to disadvantaged communities and serving those that have been historically underserved and that aligns with some state priorities because here at oda we recognize that historically there have been certain groups that have been left out of the decision-making roles when it comes to energy policy and it's our intention to do better to address these equity concerns with these fundings however we recognize we have much to learn as we go forward in addressing some of these issues and much work that lies ahead of us as we start to roll out these infrastructure funds in our communities and start to see their the difference that they're able to make and so all of that brings us to the reason of why we're here today seeking your input through this webinar and the portal as well for some of the higher level context the funding that we're talking about today is federal funding and this graphic actually comes to us from one of the federal funding streams that we expect to receive a boost under the infrastructure investment and jobs act but it does have a nice graphic that represents how we anticipate the funds will reach oregon at its source the funds are appropriated by congress where they are then assigned to a federal agency to administer from there the funds are granted to the states through either formula or competitive grants and that will depend on the nature of the exact fund and the federal requirements that are set by congress it's also possible that because the funds are federal in the nature that federal agencies may set additional requirements or issue additional guidance that directs the the purpose of the funding and some of the requirements as well as what the funding can be used for as a res um because of this the state may have some more flexibility in certain federal funding streams than in others as far as what we may be able to invest these these federal funding streams uh dollars so today we're seeking your input so we can develop guiding priorities that will assist the agency with all aspects of our grant seeking for these federal in doing so we have been speaking with the energy suppliers and developers community-based organizations and tribal and local governments just to name a few to get their impressions of what we need to consider to bring these funds into our state and put them to the best use in the next few slides we'll cover at a high level what some of the federal investments are and as we go through this information please consider and think about what might be missing from this list of items that we'll be discussing in addition if odo could pick only one thing to invest in what would be the best thing for us to do we'll be asking for your response in just a few slides based on what we know we believe the state energy program will receive an additional boost of about 600 or 6.5 million dollars which can be used for a broad spectrum of items from investments in clean energy energy efficiency programs and resilience activities we estimate receiving approximately another 3.2 million in funding for energy efficiency programs and that will be a combination of programs under a revolving loan fund and other portions that will be available for direct grants to local governments under the energy efficiency and conservation block grant program in addition to that we expect that the oregon housing and community services agency will receive somewhere in the neighborhood of 34.7 million for weatherization and energy conservation programs for low-income households we also anticipate that the oregon department of transportation will receive approximately 50 million dollars to assist with electric vehicle charging and uh as a recent update we anticipate that oda will receive approximately 50 million dollars to allocate for grid resistance uh resilience investments and that um under that particular fund we will be having a separate public hearing on that coming up in the near future later this summer as part of the application process for the state to apply to the us department of energy to seek those funds to invest in oregon and lastly we do anticipate a competitive training opportunity that's specific to a need we've heard about which addresses the need for additional trained energy auditors and so states will be eligible to apply up to two million dollars to help train um energy auditors that can help with additional energy efficiency programs and so with that i think i'd like to pause and see if there are any questions that have arisen in the chat that would be a good question to address at this time thanks jen i don't see any questions in the chat but i'll invite people to raise their hands if they have any questions about what we've covered so far knowing that we'll may answer them later in the presentation so you're also welcome to hold them until the end or put them in the chat as you as they occur to you i'm not seeing any oh i see one raised um stacy can you please take joshua off mute there we go go ahead joshua hi thanks this is joshua bassifen from climate solutions um thanks jen for that presentation can you clarify on the resilience and reliability piece is that something odo still needs to apply that's a discretionary grant that you still need to apply for is that graphs uh so actually with the grid resilience fund the resiliency and reliability that is mentioned there that is approximately 50 million uh that is a formula grant that is open to um states and and tribes to apply for and we anticipate an annual allocation of approximately 10 million dollars for five years each to reach the cumulative 50 million dollars so while it is formula we do still need to prepare an and in our application to the us department of energy we'll need to describe some of the criteria in which we will choose to invest that that funding into areas that can enhance our grid and so that's actually the topic that will probably be the prime focus of the public hearing that will be happening later this summer uh this information is all relatively new to our agency um the official funding opportunity only released last week and so we don't yet have a date set for that public hearing but we'll be sure to let everyone know as as soon as we're able to um provide a date for that great thank you thanks jen and we do have a few questions that have come up in the chat one request to go back to the previous slide if you can so go back to slide 10 for a minute and just as a reminder to folks on the phone all of these slides are up on our website we have a question about whether the auditors are state auditors or utility-based and i'm not sure we have an answer to that question yet because we haven't set up a program but i'll see jen if you have anything to add anything to offer you know um under the energy auditor training program it's a really a workforce development focused opportunity so it's about how do we train energy auditors wherever they may land in employment um ultimately we we want to make sure that the folks that we invest training dollars in are hopefully gainfully employed at the end of that so i think there could be a wide um array of opportunities under that fund and that's also one we are seeking information on and kind of preparing for a competitive opportunity that we anticipate will open up in in the future great thank you um and i see that we have a another hand raised and john we will come to you in a moment in the meantime jen we have a question in the chat will the state be administering the energy efficiency loans or just providing funding to organizations to administer the energy efficiency loans i think that's a question that we are still working on the exact determination since it is a loan there are lending requirements and that's a topic we are are certainly exploring um in our capacity to lend or whether it makes more sense for someone else to be a third party lender such as a grain bank so all topics we're we're still great thank you and um stacy can you please take john off me there you go john you can ask your question question about the state energy program the 6.5 million funding uh and and can you describe a little bit about what the you know envisioned as the the use of the 6.5 you supporting uh you know investments for clean energy is that to create like a think tank or study on what directions you know the state should be going in or kind of you know what is that uh 6.5 uh how's the use of that is envisioned yeah so um as from a a federal perspective which is where the underlying uh statutory authorization comes from the state energy program has a pretty broad basis for the types of projects that that that funding can be used in so it can be used for energy planning activities it can be used for studies and it can certainly be used for on the ground investments in energy efficiency type programs there are some limitations that are specific to that to that program um but it is perhaps i i think one of the broader applications of of the funding that we see before us as an opportunity under the infrastructure investment and jobs act so i'm i'm happy to follow up with some more detailed information about that but the the list of authorized program activities is quite long all right thank you jen um i think we've addressed most of the questions and feel free to keep them coming in chat um but in the meantime i will turn it back to you to go to the next slide and just as another note um overall the act includes nearly 100 billion dollars for additional funding for infrastructure projects and some of these um are items that we are hearing about from other agencies and other entities that may be eligible to apply or are starting to think about preparing their applications and so these are just some of the opportunities that are presented to to folks that are available under the infrastructure",

meet our goals there may be trade-offs that require policy discussions and we didn't go into that level of detail in the report but mostly to say that we have enough renewable energy potential in this state we might not want to use it all we might want to sort of think about other resources available in other states in a more efficient way to get at those through a regional transmission organization or otherwise but sort of thinking about all of those options in a holistic way is what I think the energy strategy might help to to help lay out and I think that citing might be one of the things that are involved in that as well thank you Regine I will say that land use planning came up quite a bit during the natural the U.S climate Alliance natural and working lands learning lab in April and you know the op the need and opportunity to think renewable energy citing is definitely on a lot of States minds and there's a lot of interest renewed interest I think in that so opportunities to collaborate with other states and think about how how we're all approaching this certainly Oregon is well ahead in the land use management uh and regulation than many other states but so an opportunity for Oregon to kind of show the way but also to think through this new body of development uh associated with renewable energy and how to best address that commissioner Decker yeah I just wanted to say in response to commissioner Afters and point there that you know permitting is a lot about sort of getting transmission projects through the pipeline faster right so we need to like shorten the time frame you know if the pipeline is 20 years long then we're probably behind right now right but it's also a matter of getting transmission projects that are beneficial in the pipeline and I wanted to just mention that there's a good Business Journal article this week about some of the work that needs to be done on a regional basis you know as opposed to maybe just the state or federal basis um with BPA and with other sort of groupings of states to make sure that we're sort of um putting the vision of the future out there and the needs for transmission um are identified so that they can get into the pipeline so the pipeline can move faster with these permanent reforms you're talking about yeah great Point commissioner Decker in it we talked about Regional markets and transmission but it's been over two years now since we had that conversation so it would be great to kind of check back in on those topics and see how things have changed and what if anything we should be uh trying to weigh in on before we move on a participant named Ken raised their hand earlier and I wonder if that is representative Helm and if so if we can Elevate uh representative Helm to be a participant so I don't know if you can unmute Ken here we go if it's me it was an accidental hand okay so this is not representative no okay thank you very much appreciate um any other questions or comments again great work that's really exciting to see this a lot and just a quick uh question does the planning tool include offshore resources oh great question great um so you know our Prime our fun our main funder was a Department of Defense and they have a strong interest in offshore their data was not quite ready for the full level of detail that the onshore version has the onshore version has like very detailed kind of like flight paths that they use but there is offshore information to some degree but it's not the same level of detail I would say it um has significant linkage to another tool that dlcd developed uh which is called the Oro wind map the Oro wind WAP was um it's a it's a tool that was developed in partnership with the Bureau of ocean Energy Management with it which is an agency at the department of interior and uh we tried as much as possible to maintain some connectivity with that separate um with a lot of references and have at least some information about offshore and because we've noticed that when sort of questions arise about offshore wind and there may be some strong concerns there's almost an immediate reaction to say hey why don't we just get that capacity with the solar over there or if there's a question around solar that arises in Asian Oregon they're sort of a natural reaction to say hey how about if we just get that City with offshore wind over there and so you sort of needed to provide at least a broad brush of all of the resources that might be available in the renewable energy sector to sort of have this conversation but thanks for that question it came up quite a bit during the makeup of this tool and will that be some of the follow-on work to kind of build on that the dlcd will do um with you all as part of the implementation of House Bill 3181 you know I think that the focus of that bill will be solar there's a bit of a separate conversation happening with boam around offshore wind and I would um defer to dlcd I think director Bateman is on the line if there's more detail there but I think for now we're going to continue pointing users to the basic level detail and for more information go to the orowind cool great well I am going to move us along um we are about 10 minutes behind a little bit more but again thank you for the great great presentation and um look forward to staying on top of it and seeing how we can engage in some of the follow-on conversations such as Regional markets and transmission thanks for the opportunity Zach back to you here's the agenda the next um I'm very related we're going to hear from the Department of energy from Amy and Edith on kind of how what they're thinking about the development of a state energy strategy and some of that work was thought through and included in the 2022 biennial Energy but great to also hear kind of an update on where things stand today thank you so welcome Amy hi thank you thank you um I am Amy Slusher and I'm joined by my colleague Edith Bayer and we are senior policy analysts with the Oregon Department of energy and we're here to talk about some of the findings from odo's 2022 biennial Energy report and our forthcoming work to develop an energy strategy for Oregon I'm going to start by giving an overview of our charting a course policy brief from our 2022 Energy report next slide please um as you can see from our mission statement on this slide odo's mission is to help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable Energy System the biennial Energy report is a key resource that the agency uses to help oregonians make informed decisions about and it also exemplifies several aspects of what we do it's a central place for Oregon's energy data information and and it can be used for energy education technical assistance and helping identify solutions to organs energy next slide please the 2022 Energy report includes a policy brief titled charting a course for Oregon's Energy Future that explores what it will take to deeply decarbonize Oregon's economy and achieve the state's clean energy targets by mid-century Odo staff reviewed 20 technical studies that indicate it's possible for Oregon to achieve its climate and energy goals through some combination of actions within what are known as the four core pillars of keep to carbonization increase Energy Efficiency to reduce energy consumption electrifies many end uses as possible transition to a clean and renewable electricity system and develop low carbon fuels for hard to Electrify over the next several slides I'll hit on some of the highlights from our review of these studies and I'll try to characterize the multiple Pathways that are available along with the associated trade-offs for each Pathway to achieve our policy goals next slide please the study the studies we reviewed all predicted that demand for electricity will grow significantly in the coming decades and this increase in demand will be driven primarily by increasing electrification of vehicles and Building depending on the pathway that we follow to reach our clean energy Target organs electricity demand is projected to increase by between 50 to 100 percent between now and 2050. in Oregon the First Resource we turn to to meet new electricity load is Energy as more and more electric vehicles and building Technologies come online investments in Energy Efficiency and demand and demand response can help to reduce Peak load provide grid flexibility and conserve energy across the system as electricity demands grow across the state and the region will need to increase Energy Efficiency to often offset new load on the grid we'll also need to decarbonize the electricity flowing through the grid and serving Oregon customers this means we'll need to deploy additional renewable energy resources to meet new electricity demand that isn't reduced through Energy Efficiency while at the same time we'll need to replace existing fossil Resources with renewable resources one study looking at Oregon specifically found a need for as much as 30 gigawatts or 30 000 megawatts of new wind and solar to meet Oregon's electricity needs in 2050 and to put this into context approximately two gigawatts of wind and solar capacity were deployed in Oregon between 2010 and 2020. there are multiple Pathways that we can take to achieve our clean energy targets but the scale of clean energy development will be substantial under every scenario there are also important considerations and trade-offs associated with different Pathways for transitioning to clean for example building more transmission would enable us to Source renewable energy from a broader geographic area or offshore which would increase access to low-cost clean energy while minimizing land use impacts in Oregon but building new transmission infrastructure can be challenging and it can take a decade or more to secure the necessary approvals to build a new line similarly deploying small scale and community-based renewable projects would deliver clean energy while also providing co-benefits like increased energy resiliency and new economic opportunities in local communities but these projects are also likely to be higher cost and larger utility scale projects and can have localized land use so given these and many other trade-offs Oregon will need to engage with stakeholders to identify an optimal Pathway to achieve the level of renewable energy build out needed while balancing these trade-offs next slide please we also need to determine what role will remain for natural gas and existing gas",

        "text": " that soon? That's a whole other topic. We'll be happy to discuss that with you, but that is not what this public hearing is. I know. We desperately need help. Bonding can be done. Go ahead, commissioner. And we did actually have that conversation at the last Florida county commissioner's meeting that we had during the public hearing about the penny sales tax referendum renewal. So if you go back to last week's meeting, you can catch that discussion during then. Thank you. That's a very good suggestion. Behind Miss Han is Miss Kim and behind Miss Kim will be Karen Arman. Miss Kim? Yes. Hi, my name is Kim Goong. He's the first name. So if you could give your address again. Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry. So my address is 6495 Southwest 66th street. If I can get the map up there. This is my concern is I'm on pretty much sharing the property line with the color brac. What the 1300 square feet on the east side that they planning to put the utility in. And also on the previous had before the 65th street, there was like supposed to be an emergency access pretty much. We have not seen the final master plan yet. That is not what this public hearing is about today. It is simply about them establishing the community development district, which, again, is to establish a limited government for those particular infrastructure items that were listed previously. And if you have some comments about that, you're welcome to share. But the development and the land use has been been approved, and again, we have not seen that final master plan at this time, and I cannot speak to that. Okay. I mean, that's fine. Like I said, I just don't want somehow to kind of sign off and we totally forgot. And there's no emergency access from my problem. Yes, all of that will come back and there will be notification again for another public hearing when that time happens. Okay. Like that. Is this the still the same development, the same owner, or. It's the same. Okay. All right. And I wish you guys an opportunity, maybe take a field trip to actually see the area. We're very aware of it. Thank you. We are very aware of the project. Is Miss Armand here? Is there anyone else in the audience who would like to come forward and address the board? If not, I'll bring it back to the applicant. If there's anything you'd like to add before we bring it to and the board to, just briefly, because they raise some legitimate points, and I'm going to address them not necessarily in the order that they did. Miss Dale pointed out the issue that's raised in the email to you all of conflicts of interest, the fact that initially the board members are affiliated with the developer or inframark. Let me first make a distinction between Inframark, who Brian works for, and Calibrax, which is the owner, and the developer. Inframark is a representative that's getting this done, and helping to set up the CDN, helping the market to funds. But the development will be done by Calibrax. So the concerns about who inframark is is not really relevant to this issue. But her point is valid. We've got a board here that consists of people that are affiliated with the developer. Well, that's how it happens. The initial board members are almost always that way, and the statute 190.007 says it's not a conflict under chapter 112 for a board member or the district manager or another employee of the district to be a stockholder, officer, or employee of a landowner or an entity affiliated with a landowner. That's how these things work initially. Now, afterwards, however, there will be elections, and the people living in the CDD, the area encompassed by the CDD, will actually elect the board members at that time. Right now, if you had an election, you'd get the same people elected who we're going to start out with, which are the people affiliated with the developer. So that's not. That's authorized by the statute. And in fact, that's how they happen. The project name is Aurora Oaks, but the developer is the same. It's not uncommon for a developer to cause a project different. Y'all, you just had Chris Armstrong in here. I don't know of any Armstrong acres that are out there. The small business issue is a. I think it's somewhat of a red hearing. These projects will be bid and everybody will be able to participate in them. The local small businesses will have the same opportunity to do the work, just like they have been at other construction projects. So it's not a. It's not a. It's not contrary to small businesses. I think I want to commend Miss Korber for raising the issue with the comp plan, because I like interesting stuff, as y'all know. So just bear with me, if you would. We are obligated to prove that this is not inconsistent with the comp plan. Miss Korber is a thoughtful person. She pointed out that. How have we done that? Well, because I looked at our comp plan and it mentions CDD one time, and the end of our comp plan, there's a list of acronyms, community development district, CDD, but it's not mentioned anywhere else. So I said, okay, well, it's not inconsistent with it, but the comp plan doesn't deal with it. What do you do? And so I looked at the statute and I looked at some cases, and I'm going to bore you with a little bit of statute. First, is from section 190.002, Florida statutes. Same thing with the legislative findings. It is the policy of the state that the process of establishing a CDD pursuant to uniform general law be fair and based only on factors, material to managing and financing the service delivery function of the district, so that any matter concerning permitting or planning of the development is not material or relevant. As you pointed out, we're not here to reconsider that. But in fact, because inconsistency with the comp plan is in the statute, it does come up. And one of the cases that it came up in, and by the way, these are. This is not the only case in which it's discussed, is a CDD division of administrative hearing decision, 1997 WL 105-3424 involving the project timpani of springs. I'm just going to read you a small part of it. No provision of the Lee county or state comprehensive plan prohibits the creation and establishment of CDD's. Thus, the creation of the CDD could not contravene any express plan provision. Just like in Marion county, we don't deal with it. So it's that at that level it's not inconsistent. However, a finding that the proposed CDD would not be inconsistent requires more than a finding that the plans do not prohibit the creation of a CDD. The factor requires analysis of whether proposed CDD would be inconsistent with the operative provisions of the plans, including the local government flume. Then it goes through and analyzes certain factors from the Lee county flume that are almost verbatim to ours. First is that you have to have infrastructure concurrent with the impacts of development. This is one way to achieve that. As the statute points out, the existence of the CDD powers may accelerate or even permit residential and commercial development of previously undeveloped areas, a goal consistent with those in our comp plan. The points out that the property is consistent with the comp plan in terms of the land use and zoning which we'll get into in a little bit. And it points out that these CDDs are consistent with provisions of comp plans very similar to ours that talk about economically feasible plans which coordinate the location of timing or new development with the provision of infrastructure by government agencies, private utilities and other sources, promotes contiguous and compact growth, and is consistent with the urban growth boundary. That Lee county comp plan contains provisions almost verbatim to ours. But then here's what they say. If there's a development order that vests certain development rights and petitioner, then the consistency determination is perhaps a foregone conclusion absent and explicit prohibition in a local government comp plan against using CDD's. So in this case, they were doing it for a project that did not have the entitlements. Yet they went through the analysis. They said there's nothing in the comp plan that prohibits that. Nonetheless, a CDD is consistent with these other goals. And then they said, but by the way, if you already have the entitlements, you're by definition not inconsistent. Actually, they don't say it quite that then they say it's perhaps a far gone conclusion. I would suggest that as the statute points out, we're not here to relitigate permitting and planning, but the entitlements that the project has, I think are relevant to it. The goals of our comp plan are relevant to it. The professional opinion that staff has rendered that it's consistent with the comp plan are relevant to that. And I think this is an interesting issue. But in light of these authorities, I think that the. I think that the staff recommendation based on not being inconsistent with the comp plan is definitely valid. Thank you Mister Gooding, I'll bring it back to the board for action. I do have a question. Sure. So Jimmy, Mister Gooding, if you could please come back. This is going to have a homeowner association too. Yes. So what actually outlines the demarcation? I know that's been an issue in the past with some CDD's. The demarcation between responsibilities and how that gets laid out. And Brian can come up here and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the last presentation you. You generally want the homeowners association to handle ARV matters,",

        "text": " everybody else thank you thank you there's a comment from dave model in the chat i don't see any other questions or hands raised right now from the members of the committee um but dave's comment is just that a usda we study from 2012 found that there was 110 megawatts of hydropower potential at non-powered dams in oregon including the one you just described well thank you well thank you and if anyone has any questions and one question just did come in thanks um so uh i'm just gonna ask this one uh it sent to me but the person asked if i could just say that just ask the question uh as damn removal moves forward on the klamath and soon on the snake um are there conversations about dam removal at um there's not don't bowman was put in one of the key or key reasons why bowman was put in was flood prevention so crooked river is really different from the deschutes that he shoots his groundwater fed and it's really pretty stable throughout the year you know on a normal year primeval reservoir flows go essentially to zero and they may peak at 10 000 cfs during the spring so historically primeval flooded like every two or three years and primeval would flood if we removed bowman dam all right well thank you eric and steve so yeah that's um it's a it's a tough one to hear this is sad when you know you have a project that provides you know a an environmental benefit but gets shot down based on an environmental policy and um i don't know if there are any specific recommendations that would come out of for you know consideration by the legislature but certainly you know in in instances when dams are already in place and have already had negative environmental impact associated with dams um if you can add you know hydropower to that dam and improve the water to chemistry as a result of the project um it seems like you're you're doing doing a lot of a lot of good in the system and so um hopefully this project still has some some legs in the future so thanks for sharing this yeah we appreciate it thank you all righty i think we will move on to our next presenter katie martin with elemental energy is going to talk about trying to develop some large-scale projects within city of portland i think if we are katie if you're ready we will just kick it right off all right same sounds good thanks rob uh yeah my name is katie martin i am the construction manager for elemental energy we're a solar storage and electrical contractor based here in and serving oregon and southwest i've had the pleasure of also had the pleasure of serving on the as a board director for the oregon solar and storage industries association and i chair the technical committee there so for today we're going to focus on challenges and opportunities related to rooftop solar installations there is a focus on the city of portland jurisdiction in next slide please the city of portland building and development services has had its challenges for years becovet has really elevated them as they quickly tried to shift online permitting processes it's common knowledge that some solar contractors have just chosen to decline work in portland specifically because of the troubled permitting it's important to note that solar contractors are just a portion of the overwhelming pressure to reform the permitting practices of the city are just a few uh we're going to talk just about a few of the the pain points um continuing to be felt by businesses developers and contractors across the city uh we'll be looking at extended timelines customer service ballasted planning and zoning codes and we'll also talk about challenges and other but starting with city of portland the the bureau structure is really kind of uh the root of all this the city is run by elected official commissioners uh the commissioners are assigned city departments in which to manage uh due to this fact it's kind of rare for a commissioner to be a professional in the type of work that they're and given the elected nature a long tenure in the position is also pretty rare the departments are by and large segregated from each other so at last count i believe there are seven departments that play a role in permitting services and with seven cooks in the kitchen there's a redundancy confusion and even times where bureaus are at complete odds with each other a couple of examples of specific commercial plan reviews can happen with multiple bureaus looking at the same thing electrical trade permits we'll be looking at the same plan sets as the fire and in cases they're using completely separate codes where electrical is up to date for 2020 code fire may be looking at 2017 they're looking at the same thing and they're giving conflicting results of our permits another example are valuations the valuations or how much a project costs kicks you into multiple different reviews projects over twenty five thousand not very large have to be processed through urban um i had a college here in town that applied for a rooftop solar permit and were asked to provide a tree survey of their entire campus costing tens of thousands of dollars in order to do so really tree survey requirements not only costly but they really have no place in solar permitting processes um there is a task force and several work groups concurrent currently working on permitting improvements and while some changes have been made we still have a ways to go it's still widely felt that the bureau of development services is stifling development in portland and solar is one of the sectors being the project shown here is the new multnomah county courthouse as as you all may know you know projects being built with public funds are required to have a renewable aspect to them so both those projects as well as projects receiving funds from the portland clean energy are really running into roadblocks where the state or the city are supporting such projects but the permitting department is really stifling them most of the issue comes with timelines the timelines of permits are basically measured in months for the city of portland prescriptive projects we have two buckets for projects prescriptive and those that don't need engineering or those that do prescriptive projects should really be permitted in the same day this was many times the case prior to covet and portland but now that things have moved online the process for application upload intake review and issuance is stretching to weeks but flat roof commercial projects the large scale stuff always requires engineering for the code and once on that track the timelines are usually there's little transparency in the a little ability for direct and the process can easily slow um or stop altogether that compounded with customer service issues it's really hard to get resolved so moving on just to the customer service piece is really the access to information ability to ask questions overall transparency and specifically related to the new online permitting processes i think it's important to note that the staff at bds are by and large you know knowledgeable willing to help but they're understaffed and using tools and processes that are just prone to for an example we had three three or four applications submitted in january the process failed on their end those applications were deleted altogether and without the ability to get a hold of a person or talk to someone or work through the complications we lost two to three months in in those projects before they were able to be restarted i want to talk a little about ballasted for large scale large-scale commercial ballast systems are the most commonly deployed they incorporate concrete blocks to weight the system down that resists the wind and seismic forces and they reduce the need for roof attachments so they really make these systems ideal to prevent water and really efficient to install low profile low maintenance really great great and widely accepted throughout the u.s the city of portland has in the past year put out guidelines for permitting of ballasted systems the guideline though requires additional info engineering above and beyond the state and other municipalities the requirement includes providing a third party peer review of the standard engineering package this adds again more time and more cost to developments i'm happy to report that we have three ballasted projects in the city of portland this year but i am still disappointed with speaking to city engineers in the i had a call with a city engineer stating i give up and another stating i have nothing more to argue so they issued the permits these are proven technologies fully supported engineering packages and these comments reflect an adversarial attitude within the city towards solar rather than fostering development to help reach many goals set by the city as well as the state next slide please oh the picture's not showing up oh there it is um so you know there was a focus on city of portland there um other municipalities um it's really just the the patchwork of processes across the state um between counties cities they use different online platforms um those that aren't using online platforms are still wanting us to admit stuff in person or by mail they use different forms they want us to name things when we're uploading differently just different conventions and different fees and timelines so really the challenges across the state aren't necessarily the specific things we're seeing in city of portland it's more just a lack of consistency it's a patchwork and sometimes hard to navigate the varying requirements this slide here is a one megawatt project in the city of wood village so out near troutdale it's for northwest natural pet foods we worked with the the city of wood village partnered with the city of gresham for the permitting of this project incredibly collaborate collaborative and the process took about four weeks to so really quite something for for a rooftop project of this size next slide please so as far as opportunities um i'm not going to focus specifically on portland for this slide um i think there's some larger pieces to the puzzle there but i i would say that you know the overarching themes here are making these processes more streamlined consistent if we had a consistent platform that everyone was using and consistent submittals that everyone was looking for that we could really help not only the but the jurisdictions um processing these permits um in order you know after streamlining and making it all easier it would be really great to see reduced permitting fees and and part of the the permitting process is obviously looking at the code um that were uh that we're bound by and that's the the specialty code at this point so kind of a two-fold thing making sure that we have our our code um consistent and concise and then delivering that into a permitting system that would be",

        "text": " as a that raises questions with with the carbon intensity um and again so because oregon does consider biomass to be carbon neutral that may end up being in disagreement with other states policies or federal policies around carbon intensity of hydrogen because we have that 20 30 year in general in the in the legislation we are for the most part focusing on um the more conversion commercially available pathways right now and um the next one is from jason oh sorry from kathy uh what statute says biomass is considered renewable i think that one's just the renewable portfolio standard um kathy it's one of the eligible uh resources but i can let rebecca add to that if she wants yes so um yes the renewable portfolio standard um i believe that's sb 838 um passed in 2007 includes biomass uh certain kinds of biomass as renewable for purposes of the renewable portfolio standard and then there was a bill in 1547. what's that 1547. no 2015 um that included biomass as a that said it was essentially carbon neutral and i believe that was oh let me see if it's in my notes um if not i can track that down for you um i believe it might have been sb 392 but i'll have to look that up for you okay we can follow up on that one and then the next one is um from jason hydrogen produced from nuclear power out of state qualifies that's a great question um qualifies as you know for the purposes of this study it could um but really the study is more focused on both production and consumption within oregon so certainly within the lens of consumption we do consider the possibility that supply will come from outside of the state um but we leave that as is as rather nebulous in terms of renewable hydrogen because we're just not sure what kind of production we're gonna see uh in the region that we might be able to consume um however when we start talking about developing projects within the states um that has a more immediate um relationship to what we might consider renewable here but that all raises the you know the important question that because this is uh in emerging industry there are a lot of opportunities around policy to develop new or enhance existing tracking and how to harmonize definitions regionally and with the usdoe um you know how to try to build up an industry that is cohesive as possible and to save rebecca from going through her notes our team says it's sb 752 from uh 2015 kathy oh thank you um all right i'm not seeing any other clarifying questions in the chat but this was perfect keep them coming as you think of them so back to you all right next slide please here um based on that interpretation of the definition of hydrogen here are the hydrogen renewable hydrogen pathways that we are most focused on for purposes of the so at the bottom you'll see that we've got renewable electricity and renewable thermal energy and there's a few different pathways there though truly electrolysis is the most dominant one there right now um photoelectrochemical and biological processes are more in the r d phase uh for biomass uh biomass can go through some of the same processes as fossil fuels so there can be biomass gasification uh biomass reforming and then um biological processes which aren't as commercialized and then for that biofuel biogas there's the opportunity for using those and reforming and specifically renewable natural gas um or biogas um that has been cleaned up enough to have a high methane content uh can be can replace natural gas in steam methane so these are the pathways that we focus on for the study great next slide please uh okay i promise you're gonna see these requirements a lot so here they are again uh we're gonna dive into the initial findings for the first study this is a high-level analysis of how renewable hydrogen may support oregon in meeting its existing renewable energy and greenhouse gas reduction policies and goals next slide please so i'm going to get into i'm going to go through each of these policies that we analyzed for this and then i also here wanted to just point out kind of the sectors of the economy that they address so for the electricity sector the two most relevant policies are the renewable portfolio standard and the 100 clean electricity standard 100 clean also affects the natural gas industries since almost 25 the electricity consumed in oregon in 2019 was generated with natural gas next is the climate protection program and that addresses fossil fuel use for stationary and vehicular end uses so this policy addresses transportation industry and the built environment and like 100 clean this policy definitely um affects natural gas utilities and then finally we've got some of the transportation policies like the clean fuels program and the zero mission vehicles or zev's goals and the advanced clean trucks rules and not surprisingly these predominantly affect the transportation and in looking at these and how renewable hydrogen might play a role in supporting these policies mostly considered the near term to 2030 but certainly also looked at longer term time horizon out to 2050. past 2050 that's really the cutoff where most available modeling and analysis ends and certainly you get more um you know less accuracy the farther out so um but we have to try to to look at both time horizons next slide please okay in the interest of time um i'm just going to note that i am going to go into greatest depth on these two policies as compared to the others otherwise i'd be keeping you here all day so first up is the renewable portfolio standard or rps and it requires electric utilities and service providers to meet an increasing share of their annual retail load with eligible renewable resources as mentioned this policy has been in place since um 2008 and the targets were updated in 2016 such that investor-owned utilities now must meet 50 of their retail load with renewables by 2040. hydrogen has been listed as an eligible resource since 2018 uh in the rps but as yet nobody has used electricity from hydrogen to comply with the rps um the rps doesn't refer to it as renewable hydrogen but hydrogen is eligible only if it's generated from another resource that's eligible for the uh worth noting is that the rps does have a compliance cost cap a four percent it's kind of a cost containment and this forces utilities to seek out cost-effective renewable energy projects next up is the 100 clean standard and that requires uh investor-owned utilities to meet their retail load with emissions-free electricity by 2040. like the rps this policy has some safety valves around cost and reliability and definitely notable is that the bill also restricts citing any new fossil fuel energy facilities that emit greenhouse gases so essentially that natural gas facilities next slide please okay so how renewable hydrogen might help with the implementation of these two policies so first we'll talk about some of the challenges in implementing these first off is that um grid balancing becomes more challenging as the penetration of intermittent renewables goes up um so you see this graphic here from nrel and it shows that as you add more intermittent renewables the fraction of your portfolio the degree of difficulty of balancing and the cost both go up and it also shows some of the ways to mitigate some of those problems um or at least mentions that they're kind of different kinds of problems and so these to a degree be met with demand response with some short duration storage but the degree of difficulty of as you as you add more variable renewables gets bigger and so to address this you really need flexible zero carbon resources and you need energy storage next slide please sorry next another op option for integrating high levels of variable renewable energy is to over build and then curtail which simply refers to building much more capacity than a system requires to meet peak demand and then to curtail those renewable resources at times of oversupply essentially you shut them down and the more variable resources in a the more likelihood of excess supply that could be curtailed um to the right here is a graphic from e3 specific northwest low carbon scenario analysis and in this analysis um e3 found that increasing rps targets could lead to an increase in both the magnitude and the frequency of curtailment events and so they took you know kind of a typical day with high hydropower supply and then looked at curtailment you know a 20 regional rps scenario versus all the way up to a 50 at the and what they saw was that curtailment went from four percent to nine percent and that curtailment you can see is the bright red portion of that graph so at twenty percent or i'm sorry thirty percent regional rps um at the top you see kind of a thin sliver uh it's much larger and pronounced um at the bottom at fifty percent and i'll touch it on again later in the presentation but oversupply can lead to low and even even negative prices for electricity and so what would be helpful for the system is to have some sort of variable loads or loads that could stop up all of that excess supply next slide and so production of renewable hydrogen can help with these two challenges renewable hydrogen from electrolysis now electrolysis can serve as both a flexible resource and as a variable load so first renewable hydrogen can be paired with fuel cells to provide short uh balancing resources that can be ramped or up up or down as needed to provide perhaps most attractive though is renewable hydrogen um is a great candidate for longer duration energy which will be increasingly pressing need as more renewables are added to the grid and then also electronizers can serve as that variable variable load um in that they can increase their electricity demands at times of surplus and then can their demand can be decreased or even shut off quickly at times of high electricity demand and tight supply exactly those times when balancing becomes challenging so this graphic here is from evolved energy research's oregon clean energy pathway study and that uses a number of scenarios to determine how oregon might meet its clean energy goals the bottom graph shows what role electrolysis might play in grid balancing in oregon and in that bottom there that turquoise color is um so in all the scenarios electrolysis as load is increasingly from the late 2030s on and especially out in 2050 it plays a material role in almost all of the scenarios next slide please so and then another um challenge with um rps and 100",

        "text": " and depending on the nature of of the fund and the federal requirements the state may combine the federal funding with other state or private dollars to invest in the work and at the end of the day because the law that is authorizing the funds is federal some of the funds are restricted in what they can be used for and that comes straight from the law that congress passed additionally federal agencies can set rules and issue guidance to further clarify the parameters of what's allowed under these federal funds as a result of that certain parts of the infrastructure investment and jobs act will have more flexibility in what they can be used for than other pieces of it but ultimately it all stems from the law authorized by congress so today we are seeking your input so that we can develop guiding priorities that will assist the agency with all aspects of our grant seeking for these federal funds in doing so we've been speaking to energy suppliers and developers energy-based or community-based organizations and local governments just to name a few to get their impressions of what we need to consider as we work to bring these funds into our state in the next few slides we'll cover at a high level what some of the federal investments are as we go through this information please consider what you think may be missing from the list of items we'll be and in addition to that if odo could pick only one thing to invest in what would be the best thing to do we'll be asking for your responses in just a few slides so based on what we know we believe the state energy program will receive an additional boost of about 6.5 million dollars which can be used for a broad spectrum of items and investments in clean energy energy efficiency and resilience activities we estimate that we will be receiving approximately 3.2 million in funding for energy efficiency programs related to a revolving loan fund and the energy efficiency conservation and block grant and the energy efficiency conservation and block grant program will have sub-awards out to to local governments in addition additionally the weatherization program that is granted to the oregon housing and community services is expected to receive about 34.7 million in funds to help low-income households with weatherization services we also anticipate that the oregon department of transportation will about 50 million dollars related to electric vehicle charging stations and we anticipate receiving at odo approximately 50 million for grid resilience investments uh just a note on that the application from the federal government to the state is currently open and we will be working on that application over the next few months uh there will also be a public hearing specific to the resilience and reliability item that you see there in in the uh months ahead we're still working on nailing down a precise date for that hearing though um lastly we do anticipate that there will be a competitive application for energy auditor training up to two million dollars per state and energy auditors are an area that we have heard um is a high need area for workforce development related to the energy system so with that i would like to pause to see if there are any questions based on on that information so just as a reminder you can put your question in the chat or raise your hand not seeing any questions jen we're good so moving on um i just wanted to mention that there are quite a few other funding opportunities that are available under the infrastructure investment and jobs um these are just some of those that are available at the federal level as you can see there's approximately 100 billion dollars in additional funding related to these various topic areas some of which state agencies may be eligible for some may be eligible through nonprofits or universities or other types of entities so these are all some of the opportunities we'll be watching and trying to communicate out jen we do have a quick question the energy auditor training funding is available for homeowners and business owners is that um the energy auditor training program is a competitive grant application that's that's not open from the federal government yet but it will be to support workforce development to train um a variety of energy auditors related to both the residential and commercial um i want to be careful to distinguish that from one of our current programs where we actually we have a current grant through the usda which supports the cost of doing energy audits for rural businesses and agricultural businesses so we we have uh several programs that may may be aligning here soon so i'm happy to um clarify if there's any additional questions there great thank you i think we had a typo in our description of it there is another question in the chat is odo attaching any standards for contractors who will perform these projects within iija funding because the root of the funds are federal um at a at a bare minimum the requirements of the federal funding source which will come with with different compliance related provisions will flow down to any sub-recipients of the federal funds and some of those may uh also apply to contractors depending on the scope of work that that is contracted out for for example if there is a contractor who is hired to perform any sort of construction under the federal funds we do know that based on the law that davis bacon wage reporting requirements will apply and so that is something that a contractor that would be responsible for doing construction work would at a minimum need to comply with um but yes there will likely be various aspects of of things that will need to flow down to the different folks depending on what the individual scope is so we'll move on to talk about community so based on what we've done so far we've had some discussions with our energy advisory work group and managers of community owned utilities as well as some community-based organizations we've also reached out to tribal governments and are scheduling some follow-up conversations we've also had a meeting that was specific to workforce development that was a specific to a priority that we heard coming out of january's meeting in the future we want to gather feedback from the portal that we have so that we can create guiding priorities that can apply broadly to all of our grant seeking under iija to the extent that is practical within the scope of the federal requirements we also anticipate that there will be further conversations around the hydrogen hub and around the grid resilience opportunity under which we will need to have a public hearing for jen we have another question in the chat there is a big list of things that communities might apply for is that something that odo will guide or should folks work directly with their communities to advance those i would say it's one of the reasons why we asked that question at the beginning is to get a better sense of the capacity within communities that may apply for some of those funds but odo does want to help we've actually submitted a legislative concept to additional resources and a staff person at the agency to do just that to help communities navigate federal and state funding we don't have that position yet we are looking to be as helpful as we can with our existing staff um so i definitely reach out and be in touch if you see something that you your community might be interested in applying for and we'll also do our best to promote opportunities that we hear of as and feel free to add to that jen i think that's great i think in order to maximize the funds that we might be able to bring into the state it's going to be a collective effort of any type of entity that may be eligible for any fund trying to to work together with partners to coordinate and collaborate so that we prepare competitive proposals so moving on um just to give a quick overview of where we think we may be able to focus some funding and provide examples of how we could shape our proposals at the state level to focus on certain opportunities as an example we could use some of the federal dollars for additional research or studies and that could support things that address uh statewide issues such as transmission capacity that we've heard about before or it could be for supporting community level planning or projects we could also propose programs that direct benefits to individual customers and focus on energy efficiency in homes and businesses or renewable energy as well as personal or community transportation programs with all these options however we know there's also not likely enough uh funding available to do everything that we desire so we must set some priorities as to how we use these funds so in our conversations to date we've heard about the need for greater workforce development for energy related occupations and the skilled trades that support many aspects of any energy we also know there's a keen interest in making sure that energy workforce programs have strong diversity related to workforce is also a concern about supply chains making it difficult to conduct the construction projects that we need to shore up our supply chain problems in order to get the equipment and the workers in place to to do the necessary infrastructure work we've also heard a desire to increase resilience efforts which includes both the large grid and the community level forms of resilience undergrounding power lines is of particular interest to some of our utility partners lastly we've heard an interest in programs that benefit renters as opposed to homeowners who have long benefited from energy programs additionally we heard there's a desire for navigating aspects of energy information and understanding the various incentives that could be stacked to benefit a specific project whether it's on an individual home or a public and we've also heard that there's a strong desire to simplify the funding process wherever we can so based on what we've shared are there any topics issues or pathways that are from the previous slides and it looks like where you just launched the poll to get your feedback in response to that question so if you have a few moments please go ahead and type in your response if there's any topics that jump out to you that should certainly be on our list and i think we'll give folks about a minute and a half to enter your responses here and as a reminder if you are feeling pressed for time or you want to think about it more you can feel free to respond to these same questions on our portal on our website okay let's keep it open for about 30 more seconds so people can enter their short responses okay you've got about 10 more seconds to finish your response and press send and stacy go ahead and close the bowl all right thank you we've got some really good responses here aligning and combining with existing promoting these wins for oregon as we finish the projects maximizing climate and environmental justice benefits large building systems maintenance and replacement program concerned about permitting assessment work that will delay projects um encouraging us to advocate for expedited timelines great",

counselors you know budgeting setting policy you know bonds other things um all the subcommittees we serve on and and just that you know being in those land use cases where we have that quasi judicial um role where we're not really you know acting in the same way we do uh otherwise as council is just frustrating um but it doesn't get rid of all of it so there still will be times where there may be call-ups and staff still may tell us that there's really not a lot of discretion that we have um it's just important for people to understand this is legalistic uh and you know your reasons for wanting or not wanting something have to be based on the criteria and rules and laws that are established by you know the state of Oregon in our own or orces so this hopefully gets maybe half of it off our table but not all the way there uh but I'm sure it's just a work in progress I hope thank you councelor councelor Stapleton yeah I quickly wanted to add uh that I think the state rules are trying to get at this but also this as well um is really helping to get more affordable housing in our communities because anytime we start to call things up um you're starting to add to the cost of that housing development and then the prices go up for people so I wanted to make that quick connection as well that um especially having affordable housing uh more units in our city um that's one of our priorities this is also linked to that as well and really important I feel thank you counselor further discussion on this one this is again it's just an information report you'll have an opportunity for a debate when the rule comes before us for um uh adoption correct um most likely the the next meeting will have it up as a special order of business and presentation great so we have a full chance to debate at that point I definitely encourage people who aren't on that committee to Avail themselves of the city attorney's time and get the in-depth conversation because there's a lot anything else on one all right 6D 6 e that concludes information reports so now we are on on to First readings ordinance bill number 124 an ordinance declaring certain Territory located at 572 High Lane Northeast Annex to the City of Salem prescribing its comprehensive plan map designation and zoning and withdrawing the territory from the Maran County Fire District number one and East Salem Sewer District sewer and drainage District all right councelor Hoy do you have a motion sorry sorry about that just a um this is 7.1a is that correct okay um I would like to make a motion for annexation of approximate 0.78 acre Territory located at 572 High Lane Northeast with a minor comprehensive plan map amendment to a multif family residential and zone change to rm2 multif family residential is that everything uh let's see to approve the annexation of the territory at high Lane 572 High Lane Northeast with minor comprehensive plan map Amendment for the territory to multif family residential zone change to rm2 multiple family residential and withdrawal of the territory from the Maring County Fire District number one and East Salem Sewer District and drainage District to Second reading for enactment second thank you motion by Hoy second by Stapleton councelor do you have any for your motion I do not have anything to add let's do it thank you will the recorder please call the r councelor Nordike I councelor vanney I councelor Stapleton I councelor nishioka I councelor Phillips I councelor gwy I councelor Gonzalez I councelor Hoy I mayor Hoy I motion passes all right we already disposed of item number eight city council is adjourned we are moving on now to Housing Authority and then we'll come back for urban renewal all right we're playing musical tonight all right I bring to order the meeting for the Salem housing authority of the City of Salem for Monday January 8th 20124 with the recorder please call the role commissioner Nisha here Vice chair Phillips here commissioner gwy here commissioner Gonzalez here commissioner Hoy here commissioner nordik here commissioner Barney here resident commissioner viegas absent and chair Stapleton I'm here thanks all right Vice chair do we have any additions or deletions I can't find any did we have clarifications thanks I'm a little scattered at this point is it is this okay so I move clarifications thank you uh I think we'll call them additions but that's okay additions okay do we have a second I'll second that okay great all right to motion um the basically we've just got some new information and we're clarifying it so the addition is is a more clear text on what's coming in the main meeting sounds good all right any all right recorder would you please call the role and if I could clarify um it was the uh correction to a section three of the resolution for that ordinance correction yes okay and councelor Nisha or Comm commissioner Nisha I Vice chair Phillips I commissioner gwy I commissioner Gonzalez hi commissioner Hoy I commissioner nordik hi commissioner Varney I resident commissioner vus absent chair Stapleton I motion passes I think we are all just little discombobulated from having a meeting in a different order uh so I appreciate everybody um hanging in there all right we have nobody signed up for public comment uh Vice chair do we have approval of the minutes uh I move the consent calendar I'll second someone if I may speak to the motion yes please sorry it consists of 3.1a which is the minutes of the December 11 2023 draft Salem housing authority minutes and that concludes the consent calendar great any discussion would the recorder please call the rooll actually there's one more item um a uh that's not the consent calendar though we all really oh pardon me okay I kind of feel like we should just start all over all right all right Vice chair Phillips I commissioner Gwyn hi commissioner Gonzalez hi commissioner Hoy hi commissioner nordik I commissioner Barney I commissioner nishioka I president commissioner beas absent chair Stapleton I motion passes I can't wait to see what the urban renewal meeting brings us okay but we do have uh we don't have any resolutions or action items um but we do have a public hearing so I would like to open our public hearing thank you the Salem housing authority commission will now conduct public hearing to consider exemption from competitive bidding process and authorization of an alternative Contracting method for a class of public Improvement contracts for the renovation of Englewood West apartments and the renovation of Southwood or South View Terrace Apartments the hearing will begin with the staff presentation followed by other interested persons indiv individuals testifying are limited to three minutes you great thank you so much good evening chair Stapleton and Commissioners I'm here tonight to present um on the alternative bid process I am here filling in for Jessica Blakeley who is unfortunately not being able to be here tonight I we wanted to indicate that the affordable housing in Salem has been a desired goal for the past several years currently the housing authority of the City of Salem has two new affordable housing projects that is being currently worked on the first project is a renovation of a senior complex Englewood West apartments and the second project is a renovation at South VI terce Apartments the first project site Englewood West departments is located at 1068 Park Avenue Northeast Salem Oregon 97 7301 it is surrounded by Community businesses apartments and single family residences it is currently fully occupied it is a 54 unit property located in Northeast Salem three-story building with an elevator all units are one-bedroom apartment styles that are serving are elderly and disabled the property was built in 1991 is in critical need of renovation and upgrades to meet current codes the second project site is South View Terrace Apartments located at 3 75 fairf Avenue Southeast Salem Oregon 97302 it is surrounded Again by business churches Apartments single family residence it is a 60 unit property located in Southeast Salem it is also a three-story building with an elevator all units are one-bedroom apartment elderly the property was built in 1993 in critical need of Renovations and upgrades to meet our current codes and standards tonight we are requesting the cgmc alternative process as a maxim for the pros as being a maximum owner control over design and construction is highly predictable and collaborative team environment is the most flexible delivery process with respect to cost control and change in uh change order management we know the cost pressures early on and we're able to collaborate in a scope risk assumption as our team continues to build these it reduces our owner schedule risks on technically complex projects and when I say that I mean that delivery of tax credits for affordable housing is a very complex in an owner or in an occupied rehab and having the greater ability with the cmgc alternative process allows us to work with the the contractor from the get-go and an understanding of clear delivery of the units for our residents who will be temporarily relocated out of them overall the project delivery is faster than traditional and maximizes util ization of local participation um I wanted to also indicate that the this method uh is not used typically by the Housing Authority ongoing we've used this over the course of the last uh over decade for 10 other of our affordable housing projects it has been a key to our success in delivering these projects on time um in connection with the requirements of our investment firms and ensuring that our residents are taken care well taken care of while they're out of the unit and they have a timeline knowing how to quickly um we do have a history of using this method and delivering this project on budget or under budget and being able to Value engineer back in um items that wouldn't wouldn't have made it in typically um in our request for proposal we request qualifications and certifications with past history working on uh budget delivery and timeline delivery meeting uh low-income housing tax credit requirements we've also used this method for historic pre preservation which is a very time uh sensitive and very critical um High project we uh utilize this for occupied rehab experience um and we also request uh experience for section three and my uh mwb which is minority women own emergency emergenc emerging",

kind of showing the the change and mentality of our residents and of our um infrastructure have we included uh or thought about including any of these questions in the annual survey that no was that a no don't ask any more questions or a no can we talk about it so more well we can certainly talk about it um just that that the nature of that the Comm elction every question that we add like increases the cost significantly so yeah we have to be thoughtful about that yeah I'm really hoping we can change some of the questions on the survey you know like right now one of them is you know uh how quickly do you get across the city of Salem and rush hour traffic and that's not a question I think that lines up with our climate goals um so and in my opinion I think it puts everybody in a bad moon and so therefore from then on I think the survey is much more negatively biased because now everybody is stuck at traffic in their mind so I would like to get rid of that question and maybe we could think about some questions that we would want to include in a survey like that that could I don't know if it's a transportation question or I don't know if it's an energy question but I wonder if there are some questions that if we did have the opportunity to redo that survey if we could include it to kind of get at climate action whether it's just the general feeling of the household um you know if it is a goal for them or not just in general or um if it's more specific question but I would love to ease that out in some way and change some of the questions that we do ask sorry hold on I can certainly follow up on that and see if that's the possibility for future surveys and ke's in the room too so he just heard all that as well yeah I believe that survey comes out of the city manager's office so yes I write it personally and make most of calls yes that's true anything else um so for how this would look uh the vehicle miles per day that's available through third parties um one of the three third parties would be uh Google's environmental impact engine and so it's something that is free that has a pretty easy to use metric um that would be for mitigation uh and it's not exactly actionable because we are asking people to um change their behavior so it's actionable but not necessarily from the city um public transit ridership uh that's available through chariots um we are just asking for a few Standalone metrics so that should be be easy to um obtain and to use um that would be for mitigation and again asking people to change their behaviors uh types of Transportation miles this would also be from the Google insights engine or other um metrics and then uh again we're asking for very few discret numbers um and it would be for mitigation as well the number of miles of paid sidewalks multi-use lanes and bike multi-use trails and bike Lanes the city has ownership of that data and we would um be able to use and publish that fairly easily and that would be for mitigation and we would be able to act on that as it is something that we would be able to increase if we see the need for more of that um for community so this one was a little bit more difficult because a lot of the questions in the strategies were more um blending themselves to qualitative instead of quantitative answers so the ones that I found as most applicable would be the number of housing units within half mile of Transit uh the number of affordable housing units and the percentage of energy burdened households um energy burden is at 6% of the income of a person going towards their energy B so an example of what that could look like this is from Oregon housing community services and this shows the percent of household under 60% of the median family income that are energy burdened um so it's it's showing what the graphic would look like and um how we could use it uh would be just kind of showing the number of houses in different census or the yeah the number of households in different census blocks um that would be experiencing an energy so let's look at these different metrics U housing within half mile of Transit it would be available it would be an annual measure not exactly the easiest to use it would require building those um data set uh applicability it would be for mitigation resiliency and equity and yes it would be actionable to um either look at increasing uh the transit stops or increasing housing that is nearby Transit stops um affordable housing units available and that's an annual measure um that would be a lot easier to use and it applicability would be under Equitable sorry equity and it is an actionable measure energy burdened households again that's not City ownership of that data it would be either PGE or stale on electric and then uh trying to figure out how much those households are earning might be a little bit difficult as well so um not exactly the easiest to use or the best direct measure um but it's something that we look at um and that one would be for mitigation adaptation resiliency and equity and as the city is not its own energy provider it's not an an actionable measure so for municipal Fleet this one didn't exactly fit under transportation but I think it's important to have and to report on um so the number of vehicle Miles by type and we can look at internal combustion hybrid and electric vehicles for internal combustion I will note that our Fleet uses r99 which is like a biodiesel and um we can report back on the metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions of avoided um and then we could also report on hours running for off-road combustion engine equipment before you move past that one yeah I was at an event at a city building last week um and literally we were swarmed by a an army of leaf blowers during our meeting all gas powered they were all uh they appeared to be all contractor they weren't city employees but they were performing mainten you know performing Landscaping Maintenance out of city building and I wonder I mean it literally was there were I think four or five of them was mindblowing like and they it was a thing where we had TV cameras going and so it was like particularly annoying where we had to go out and say can we stop this right now because we're tring I mean and it just made me think like what are we doing from a policy perspective to discourage that to just and you know even with our contractors like are we doing anything and if we're not when are we going to start doing something toage that behavior just you know yeah yeah that might be some low hanging FR yeah I mean to me that seems like I mean literally there were four or five yeah guys with leaf blowers and there were no leaves but they were blowing lots of things I yeah I routine I like that you said mindblowing I think that's funny mindblowing Le blowing I know you just on it today tot with but I know that other I mean thinking of that I know that there's a small group of folks in Salem who are starting to Rally around this idea of adding some kind of restraints to leaf blowers in particular because they let off so many emissions they what two stroke engines right and for every hour I think it is they're blowing it's it's an F-150 driving to LA and back from so yeah parate matter now parate matter thank you yeah so I know that they're not the greatest for the environment but I wonder if there's something that we can do to kind of help well we need to be modeling good behavior to begin with and I know the state has some electric blowers which is great not all of them but I that could be something we could do I don't know anyway I just was waned to add that to the mix like I'm hoping at some point we could like start measuring that what do we what have we done to reduce that so would you like that to include um contract bu okay so just along those lines the fire department is replacing all of their powered uh equipment draws life and all that sort of thing with with with electric we ought to be capturing that I mean I knew that we ought to be reporting that I mean this particular one was at the PD you know and I'm sure because St any building or I don't know why we have contracts that doing that work what we do and I don't think we have a category for hand tools like leaf blowers and things like that so that just might be one thing to think about and I know we don't have a policy in terms of Shifting to that when it's available yeah even I mean what about like mowers and stuff like that that we use in our Parks right I I don't know if that's been captured at all they have equipment codes so they could be tracked feasibly okay is as far as whether we have a policy we getem a question I don't know the answer to that yeah like what's how are we like what are we doing to head in the direction of electric we but I think we're heading in the direction of not mowing at all well yes sadly that's the direction we're at it we'll cut things back some leave it sorry so I'm just waned to make sure that we're capturing this kind of also I was thinking and I'm glad you're here Alan but like as we get ready to do this building project this building like what are we get I really want to be sure that we're capturing all of the energy efficiencies that we're going to be creating I mean I'm hoping that we get to the point where we start doing motion sensors in room so lights actually go off automatically you know those kinds of things but I'm hoping we're capturing that all of that kind of stuff and Reporting it yeah those kind measures construction so it's just a matter of make sure and right right so actually you know show that we're making some progress right LS all that stuff and Council your it's kind of at Le two prong approach one of course is our own operations and turn over into battery powered whatever we've got the other one is on our ongoing contracts as renew contracts with our service providers for landscaping what do we require and how we do that",

        "text": " started that and we agreed to continue the dialogue between their team and our team to see if there is a path forward for this project or to find that path forward we had the right people in the room for that discussion and uh Kristen can offer any other comments to fill in the blanks that I've left here so thank you thank you Mr Staley Ms Rutherford good evening Kristen Rutherford community and Urban Development director so yes we had a Friday afternoon workshop with Consultants development team and City staff that started with a presentation and a bigger broader audience including some counselors and other elected officials from the region after the presentation then we moved on to two different workshops one that focused more on a potential development agreement and what this public private partnership may look like and then on the other side of the wall we had several of our engineers and planning staff that worked through kind of the the nitty-gritty issues tied to challenges with the site so at a very high level what they're proposing is a mixed-use development with approximately 370 units of housing multi-family with a soccer stadium on the North End of the site and so the challenges you know that we're working through are tied to having this sandwiched between a railroad and a road and a river and a and existing development on each side so there are many other stakeholders that need to be engaged as we continue this sort of funneling and filtering process and learn more including getting the rail to the table so you know the the development team continues to be targeting a 2024 start date for construction there is a lot to navigate between now and then especially when it comes to anything tied to Front Street and the railroad so as we continue to have conversations and meetings you know we will be continuing to vet these challenges and and try to navigate some solutions and get a better handle on kind of where their feasibility challenges are where the financial gaps are what our role as partners might be that's still very high level and undetermined at this time but we will continue to work through and explore those issues thank you counselor yeah I just wanted to say uh thank you to staff I was just really Blown Away in the room by the amount of staff that were there and in the room and willing to work and try and figure out a path forward for this um I was telling the developer that I think this might have been my second or third email I sent as a city councilor was what's going on on Front Street and how can we help that Redevelopment because I know that this is going to be really critical for North downtown this is a prime Jewel of the City of Salem as you all know the river is is banked by Highway 22 and Wallace marine park on the west side and then we have a beautiful Riverfront Park in Mento Brown Park on on the did I say that right on the east side and here we have this just stretch of land that is prime for really a re-investment in Salem's Downtown North downtown so I couldn't have been more thrilled and wanted to say thank you for the update and I hope other counselors share in my excitement for this really Monumental thing that might be able to happen here for our city thank you counselor and thank you for highlighting that I'm sorry I wasn't able to be there I have met with the folks in the past and so I'm equally excited so thank you other comments counselor hoy thank you Mr Mayor it was a gift to attend the navigation Center open house this morning I look forward to the day when arches referred residents arrive and progress in the lives of real people is underway as suggested I took time to stretch out on one of the beds at the center I looked up at the ceiling and briefly imagined what it might be like to need to be there my how life takes its turns I prayed please fill this place with all the right help and inspiration to grow and Thrive I know if the programs work and lives are improved the money will be there I just believe just when I thought it was time to leave I made two new friends I'd wanted to make contact with officers Bennett and Ramirez from the homeless Outreach Services Program for some time their work is right up my alley almost they mentioned their next move this morning would be to visit a homeless encampment in South Salem I know that place I said I was out there on a Ride a week and a half ago into the darkness we trekked to make an arrest and to deliver a man to the Marion County Jail the area is soon to be cleared today's visit was to be another warning for the handful of folks still camping there can I go with you I asked sure officer Bennett replied but only if the chief gives the okay next thing I knew I'd changed my clothes and was off on a different kind of Ride Along we saw more of what I see each day only concentrated prolonged homeless living deeper and dirtier than what if that what my homeless one of my houseless neighbors calls concrete camping the size of the mess on the privately owned property in South Salem is astounding it's nowhere near as big as Wallace Marine but it's big it was easier to see the full scope in the daylight between rain showers Stories the officers told were incredible their dedication to this difficult seemingly insurmountable problem is admirable The Cooperative effort made with city and county Partnerships is working I came away inspired and confirmed in my belief that in order to solve the homeless problem we have to get to the root of it thanks to Gretchen Bennett and her team and to Chief Womack for his yes thank you counselor counselor Nordic thank you so much so a few things are in order first of all to all the city staff and Community Action Agency and other partners who helped make the navigation Center a reality I remember when I joined Council one of the first students I did was talk to legislators about funding this dream and it took some time for us to get that funding from the legislature and other partners but we did it and we did it together but you know even though it's nice to be there to hold the ribbon and I've now held the ribbon many times I've held golden shovels I've held gigantic scissors and I'm always happy to stand in front of the cameras and celebrate those moments but we all know at the end of the day that this took a lot of work behind the scenes by our incredible staff so I really want to thank everyone who did that and we had a lot of other folks who were big supports to this project in the room too so I was really grateful to see Marion County Commissioner Kevin Cameron was there he was instrumental in helping us get some money as well we saw a lot of Community Partners there folks like church at the park b-bold Ministries YMCA there were a lot of different partners who are standing in solidarity for a Humane and compassionate way of addressing homelessness in our community so it was great to be there and I played a small role but I really want to give kudos to the staff who really made it happen so I appreciate that very much and it was great to have the governor on hand too I know that the governor's emergency order that took effect is going to result in some major funding coming to our Community Partners in this city again places like Community Action Agency and several others Salem housing authority and many others they're going to receive a lot of funding which will translate into a lot more shelter beds and a lot more households being served because of the emergency funding coming to this area when those organizations Thrive the City of Salem can Thrive too so I think it's really important that we show our support for those Community the other thing I want to say is I really want to thank Capital Community media they reached out to me and asked to interview me about my day job and I'm sincerely proud of that work it's an honor to serve as the executive director of Casa Marion County and I want to thank Capital Community media Megan and Ashley that were wonderful to work with so thank you for that um I did have a couple questions um I had told the mayor and or council president and the city manager that I wanted to see an update on the Cannery property because I would like to know what's going on um I am delighted to hear that there was a meeting on Friday and that a presentation was given I'm sure that for any of the counselors who were not present for that meeting I would love to see a copy of that presentation and I'm hoping that it can be circulated amongst council members so we're all on the same page moving forward although it's not in my ward a property of this scale will have an economic impact on every single person in this city to that end I'm also curious director um has there been any discussion so far of affordable housing being at least a portion of the proposed 370 units of housing that you mentioned yes there has been great and I know that we're still very early on in the phases of this project but I mean as you know from our offline conversations and my comments here on the record I would love to see affordable housing worked into as many projects around the city as possible even if it's just a percentage but the more the better um the other thing and I know we're going to get questions about this from my constituents they want to know what the environmental impact is of this project especially since it's on the Willamette River especially because of the history of uh of this property and its proximity to the railroad there's a lot of complicated issues I have no doubt the city will do its due diligence just keep us in the loop because I know at neighborhood association meetings those are the kinds of questions that my constituents will ask is there affordable housing what about the environmental impact what's up with the soccer stadium by the way uh that caught me by surprise I love that concept but when I share with my constituents I know they're going to have a lot of questions is there any more light You Can Shed about the the proposal for the soccer the soccer stadium is a very recent addition to the scope of the project that was first shared with us this week also so we are still you know working to kind of you know figure out what that will mean what the impacts will be they're looking at a stadium that would be about 5 000 people um up to maybe ten thousand for",

        "text": "all right good evening everybody oh I don't know if it's on am I on okay excuse me it is now 6 o'clock so we're going to start our meeting tonight first I just want to thank everybody here in the room for coming to our meeting my name is Kathleen Sloan I'm a senior sighting analyst with the Department of energy the Oran Department of energy the first thing I wanted to do was just go over a couple of overview slides but first I wanted to do introduction so I'm Kathleen floan sighting analyst to my right is Todd Cornett he is the secretary for the energy facility sighting Council he's also the sighting manager and Nancy hatch is our Administrative Assistant who is our technical Wiz for all things setting this up for our meeting so thank you I have omit is in the back she is one of our new members of staff and she is a um analyst as well and then we have one council member from the energy facility sighting Council that decided to attend this meeting in person and I'm going to introduce her and that is an buer council member Ann berer so thank you Ann for being here and that is it for the Department of energy side I'm going to turn it over over to the applicant team to introduce themselves I'm Matt Hazard with IPA power I'm the project manager for summmer hi folks uh Sam Littlefield I'm Executive Vice President of development for ipop power I oversee our project development uh Pipeline and um Matt is uh on on my team um we ultimately have 28 uh project developers land agents uh and government Regulatory Affairs Personnel that that uh help us see through um these complex but ultimately uh important projects so thank you very much for being oh hello my name is aab j and you can call me AJ uh I work with tetratech environmental Consulting and I'm the project manager on this you know the environmental Consulting uh side that helps write the application and hi there my name is John vandery I represent IPA with kind of Permitting management environmental Affairs um some of the study work that goes into the application for site certificate um and just helping to manage kind of the complex permiting process okay thank you can you go to the next slide Nancy so we did our introductions I'm going to do a little bit of a overview of the meeting itself and the flow of the meeting I will also present on the sighting process for the state the department of energy sighting process and then I will turn it over to the applicant who will present on their proposed project which is the Summit Ridge renewable energy facility so this is a notice of intent that they've submitted with the Department It's Beginning a whole process to obtain apply for a site certificate and then we try to keep that relatively brief my presentation and their presentation so that we can get to the public comment period in the meeting which is the purpose of us having this meeting is to provide information and allow the public opportunity to ask questions make comments and I'll talk more about the comment period in a minute and next slide and I guess I would just say we ask that we hold your comments and questions until we get to the comment period okay so this is an meeting it is for the purpose of informing the public about this notice of intent to apply for a site certificate for this new proposed facility we call it an noi for short so if I switch to acronyms that's what I'm talking about I'll try not to do that um it's important because the of the site that it be clear that this is not a contested case hearing the participation in this meeting is not required to preserve issues in a contested case that comes later on in the application process and like I said we're asking that you hold questions and comments till we open up the comment period at the meet at the end of the presentation and we just ask that people be respectful um everybody's trying to do their jobs and we just ask that people not be disruptive or rude in our meeting okay next slide so just wanted to clarify what this meaning is for and what this meaning is not this is the public information meeting on the notice of intent to apply for a site certificate for a facility called The Summit Ridge renewable energy facility it is not about the Summit Ridge Wind Farm project um and the notice of intent is really the first step in the FC review fr process and I'll say fsec that is an acronym for the energy facility sighting Council they're The Entity that has to review and approve a site certificate from the state for an energy facility that falls under their jurisdiction and the applicant team it is the team is with Summit Ridge wind LLC and AA power so just a really quick overview about the Summit Ridge Wind Farm which many of you are familiar with um the certificate holder did submit an application to terminate that site certificate on March 88th an public notice on that request or the application to terminate was issued on the 13th of March that public comment period closed on April 1st so it is closed and it will go to council for a possible decision at the April FC meeting to be held on April 19th and I believe that's in Salem it's in Salem so you can participate remotely if you don't want to drive to Salem if you're interested okay next slide is there something I missed oh okay all right so back to us and why we're here um a little bit about the energy facility sighting program so we oversee the re the review decision-making compliance for large scale energy facilities and infrastructure in Oregon the energy facility sighting council is the body that actually makes the decision on an application it is a seven member board Council they're appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Oregon State Senate um and they serve terms the Oregon Department of energy staff staff who we are we work in support of the fsec and we help do the technical and environmental review and document prop that goes into all of these applications all the review process that we have to go through in order to make sure that our standards are met so basically in concept we are the a Consolidated review process so it consolidates Local Government Review State other state agencies within the state that might have a a role in a in a resource and the purpose of that is to eliminate duplication speed things up make it a little more streamlined for both review decisions if it goes through judicial review We review the compliance aspects any applicable Council standard applicable laws and rules that we have to consider um our process also has built into it a public participation process it's very important to our Council and our process that the public be allowed to participate and pro be provided information and opportunities to provide comments and it happens at several stages in our process and I'll go over that in a little bit and then we also coordinate what we call reviewing agencies which are those other entities within the state or maybe a local government we have special advisory groups which are the local counties that may have County jurisdiction in the area and we also consult with tribing tribal governments coordinate with them on comments that they might have on our review next slide okay so what is an FC facility um there's several definitions the one that this facility this proposed facility really meets is that it is an electrical power generating plant with an capacity of more than 50 megawatt of power proposed for a Wind Facility the applicant is proposing an estimated Peak generating capacity of 201 megaw or an average generating capacity of 67 megawatt from the facility from wind and therefore it is an fect jurisdictional facility under this order statute 469 300 subpart 11 subpart A subpart J all right so when a proposed facility meets that definition as an FC jurisdictional uh energy facility the applicant must obtain a site certificate from the energy facility sighting Council um before it can construct or operate that facility and to obtain that site certificate the applicant must demonstrate that the proposed facility meets the standards we standards based process and I'll have a slide on that in a minute um set by Council in chapter 345 of the oars the Oregon administrative rules and other applicable Oregon statutes and land land use planning goals and as I said because we as staff serve uh as supportive Council we will conduct a lot of the technical review of the information that's submitted by the applicant um as part of their preliminary application at this point like I said we're at a notice of intent stage so we step one they've submitted a notice of their intent to apply for a site certificate so we're really at that first step next slide so this is my favorite slide because we can show kind of at a glance um the whole process in one slide so the red box is where we are as I stated we're at the notice of intent stage there are seven major steps in this process that goes all the way to a final order and a site certificate at the end there's a couple of things I want to cover on here the notice of intent submitted by the applicant the Department issues a public notice and it opens up that comment period the public comment period is is open and it closes on May 3rd um and then we hold an information meeting and the whole purpose of that is in all of these green boxes is that there's opportunities for participation and then we are also coordinating at this point with those uh reviewing agencies that I talked about about the proposed facility about the notice of intent and all of that information will get summarized in what Odo prepares which is the next step which is the project order and the project order is something I will prepare as the signing analyst and gets reviewed and approved through our department and we prepared that project order for the purposes of giving it back to the applicant and that project order will contain really specific information about what needs to be included in their preliminary application so the applicant will be working on the materials for preliminary application and they will submit a preliminary application should they choose to um based upon what they're required to submit and it will be in the project order and that project order is underway and it will be issued in the middle of June is the deadline to to issue that to the applicant and then it come starts the application process so the first step is a preliminary application the applicant submits to the perment a preliminary application with all of the required exhibits that cover all of the 16 standards that we have and",

        "text": " of these standards are met and there's a little back and forth that goes between us and the applicant to get it to what we call once we have a complete application we issue another notice we post it on the website and again there's a public comment period on the formal application we will then review all that information and prepare what is called a draft proposed order and that is a fairly technical document that summarizes each of those 16 standards I mentioned and our evaluation of that and we give recommendations to our Council of whether or not we think that there are either conditions that need to be prescriptive kind of conditions to meet the standard or if the standard has been done but there are recommendations and we take that to our Council the council reviews it we have a public hearing and when we have the public hearing we'll be back down here to have it and we take all of that comment from our Council from the public from the reviewing agencies and we have to basically issue a revised document which is a proposed order and then that proposed order and you know that intent is that it combines all of this information makes a final kind of recommendation to our Council and then it goes back to our Council to consider at the time that we issue the draft propose order we or the proposed order we also issue a notice of contestant case and that means if if party wants to contest the correct the findings of that proposed order they can request a contested case there is no contesting case we will issue a we will take that proposed order to our Council and recommend that they consider it and adopt it as a final order the council has not made a decision until the final that they make a decision on the final order so a lot of the work that the citing division does is to go through all of that information file it make those recommendations answer those questions that come back work through the contested case process if we have one and then Council will ultimately make the decision and just you know up or down of whether or not to Grant a site certificate for a facility in the state of Oregon so a notice of intent is valid for two years so the applicant has two years to decide whether they're actually going to proceed and submit an application sometimes they do sometimes later so it at this phase that's what I would say to be determined and it's not our decision that they're going to submit an application it is um the project proponents decision whether or not to move forward from notice of intent to application and at this point I am going to stop talking I'm going to turn it over to Sarah asterson who's going to speak more to process a little more about what we do and how we do it and then I'll come back and open up the Q a at a certain way but thank you good evening again my name is Sarah esterson I'm the senior policy advisor with the citing Division and we're very happy to be here as Kate said thank you very much for taking the time to come and join us tonight um on this slide is the seven that's process step uh citing process for an energy facility to seek review and approval or denial of a site certificate and I just wanted to highlight that you know notwithstanding the two-year time frame that an applicant has after they submit a notice of attempt to actually decide if they're going to submit an um generally the process could be three to five years to go through the whole thing before you actually have a permit and then it could be two to three years before it goes into construction so this is a long detailed review that we're going through here um so I'm just going to cover a couple of topics if you would go to the next slide please um your bar permitting process requires the department to see comments and Technical input from State local and tribal governments and these entities these agencies have a specific term in our process Kate just referred to it it's called a reviewing agency some examples of reviewing agencies that are applied to the proposed loan Pine to Whetstone transmission line include habitat biologists from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife specifically their local Rogue Watershed jurisdictional coordinators from the Oregon Department of State lands staff from the Oregon Department of Agriculture specifically the native plant conservation program and the land use and water planning coordinator so those are all examples of state agencies were required to coordinate with tribal governments include contacts from tribal councils and cultural and resource departments so for this proposed project the tribal tribal governments include Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Indians the confederated tribes of selects and the confederated tribes of Grand Ronde um so during the notice of intent phase which as Kate mentioned that's the phase that we're in for this project that's why we're here today we prepare a contact list of state local and tribal government agencies and then we prepare formal letters and we send them and we say help us understand what are the applicable regulatory requirements help us understand the resources that you're aware of identify permits statutes rules ordinances anything you think that applies that you have expertise or jurisdiction of please help us and identify those things so that we can incorporate that into the review specifically a document called the project order and then that sets the stage for the next step there are several more Milestones that we showed on the prior slide that require that department staff seek review and input from these reviewing agencies this is the first step so we also have a unique um term in our process called a special Advisory Group and that applies to the local governing body within which the project is proposed to be located those entities they're called special advisory groups and this applies uh this is a designation that our Council applies and appoints to these um these entities and then it applies for the life of the facility and future changes so the role of a special Advisory Group is unique we ask them to identify the applicable land use permitting requirements for the proposed facility so an applicable permitting requirement is based on the use the proposed use of the energy facility and the zone and then the requirements that apply to that proposed use in the proposed Zone and then those are the requirements that are established in a local government local zoning and comprehensive planning so for this project the special Advisory Group we call it a sag but I'll try not to use acronyms at this stage are the City of Medford city council and the Jackson County Board of Commissioners those have both been identified and appointed by the energy facility setting as Kate mentioned the notice of intent for this project was received on April 27th the notice of intent is a physical document it includes data and maps that are based on rule requirements and we do have it available on the website and a copy here if you'd like to look at that but so we sent formal letters to the reviewing agencies and to the special advisory groups asking for input on those the notice of intent materials that we will then be able to consider in the future future phases so right now we're kind of in the middle of the review and comment period We are continuing our Outreach efforts with all of the reviewing agencies and the two special advisory groups um and we want to make sure that these entities understand what we're asking of them and that they understand the project and of their opportunities uh just so you know our process does allow for reimbursement for these other um just want to make sure everybody knows we offer support and and the complicated requests that we ask of these entities financial support next slide please so the next topic we'll cover is um the topic of study areas so in a notice of intent an applicant is required to identify resources within a specific distance from the boundary of their proposed facility these are called study areas I wanted to note another important term in our process it's a site boundary I'm sure you've heard it here tonight and on the maps the term site boundary it's in our rules it refers to the boundary of the proposed facility any supporting facilities and temporary lay down areas and that will be used throughout the process the site boundary of the proposed facility so the study areas that start in the notice of intent extend from the site boundary the study areas are established at a default distance and we've shown here on this Bullseye so for different um the study areas differ I wanted to know that the site boundary for this project is defined as a 500 foot wide Corridor that extends the length of the two routing options so 10 and 12 miles in length sometimes we have 40 000 Acre Site boundary systems a little different for a transmission line um so then back to the study areas uh what we're looking for in these study areas and the notice of intent is to make sure that all potential environmental resources within a certain distance that could be impacted by the design construction or operation of the facility are identified if there are resources outside of these default study areas that's what we're trying to figure out now that could be impacted then we want to know about them and we would expand that study area to capture an adequate impact area similarly the study area could be much smaller an example for protected areas which is a term in our process um if if there are no protected areas that could possibly be impacted by construction or operation of the facility Beyond two miles we could reduce that study area so I wanted to give you just a couple examples this shows that the study area for the land use evaluation for the Wildfire evaluation and for fish and wildlife habitat impacts extends from the site boundary out to a half a mile so this means that the applicant and the notice of intent needs to evaluate fish and wildlife habitat and species out to a half mile from that site boundary similarly for Wildfire risk they need to evaluate vegetation and risk out to a half mile and so forth so this is It's something we think is quite important for the notice of intent and it's a part of our Outreach with the reviewing agencies and the special advisory groups as they have the local knowledge of the resources so we're working very closely to see are these study areas adequate to capture the impacts very importantly are Jackson County and City of Medford where we're really wanting to make sure that the land use and public services evaluation and the study areas is adequate for members of the public are welcomed weigh in and comment on resources in the same way that we ask reviewing agencies and special advisory groups any resources that you're aware of that you feel should be protected or that you have knowledge of you are welcome to",

        "text": " Creek energy Park projects as presented and recommended by staff thank you Vice chair how I I hear a second from council member Devlin and oh we modify the list of projects okay so you said you said muddy creek and uh Lone Pine did you say Cascade renewable yes at Redstone so I think I need to add uh I think just Summit Ridge wind farm and we return Noble energy facility three yeah so I'll I'll add Summit Ridge Wind Farm Wheat Ridge renewable energy facility and I'm kind of thinking should as a pre-amble to those listings should I say including but not limited to okay I'll I'm gonna throw that in um and we'll see if we get a second okay so uh Vice chair how has added the including but not limited to is there a second or does anyone have any comments about that we're here a second for the comment uh Vice excuse me councilmember Conan looks like she wishes to say something thank you um just a quick so that leaves it pretty open-ended for dollars and it's is that dollars there's still 10 pounds yeah but not not in the not in the motion I mean do we have to be specific in the future Madam chair um I try to be agreeable uh since I seconded the first motion I second the second but it would appear to me if you add that language that leaves It Wide Open to staff to add any projects they wish to add to it and what's the question there's no time limitation on this if they ever have to come back to to approve this in the future so we have concerns about the motion of adding the additional language so at this time are there other questions comments council member buyer thank you just just a quick question and I may have misunderstood this but it sounds like there's Contracting document itself and so not to exceed ten thousand and so that Taps the amount of expenditures if additional projects are added and it hits that ten thousand dollar not to exceed staff would come back to us with the recommendation to do a new amendment to that agreement we would have additional funds and asking the question and certain stating here so um so I think as long as we fake Vice chair house recommendation and include something about the not to exceed language we should have um a buffer a cap so I thank you for your comments so then I think the question becomes and I just want to clarify is it a cap per project or in totality I think what we were trying to and Sarah by all means touched me up but I think the idea was you have these specific projects that we're going to focus on these projects we've had conversations previously where concerns about are we relinquishing our duties and authority to staff without that check-in and so I think before the motion was made or right after we discussed hey we're going to approve um as listed as stated prior to the amendment of to your motion and then if something else happened staff would come back and we would dress address that and as we move forward with this and we would learn whether we needed to do something different that's what I thought we were going down and then the additional language may have got us off track so Cindy is shaking council member Condon is shaking her head yes yes yeah it's too open-ended I guess for me but the the the police Vice chair house the purpose of the amendment to add the language including but including but not limited to was to provide flexibility to the staff to not result in a delay in processing an with the understanding that it was a ten thousand dollar amount is that per project yes yeah okay yeah so that is open-ended so I guess um well let's we can vote on it and then we can revise it if it need be well a minor line of people on that planet so council member um devil I'm going to look across the table at our legal assistance like where do we go just make sure that everybody's on the same page do we vote as is and then or do we have a motion on the table okay I'll tell you my preference would be that you vote that one down and read new language into the record so we have a clear record uh but your call thank you so we are going to leave the motion as is um do we need to restate that let's restate it please Vice chair how okay I moved at the that we approved the Department's use of consultants for review of exhibit s for the include let's see including but not limited to Lone Pine to Whetstone Cascade renewable transmission line Muddy Creek energy Park Summit Ridge wind farm and wheat Ridge renewable energy facility three as presented and recommended by staff okay we have a motion yeah I said including but not limited to he just said at the beginning this time and said about the end as he did previously Madam chair yes please there are five of us present and maybe Georgia is Jordan under anyone on the line council member trude is on the line it doesn't yes yeah it's cut in and out true it's okay a majority of those present as long as there's a form not correct okay so we have a motion do we have a second for the motion no I still have oh I'm sorry um this is gone uh anyway okay so if we could please have Mr secretary call the and buyer Cindy Condon no Richard Devlin aye for now Marcy Grail no Ken how I made it but I'm gonna vote now Jordan Truitt no chair before you announce that I'll change my books no thank you council member Devlin motion does not carry Madam chair okay this is a first thing sorry for that um bump I I apologize for not being smooth at this but that's why we have Todd and Patrick um okay so that was uh that did not pass um I think we've had some discussion do we need any additional discussion or do we have a new motion the name for the X II yeah to improve this uh our process in this meeting and to move forward Madam chair I move that we approve the Department's use of consultants for review of exhibit s for the Lone Pine to Whetstone Cascade renewable transmission line and Muddy Creek Park projects as presented and recommended by staff councilmember condo thank you we have a motion and a second discussion yes by share how you need to add Summit Ridge and beatridge so I can tell you what is happening with this um we have the list where it has some background information and the actual motion I believe is omitting that so it's just a typo in our document so okay okay so we are going to add Summit Ridge win Farm to that list and Wheat Ridge yes okay everyone's clear what we're voting on now so we have a motion this can't I'll second Vice chair Hal has given us a sorry can we amend to add the full name of Wheat Ridge okay so let's read this one more time if that's okay uh so the motion on the floor right now is for Lone Pine a whetstone transmission line Cascade renewable transmission line Summit Ridge Wind Farm Wheat Ridge renewable energy facility site excuse me Wheat Ridge renewable energy facility three in muddy creek energy Park so we have a motion and we have a second on that Mr secretary please call the roll and buyer Cindy Condon yes Richard Devlin yes Marcy Grail yes Ken how yes Jordan Truitt yes motion carries Madam chair all right thank you Sarah for your efforts here and thank you for everyone for your patience uh that was wonderful um our next item on our list is the initiate this is agenda item e this is the initiation of contested case rulemaking this is an action item and we will have Tom Jackman the rule making coordinator to present good afternoon Tom evening thank you madam chair council members my name is Thomas Jackman I am the council's rules coordinator today we'll be discussing the council's contested case rulemaking we'll be giving you a brief history of this rulemaking and then discussing the proposed scope we'll then be presenting staff's suggested rack with this rulemaking and then finally we will recommend that Council approve the direction and scope of this rule making us present today and that Council authorized staff to select rack members in the form proposed go ahead next slide so it's part of the 2023 the 2025 rulemaking schedule that we uh the council directed staff to prioritize work on the contested case rulemaking this project is very timely as it on the heels of multiple significant contested case proceedings and staff seeks to take those lessons that we've learned from those experiences while they're fresh to improve the process to facilitate and smooth out future contested case proceedings if council is agreeable with our proposal today what comes next is we're going to create a rack and we will develop a draft set of rules once staff is comfortable with the outcome of this process draft language will be presented to the council for consideration and then submit it to the Secretary of State as part of a notice of proposed rulemaking which will kick off the formal comment period and then assuming that goes smoothly it will result in the adoption of permanent roles any questions about that next slide so the scope on this rulemaking is is fairly broad the goal is to overhaul the contested case rules for the for fsec which are located primarily in division 15. um as part of that process one of the big changes is uh that staff is currently considering is the adoption of the office of administrative hearing contest of case rules in place of the Attorney General model rules that we currently have adopted in our existing rule set um you know and we basically my predecessor and Patrick have for you know performed analysis I've looked at these as well and identified that the oah contested case rules are just you know they're better so they're they cover more issues they there's more clarity and we feel that by adopting these and replacing the attorney general model rules that we will improve our contested case process as part of this kind of overhaul and in taking this relatively significant step in in our consisting case roles we also want to do kind of a comprehensive look um to identify existing rules that we needed because we didn't have the oah rules remove those so we don't have any overlap and confusion and then identify any gaps that are sent you know would be helpful to smooth out our process that are not covered in the oah rules so is to reduce confusion and uncertainty so uh this is going to be a pretty significant and important rule making that I will hopefully dramatically improve things and",

        "text": " to mind for discussion anything more around the ownership that seems to be a lot of these bullets are surrounding ownership you know this is jimmy um just on bullet point number two you know i think i imagine this or i just know there's sort of different viewpoints here you know i think it's i'd observe that this like law was this exact provisional law was just changed in hp 2021 um you know within the last year just judging by the decision of legislature and weighing in on that language very recently pg wouldn't support sort of recommending the legislature revisit it and change it all right i don't see any other hands oh we got some here we go all right comment on that that provision uh the capacity uh generation argument has been going on for a very long time and all all that happened in uh 2021 was extend it from eight percent to ten um we still believe that it was originally intended to be generation not and uh there's a long legislative history of how that happened um but the intent was to be based on generation and um but the only change by 2021 was to increase to 10 percent okay is appear you put your hand down i don't know if you still had a question okay anybody else have comments about anything on this slide or any of the prior slides open up this is this is your workshop your recommendations we want to we want to hear your thoughts so there you are go ahead you are muted still can you hear me yes oh sorry about that yeah so i just wanted to concur that um what jimmy said that in the legislative session this did come up and was was and the capacity requirement made it in after consideration of both capacity and so i i would say you know again there's there's disagreement on this but we did this capacity versus generation was considered in the most recent okay and like christy has mentioned we we can note the disagreement um and it's just we're putting all the recommendations out there for the legislature to uh consider what else i'm gonna flip back to the first slide and see if anybody's thought of anything i want to make sure you guys have time to discuss yeah i guess i just want to name something that i didn't see on here but as an active discussion among uh the investor owned utilities in some municipalities which is the element of um house bill 2021 that allows for creation of um i guess municipal green tariffs or power mix that is defined by a local and then allows for more specific goals to and in terms of both community benefits what types of resources meet the the goals of that of that community and so i just want to note that as a policy piece that we should make sure i guess um recommendations that are made also help enable that i know that you know we in the city of portland are considering that approach as are a number of other municipalities and so it was just one big thing that i just realized wasn't hadn't been mentioned before um but is i think a tool that could be woven in with a lot of these other recommendations so yeah i don't know if it's a specific recommendation or just acknowledgement of that um that process that was enabled by haspel 2021 and my understanding is that some of the utilities are looking to put forward a program model um in in the coming year to the pc and then you know work work with municipalities so yeah i guess that's probably what i'll say for now on on that but just wanted to raise it thank you uh tom yeah on the greater transparency from bpas to allowable projects i don't know what that's aiming at but i mean i can give you the short version for a utility small utility is if it's under 199 kw go for it if it's between 200 and 1 megawatt you need the administrator's approval and over one megawatt you're going to get into tanker pay and that's if you're just a tier one utilities are into tier two they can meet that tier two obligation with anything they want yeah i think that was um more geared what we discussed in our group tom where like in the future um allowing more flexibility yeah and i think that will come with the next contracts yes yeah okay so any thoughts about that or the municipal green tariffs any recommendations specific around those or anything else all right just to spark your interest i'm changing slides again just seeing if there's anything that comes to mind you're awfully quiet okay we can move to the outline portion of the session if we're ready did um sorry i'm having trouble tracking between all the different slides um one of the suggestions that asea had made was about better rules and ways for storage to be compensated what's that i know i've supported that as well yeah i didn't i don't see that on this um that would be under rates i don't see that it's made it there yet but it's you know it is on the list for sure okay great okay yeah don't don't worry yeah storage is a complicated one for sure all right thank you angela any others stephanie before we move on as people continue to stare at this and think if there's anything missing um i think maybe it's helpful to remind folks about the process on this um that i sent along i know we'll talk about next steps at the end but specific to this list we'll be compiling it and then sending it out one last time to for you all to take a look at because it's your report and study and not ours right so we'll be sending um sending this list out once it's fully complete so that you can review it yes thank you christy all right jimmy just a process question for you christy on that front i mean i know we've been engaged in the exercise this afternoon that we're kind of describing is this you know you know get all the ideas out there um you know tell me a little bit more as to you know the process of going from like a spaghetti type list to something that is being represented as like a group i don't think we plan on having there be consensus group recommendations um stephanie i think you've been the most articulate and kind of how you're planning on yeah yeah so essentially we're going to present all the ideas that were brought up all the recommendations um from this work group and we're gonna kind of talk around them so as you saw earlier there's certain topics that there are divisions on we're going to articulate those divisions um and then the ones that you know have a little bit more can like just a little bit they're a little less controversial within the group um those will not be presented with as many differing viewpoints for example but all of them are going to be in there this the list is not going to get whittled down in that regard so it's it's going to be the spaghetti till the end um it's just going to have articulation around the ones that have um you know basically objections or different viewpoints will be discussed but that's that's really all that it's going to be does that make sense to me i guess so i mean just to kind of clarify to is a useful exercise like basically right now we're engaged and you know anyone can say anything that will just then be ultimately like be a bullet point that will go to the legislature as part of the report yeah and we're just going to call them like work group member recommendations versus work group recommendations and we'll be sure that it's very clear that these are all the ideas that we heard um we did something similar with the rto study um that we did last at the end of last year so we're kind of following that same model of what we want to avoid is the department of energy being an arbiter of what there's consensus about and we weren't necessarily asked to provide consensus recommendations so i think that that's our logic we want to faithfully um represent the viewpoints of the members and there's not agreement among all of the members so how can we how can we best do that and so this is kind of the approach that we've developed is just to make it very clear that we're not there might be some consensus recommendations and then we would those would be potentially elevated and mentioned as ones where there's more support as stephanie was saying but yeah not not cutting anything because there's disagreement about them understood thank you and then we're going to send you what we put together with this sort of language and and things like that when we send the draft report so there can also be comments back from you all saying it's still not hitting the nail on the head for me that it's clear enough that there's not consensus around these or something like that now that you've had a couple more minutes with some of these is there anything else before we move to the outline and does anybody need me to go to a specific slide i'm happy to change it to a specific slide for a minute okay well then let's move on over to the outline and other gaps in knowledge okay so here's another one where i am just going to exit out of oops nope not that wrong i'm just going to take your comments hopefully you have had some time to review the outline that we circulated obviously the recommendations section was not complete because that is something we were hoping today would build out as we have so far um so any comments from anybody based on what you saw in the outline so far someone be the first brave one to speak i can help um i think james already identified one and thanks to adam for reminding me that um there was an ask for us to identify ownership of current projects or existing projects have that be included in the report yes we i wish rob were here one um but since we we don't actually have a lot of visibility on that necessarily as um i james and i actually talked about it in the breakout he was in my brickhacker um and so yeah we we're gonna we're gonna look into it see if we can tease anything out but there are limitations to the data and we will we'll see what we can do ah orianna it could be helpful throughout the report to just uh between recommendations that are specific to investor owned utilities versus consumer utilities or where a recommendation might have to be applied in slightly different ways i do feel like the discussion in this work group has been very focused on the investor owned side of things and that might be a thing to not acknowledge as well or that there may be further conversations or or data collection that's necessary around the the",

periodically and feel free definitely if folks just want to make comments in the chat that's great too okay that's fine and then I wanted to just sort of tease out a little bit um maybe what your thinking is now that you've heard from rack members support for sort of Base you know thinking about providing businesses with the with more information more information is better right in terms of planning and and aligning with missions reductions goals um do you do you anticipate then that you could provide you know when you you initiated this conversation you were thinking that maybe you couldn't provide some of that information like emissions factors Etc um but you know is is it would it be particularly burdensome for the agency to to offer that level of technical assistance um it like it it you know is in line with the purpose of the statute and um and you know will ensure the success too of of these efforts yeah I mean I think so most of the feedback that I'm hearing today from the rack is to like in still include these like emissions assessments components into the audit into the plan even though we won't be asking for like greenhouse gas intensity um like metrics for each building and yeah as far as like calculating the emissions from a building I I know it's um you know I think that's something we're like we could be open to including some assistance for although I think most of our assistance will be dedicated toward the actual elements that are part of the Oregon VPS um but in that case we would still look to like the emissions factors that are public lished by other state agencies the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality does a utility specific emissions factor analysis for Oregon utilities every um every year and again that's kind of like then mentioned it's a little bit lagging sometimes just it you know takes a year or two to gather the data and determine that factor similar to the egrid process too um and I don't know exactly where I I've heard that portfolio manager May in the future have an ability to customize and enter in utility specific emissions factors um that's something that we would definitely continue to explore um I think that would make the emissions quantifications a whole lot easier if we could just build in the utility specific factors that we that we want to um in there and just let a building owner use that as the accounting methodology um but you I think we'd probably have to think through a little bit the like the level of technical analysis that we that we provide and support on that just because it's not a direct component of the Oregon BPS but it's definitely Associated and certainly um one of the overall goals of the program does that hopefully that answers the question Cara a little bit thank you so much yeah um JP oh yeah just going back to the um was it 5.1.1 we were talking about um energy and Emissions management plan I think generally I'm in agreement with that like those two things are often used interchangeably obvious reasons um I I the one point I would mention is that sometimes when we're talking about an emissions management plan in the industry we might be talking specifically about energy procurement or offsets so and I don't think that's really going to be a problem because that's not something that this legislation is talking to but it's just probably worth mentioning that like that is quite specific as far as you know if we're looking at energy procurement that could be targeting emissions and it could do nothing to the eui of a building so there is a distinction there uh just wanted to flag that but generally like yeah um if you're not being super specific and if you're actually not asking for an emissions management plan in in that narrow sense yeah those those two things are used interchangeably okay yeah thanks I appreciate all this feedback on this one so it it just to kind of summarize hopefully it kind of sounds like we're interested in including the emissions as a component of the energy management plan but you know not maybe calling it an emissions management plan more like an energy management plan with similar to before like with emissions assessment um sort of thing does that kind of characterize the the feedback and the the group discussion so hopefully not hearing any opposition so um so I think we can move on to the next section um where it actually starts to detail out the components of an energy management plan um so maybe we can take some time to kind of go through this about um so the energy management plan shall incorporate the following um so one thing we can you know it you know sha is pretty pretty direct language and when we go to implement our compliance checks on the program you know if a building owner needs to submit their energy management plan and and we've got this language in there shall then each one of these items would be something that we would look for for compliance um so something to kind of think about how we would address this and look at this in the future so should you know something out put out for the rxs comment um would be like should this stay as a shall should it be as a May should some of these elements um perhaps be removed from the energy management plan um some of these get pretty uh specific and pretty potentially complex and detailed you know so they they outline each one of these so they got five .1 point2 is the section and then you know 0.1 2. 34 all the way down through um3 um 5.1.2 actually U yeah 14 that outlines the different CR or different uh components that need to be part of a management plan so you know there things like you know it kind of starts out with like I I think things that are that are necessary like some way to like how is the building accounting for their energy use um and how how is the building recording it uh what is the energy use intensity these are things that are going to a building owner is going to need to do just to figure out hey do I comply with the standard or not um updating the net energy use that's just part of the you know part of the process of determining compliance um but then there's some other elements down here talking about like documenting um current changes number of occupants you know energy audits if applicable maintaining this list of Energy Efficiency measures you know things like a method to inform occupants about the benefits of energy use and instruct them in the use and adjustment of operable Windows hbac controls um are these critical elements that we would expect a building owner to put into a management plan um that's what I'm hoping to get some discussion about today so um I see that JP has a hand raised and then Alex mine was from last time you can move on okay great uh Alex yeah so so I think uh just to frame this conversation a little bit right what we're trying to discuss is an energy management plan is typically to ensure a building um meets its compliance targets when it gets to that point or improves you know as necessary and what we're trying to Det in this discussion is when is it helpful and when is it maybe in in in um outsized burden for building owners right so how do we balance what a what a building burden on the building owner with ensuring we're meeting those targets right um like you were saying there are certain aspects here that seem important to achieve that goal and then where maybe it gets uh removed or maybe it's it's becomes an aspect of an energy management plan for non-compliant building right just kind of that's what we're kind of try to determine would you agree with that statement Blake yes yeah yeah I think so I think there's some components that are necessary just to figure out like where a building stands relative to compliance um and then there's some just yeah more complex Parts um of it that aren't necessarily necessary to determine compliance but could help support it um but could also add um you know a high level of work for the building owner and manager do so um yeah Kevin looks like you have a hand raised oh yeah thanks I was curious so at the moment items 1 through 14 Are All Shall is that right that's right okay yeah thanks yeah so it it kind of leads off with this shall incorporate um component so you know mainly kind of interested here if there's kind of like Alex was mentioning about if there's an opportunity to kind of keep the critical pieces and you know is there a need or opportunity to reduce the you know a burden on an on a building owner with regard to just putting this plan together and maintaining it so I don't know if there's any specific um you know open to hearing comments on either any specific items here or just like general ones about like yes need to keep everything in there or you know General guidance of kind of feel free to remove the ones that aren't maybe necessary for um just determining BPS compliance sort of a thing um like because there's thing elements like a Capital Management plan um that as of right now would be part of the energy management plan too so and that Capital Management plan includes things like sizing calcul calculations for HVAC equipment um in the event that equipment needs to be replaced so like having those um yeah maybe maybe um you know uh you know like based on what you said I agree that there's probably measures that could be removed or or or could be optional or could be um uh in in a case of non-compliance um I think there are some maybe that that uh I know that the own M we're going to talk about in the next chapter too um specifically but but yeah um I think that that's that's a good point like the equipment sizing uh the question is how useful that is particular if that's you know that in the beginning um you know maybe it's a newer building you know so it's newer equipment um and then later on uh you know five years later when in the compliance period it's somewhat outdated already so it's it's a it's double work obviously I think we all agree that equipment sizing is critical for performance just like we talked earlier about commissioning um the design is critical but the question is if it's as part of the energy management plan is a little out of MH yeah thanks Alex um Vin um certainly you we do incorporate a lot of these in the city of Portland to in our Energy Management plans and I think that's",

        "text": " this continuance you have them for um the Andro that we can try to email or I can talk through it so the Planning Commission is holding a hearing tomorrow that's already been scheduled it was continued to a date certain so with option one which is PC and and board take action before the may vote our proposed dates are November 15th for the Planning Commission they may need to continue to December 6th depending on the amount of deliberation we just don't know yet how long that hearing is going take the board could hold your November 28th hearing you have to hold your November 28th hearing because we've already advertised it you could choose to take action on November 28th if the Planning Commission continues to December 6th you may want to continue to January 23rd or January 30th in order to let the Planning Commission process complete um but in this matter the Planning Commission is advisory to the board and so the board could choose to do otherwise we picked the January 23rd and 30th dates in order to give us enough time after a December 6th Planning Commission hearing to put together materials for a staff report so that's option one theoretically could be done in November or January for the board with option two the Planning Commission hearing would happen on December F on November 15th possible continuance to December 6th the board would then likely continue to July 16th and the reason we picked July 16th is after talking to our election staff um June 17th would be the date that the election is certified so we want to make sure that the board hearing happens after we know for sure the results of that election and then option three continuing both processes Planning Commission still has their hearing they could continue to June 26th and then the board could continue to July 23rd well and I know I expressed uh through our conversation last week that I would hope in the future that for our ordinances when Commissioners have long given advance notice of vacations in this case commissioner Willie takes a vacation every year at the same time um but he's also made sure we've had it way in advance that we won't schedule an ordinance within a District uh if said commissioner is going to be on vacation uh so um I just wanted to make sure that was in the mix that's where November 28th from my standpoint even if we didn't have this I would want us to continue it until January period so um that's just that so okay so uh thank you for putting this information together and including the options uh I'm going to assume since all Commissioners have their own monitors that we can take the options down from the screen and just just have the opportunity to see one another and go around to the five Commissioners and see what questions might you have Andor a um preference who would like to go first oh I'll jump in The Fray I don't mind getting us going um I appreciate uh the clarity that you have here uh and I find it a little bit puzzling that it says we're not required to approve the ordinance even though it would be a change to our own comprehensive plan which I believe is Al always done ordin so I'm a little bit confused by that on slide seven I think what it means is that the board is not merely perfunctory and in this matter the in the case of a city Urban growth boundary expansion the city takes action through a local ordinance and then the county does the same so a county could say we don't think the city followed the right process we don't think the city met all the criteria we don't want to approve this and if that happens the county effectively blocks it from moving forward to the state for acknowledgement and that has happened we found some um instances where a county did not approve the urban growth boundary expansion that a city had proposed okay all righty um also on slide eight uh Mr Anderson you are our County Council and slide eight it says the city's ordinance is not effective unless approved by North planes Motors in May 2024 I want to make sure that you're in legal agreement okay um given the correspondence that we have received that is not based in a legal opinion uh but expresses an opinion with regard to that step one business I want to make sure that we're all clear on uh our our what our legal council says um so at this juncture I do uh acknowledge the staff recommendation for approval and based on the review of the technical information and process from the city and what in your technical expertise uh we need to evaluate uh all of this the criteria we need to evaluate all of this on but I respect the fact that the city voters do have an election coming up to make a decision on the referral one way or the uh it is also not lost on me their decision on the May 2023 uh police Levy so at this juncture so as to purely so as not to influence the election one way or the other right uh the voters of North Plains have a referral before them uh that'll be on the May ballot and I don't want anything that we might do say or hear through the course of our uh process uh to influence that election one way or the other and it's a referral I may not like the the level of referral rate here in the state of Oregon but nonetheless I have to accept that it is what it is and um that we're faced with a referral that'll be on the May ballot and so we'll just pick back up then so that's my thinking so your recommendation is option for me option three y commissioner Rogers there we go um first couple of comments and then to the recommendation u i I've seen nothing in the process that didn't fall all good land use law I mean the city went through their process um presented that to us and that's so I the work's been good I I I don't doubt that uh secondly I do support the referendum process and I think this is f that it's going on having said that I distinguish between us finishing our work internally not at the board level but internally and saying let's let the Planning Commission proceed on so administratively it's done we have followed good land use policies they will complete their work they will bring that to us and then we can defer until you know after the May election but uh I'd like this to stay within the purview of what the law as I understand it to be and that would be usess to look at it did they do the work yes is a complete yes and approve it to move on and then the referral process will make a decision as to whether their part moves on and then we don't have to reopen it or even approve it if we get Beyond May so that's where I'm at so option wise so can that's option two could we not choose options until we all speak so that we all hear each other before know the option you don't think I'm persuasive enough to get somebody to change their mind I didn't say that commissioner Willie what he just described was let the Planning Commission proceed and then the board comes back to it which is option two that's why I was check King I know but um when you interrupted me I know because commissioner Rogers am I correctly understanding that what you summarized is option two in essence correct but I'm certainly open to hear others that's I'd like to hear all the comments thank you Roy so does despite what you may have heard you are each independently allowed to State your opinions at this juncture otherwise I will call on you I'm waiting on nefisa thank you yes chair I can I have a question uh this morning um I received a letter from North Plains and I think there is a there's maybe I'm paraphrasing or misunderstanding what's the content of the letter eron I'm wondering if one if you saw that letter and then if that's yes I'm wondering what the disagreement is that they're pointing out and then two what exactly are they asking in terms of the options that are listed here I did see the letter but I think I'd ask County Council to respond to that I think the dis agreement is primarily legal and has to do with the order right I you know there's there's much said about step one step two step three that piece from our perspective is somewhat irrelevant because two things have to happen for it to go to dlcd and that is City approval and County approval um or passing of ordinances and so I I and I think there is a fundamental disagreement between North Plains and and our office on this issue um we do think that North Plains ordinances is in limbo has to be referred to voters and so their their ordinance is not effective right now if you think about uh a currently existing County uh ordinance that's on pause but it's because it's in the court cases but we did uh your board did pass uh the flavor tobacco ban and then that was referred to the voters uh that ordinance was not in effect during that period of time between board approval and and uh vote by the um County residents does that help answer your neisa yes and then the second question I asked Brad is that for Aon or for you can you repeat the question yeah 100% in the letter they are there's a specific ask to the city is saying we're in the process of researching case law on the on this issue as well as continuing communicating with dlcd on these issues and respectfully ask that you allow us to soon share our findings with you for consideration and my question is what is specifically are they asking in terms of the con the list the consideration that are listed on our PowerPoint slide I can't answer on behalf of North que that was a bit unclear to us as well um Rob do you want to I mean it would be speculation on our behalf well I I think I can add a little bit of detail to that which is that I think one of the questions that city the city had been is the state requires cities to plan for 20 years of growth and the city has done that and so this referendum then calls into question how the city can plan for 20-year growth so I think they feel a little bit stuck that they're doing what the state has told them they have to do and now there's a referendum on that and and I do think that is a potential legally challenging thing but that doesn't mean that the referendum didn't happen and",

        "text": " The structural plans that were reviewed by the building department stated that the age of the manufactured home doesn't meet the current standard. So it is something that she would want to take into account. I would want to make her aware of. I wasn't even sure. Some of the mobile homes you can't even move. Right. Like after 1989 or. Or I wasn't sure. Is it. Is there some stipulation? Yes. Um, I think. Well, I think the cutoff is the seventies. 1972, 74. Okay. Don't quote me on that. Um, but this one is 65, so this is a 1965. I don't even know if you can actually move this thing here. Even if it was zoned r four. Right. Right. I still think. Still wouldn't be meeting the current HUD standards. Yeah. Anyway, I'm sorry, ma'am. Listen, I. The problem is, once you. Once you allow one of these to happen, you set a complete standard for that whole subdivision, for that everywhere else. Right. Because once we allow you to do it, then pretty much you got to let the whole block do it. And there's already people that have built not a few lots down, single family homes. The only mobile homes that are in that area, when I drive through there are in Agdeh and on aG, pieces of property. And so, I mean, we would. We would be setting a completely different precedent. I don't think that thing's supposed to be there. Unfortunately, you moved it there illegally. Everything about this is the wrong way. And I do apologize, because I feel for you, if you're telling the truth. I am telling the truth. You know, I really do feel for you, honestly. But we can't let this thing stay there. This commissioner can't vote to continue to let this stay there. It needs to be a site built home, unfortunately. So I'm going to agree with staff and move. Is that a motion? Yes, ma'am. To deny? Motion to deny. Do we have a second? And have a motion by Commissioner Zalot. Second by public comment. Thank you. I thought you already took it out. I did. And there was no one who stepped forward, so we're good. A second by Commissioner Curry. Any further discussion? I hope you can get some of your money back, because you're not going to be able to permit that. I'll call the vote. All in favor, signify with aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. Sorry, dear. I wish you the best. You're going to have to move that off of that. That land. And I hope you do get to retire here with your son. But you are going to have to do a site built home on that property. That takes us to item 15. Four, adoption of ordinances. I've got a motion by Commissioner Zalick, second by Commissioner Curry. All in favor, signify with aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. Did you have anything, mister. Wayrock, before we conclude today? Yes, ma'am. Ken Wayrock with growth services. I just want to let you know that a similar issue where structures are being placed on properties without permits and oftentimes not meeting setbacks, they end up in our board of adjustments. And it is becoming a major problem so much that the board of adjustments themselves want to write a letter to send to you about these companies moving structures to properties without permits, mainly sheds in the board of adjustments. While here, it was a home. But I just wanted to let you know, and there have been several that I've sent to Tracy, where you see people clearing lots and moving mobile homes that, I mean, there's nowhere else that some of these places should have gone except for the scrap yard is the best way to. Is the best language I could use. And then they put them up next to other site built homes and other places. I mean, really, they. So we. So we need to. We do need to address that. We need to crack down on that. And even some of the stuff that, the product thing to Tracy not too long ago, but even some of the setbacks and people building, you know, even these secondary. I'm guessing that they're secondary structures, but they don't have any room. And they're building them eight, five foot to the lot line. And, you know, I mean, it's. And then. And then on top of that, then they put four or five storage sheds on there, and there's no. There's no longer any room. Right. Well, and I'm going to say this, Ken, I mean, we need to find out who moved that mobile home to that property without proper permitting. And we need to go after them. Yeah. If they're. If they're building. Building should have some. Some way to go after them. Right. I would say they've got to be in on my. Okay. And I think that we need to maybe get a list. Maybe get a list of all of the shed companies. And they need to get a letter regarding what. What they have to do in order to do that. I mean, because if you don't, if we don't take action on it now, it's just going to continue to get worse. As you've already stated when we talked about this a while ago when we were doing the shed thing by one of our committees, I think Mister Minter said that if we go down that we have to redo our ordinance and then we, every time they move one illegally without a permit from Marion, can sell one and move one, then you have to find the think out of them until they learn. So we'll get with legal and with building to see what options we have and then we'll get back with you. And we probably would like to see the letter that the board of adjustment wants to send to us. Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. Whenever they get it ready for us. Okay, this meeting is adjourned. We'll be back here at 530 for public hearings. It. It.",

still none Nancy okay we'll the time is 10:27 and we'll close the uh public period the next item is the wheat wheat Rich renewable energy East request for Amendment one review of the draft proposed order Christopher Clark senior sighting analyst will have the floor I thank you thank you chair how members of the council for the record my name is Christopher Clark I am a senior sighting analist for the Department um as chair how just mentioned I'm here to talk about um weid renewable energy facility East and um assist the Council with your review of the draft proposed order for request for Amendment one I can get slide um thank you uh so I covered a lot of this material at the March council meeting uh so I'm not going to go over it in detail but feel free to stop me if you would like um but this request has been require uh processed under the type A Amendment review process which included a public hearing and public comment period uh which concluded on April 4th and we got certificate holder responses on April 8th um during my dis my presentation today I'm primarily going to be um focusing on the public comments received um rather than the other findings in the draft proposed order that we reviewed in March um as far as the remaining steps in the process um after we hear the council's feedback um we will issue our proposed order containing our uh recommendations on uh findings of of compliance with standards and conditions of approval um uh the type a review process allows for a possible contested case on the proposed order um and I'll just note that only those persons who raise a relevant issue in person uh on at the public Hearing in March or in writing by the comment deadline May participate or may request to participate in that contested case um and then if held the contested case would be overseen by a hearing officer appointed by the council um after the deadline for contested case hearing requests um has passed the or the contested case proceeding has included the council will then review the proposed order and issue your final order uh approving or denying the request for amended site certificate um I believe you're all familiar with most of the history of this um proceeding so um I'll just start with uh at the um March meeting we had the public hearing um and then the comment period for written comments closed on April 4th uh after that the council did leave the record open until the following Monday April 8th to get uh certificate fer responses which they provided on that date um so today then is your chance to review those comments and the DPO um and provide feedback on what you believe should be included in the proposed order um assuming uh there are no significant issues raised or anything nothing needs more time uh we would be expecting to issue that proposed order next Friday uh or next week I should say um prior to April 26th um if that deadline if that timeline holds uh then we would be looking at a deadline for contested case requests uh on May 27th um right before your May meeting which is scheduled for May 31st um at which is the earliest State the council can make its final decision just note that all of that is really contingent on um the discussion today as well as whether or not there's any contested case requests um after we issue our proposed order slide please um just as a brief reminder um the facility we're talking about today we Ridge East was originally approved as part of the Wheat Ridge Wind um and that facility was approved in 2017 and has subsequently been divided into four successor facilities Wheat Ridge 1 two and three and then Wheat Ridge East which we're discussing um Wheat Ridge East uh or Al uh was a separate turbine group to the east of the Wheat Ridge facilities uh connected to the main sight with a 31 mile transmission line um which actually if we go to the next slide see a map thank you um so you can see uh in sort of the northeast corner of the map on the slide are the wind micro sighting uh corridors and then the remaining um fordor going to the South and then the West is the interconnection transmission line Corridor that's a overhead 230 KV transmission line um this original facility was approved to include um 200 megaw of wind capacity as well 20 megawatts of battery storage capacity um within this 4582 Acre Site uh the site's located in both Morrow and County um the next slide please as you can see in rfa1 the certificate holder is requesting authorization to expand the site um this includes of a different couple types of expansions um and we got some comments that this wasn't entirely clear uh in the previous STP propos order so I'll try to um lay out how how we're intending to explain it in the proposed order but hopefully also give a better idea of what's Happening um so from that 4,582 acre approved Port approved site boundary which uh is the same as the micro sighting bors um currently the certificate holder um proposes to expand the site boundary out to the property uh lines of their lease boundaries for the facility and that would occur both in the approved portions of the site um to the north of butter Creek and then in these newly proposed areas uh to the South uh and along the old the approved transmission Bor route um I'll give the numbers in a minute but I just want to make sure that that's clear and that's represented by the dark purple line uh which goes out from the blue to the dark purple within that expanded sight boundary the certificate holder also requests to um expand their micro sighting corridors uh to accommodate up to 41 additional wind turbines um and that's reflected by light purple uh filled areas on the map um so in addition to expanding the site boundary and the micro sighting areas um the uh certificate holder would also be realigning the proposed transmission line Corridor around a new route um it's not entirely easy to see from this figure but most of the route does follow what was previously approved there's a little bit of a difference uh in the middle part of the site but most of the differences are on the western edge of the site where it's just the transmission Corridor and you can see those purple areas um as the transmission line approaches Highway 20 great um to break this down more numerically and if I could get the next please it's okay um this would include an increase in the site boundary area of approximately 74,400 Acres um and then an increase in the micro sighting areas by about 10,000 um and those are significant numbers and I just remind everyone on the council that this is Wind Facility so things are dispersed um so I did think it would be helpful to look at the actual disturbance Acres the um facility components as proposed in request for Amendment one would occupy about 165 Acres um that includes wind turbines and their Associated Footprints as well as the substations um and the uh uh transmission line Port poles um that's an increase of about 118 Acres over what was previously approved and it's about three and a half times more permanent dis disturbance area um as what was previously approved um there would also be an additional 635 Acres of temporary disturbance during construction of the facility um and that uh total 1, 121 Acres of temporary disturbance is the area that would need to be revegetated and stored after construction so that all makes sense and if I can get the next slide as far as the facility components themselves as I mentioned um the certificate holder proposing to add 41 uh new turbines the turbines would also be redistributed throughout the site so uh the they're not all I guess not only 41 turbines would be cited in the new areas um but this the facility would be kind of reconfigured with this new um total uh amount of turbines and a total of 300 megawatts of total name plate capacity um to accommodate the larger energy facility there's also changes to the related or supporting facilities um this the request for Amendment eliminates uh previously approved overhead collector lines the low or medium voltage 34.5 kilovolt collector lines and um expands the underlined Underground collection system uh as I mentioned the request uh proposes to realign the transmission line um that would go down from a maximum of 32 miles to a new 26 Mile route um that's located entirely within Morrow County um and then the access road system would be expanded uh to include 76 miles of permanent access roads within the site and then 15 miles of temporary access roads needed for construction of the um transmission line so next slide please okay um this slide shows the layout that was proposed in rfa1 um generally layouts are uh just proposed and they're provided for examples because micro sighting forers do allow for micro sighting flexibility after construction we do want to say or just mention that um we believe that this layout is should be fairly close to the final design um of at least portions of the facility since the certificate holder is planning on building or beginning construction um as soon as they can after the council makes your decision um just to point out a few features on this map I know it's not uh very easy to see but um there are are more than 107 yellow dots representing turbines on this map and that's because there are some alternate locations so not all of the turbine locations would be um constructed uh you can see the proposed transmission line carridor um reflected by a red line covered with uh little triangles going through the center of the site um and this is kind of helpful to see where the final alignment was proposed on the western side um it has been rerouted I think to avoid um both some agricultural features and then other energy uh facility development associated with the other wheat rdge um and uh you can't see it very awful but I do have other slides showing where the proposed substation sites are um so actually yeah if you can give me the next slide Nancy great uh yeah so uh as you can see there the site with the proposes change in RFA 1 would include two substation sites uh one on the the left side of the slide is north of uh of butter Creek uh sorry and uh that",

three four five zero one one zero zero eight zero any person who engages in unacceptable conduct which disrupts the meeting may be expelled so our next agenda item is agenda item c and this is the port westward renewable fuels project this is council review of the site certificate exemption request we have wally adams operation and policy analyst to present the proposed order on this request wally thank you chair grail good morning uh members of the council i'm wally adams operations and policy analyst with oregon department of energy so we're going to review a request for exemption from the requirement for a site certificate from the port westward renewable fuels this is an action item so as chair grail mentioned at the end we'll ask council take action on this item so we're going to go through project description the procedural what the council's authority is and the applicable requirements we did get some public comments on this so we'll go over a summary of that and then of course we'll go into detail and review the exemption request and then at the end be time for your deliberation and of course any point if you would like to ask questions please feel free so this is we we call it the port westward renewable fuels project the applicant is next renewable fuels llc the location would be the port westward industrial park in columbia county the total area is about 145 acres that's 115 for the facility and then just shy of 30 acres for the associated rail spur that is needed to support the facility the capacity for this project the the input would be up to 50 000 barrels per day of biomass feedstocks and we'll talk about what those are as we get into this then the output would be 49 200 barrels per day of renewable fuels both diesel and naphtha and those are the the maximum capacity so they wouldn't necessarily have that right at the beginning but that's the the maximum that they're saying that they would process and produce at this facility so just a couple of maps here to get us i'd like to point out on here and you can see the port westward area and the facility site marked you can also see where the rail spur is kind of over on the right hand side and it's probably a little hard to see on the screen trying to move my cursor but there's a main rail line here that they would tie and that is to bring some materials in but mainly they intend to use the port for receiving their their raw materials and for shipping their finished products out so just another view and you can see some of the other utility connections over on the left there is a tie for a natural gas line the facility uses natural gas we'll talk where they use that and why and then you can also see the pipeline that's in blue and that's to both bring in the raw materials and of course to transfer out the finished products over to the port so procedural history the application was initially submitted in november of 2020. the department sent a request for additional information to next and they in february of 21 and then at the end of march the department sent an evaluation of the exemption request to next and the purpose was basically just to clarify where information was still required so then march 31st of this year next submitted an updated request for and shortly thereafter the department issued a notice of filing which basically is saying we considered it as required by the statute and rules on april 20th the department issued a draft of the proposed order that we're going to review today and concurrently opened a 21 day written comment period may 11th that comment period closed and we issued the proposed order in a written comment summary for council's on may 13th so the council's authority here in ors 469 311a it says that an energy facility includes in part g a plant which converts biomass to a gas liquid or solid any combination of such products um if they can be burned to produce the equivalent of six billion btus of heat a day this facility at its maximum capacity would would far exceed that so it would normally fall within the council's authority unless it qualified for an exemption so next is applied for an exemption under 469 ors 469 320 to f which states a site certificate is not required for and i'm not going to read through all of these things but basically the facility has to exclusively use biomass as a source of material for conversion to a liquid fuel they have to have local land use no new fsec jurisdictional transmission or pipelines of the finished products have to be transported in bulk by rail or barge and finally the carbon intensity specification has to be met so we'll go through each of these in detail as we review the request for so i mentioned that we had a written comment period that was open from april 20th to may 11th we received a total of 11 comments all the comments are posted on our oto which is fairly new that we have a docket as we call it out there so the substantive comments that we receive focused basically on two issues the first was that the facility so again this is the comments comments claim that the facility does not exclusively use biomass and therefore does not meet the requirements of the statute for an exemption and second that the carbon intensity of the facility exceeds 118 pounds of co2 per million btus and therefore does not require or meet that part of the requirements of the statute so we'll address each of these as we review the application versus the so we're going to start with the the hard one and that's the feedstock and so just looking again at the statute so this says that they must exclusively use biomass including but not limited to grain whey potatoes oil seeds waste vegetable oil or cellul cellulosic biomass as the source of material for conversion to a liquid fuel so basically i think there are two questions here that we have to answer and it's first is the feedstock that next intends to use meet the definition of biomass that's the easier part and then second does the statement exclusively uses biomass as the source of material for conversion refer to only the primary feedstock or to all of the ingredients that are used and we'll get into great detail on that second point in let's look at the first point so here's an example that next put in their application of what their feedstock would look like so they would use you know soybean and canola oils corn oil used cooking oil beef tallow and then a couple of types grease obtained from from animals from pork and chickens so if you look at the the statute it says exclusively uses biomass including but not limited to and some of these things that are listed here are not in this table so you know does it does it meet the requirements the waste vegetable oil would count in but some of the other things aren't specifically listed although standard does say biomass including but not limited to so the applicant did make a an argument for this in their application and they call down a definition of biomass from ors chapter this is basically the tax code and here there is a definition of biomass that says it means organic matter that is available on a renewable or recurring and then it gives a list and included in that list are opel and tallow from animal rendering and then finally crops grown solely to be used for energy you know basically the department in reviewing this we we agree that that's a good definition to use and the biomass that they've cited um would would count and falls under the statute excuse me just a second so now is where it gets interesting so let's let's take a look at this phrase again and i highlighted the part as",

I am very excited and I also want to make a public apology to the counselor today the work session we had I think was last week also everything happened Last week Counselor Joy made a very good point and I left and I think I should apologize that if it is in the public spirit I owe myself an apology and I know that you would have taken a call but I chose to do it here and I didn't just leave I laughed it was unprofessional to laugh it was important and the reason I laughed is because I thought the same thing I struggled with the fact that there is a large part of the city that is not incorporated in the first year I was a councilor I had to work with that and I always thought it wasn't fair that all these people who benefit from what we do here for the city and don't pay the same taxes or why don't they want to so I just want to say that I apologize for my carelessness And I really I appreciate what you contribute the questions and that I will no longer be so careless and I hope you will excuse me of course of course Thank you very much Thank you advisors Where are we together and we will be here to support each other so that everything can be better for everyone I really appreciate it Please recognize this, there are many things that are happening here, there is a lot that implies the responsibility that we have here, thank you, thank you councilors, I would like to highlight a couple of things as well. I want to congratulate the colleagues and I want to mention two things that I think highlight the richness of the community that We have these are things that when you are the mayor you have to do fun things A few days ago I did very fun things and the last one was last I participated in the festival at the Pires cemetery and it was really a wonderful event despite the rain storm 250 people there who were celebrating the Chinese immigrants and who are the basis for the foundation of and everything was done in live broadcast with their ancestors descendants in China and it was a wonderful event I felt very honored to be participating and represent all of you in said event they also invited me to the then well it is difficult to keep everything up to date and Well it really was a wonderful experience as well I had never had an experience of that kind in the past and it really was a great opportunity I encourage you that if you ever have the opportunity It is really wonderful and good and well I wanted to highlight these two points the Siri manager will have some comment If he says Thank you Mr. Mayor I want to point out the wonderful work we are doing Here tonight the [ __ ] already mentioned the Acres that we are requesting And if one day we are successful In that people can say what a wonderful acquisition to add to our community that first step was taken Here tonight and I feel proud to be part of this team that integrated all this action for weeks I hope that we are successful at this point and tonight We are also an air traffic operating agreement to be able to serve our community another time so we are taking a step forward for our community that has to do with the participation of a wonderful staff John Mark Bryant and their respective teams have made an outstanding job to be able to bring us this agreement here tonight really. There was a lot of technical work and they went back and forth with all this but well we are about to finish it we are almost ready to take off and well we had to recognize tonight the hard work that has been done for this commercial and I agree with the mayor and the councilors that they are very important steps for our future and it is one of those things that we will see once in the future we will look back and see what wonderful things we have achieved Yes good These are the visions going It's going to be an incredible transformation, one in the center of the city and another for all the cities. All of this is wonderful, so I don't know if the councilors have any other comments. If not, let's move on to the proclamations. And then the president is here to make the week. of the national proclamation from public safety telecations welcome and welcome Thank you very much for being with us considering that public safety qualifications are the first and most critical contact our residents have with emergency services considering what can occur emergencies at any time requiring police fire services or energy medical services and considering that when an emergency occurs the prompt response of police officers fire paramedics is critical to the protection of life preservation of property and considering that safety of our police officers and firefighters depends on the quality of accuracy of the information obtained from residents who telephone the communications center of and considering that public safety telecommunicators are the only vital link to the protection of life and preservation of the quality property and that attitude of the information obtained from the residents who call the center to communicate and considering that the security telebrators so that our police officers, firefighters, since they supervise their activities by radio, provide them with information guarantee their safety. and whereas each operator has passionately demonstrated compassion and now therefore I and Mayor of the City of Psalm Oregon hereby proclaim April 9-15, 2023 as National Telecommunications Empirical Security Week in honor of the communications center employees whose diligence and professionalism keep our city safe and our residents are grateful for this recognition and we celebrate what we do and because we can also keep doing fun things you really are the first responders and you are responsible for the safety of many people and for that we thank you very well Now we are going to move on to the public comments and we have two people we are going to remind you that you have three minutes please come to the microphone press the button to turn it on give us your name and address and first we have John Thank you very much it's me hopper if you could please release the microphone sir could you release microphone because it makes a lot of noise when you hold it just one step forward so that it is closer I am here to few words about the next airline I spent 51 years at the airport in Salen I had the opportunity to see what was happening in this world I worked for United Airlines for other airlines I was also at the Portlan airport your forty-three and what I cannot understand is that airline when they want to come here did not have a frequency of flights Delta was the only one that had a contract and they were here for six months and I remember well but on paper they said they were going to produce they were going to operate two flights a week that's what the article says or am I wrong Well it's really not much for the money they are getting really paying for it to work well and look like a good business you have to have two things in an airline company first is the frequency nothing is more important than the frequency we operated every two hours three hundred and sixty five days a year cancel a single flight in thirty-three years and that was because the Portland airport was closed and everything was closed So that has to do with dependency and frequency which I don't understand right now Why do they want to pay so much money and if They are not going to get the benefit for what they are paying And this is the case that I present to you Mark week 1957 Street South I thank all of you for being here I have two aspects that I want to ignore I would have liked to have had six minutes No We just have three Mikes but they are two different points Well then I'm going to talk quickly the first is the three a for the classification of the property one of the things you have to understand is that the wildlife mitigation program is not open to the public. It is going to allow you access to that land so look what happened in the public. It has a road but they cannot leave that road. That is one of the rules and the other. What are the requirements to be able to finish the restoration? Do you know them? Something that we are not aware of is the responsibility. Are you aware of what brave Pitt happened, who is much lower than the mess. So if there is a problem, the river is going to change its cause and you will be responsible for the fact and not We are going to have property taxes for that and we are not going to have public access except for that one tiny parking spot. So we have to have the fund for parking and not for mitigation. The parks have money for the parks now regarding the airport 25% of discounts is being granted for gas tanks forever, not for a period of two years, it is forever. So we are going to guarantee twenty-five thousand dollars",

        "text": " they included all the provisions necessary for the Wildfire mitigation plan into their Emergency Management plan plan and it's called the Emergency Management and Wildfire mitigation plan so uh which uh you know does weave in aspects with the the fire department so and looking at Council standards which are kind of modeled off off of the Public Utility Commission there's this aspect of having it be updated that I think the council standard um you know asks well maybe you know maybe not directly but it kind of references so to be responded to that which also makes sense that's the whole idea right is that Wildfire is changing our climate's changing things are changing on the landscape we want them to go back and look at it so because this site has a low to moderate Wildfire risk you know in there we have like go back and look at Wildfire risk at the site um every five years um and then you know let us know what what changed and if you're doing anything different again paraphrasing so what's interesting about this that I haven't highlighted so much which I may go back and look at in in the proposed order is really focusing on that all of that stuff that front end evaluation is the cap that'll go out in the final order is capturing the site right now with no facility on it because what council needs to be prepared for is that in five years that five-year update is the wildfire risk is going to increase but that's because they're likely going to use those data layers and data layers look at assets and infrastructure and that automatically so that so because the Wildfire risk is going to be it's now going to go from low to moderate to you know moderate High perhaps it's not because the facility is going to be more it's because everything's going oh well there's now an asset and the risk to that asset increases the Wildfire risk so I just want to make that clear so that if you know in five years Council gets this you know like update if it's if it's increased that that is likely one of the reasons why it did so compared to the Baseline but as a record we have you know documentation in the final order of what it was before there assets on the landscape I know I know it's gone we're almost there oh my gosh you guys are doing so good but I just wanted to take some time because that is the first time you've seen it so okay all right waste minimization um gonna minimize waste um we went with a little bit different of a condition because usually it's like you know have a recycling program and recycle these and we're like What do we care about we really kind of want to know we want to know which kind of goes back to what um like Patrick was talking about you know even though it's not this is a solar facility but um we kind of want to know like tell us tell us where you're putting these you know like that would be tell us because you know those programs may change Etc that's what it's meant okay now we're into other applicable regulatory requirements okay so noise is pretty exciting for a little facility here and I think probably for because it's a smaller facility and in the area that it's located is why we're having you know why why it's more interesting here so as with noise we model maximum noise output of the maximum number of equipment that that they're that's included in their proposal so here we got like the inverters Transformers associated with the substations battery battery storage units and the maximum now because they are saying that the battery storage those 200 units could be in a distributed uh scenario or in a centralized scenario they modeled both which I'm going to pop up here um we can see here on the right uh is the centralized where the red portion is just in one area that reverberates out and on the left with the little uh red dots all over is the centralized the noise council is making a decision on deq's noise rules because DEQ does not administer or fund their noise program but it still is a Oregon rule so that's why council's Finding compliance and does so with other facilities the noise control regulations actually Parts there's a maximum allowable which is 50 DBA okay and then there's the anti-ambient degradation standard which is that any in any one hour period the DBA cannot increase um by 10 DBA and that involves measuring a Baseline that's where the you know quietness of or loudness of the in a surrounding environment matters quite a bit anyhow um that at one noise sensitive um uh they exceed both and so this is an interesting uh uh pickle to be in so what the department recommends is that basically underneath this maximum you know again very well may be that there's not 200 battery storage units or 2 25 inverters um but uh basically the department is saying you can't do in that maximum scenario the centralized it's under the centralized or I'm sorry no the dispersed battery scenario that there's that expedience underneath the centralized they meet both of them it's fine it's just underneath the dispersed um they exceed both of them so the Department's basically say you can't do um or you have to you have to demonstrate prior to construction that you got a facility design with your maximum of whatever you're building out there that does meet it um and provide that facility design and that's what these noise control conditions set and then we have noise control control condition two and three which have uh address like a noise complaint response um removal fill I touched on it under but and and it's interesting because we're like okay well there's no wetlands and I I coordinated with DSL and got him to do something that they said we don't usually do this we're gonna do this again but they gave us this off-site determination because we don't really encounter it very often for our projects because everybody does a wetland delineation and what the applicant did was this whole they did a whole evaluation that functionally is all the stuff that would have to go into a wetland delineation but just didn't go into because they're like there's nothing to delineate to delineate so um so we got this determination from DSL but then because you know we just really want to like you know short everything up and we don't want to be silent to the work that the applicant did is that we actually just went through and did an evaluation of the hydrology um of the the hydrophytic vegetation and of uh the soil assessment because the applicant provided that so as just a way to like you know um bolster the recommendation that there's just there's no Wetlands on site because this also supports the no 1200c from DEQ permit and it also just means there's no removal theft um and water rights um approximately uh 10 to 12 million gallons of water would be used during the construction period and then during operation they're representing that about 1.6 million gallons of water would be used each year mostly for solar module washing and this is the condition that we see in most site certificates but we're basically asking them to like you know confirm prior to construction what your water needs are and you need to demonstrate to us that you have a service provider because they're representing that the city of Hermiston um will provide water for the project um and so we ask them to you know demonstrate that that entity has the ability to provide that water but they don't need a water break but there you are you did it that's super short oh boy so I am the first one I just appreciate you a lot because you at least are very um the little extra ones Cruise yeah but I will I'll say this or the um some of the folks who were on the phone earlier and talking about our lengthy processes and things the amount of work that she just went through that a parent that's a developer or uh but that everybody does to make sure that all bases are covered that's what they don't see and it's a Todd's Point everything is different there's not a one-size-fits all activities I hope that somebody stuck around on the phone and and witnessed some of this but thank you uh for your simple questions comments things I appreciate um council's engagement as it's been um really cool and I'm really glad the applicants here too to to listen to that as well thank you thank you um we have I mean this was an information item for us um I know we asked a lot of questions and did a lot of comments over the last whatever period of time so does anyone have anything final we're under breath um so it's 139 how are people feeling did you go everybody says go that's the same last party so we are rocking rolling there all right so we are not taking a break because we've done that um and then the next item on our agenda is annual election of officers uh this is an action Idol and a Council secretary will be taking over I want Council know that I haven't been discussing this in the background and I felt it was more appropriate to have a public installations secretary Cornell asking if I'd be still being interested in serving an advised chair and I said I'd be honest but I just kind of feel the confidence policy exception Council um this residents just by default is warranted that I'm not want to make anybody uncomfortable here you'll understand I think it's a good in my experience uh the annual the election of officers is an opportunity for the wife's chair to move up to chair in the council to select the next wife's chair to be in line for chair around the next annual election and I think rotating the chair is an opportunity for the counselors to experience the role of chair and the reputation allows for diversity of how different the council owners would share the meetings my comments here are not about how charity Royal has run the meeting she had been similarly Dependable articulate knowledgeable and well spoken it's about just our policy on annually watching the officers you know continued reappointment or rotate the position through the county filter so I just wanted to open that up I'm buying either way if the council choosing to stay the course I'd be honored to continue its Vice chairs yes sir and just going to the rule which is reference there and I pulled the bullet points out in the slide there is nothing in terms of policy about it it just simply says annual election officers that's requiring you know so there has to be a chair and a vice chair in terms of you know whatever policy around that you know Council would like to or not like to set it's entirely",

        "text": " to share some of these related contacts as well as any Outreach best practices that people are finding amongst the different programs here within the department of uh clay if we could go to the next slide and I also just wanted to take a quick moment with our members that are on if there's any part of the presentation if you have any questions please don't feel like you have to wait till that period go ahead and enter them in the chat or uh raise your hand and Patricia will will stop for a moment um but for right now we want to go into our round two update and overview and where we are within the program and a couple of the enhancements from round one into round two is that uh we are looking we or we implemented some improvements uh that have been recommended by program stakeholders uh and prior around applicants partners and are even our external reviewers from round one and again for this round we had 12 million available in our overall program bucket and we allotted uh two million or up to two million for our planning projects and that would be one million for the renewable only planning and up to one million for our uh resilience energy or renewable only with resilience energy prod projects as well as we mentioned back in December we uh undertook a large effort to improve uh the application questions uh the instructions and developed even more guidance for applicants via resources and we also implemented a fully digital application evaluation and scoring process for our competitive review uh and then finally our Outreach to Prior applicants are we focused on Outreach to Prior applicants and enhance the support guidance for them uh before and during the open application period which we went through on the prior slide uh clay could we move on and uh we also have updated our timeline just slightly for this round uh as you know the application period closed on February 15th we went through completion and eligibility review for all of the submitted applications and that ended on March 22nd and just this last Monday we launched into our competitive and Technical review process that did start just this last Monday and will last we'll end on April 21st so it's a four week review process following that we'll be working on calculating scoring creating recommendations based on the scoring and the various bucket allotments for the projects and then submitting that to the director for the award notification determination and notification for uh grantee or selected and uh so now we're going to get into just a quick synopsis of those submitted applications the the eligible applications as well as projects that move into competitor review and for that I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to my partner here uh clay Decker all right thanks Jason okay so round two submitted applications on the deadline of February 15th we had 52 applications that had been made the deadline and were fully submitted uh 24-hour construction 28 in planning and then the breakouts are are listed as well and we also have the comparison with round one where we had 68 initial um with a even break out there just for comparison purposes and then after we did the eligibility and completeness review out of those submitted applications we ended up with 47 moving forward to the competitive split evenly 26 and 26. um we had three applicants uh withdrawal and only two of this round were found and then again you'll see the comparison with round one on the right side there and I just wanted to say I apologize I had a I had a typo on the total numbers the uh I had a time I had a typo on the screen for the for those total numbers so please just use the breakouts uh below the 26 construction 26 plan and I apologize for that there were 47 eligible going in so my all right and here's some more detail on the applications um so the 21 construction projects there's the list of the opportunity announcement they're under and the types of organizations that have submitted or that are in the competitive review for just leave that up for a second and then looking at the planning there and we have the nine renewable only in the 70 enter 17 energy and the distribution or the dis yeah the distribution of the um of the applicants are listed there as far as Technologies we don't have a slide on that but we do have uh like round one it's primarily solar with a few mix in of some biogas and some um Hydro mixed in as well and just a reminder from the um the competitive review scoring criteria that is in each opportunity announcement I'm just going to run through those right here just to remind you about what was created through your assistance on the advisory committee and putting together the scoring criteria that is in each opportunity announcement and exactly what the evaluators are using now to evaluate and score the projects against each other we start out with the biggest bucket of project strength 45 out of the 100 points covering the areas of the strength of the project team strength of the plan the overall project description and its technical details and the strength of the financial plan um and the documentation that describes it and along with the actual for those you know as opposed to the planning ones then we get into the program priorities or the equity criteria um and there are because we have the two opportunity announcements with energy resilience to get to the 100 points even across all four we had to break that up a little bit um and so that's why you'll see the different point totals there because we had to work into 10 points for any Jew resilience for those two programs but we're covering the location in the community and the support to environmental justice communities um and so those the community members served by the projects project leadership particularly Community leadership and environmental justice leaders that might be involved in the project the Partnerships that they created as part of their application and just project creation and then any Equity framework that their um that they're using or they apply specifically to their projects and we also have a pretty good group here under the project benefits also um consider project priorities or additional scoring criteria that the legislative specifically put in the um into the law so that we would prioritize these listed criteria When selecting applications and you guys made a wise decision it worked out really great in round one on adding these NS scoring criteria rather than just some other method of Odo picking priority items or picking projects that had priority items but to build it into the scoring makes it much more transparent and even across the board and that's you know prior energy Investments or efficiency Investments at the facility or project site points for any priority hiring dbe programs that are built into the inclusive hiring has some point if they have policies or a specific exclu inclusive hiring standards for their projects we also have the energy resilience aspects for the two opportunity announcements that include um and that's you know using the energy resilience definitions under the law and then we have FEMA approved natural Hazard mitigation programs and if the project directly supports those programs energy cost savings to families and to small businesses specifically we ask we ask for evidence of that direct cost savings for those two two groups the same for economic development beyond the project itself beyond the jobs created but an overall looking for evidence of the applicants overall focus on economic development to the larger community and then of course the requirement is to list and list the jobs that will be connected with the project both during you know installation construction and planning but also long-term operational jobs to be listed and then compared against the size and scope of the so that's that scoring element um and then the final five points are for project diversity to try and give a little leg up to projects all across the state of various sizes and various Technologies and so the evaluators get to assess that and give some points for that project diversity over those four don't take it back to Jason here and he's going to give you a little bit more about the evaluation committee that is using that scoring criteria that we just went over well thank you clay um and just as a a quick reminder um back into round one uh with each of our competitive review processes we have an external evaluation committee uh these are interested applicants that you have helped to engage and to come and apply as well as people that we have engaged throughout Odo or some of our rare members and Outreach Specialists here within the agency and that process is they come in fill out a statement of Interest application where they come in and submit some their level of Interest some background information helps us sort of organize who fits into the different review categories if they're eligible and then of course their time availability and in this in this second round we had 26 applicants come in as proposed external reviewers before we moved into our kickoff meeting we did select 16 evaluator years and then met with them on March 8th and determined that we were going to have four external evaluators per review group and we had and we have six internal evaluators from Odo and three of those internal would be assigned to each of the groups and the way that our groups are laid out for this particular round is each of these groups of reviewers are put into a team to Simply review the projects within one opportunity announcement so we have four opportunity announcements four groups and between seven and in two groups we actually have six reviewers we had uh we actually have two we had one additional person have to drop out this um and then the other part as we mentioned earlier to uh uh to try to make the process more efficient we worked really we worked in Canada with our I.T Department to create a uh to create a review portal both in the full application view as well as we broke it down into all the questions that relate back to those scoring criteria that clay just went through broken out into tabs individually to help those reviewers move quicker through these projects and then we put our scoring process fully online so that that information is easy for us to just go and grab once the review period is over and start to move into our on Clay if we could move into the next slide please and then additionally we wanted to give the committee an update on the on ground ones uh performance agreements uh clay if you could move into the next slide this is just a quick uh map and reminder for the committee members here that uh of the distribution of the projects between the planning and construction projects that were selected to receive a grant in the first round so I'll leave that up just for just for a moment to let",

just Economic Development economic DS the US Chamber of Commerce us Chamber of Commerce has sued in essence because they thought carbon was okay carbon's good for the environment they sued in using that argument so the US chamber of commment a lot of little Chambers don't belong to the US Chamber of Commerce but Hillsboro does and so you got to be careful when you talk about people this the recommend chamber of commer now in this document it says the myth of smart growth because I noticed down here somebody said smart growth take a look at what this document says if you get to it in links about smart growth uh more expensive is more expensive how spraw infrastructure bankrupts organ communities so please look at those eight documents there when you get them it can open the link one of the things they presented is Data Centers Mike Ray's done excellent work on data centers he got an award for it data centers provide no jobs very few people and create take a lot amount of land same thing warehouses and they're so they're saying oh we'll have data centers you don't want data centers data centers energy and money and I'm done thank you very much all right thank you thank you Dale um we have next Alan kran I apologize if I'm mispronouncing anything here Karen schmidlin and then Luis Herrera and Corey Wright coming up next good evening my name is Alan Katherine and I live on West Union Road and I'm one of the uh my address is on your list there and I'm uh one of the parcels in consideration for being brought into the ugb um just a little bit about our property my my folks bought the property and 1949 so about 74 years ago and uh then they raised their family of five children there uh which I am the youngest and I am 66 my oldest sister is 78 years of age all suffering from various medical issues and things my dad died in ' 92 and then um my mom had lived there uh they had the fire department do a learn to burn on their old house that he had built alone and uh had a Manu ufactured home so after my dad had passed my mom wanted to still live there so uh since there was a manufactured home we applied through the county and got a temporary health hardship permit and we built the home next to her the way the the laws are set up not any other homes could be built on the property it's zoned exclusive Farm um the we've had another local area farmer Farm about 25 acres is what would be part of the farm area that everybody's been talking about um it may be good soil but most Farmers rotate their crops uh do Clover one year a couple years and grass seed and and then maybe wheat in this area our land is is wet enough that it only can grow grass seed you know enough and everything growing on there would never be enough to support a family we tried to sell the property before my folks didn't have much money at all but they had that land for us kids and um we're getting older and we tried to sell it and nobody would take it um now the city of North Plains is on two sides of us but up right here and then right across the street um they have utilities infrastructure water sewer right next to our property so from a business standpoint that makes sense to me um I just want to say a little thing about the the cities they've been in contact with us from years ago now talking about that getting input wanting to know and we've been a part of that so I can I understand everybody's argument whether you're talking climate change animals or losing Farmland but we can't stop growth altoe I'm I'm for adopting the ugb thank you thank you for testimony um Karen is this on I'm Karen schmidlin um I live on sellers Road um outside of banks um and although I'm I'm I'm in Banks uh one of the things that I was concerned about and oh and I just wanted to say thank you all for being here and thank you for having this meeting in the evening when people can show up because it's hard for people that are working to show up during the day for things and and I appreciate the thoughtful questions that a lot of you asked on this too I think they're there were some very good questions and I appreciate that and I appreciate your time um and so anyways um you know one of my big issues is um the water um because I live in Banks or I live outside of banks but even though I live outside of banks I you guys are probably aware of some of the water issues that we have in Banks you know we kind of have had some issues with that and we've been trying to figure out you know how we're going to how Banks is going to grow and how we're going to have enough water for everybody and with North Plains just being down the road from us um you know my concern is how that's going to affect the the water needs of North Plains how is that going to affect um our water table and Banks if a lot of water is being taken from the water table um how's that going to affect our water in Banks because that's a big issue for us but and aside from that also you know the whole affordable housing thing you know there it just doesn't seem to be um addressed very well and I know I know that there's been a lot of people that have spent a lot of time on this and I appreciate the North Plains folks um and all the time that they have spent on this um but um affordable housing I mean I have kids and it's it's hard to afford a house you know when you're a young person and even though you know they're making a decent wage um but we have to look out for those people you know and I think it needs to be addressed um and and then the um the Farmland um I know people disagree about this but you know the bottom line of it is is is we do have some of the richest Farmland of anywhere in the world here in our in our Valley and in that area around North Plains and once that land is not Farmland anymore it's just just not you don't get it back and you know there may be the argument of oh well they're not growing food there well they're growing something there so whatever doesn't get grown there is going to have to get grown somewhere else and somewhere else and somewhere else and so pretty soon there just isn't anywhere else so we do have to have those concerns about um that rich farmland and how productive it actually is um and that's all I have thank you thank you thank you Karen next we have Luis Herrera and Corey Wright following we will call Debbie vanan and I believe Don Malton goe um good evening chair Lockwood and the rest of the commission my name is Corey Wright and I live at 31950 Northwest Meadow Drive in North plains I have been a homeowner in North plains for the last 15 years my view used to be to the North Plains post office just Fields um since then in those 15 years I now have a view of 24 town homes and I could they can literally touch their neighbor through their kitchen windows that's how close they are not only that but now that we have the new Housing Development that just went in by the new alala Ridge those homes went for 650,000 the new houses coming in are not affordable both my husband and I work for Intel make good salaries we would not be able to afford a home in North plains currently with our salaries so um I don't really have much more to say other than the development that has been happening has not been for North Plains unfortunately thank you thank you hello my name is Lis Herrera um I've been living in North plains for what like 12 years now maybe something like that and um one of the things that was most attractive uh to me my wife and my family was that um North Plains was a small community it reminded me a lot of the community that I grew up in in California um when I grew up there in California we didn't have sidewalks much like North Plains uh Old North Plains not the new developments um we don't have sidewalks in North plains all of this new development that's been happening all of the new construction it's really beautiful um those people in those new developments have nice beautiful Parks we had a park right close to our house I live in a manufactured home because I can't afford a regular home like everyone else I work for the county uh but I can't afford to live in North plains necessarily if it wasn't for that manufactured home that I purchased um so all these uh new developments have nice beautiful Parks we have uh the purple Park which is like a triangle shaped little area um near a creek um it uh it constantly floods we had a brand new playground that was uh painted purple I wonder if that's why they called it purple Park um residents complained I imagine that um that it's always flooded even during the summer and um so they came through with a bulldozer and bulldozed that down now it's just grass while all these other developments have these little fountains that they get to enjoy because they have money and Teslas and everything else and I fear that everything that is beautiful about North Plains like breathing in the the air when you're driving through the farmlands in the morning all of that's going to disappear um I know that they say that there's no plans for specific warehouses and things like that but you all know what's happened with the construction um all around Washington County as soon as that land is made available those things are going to happen and somewhere along the line our voices are going to be lost in the process and there will be a 500 acre Warehouse or or data center or whatever else they're going to build there and what are we going to going to lose what are we going to replace that uh we're going to replace Farmland that is unique with data centers and warehouses and commercial land um you know I'm not against growth I understand that growth has to happen but the growth that is happening isn't happening for our community it's happening for the sake of growth so that we can have more tax revenue so",

        "text": " You know, Marion county is a safe, well planned community with a thriving economy that supports a high quality of life for family matters. And, you know, well planned really does stick out to me to provide that sort of environment where we are able to enjoy life. So I'm in favor of this. But again, I certainly want to give the board opportunity to voice your concerns before we take the vote. Commissioner Zalick. So, like Commissioner Bryant had an opportunity to go around the block once or twice. The reality is, when we first tested the sales tax, first couple times we put it on there and we didn't know honestly what was going to happen, but we knew that, you know, in order to equip our fire, sheriff, like everyone has said, to have a chance at repairing some of the road deficit that we had, we were going to have to do something different. And the truth is, we all know that property tax tax is the most liberal form of taxation ever. Right? You work all your life, you create wealth in your home, in your homestead, and the real estate that God has blessed you with in a great community, and then we tax the hell out of it, unfortunately, to have general services, which are completely unfair. So based on how well you did in life, is how you get taxed. That's fundamentally against the principles that I have myself. Right. I think that people should pay all for the same services. We don't send three sheriff's cars and two fire trucks to the rich person's house and then to someone that's paying less in tax, send less resources. Right? We send it all. And we do that because we want to try to save people's property, and we want to try to save their lives. When we're talking about public safety and the infrastructure to get them there in the fastest and most efficient way, is the infrastructure piece of this? All of those things are imperative to life, health, and safety, in my opinion. So the sales taxes, for me has always been that no brainer. And when I've talked to people in the community, I have always said that, listen, this is the first time that people using our resources as visitors that come in and use our roads, but more importantly, I think use our public safety. If something happens, and God forbid they get into a car accident or something else, on an expressway or something else, chief Banta and his team and our sheriff and their team are on their way. It has allowed us to bring some heavy equipment in, airbags, different things to roll over tractor trailers and keep them up in the air and get people out of vehicles that I never knew we could do before, you know, until we saw those things and implemented those resources. And the only reason we ever could put a heavy rescue and tech rescue apparatus that we have today to save those lives on the expressway is because of the sales tax. So do I have. Listen, man, I'm like you. If I was just my personal preference, I would not do 20 years. I would do twelve. I would do something that gives us enough time to plan the roads and stuff, but also, you know, has a, what I feel is the right time. But at the end of the day, I think we've done a great job explaining to the public why this matters so much. The reality is, is public safety and roads aren't going nowhere. This is absolutely the best way to fund it, you know, and I think the public can continue to hold us accountable. So I'm like you, I'm going to vote with the board because having an ununified board is probably the worst thing, in my opinion. But 20 years does have its benefits. So that's why I'm conflicted at some level, because 35th street has been on the books since before I was on the board. So 15, almost 20 years, it's been on the books because we can never get enough money to fix our priorities and fund it. 92nd street before that on the table for almost 20. Yeah. So if we want to move, we know we have, as Mister Tillman stated, we have people coming. With all due respect, me and Mister Tillman differ on level of service. And if I want my level of service, then we're going to need more money for that infrastructure to move people, because I don't think people want to tolerate the level of traffic we have today. I don't think that congestion is going to get much bigger before people start tearing down our doors, to be honest with you. And if we want to keep the level of congestion down, we're going to have to put more money towards that infrastructure, you know, and so if we can have it for 20 years, if, God forbid, we had to do projects and we hit those moments in time where our economy fluctuates and we have, you know, I hope that we get to the other point where our dollars start having more value again and we can spend more money and produce more results for the citizens of Marion county. And in those instances, like during the recession when we had the sales tax and we could put people to work during those times in our community and do extra road projects, it made a huge difference to our economy and we got more bang for the buck. So I'm certainly going to support it. I couldn't be more excited about the sales tax. I don't love the term, but I'm not going to fight about it for sure. That's not to mention the opportunity that we will have if we so choose. And it's another conversation that we can have about bonding some projects and going ahead and moving them forward. And I know that, commissioner, when we talked about it one time, you made the mention of paying the interest on it, but I can tell you right now, the interest on those bonds will probably be far less than what those projects will cost us in another ten years. So I think that's another conversation that we can have. It doesn't have to happen today, but this sales tax creates opportunity in so many different ways. And it has been part of what has helped us become what we are today compared to where we were in 2013, 2014. It's just been another cog in the wheel that has allowed us to have the unemployment rate that we have to be able to catch up with the public safety needs that we needed, the transportation infrastructure needs that we needed. It has been so very, very important for all of those things. And if I may say one more thing, my purpose in continuing to fund this, and especially at a long term, is that our departments, I mean, I've heard this from multiple of our departments and our administrator, that commissioner, hey, listen, we got the sales tax right now, but we can't really plan on not having it three, four, five years. So just the simple life term of the piece of equipment that we're buying, if it has ten years worth of life, when they have to replace that, they can't guarantee that they're going to have a sales tax in place to replace that capital. So by that very essence of that, I think what we can do is for the citizens, God willing, as we, if we can pass a long term sales tax, we should be able to reduce our overhead cost. We can plan better for capital improvements. And my purpose is to drive down property taxes. I continue to hope that that's part of what this commissioner wants to do, is I don't want to see our property tax rates continue to go up. We heard the stories from those folks that were affected this last year. More of those dollars should be presented in sales tax to the best of our ability, and we should continue to help drive down property taxes because our economy is cyclical. We will go back into another hard time at some point, I don't know when, but at some point we will have another hard time. And if we're prepared for that, it will make a huge difference to the resilience of our community in the future. Thank you, Commissioner Salad. Thank you, madam chair. Sure. Commissioner Curry? Yeah. I just wanted to remind everybody what has already happened from the state legislature. Our home rule is under attack every year. Every year that they go into session, we either almost or we lose something. Regarding the sales tax, I don't remember exactly the years, but since I've been on the commission, which is three, there's been two attempts by the legislature. Number one, it used to be that you could put a sales tax on a primary election that went away. Now you can only do it in a general election. So that's happened. The second thing that they tried to do is to require a super majority vote. Right now it's a majority vote. And back when that attempt was made, if that had passed, there were, as I recall, eleven sales taxes that were up for election, and that passed. And if the supermajority had been in place, only three of them would have passed. But the point is, what Commissioner Bryant so aptly mentioned is that it is going to change. I don't think it's, if it's going to change, it's just a matter of when because they just continue to chew into it. So the 20 years would give the certainty for the community that we have that revenue stream coming in to build roads and do the infrastructure needs. So just wanted to get that on the record. Thank you, Commissioner Curry. I'll bring it back to the board. For action or further discussion? I have a motion for approval. Second. I've got a motion by Commissioner Bryant. Second by Commissioner Curry. Any further discussion? If not, I'll call the vote. All in",

        "text": " a cohort of Three Counties you would $150,000 total each County in the cohort $50,000 this isn't if you create a cohort it's $50,000 it's that each County that is created that's in the cohort each receives $50,000 so um but the question is is Odo cohorts um we're not coordinating formally in that we're directing counties how to uh do that coordination themselves outside of uh our formal Grant processes right so if you would like to work in a cohort um that's excellent as I mentioned you'll submit there is a specific application for counties that want to work together in cohorts as Sarah mentioned um you know each County can request their full Award $50,000 and then that will be distributed directly to the lead County that cohorts identify um and that is the way that we're trying to reduce administrative burden um and I I assume or I should say I think that would be a way that we are approaching coordination just in terms of your interfacing with us we want to make it easier on you so having only one County that is then doing program processes and paperwork is lifting a bit of a burden for the other counties but in terms of the back end of what that looks like for you Odo um you know we defer to y'all's expertise and collaboration approaches for that um and then the next question is are your technical providers already part of a Cooperative contract that we can buy off um no these would be you know individual contracts that you would be making with these technical assistance providers so what we did was just reach out and make sure that you know adding them to the list was something that they were interested in that they would potentially be available that these plans are within their areas of expertise but we have not contracted with them nor are we formally endorsing their services I should say if you know of contractors that do this work that are not on the list I can also add them and would love to provide more resources folks perfect um two more questions and then we'll get to Justin with his hand raised thanks for being patient um for Moma County where 90% of the state's liquid fuels are stored on highly unstable soils how will Odo coordinate with mandated reporting under HB 1567 and I think we're going to hand that one over to Max yeah John I assume you're talking about the DEQ seismic tank reporting requ Ms um no I'm talking about the I'm sorry I'm talking about the the the law mandated that Odo also produce a report about oh the I mean our energy security plan that's what I'm that's what I'm referring to yes yes yes uh so I'm working on that that's my project as well uh you came to the right spot um we are working on that right um it's a little you can see how in Mol county perhaps as much as any place it's a little because you store we store I live in M County um the state's resources for fuel the sort of the risk and the burden that's put on those communities uh and the importance um of that facility of the of the fuel terminals that kind of changes a little bit and so there's a lot of programs that come at that fuel terminal right the energy security plan the DEQ seismic risk program this County reporting requirement so we're working on the energy security plan for the state right now it includes a lot of work and Analysis on um the fuel terminals itself this grant program is different and uh John if you choose to proceed at the county chooses to proceed uh in accepting the fund and doing the work uh I think we should talk about how to kind of incorporate information that's already existing into the county plans I think that goes for anybody too so recognizing that there's a lot of existing work either by our agency or by utilities or other organizations around energy planning um you don't have to recreate uh and for the most circumstances lot of existing information G information that's available so the the the concept would be that uh counties and we can help facilitate this but County governments coordinating with um electric companies gas companies fuel companies to find existing information that might be in many different locations and you can pull it together uh into into one County plan that would be something we can s of help coordinate and a good idea yeah and to to just not off of that that plan resources document has links to our Oregon energy security plan our Oregon fuel action plan and if there is you know mapping resources but if if you have a question and you're wondering if we know of an existing resource you know please that's where I come into to play please reach out to me and I will um you know try to do my best to figure that out um and then those example plans of other communities that have done similar types of planning are again a great resource to build off and a couple are in in in Oregon which is really excellent perfect and then the last question and then um uh Justin feel free to come off a mute and to ask your question um Grant County Emergency Management asked um are the utilities the energy only utilities or Communications as well and um Tiffany had a um Tiffany from Lane County I believe uh had a comment in here that says energy as it relates to maintaining comm's infrastructure but um would love um a Odo perspective as well on that yeah I think this the the statute itself so it's a good question um Energy Systems aren't independent of and by themselves right that as Tiffany's point we energy provides function for systems the statute speaks to energy it doesn't speak to comms necessarily uh um but if I was in your position I would consider Communications as part of that um so that I I would say yes if you have the ability to incorporate um analysis of communication systems into your plan that would be useful particularly when you're looking at uh resilience centers and um locations that need to have um all these on energy Supply whether it's from electricity or fuel you know thinking about maybe critical I don't know even cell phone Towers or comms hubs where uh internet data goes through they have to have power all the time and so thinking about how that uh how this plan can help sort of provide information and insight to making sure those facilities are always powered that that would be useful I would think yeah yeah and to just jump in off of that those for those Community resilience centers the the plan should consider communication zones and ways to um keep that of communication in in your community and in terms of communication utilities being required or directed in statute to collaborate I feel like it is particular to energy but hopefully there is partnership and willingness on their end um yeah perfect um Justin do you w to come off of mute yes remember your question still thanks yeah thank you uh first I'd like to thank you for extending in this opportunity um it very much aligns with the the work uh that we already have planned um so um I I appreciate the way it's structured as far as it being incorporated into our Hazard mitigation plan uh we actually are applying for uh FEMA brick funding to update our natural Hazard mitigation plan um that is due in March of 26 and we're going to be working with the University of Oregon to uh incorporate our community Wildfire protection plan as part of that as well um but I see this as kind of a natural marriage uh and expanding it to become multi-jurisdictional uh resilience and and Hazard resilience and mitigation plan um I don't know which is you know part of the other but they are definitely related um so I I just wanted to make sure you know with that um that uh it would be amendable for us to expand our scope of work for that project to include um this energy resilience component uh what I'm thinking of is uh having uh incorporating Community like lifelines into our uh mitigation plan and then identifying resilience goals and mitigation goals for the various hazards uh so that would be an intersection for you know the energy piece under a community Lifeline um but I just wanted to make sure that that would be allowable you know with with these funds to expand the scope of work of of a project that's being funded the government so okay um Justin thank you so much I I really appreciate your your comments and that context that's very helpful um is your question like if it's acceptable to explain expand the energy resilience plan or your other plan uh to well I mean it it's already laid out in the house bill that this has to become part of our mitigation plan so uh I I'm just wondering uh which we wouldn't be planning on using it as matching funds you know for the the federal dollars but I guess that would be one question is can it be used as matching funds and then um is it okay for us to potentially just even if we're not using it as matching funds just to expand the scope of work to include this body of work as part of our up update to the Natural Hazard mitigation plan Justin I think that would be probably a really good question for OEM who you're working with on the brick Grant I will say that these funds are State funds they're fund that they're funds from the state legislature which has traditionally been able to layer on top of federal funding um to expand projects but I think that the question that you're asking around the eligibility of um how to expand your brick Grant and the work that you you've um you've committed to OEM and FEMA through that Grant would would be better suited to go through OEM great I've already called them before this uh perfect yeah they would be they're they're a good partner for answering those types of questions um but this is State funding and we'd be happy to um you know Hannah um would be happy to communicate with OEM to make sure that um they understand this grant um in a in a you know in a different way um you don't have to do that explaining that's great because I know that you know the state is prioritizing natural Hazard M or Hazard mitigation plans for the use of brick funds so yeah uh that would be wonderful thank you yeah and just as a a note um in addition the University of Oregon is also a great resource um for some of that work and they are also on our list of technical assistance providers which you can find on our website so um just as a note um for that resource for everyone else Hannah Max do you have anything else to add to that um yeah I would love Max's opinion on using these funds as as match um",

        "text": " deep in the ocean and kind of is basically a tower affixed to the seabed um and so that's more mature technology um gets mass produced and has an impact on the cost of this and then they also have state offshore wind targets on the east coast which are helping to drive deployments and so when you factor all those in yeah they have some offshore wind development but even the bottom fixed every arena they only have a few projects that are developed but there's a lot more being planned for then on the west coast some of the differences are southern oregon northern california have some of the strongest winds you can see that in the dark red there we also have that tremendous hydropower resource that i mentioned that a lot of people are aware aware of for the northwest region and we have coastal loads that are not even really showing up on the map here and our water is really deep so that requires this floating technology that's pretty much the subject of this study and then we also don't have any state offshore wind targets yet up and down the coast um california is working towards those um but none yet and so we haven't seen any offshored will offshore wind development yet on the west coast and those are kind of the driving forces and the transmission is an issue i'll talk about that in a second and the floating platforms are also kind of a new emerging technology so here's the global wind markets in context um i made a reference to land-based wind in the bottom fixed offshore wind being a little sim you know relatively similar in how they're anchored the land-based technology is of course the most mature we saw the big deployments in the earlier slide about 10 000 megawatts in the pacific northwest across the globe um there's 707 gigawatts of of land-based wind currently built and then there's 35 gigawatts of bottom fixed offshore wind so so that you know technology is kind of still ramping up further along than floating offshore wind but not quite as far along as land-based and the floating offshore wind is kind of a little blip on the map so to speak um with less than 0.1 gigawatts so there's just a handful of uh projects out there right now and the largest project is 50 megawatts so relatively small in the grand scheme of energy projects and the bottom line here is it's a nice nascent industry it's emerging and there's a lot of ambition with several projects in the global pipeline and we can look to the next slide to kind of think about where their ambition is stemming from here um so the bottom fixed is you know this is just offshore right so we had all three on the last slide so these are just the two offshore technologies the bottom fixed offshore wind as i mentioned is the more dominant offshore technology why is that um it's because it's more mature and it has that lower cost fixed anchoring very similar to land-based wind it's um being developed in shallower waters near shore um so in the shallower waters it's a shorter reach you're not going out as far into the oceans and the water depths aren't as deep so it's relatively less complex to install and then you know you can clearly imagine that if you're looking for shallow waters less than 60 meters those only exist to to whatever extent they they are out there right there's limited sighting with floating um you know the new and high cost floating anchoring is something that's um there's being a lot of work done on and they're trying to lower the cost of that but that's really the key to deploying this technology and then right now that technology is still developing so it's a little bit more expensive and then the reaches into deeper waters the floating structures are needed for you know depths that are greater than 60 meters and those can be pretty far from shore but far from shore can have really strong winds in the deeper and longer reach can also be more complex to install so there's some trade-offs going on here and some but they also have expansive siding out there you can imagine that there's a lot more waters out there that are greater than 60 meters than waters that are less than 60 meters so it's a challenge um but it could have a lot of potential benefits if we can lower the costs so how does floating offshore wind work the sled kind of ties it all together and what would happen initially is wind turbines would literally be kind of tied together with gathering lines out in the ocean and then there would be a floating substation and then this is an export cable essentially that exports the power to the mainland grid and then there would be a tie-in point with the onshore transmission infrastructure and that could require some significant upgrades um just depending on how much floating offshore wind is potentially developed so the bottom line here is there's an transmission component and an onshore transmission component in addition to the floating platforms and the turbines themselves being placed out in the ocean okay so i said a lot about transmission and here here's kind of some slides to really visualize that um this slide here shows the lines that are greater than 345 kilovolts um those are you know basically the largest lines we have 500 kilovolt lines um are pretty common those are in fact most of what we see here these these kind of lines that look like roads those are those are the large-scale transmission lines and i just popped up um where the offshore wind is at and the relative strengths going from kind of the top of the of the state down south they increase the further you go south and you can see pretty clearly that there aren't any 345 kilowatt lines um spanning the coast range from from the ocean into the main grid here up and down the i-5 corridor and these large transmission lines were built um basically to bring power um to the large load centers up and down the i5 corridor so you have large transmission lines coming in from these large hydro projects out in southeast washington and along the columbia gorge here there's other you know technologies also on the grid out in the gorge is where the boardman coal facility was built that was a large there was also a nuclear plant out around the tri-cities area and that's that's a large-scale generating facility as well so the bottom line here is that you know developing these large generation projects drove the construction of those large transmission lines and the coast doesn't have any large transmission lines right now to support the construction of very large amounts of floating offshore wind there is some transmission line though look at that here so here you can see the coastal lines um they do exist um they're less than three hundred fifty three four less than three hundred and forty five kilovolts uh primarily two hundred and thirty kilowatts and 115 kilovolts and there's essentially five pathways um in oregon and it looks like there there's another pathway that kind of comes down into california there but there's essentially five pathways for um for oregon and you know the big takeaway here is that as economies of scale might drive up um floating offshore wind projects that there's kind of an upper round or a limitation currently without upgrades to existing transmission infrastructure here and uh a little bit about setting and permitting too um so floating offshore wind would fall under federal jurisdiction with the bureau of ocean energy management or boem controlling the leasing of offshore areas and they control an area out to 200 nautical miles from the coastline and then there's a break line in jurisdiction where development activities within three nautical miles from the coastline fall under state however this break line doesn't mean oregon wouldn't still have input into the federal permitting process under oregon's coastal management program the oregon department of land conservation and development or dlcd they also perform a consistency review against the state's territorial sea plan for projects located within the 500 fathom death contour contour so you can imagine a depth contour line and that includes areas where flooding officer when offshore wind would likely be developed and then on the state side there's an array of agencies at many levels of government from local cities to counties up to state agencies that would likely be involved in permitting various activities relating to floating offshore for example jart is the state's joint agency review team and that consists of a host of agencies um such as department of environmental quality odfw dogami parks and rec um so the bottom line here is that floating offshore projects floating offshore and projects are big and the siding and permitting could be it could be quite complex for these large taking a little closer look at the bomb activity along the west coast i thought these two slides would be helpful california currently has three call areas identified and they're a little bit further along and in assessing the viability of developing floating offshore wind as a state you can see the call areas there's one up north close to oregon's border around eureka and then there's also a study area not shown here um that's that was looking at del norte county um so it's not currently a call area but there's some other areas of interest on this map that aren't aren't currently one of those three um call and then the other two call areas are maybe in the central south south area of california south san francisco you can see those around morro bay in diablo canyon and then turning to oregon um you know this this slide here kind of shows the heat map so to speak of the wind speeds the strongest are down here in southern oregon we saw these on the last slide the last slide had some green in it and that was from a study from a few years ago the green the green colors were wind speeds less than seven meters per spec seven meters per second and then there was updated um data that that just came out in october 2021 that reassessed wind speeds with different meteorological years and it came out with with a little higher averages so this wit this map right here reflects the most current and so the bottom line here is that bone's been involved with oregon for a few years now dlcd is leading that effort so they're in the early engagement stages and looking to identify call areas very soon potentially next month yeah i'm gonna take one pause to check into questions and um so i am just gonna pause us here um that was such a great wealth of information that jason provided about the energy landscape and floating offshore wind there's been a ton",

present councilor barne present mayor today present councilor ceton we have any elimination to the agenda or addition to the agenda we have a person who has a comment eh public eh And please turn on your camera you have 3 minutes to introduce yourself and eh with your address and it is a public hearing please your address and your District I cannot turn on my camera I hope it will turn on soon but eh Me I'm sorry Good evening Thank you for inviting me I know you have a very busy night I'm going to be brief and I'm at 01 Northeast Gayon Street in Portland We are a real estate development company We were asked for an exception program with a low authorized amount the the capital grant programs and I know that they are going to consider this Tonight I would briefly like to point out the proposed the proposed project the uh proposed project and this situation that location is a parking lot that is 277 on High Street in downtown Salem before being a parking lot was the Hall of uh or uh And we want to talk about the history of developing this uh area we met with the consultants several months experts in come out to make sure that we bring to the market what the market requires and meet the needs of housing in downtown Salem we want to replace this parking lot with uh six buildings these buildings include 98 residential units we also include seven commercial units There is street access we are going to have they will be able to exit through High Street and shema and it is not a requirement But there is an exception request So the plan is to establish 16 of the housing units that are affordable and we have uh 80% for a family income rate the design of these buildings has different types uh And they have 4 a study of 450 square feet to or also another 950 has great coverage in large and small unit types Lu we did with intention to bring different demographics and cultivate diversity within the housing community and in these buildings and the properties around them this building has great amenities it has a lounge for residents they will be able to have meetings in a patio we will have a storage system an exercise center a place to bathe the pets a disposal station there are different modes of transportation bicycle storage also also stations for washing cars and we also have a charging station for uh electric vehicles is what we think this project is going to be a great benefit to downtown Salem thank you for your consideration we are excited about the opportunity and we will be happy to answer any questions you have Thank you very much Mr. Lorck the Crero Nordik eh thank you for being with us tonight I don't hear very well and I hope you can talk a little more I believe that you said in the materials they indicate 16 units are going to be affordable and you also 80% of Ami I mean not individuals but well the way we have done it traditionally depends on the type of unit so I'm not sure I can technically answer the question but eh For example eight studios eh And for example we have eh 172 that would be the cost of a studio is a great question but I don't know if I have the technical answer This is how I understand it with my level of understanding at this time Yes you know at that time as early as early in the process if the units are affordable do you think that All 16 are going to be studios or it is still to be determined, we do not assign that according to the with a mix of units that project is intended to have about 20% studios 55 for a single bedroom 25% for two bedrooms to use those percentages depending on the units eh To see these types of units eh that are affordable and done in a pro rata manner counselor stapleton Thank you very much thank you counselor nor eh It's good that I answered the questions you had I also have a question about the situation of live and work as I understand it not having seen the plans is that there are going to be some type of shops in front of the space and people are going to live in the back I am correct about that yes 100% correct and I don't know if we have This in downtown Salem is going to be very interesting because this is a portion it is very exciting I just want to invite you to include at least one of these as well as to make it affordable when you are looking at the different units that are going to be considered to be affordable because I think it is going to be a very important part to include that it is an affordable commercial premises and I have no more questions and I am very excited about that project I don't know if there are any other additional questions for the people who are going to build if Is it allowed eh councilor stapleton do we have any addition or deletion to the agenda no and you already asked me Sorry I went back on the agenda an apology eh we are going to try to make an approval eh the motion is presented the motion is approved tonight we have the 3. a which is the previous draft of the minutes and the 3.3a uh we have this uh program for the development of llc and with that ends our consent calendar there is some discussion then vote nordik in favor Ronnie in favor stapleton a Council member in favor nishioka in favor Philips in favor wen in favor Gonz\u00e1lez in favor Ho in favor and Ho the motion is approved we are very excited that project is going to be a great addition to the center and meets many of our objectives we do not have public hearings What we do have is an information report. I don't know if anyone has any questions in 6a 6a. eh, sir. eh. I would like to talk about it. If I can answer the question, if you allow me. Well, when it comes to rent. affordable typically is based on the size of the home if the rents are based on uh if it is a house for one person then uh it has a certain cost And if there are two or three the rent depends on how many people live in that nishioka hutch house I have a question and it's about flexibility. If people can afford to live in them, could you tell me how long those affordable units are going to be in in this situation because this is not a requirement for the exception? of the grant there is no time associated with the requirement however I think it is a reasonable expectation that the developer is going to have an application for the new tax exemption program and for 10 years and if you see for example these periods of affordability eh yes They are prorated to the times So it is likely that if they can see that tax exception It is a period of 10 years and maybe a little more Thank you very much I don't know if there are additional questions Okay thank you very much eh we are going to have the Council meeting November 27, 2023 we can call the roll councilor steton here councilor n present councilor Philips present councilor wen present councilor Gonz\u00e1lez present councilor today present councilor nordik present councilor barne present Ho present do we have any additions or deletions from the agenda Yes we are going to see the revisions of the agenda as an addition who seconds the motion and the motion is approved this simply in 6b we had a change a correction from District 6 to District 2 some other discussion about it then we can call the roll councilor present councilor Philips in favor councilor in favor councilor Gonz\u00e1lez a please councilor today in favor councilor nordik in favor councilor barne in favor councilor stapleton in favor of mayor today the motion is approved very well and now is the time to make the comments I would like to start with having that I had the opportunity to have dinner with him transportation council and with several of the transportation leaders of the region on the coast We had a great dinner a great opportunity to be able to talk with people and develop uh And our relationships was a couple of days ago I think a week I just want to remind you everyone this Friday we have uh At 6 pm there's going to be a great uh moment I'm not sure if the weather is going to be as good as we had last year but we're going to have this parade uh soon any comments on it parade about something more councilor Nordik Yes thank you very much I am not going to allow the weather to rain and not allow the people to be in charge and we are going to make sure that our parade is wonderful I hope that the association and all the others and volunteers and we had more than 77,000 people and uh and I'm also going to walk in this parade if it rains and snows and there's sun and also everyone who's watching in the house look briefly but we're going to see our urea meeting we've approved money for the creating a downtown parking lot that is uh sub utilizing the real estate we want to make it vibrant and accessible in our downtown and a wonderful place to live and work and This is another step in that direction and this council should say Yes I and we all we are patting ourselves on the back for everything we have decided lately we can really see the difference the riven hood apartments are going to have a tos apartment the HM hotel added 60 more jobs downtown and there is much more on the way also take a look at ura meeting tonight we are making great progress to turn uh piece of misused property into a wonderful place to make downtown brilliant br I am very excited and just wanted to tell you all this good news we hope to see more of the same thank you advise Thank you mayor, yes it has been two weeks with many events and in fact I was visiting with a friend, a friend who lives in the western part of the city, I had not seen him in a while since the covid, we both agreed that everything is super different in",

checking in morning everybody good morning coun should be good I've had that problem before too that but it's streaming all right okay looks like we're ready to go so I will call to order this meeting of the City of Salem climate action plan committee for Monday March 11 2024 present our boy Philips Phillips and Gonzalez virtually uh and I understand we'll have councelor do at some point so uh we will just go ahead and get started we have also staff here uh to be identified uh we have a time for public comment and we did receive uh one written public um we're just taking a moment to our phones folks bear with us all right so we did get one uh public comment you should have all have that in your packets do we have any members of the public who want to address US verbally all right uh on to item three which is approval of the January 8 2024 minutes everybody have a chance to look them any issues with them be concerned all right you need a motion to approve I guess I will move approval January 8 2024 meeting second Mo by Slater second by Phillips any further discussion all those in favor say I I I I motion carries all right uh item number four uh charging for City controlled parking Juliana did you want to kick this off or do we want to go straight to our guests actually we can just go stra all right we have Sheree and Sarah here from Comm planning and and development good morning everyone and thank you for the opportunity to give you an update this morning on um a parking imp implementation plan in Downtown Salem first of all I just want to make sure that I for managing expectations in the climate action plan where it references parking as a P Parking as a priority project it had um $2 signs which would mean it was between 200 and 500,000 as a project cost and it had an S for short timeline and it would not be between 200 and 500,000 in cost and it would be longer uh timeline so I just want to make sure that in order to manage expectations were all on the same page as far as this we weren't a part of this but again it's easily something that I can update you on so for Sarah and I I've been here over 20 years Sarah's been here over 10 years twice um implementation of paid parking has been and we do not have paid parking on street uh we have many many years of thirdparty consultant work that uh recommends that we put a Performance Based system in downtown of which the implementation of that has not happened so the implementation is extremely just for the record we have coun joining us thank you so for us the implementation piece is critical to the success of this and so council did approve us moving forward with an implementation plan and since that we have been addressing those things that we can so first thing we needed to do was go to the riverfront over renewal plan and do a plan Amendment so that we could add the payment of the technology as an eligible use with Riverfront dollars of which we did um since then we've also engaged um Consultants uh to do two different aspects for us one uh to look at the financial analysis piece but the bigger one is a communication um how we are going to engage the community get their input on how they think this is going to affect them their customers and again we' just started those um meetings and so have something that we can come back with uh we will but again just wanted to let you know we are moving forward with that that plan and we will keep going um with it and let you know when there's strategic tasks that are being done and when a significant piece of the plan will be implemented can you detail out a little bit more of those engagement sessions what do those look like what what is that what's involved in so we just had um a second meeting with again a consultant that has a a subc consultant who's doing the communication strategy we have our first meeting with her uh next week next week so unfortunately I don't have any more than that we're going to to sit down but I know you've been very consistent in a piece of it needs to be that engagement and so that's a big piece if you look at the scope we're going to be talking with her about it's going to be coming up with those questions and who are partners that we need to make sure that we meet with early on because a big piece of it's going to be education I'm sure a part of it's going to be a survey because we have many stakeholders that will be interested in how we move this forward yeah my in my motion to move this thing forward is really specific about all the different groups that I want to make sure that we're engaging with from business owners uh building owners employers employees all folks so on the list great any other questions councelor Phillips or Gonzalez uh no all right well thank you thank you look forward to coming back all right we are now on to uh item five strategy en9 which is the green tariff we have Riley PE Steve cor and from PGE good morning good morning mayor and climate action committee members I'm Wendy valiz and I'm um for those of you who don't know me in the room I'm a local government Affairs manager for PGE and today I have with me the really smart people at PGE and that is uh my colleague um Riley P who is senior manager of our regulatory strategy and we also have Steve Corson who is one of our regulatory consultants and with that I'm going to hand it over to Riley he's going to kind of walk you through um giving you an update on our tariff thank you for the opportunity thank you for being here uh thank you for the intro Wendy um it's a pleasure to be here to talk with all of you today about PG's Community granden tariff efforts um so I'm Riley peek senior manager of regulatory strategy at PGE um I'm lucky to have um Steve Corson who's on my team with me as well um we have a couple slides to share with you all um my basic idea is to just take a few minutes to sort of talk with you about the program as we've conceived it but to leave plenty of time for questions um I hope that we can address um the majority of not nuts and bolts questions up front um so um maybe a suggestion would be to hold questions until we're getting close to the end because we have thought this through um and it sort of makes um sense sequentially um that said if I say something that you're just unfamiliar with from sort of a technical perspective um do let me know um you know I I know there's a lot baked into this presentation and um we've tried to keep it um reasonably accessible without being too simple but um it's hard to write that balance um so with that I'll kind of just get started um so to step back to where we were um a couple of years ago um and what got us here Steve you perfect I I I have this feeling that Steve's going to magically know every time we need to go to a new slide um we have this um Community green tariff concept that was created in HB 2021 but goes back several years beyond that in conversations between PGE and the communities that it serves um basically this is a way for PGE and a community um to work together to help communities get to their climate goals um ahead of PGE schedule you are all aware that HP 2021 has an 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 90% by 2035 and 100% by 2040 we know that certain um cities and counties in our service area want to go faster F than that um and you know conceptually the way to do that is to add more non-emitting resources to PG system sooner but then we need to figure out a way to say on behalf of the community you know this new thing that we built is Salems or is Portlands or is Milwaukee or you know insert any of the many cities and counties that we serve um and that's what this is all about is to be able to say you know this thing we built for Salem and then obviously along with that it's not just we built this thing for Salem but Salem is paying for it as well because you know you get what you pay for basically right um so that's that's the idea here um I want to touch briefly on how we're going to do this from a regulatory perspective and then we'll talk about how we do it from a cost perspective so all business that PGE does pretty much has to be done via a tariff which is a um a document that we file with Public Utility Commission that it approves that explains what things cost and how we we we charge for them um this is no different So currently Steve and I and many others of PGE have been working on a community green tariff um that's going to explain how this works we expect to file this within the next couple of months um and it's really high level we're trying to make this effectively a carrier for whatever policies that our local communities would like to implement with this you know we have some communities that just want to talk about um emissions period we have some that want to talk about you know developing um resources that provide significant local economic we are trying to do something that allows for both um this slide is really helpful because it shows that it's the general umbrella Provisions about um you know how customers get charged the program mechanics in terms of you know how decisions are made and then that last one risk allocation is really important I'll pause here to see if there are any questions with what I've got so far question so far I don't think we have any so far okay great so to talk briefly about risk allocation I want to just explain what how that works and why um one Bedrock concept of any voluntary utility program is that the customers that are choosing to take on additional costs bear the risk because it would be not not fair to let say um you know the M County County C IL make a decision that could increase costs for customers in Salem OR",

        "text": " energy is negotiating the grant agreement with um with our federal partners and then once that's in place we'll have to set up a identify the awards to monitor the financials to provide the reporting both from our grantees and from the state level back to the federal government we'll also be working on our plan for future years with some of those administrative funds and technical assistance funds so not only launching what's going to hopefully hit the ground in that very first year but planning for the future with those funding um during that that first year as well great um there were a few comments in the chat that i'll just vocalize about um uh distributed renewable energy microgrid grids and the earlier conversation we had about generation as well as a comment around community engagement and applicants working with union apprenticeship programs is a critical and it looks like ryan is interested in working with folks on that thanks ryan and then uh two other questions and then i think we'll go back to the slide and pause again later um the first is from harney electric uh what happens when supplies are not available from u.s suppliers also wondering if the grant process is going to be simple because of some of the smaller utilities that don't have grant writers on staff um one one other plug for that navigator program that we're trying to put together is hopefully to help with that but that won't likely become available until later i'm not sure jen if you have something on the suppliers piece i know that's been an area of that's come up in other places yes so um the build america by america provisions will apply so in general the equipment will need to be um produced within america there are limited waivers that may be possible um but that will have to be issued by the federal u.s department of energy so it may um there's several different ways that can be done but it will really come down to the very specific item and how much that might increase the cost of the overall and various other factors that um yeah gets really specific once we start talking about which type of waiver great thanks jen and i think that we would like to keep it as simple as possible that you're hearing a lot of requirements from jen so um if you have feedback on on how it could be more simple from our end we'd love to hear that and try to make um try to make that part of the design uh last one from jennifer is just confirming i think something that you said jen about whether the federal government can alter the application submitted by the state and if that typically does occur they do have the ability to negotiate that is a part of the federal process whether or not it's likely to happen i'm i'm really not sure since this is a brand new federal program we do have some other federal programs where it is an extreme rarity and others where it is a common annual occurrence and so since this is a brand new program i'm just not sure what what the federal government's approach may be in interacting with us on this one great well with that we're going to pause again for questions a little bit later but let the team go through the rest of the slide deck and please keep the questions coming in the chat it's really helpful to log those as you have them great thank you and i think we got we went back a couple slides one more yeah and so just before i do this just just to summarize since we went through a lot of material there sort of the vision as we're proposing it is that there will be uh data layers mapped one around and then one around disadvantaged communities so the vision is that you have a combination of the layers um the maps you just saw that would uh make up a single wildfire layer and a single disadvantaged community layer that we would make available uh before the program gets going so yeah so as i mentioned earlier we do plan a priority round where only those projects that satisfy the eligibility requirements on the previous slides can apply but assuming funds still remain we do then plan to hold a general round with fewer restrictions where projects can be located anywhere in the state and we'd really be looking to the utility applicant to identify which hazard or hazards the project is designed to and we'd be looking for the utility to identify the project in a previously published plan so something like a utility or community energy or resilience plan a local natural hazard mitigation plan a wildfire plan etc um so why why are we proposing it this way again we're proposing the structure uh this way in year one to ensure we can commit all the funds allocated to oregon via the formula grant we don't want to leave anything left on the table there uh that's been allocated to the state so that's the idea behind scoping a general round in this way after the priority round next slide and so here's the last slide for me on the specifics of our proposed provisional approach for year one as i think i've already made clear but i'm not sure if i said explicitly we're proposing to make direct awards for year now the funding leaves significant discretion to the states in this regard either to do direct awards have competitive solicitations green banks but we're proposing a direct award now we also propose that the utility applicant will be required to demonstrate compliance with the eligibility requirements subject to an eligibility and technical review by oto if more funds are requested than are available it will identify a process for making awards that may include first come first served a randomized lottery or some combination thereof and you'll see more details about our thinking there in the in the draft narrative match requirements um so this was mentioned earlier by gen but the state's required to do a 15 match of total federal funds to access the state formula allocation and in addition to that each utility applicant will have its own match based on our preliminary calculations we anticipate that this will be 100 match required for ious and a one-third match for our cous and then the last element here i'm going to cover is around maximum rewards and again this is an area where i really am looking for some feedback we're trying to balance here um having sufficient dollars available per award so that we can make meaningful investments for individual projects with the total number of awards uh that we can make so that's what we're trying to strike a balance here so we're proposing to impose limitations on how much any utility can receive in that priority round for the ious we're really looking to do it on a proportionate basis based on the share of customers served by each investor in utility relative to all three of the investors utilities statewide so again this is our preliminary calculation of these percentages is shown here on this slide and then for a consumer on utilities uh we're proposing a maximum award amount of 400 000 per utility in the priority round again i hope you understand the objectives we we have here but trying to really balance uh that striking the right the right mix between the total dollar amount to make meaningful investments uh piano award um certain number of awards that you know certain threshold of utilities uh can capture an award so that's all i have here unless we want to pause for more questions otherwise i'll turn it back over to jen center hey i think we'll go ahead and cover the metrics um actually jen before jumping into that there was a um question adam i think on the small utility from jennifer that wanted some clarification on the um so in that one there's a 400 000 cap for small utilities um that you can see on the last bullet on the slide um and she was wondering that she was thinking that only 10 of the 37 consumer owned utilities would be eligible for a maximum 400 000 grant and so we're wondering about some of the assumptions that oto might have had income coming to that number about participation and eligibility in year one yeah and again i'm totally welcome to hear feedback on this i think it's really we're trying to balance how to balance this uh issue we have here but um so you're right that's that's about the math we were thinking is roughly 10 awards to be made to recognize that that wouldn't be uh all consumer utilities been able to get an award um but again if we were to you know ensure that every consumer utility got an award we'd be talking about much smaller dollar amounts so we're trying to strike that the balance and get that right so um please please give us your feedback you know and i also you know we did look a little bit about you know which we look at kind of percentages of customers served by our consumer and utilities but i think as everyone on the call is probably aware there's really such a huge diversity uh for some really small municipal utilities to some fairly good size co-ops and puds that you'd have a really big spread there um with some utilities getting a really extremely small dollar amount um that might not really allow for a meaningful investment so anyway well uh welcome to your ideas on this great thanks adam and thanks um jason and and brittany for adding to the conversation in the chat about the um small utility award um and the idea of maybe getting together with other utilities uh go ahead jen so adam covered um some of our um initial objectives especially during year one but underneath those objectives um we have some proposed metrics and it's our hope that these metrics would help um help us at the oregon department of energy determine and assess how well um these investments are are meeting these objectives and so these are just some of the proposed metrics we are certainly open to feedback as to whether or not these really help us measure those overarching objectives and if there's a better way to frame these or define these or consider these we certainly welcome your feedback into that many of these metrics would be incorporated into subrecipient grant agreements um because that would be part of how we would be able to determine if our investments are are serving these so i'm just covering some of the types of metrics we have metrics under the objective of wildfire risk mitigation and benefits to disadvantaged communities or the nine federally recognized tribes we also have metrics around supporting immediate investments that provide those community benefits as soon as possible and metrics that help us examine whether or not we're investing in projects that meet strong labor protections and in addition to that we have some metrics set around our investments and engagements with disadvantaged communities and the fine nine federally recognized tribes as well as metrics that can help us evaluate our progress as we look to the future and consider our work with an advisory committee to",

team and um other folks that'll stay in the background from our Odo team help answer questions and uh and help run the run the webinar as well um we opened this first round of funding on March 15 making almost $19 million of federal funding available to Oregon's Electric utilities for grid resilience projects if you are with an electric utility hopefully you've had time to review the information and documents and start an application if you're a utility customer interested in following this program we're glad you're here and we encourage you to engage with your utility to be part of the process um the main purpose today is to quickly get to your questions but first I'll run through an overview of the program and highlight the application requirements including where to find everything on our website again thank you very much for being here here's a quick guide to some of the features in WebEx attendees are off camera and muted but our host will be able uh to unmute you for questions on the right hand side of your screen in the participants panel you can click near your name to raise your hand there's also a hand icon at the bottom of the WebEx window in the reactions bar click that hand to indicate you'd like to ask a question and feel free to use the chat function to ask questions please send your chats to all panelists or to everyone so that all of the AO staff can see it and help responses if you joined from a phone press star six to raise your hand um we should be able to unmute you from our end uh but in case that doesn't work and you're on a phone then you do we try star three but hopefully between Patricia our host's help and uh and you on the phone we'll be able to do that it's oh it's I'm being corrected star three is to raise your hand on your phone if you're here if you're hear from a phone it doesn't look like the four participants we have so far are on their phone so I'll let's keep going um we we are recording today's webinar and we will post the recording to our website along with the presentation slides again please put questions into chat at any time but please wait to speak until I finish this summary I promise I will make it quick and we'll get to question and answer for the majority of our chrisy yeah before you get going to start um start with your presentation or quick presentation I should say I think it'd be nice if folks could introduce themselves in the chat with what organization or utility there with just so we know who we're talking to okay great thank you and we'll ask that you do the same um if you are going to speak um and ask a question that way if you just give a quick introduction to yourself um after you've been uh um unmuted and asked to uh to proceed with your question thank you all right I'll start the summary now this program is funded under the infrastructure investment and jobs act also known as the bipartisan infrastructure law and will include five years of funding this eight .9 million is the first of the first two years of funding and we expect about $50 million of federal dollars over the life of the program so if the firstr application deadline on June 14th won't work for you there will be more opportunities so please continue your project and application planning for a future round we've set aside 40% of the funds for projects from small utilities defining those as selling 4 Mill million or less megawatt hours annually the law requires a one-third funding match of any subgrant award to the small utilities and large utilities must match 100% of any subgrant award all of the application documents have been posted on our website since March 15th so hopefully you've had time to start and here and are here today with questions about those documents and other aspects of the process our application submission portal is still being developed but is not needed to start your application the portal will simply be a place to upload your completed application documents and to lock in your submission with a dig digital signature before the deadline after the deadline on June 14th we will start the application review and selection process we plan to notify selected Utilities in early October the law and the US Department of Energy's implementation of the law created this grant program to provide utilities with money to improve the resilience of the electric grid and to encourage the selection and development of grid resilience projects that prioritize disadvantaged communities our first objective gets right to the resilience improvements by looking at how your projects will decrease the frequency in duration of grid disruptions the second objective is to see how and where projects improve grid resilience to benefit disadvantaged communities in in this program disadvantaged communities are defined and identified by the climate and economic Justice screening tool up with we will look at how your projects will decrease the frequency and duration of good distri ion specifically in disadvantaged communities where that applies um I won't get into the details of the climate and economic Justice screening Tool uh today that's um the links and stuff are available on the website along with a lot of documentation around that program the justice 40 program and and everything related to that and the and the climate tool but we're here to answer questions around that today too and then our third objective is to select project that maximize Community benefits overall so we'll look at your community engagement and any Workforce support and development aspects of your projects will your project reduce the use of fossil fuel generators we will also look for project measures that support emergency preparedness and Emergency Operations and we'll also consider project diversity in geography Technologies and scope as well as the type and size of the utilities for the applications that we receive in the first round this is a list of the eligible measures from the federal guidelines if you have very specific technical questions around these measures it might be better to put those details in an email so we can research and provide detailed answers um the main point to make about the eligible activities is the scope of the project using one or more of the listed activities should reduce the frequency in duration of disruptive events New Generation and cyber security measures are not allowed under this program I mean they're allowed but they're not eligible for uh funding or for Grant funds um now I'll quickly discuss some details here's the homepage for the Oregon Department of energy the first column on the left lists our incentive and efficiency programs and here you'll find a link to get to the grid resilience grant program page handy a little red arrow to show way on the other website or one other website navigation tip the blue Banner at the top stays with every page in the on the Odo website so as you move around the website you should always see this blue banner and see these menu choices at the top including incentives when you select the incentives um menu choice at the top you get a drop- down list of links to all the incentives programs just like on that column that I previously showed you including another link or another way to get to the grid resilience grant program and then after you get to the resilience program this is what you'll find um the program information is in the center column and the left column has links uh the left column has links to other programs the program schedule is in the center and will be updated as needed so always return to this page for the current and official dates and deadlines for the program the application documents including instructions are on the top right hand side of this web page as mentioned earlier the application submission portal is still being developed but it is not needed to complete the application documents the portal will be a place to upload completed application documents and to provide a place for a dig digital signature to lock in your submission by the 1pm June 14th deadline so on that right hand side of the web page this is um you'll find all of these these documents linked and so here's here's a list of them again just so they're easier to read um they're all available on that right side of the website the exception is there is no template for the grip letter grip refers to the grid resilience and Innovation Partnerships program also from the iig that was a program where utilities and other entities could apply directly to the US Department of energy for very similar funding um but it's in a different section of the law also referred to or the section number is 4101c and sometimes the whole program is referred to that 40101 c just like our program is often referred to as 40101 D because that's the section in the law that derives the program if your utility has applied for funding under the grip program a letter is required giving a summary description of the project for review to the US for review by the US Department of energy and just a another reminder and a reference back to the schedule even after we have selected the projects we would like to put forward we have to submit all of those project details to the US Department of energy for their final approval before we can proceed with a performance agreement um and that's referenced back on the schedule but I just wanted to to mention that again here and that's it that's the whole summary so uh we can get to your questions now um I'm taking a look around for either raised hands if you want to come off mute and ask a question we also looking in the chat for um any questions we have so far so far no hands open and no chats hey yeah that's what I'm seeing as Chris we sit here in awkward silence we'll get that here we got a question so um are projects that integrate existing renewable generation into a micro grid with battery storage eligible for the program yes is the short answer the devil's always in the detail um and so we'd have to take a look at that the um the it would also have to be uh micro grid design specifically to support the resilience and reduce the effects of grid disruption um so as long as that was built into the design and planning of it um what's not allowed is New Generation so um if it's a so a micro grid um where the resilience generation is from solar um the solar aspects of that are not eligible funding but aspects of the micro grid would be great the next question is could you please repeat what is not allowed that you mentioned previously so I don't know if it's easier",

        "text": " so again your choice but it's our recommendation and the way we've set this up is to hold uh until the conclusion of all of the remaining uh noise control issues okay what's the pleasure of the council so this is handling we have pulled on one nc one i'd like to go ahead and pull on nc2 and then consolidate three and if we can that's fine council good with that okay okay so agree with the findings of fact conclusions of law and conditions of in the proposed contested case order pertaining to issue nc2 sounds good and buyer perry choctoot cindy condon hanley jenkins yes ken howe jordan truitt yes thank you council issue nc3 has one limited party filed exception stop bth the issue is whether the methodologies used for the noise analysis to evaluate compliance with oar340-35-0035 were appropriate and whether the oregon department of energy erred in approving the methodology used to evaluate compliance with that rule the hearing officer's opinion she first noted that the applicant identified specific locations within the 300 mile transmission line to set noise monitors and collect ambient noise monitoring data to then be used for the evaluation of predicted worst-case operational noise to evaluate whether the proposed facility would result in an increase of 10 dba or above the ambient anti-degradation standard in union county the location selected and evaluated in the application for site certificate and proposed order for baseline noise monitoring is referred to as mp-11 mp mp-11 is in proximity to i-84 highway 30 and a union pacific railroad noise measurements identified ambient noise levels at this location of 32 dba the applicant's expert witness mark bustach confirmed that the noise level used to evaluate compliance with the anti-ambient noise degradation standard is based on l50 which is an averaging of all total hours train noise given its limited duration would be filtered out over the sampling in response to issues raised by the limited parties through the contested case proceeding the applicant introduced new noise monitoring data for four new monitoring position locations within union county these are referred to as mp100 101 102 and 103. data was collected for three weeks in october 2021 the applicant selected the monitoring positions to represent nsrs located closer to morgan lake and the grand baseline data relies on the quietest times of day midnight to 5 a.m where wind data was recorded as calm at these four new monitoring position the mean l50 was 31 dba 36 dba 32 dba and 43 dba respectively stop the hearing officer also found that stop bth's introduction of monitoring data from mr kerry stanley should not be used to determine representative ambient noise levels she concluded that the data set is too to allow that conclusion she also found that oar 340 35-00353a expressly authorizes the reviewing agency to approve sound measurement and the department and its noise consultant gold or associates appropriately vetted and concurred with the applicant's methodology the hearing officer also considered whether the variance slash exception should only apply to the nsrs where exceedances are predicted to occur today the noise control regulations do not address the difference between a non-linear and linear facility the council should acknowledge the i either could be a situation where there are new nsrs or nsrs that were inadvertently missed in the evaluation granting an exception or variance for the whole line creates some flexibility for ipc to avoid an automatic violation of the standard the conditions assure that if this were to occur a for a full formal evaluation would be required and upon a complaint filed uh the same level of mitigation for known nsrs is required and which includes the opportunity for council review so that is the summary of the hearing officer's opinion on that issue and stop bth can present oral argument carl anuda presenting for stop b-2-h the hopefully you have a chance to read the exceptions and materials on this the crux of the dispute was over monitoring point 11 and whether it is or is not representative stop provided a spot check with data from mr stanley that showed it was not representative the idaho power did a spot check for a bit longer but it was still nothing but a spot check that suggested it might be representative but it may be not maybe it was not representative in the other way the problem here is that you're trying to set that they're using monitoring 0.11 to set a baseline level and the baseline level that was chosen which was started out at 32 and went to 31 dba way higher for a rural area than any of the rural counties and there's a chart in the record we cited it repeatedly in our testimony and our exceptions that shows all the other counties have baseline dbas between 24 and 25. that's where the dba for morgan lake and mill creek routes should be and we presented evidence that showed that the fundamental problem with monitoring 0.11 is it's too close to the union pacific train line where there are 25 to 35 trains per day that increase the ambient noise level so that's the fundamental problem uh we urge you to remand for further analysis or to conclude that what's really needed here is to set a baseline for union county that's the same as the baselines for the other rural counties which is in the 24 to 25 levels if you do that it's going to increase the number of nsr exceedances but as has been pointed out there is a process in the conditions for complaints and addressing those exceedances and we think that process should be available to all those people that are at 25 and go up from there rather than just all those people that are at 31 and go up from there and i'll talk more about the conditions when we get to nc4 we made a bunch of recommendations to tighten up that language so that it really does what idaho power says they want to for now i think what you really need to wrestle with is do you want to have ambient noise levels set at a level way higher for union county than all the other rural counties and what's the safe thing to do here we've outlined in our testimony and our exceptions why the safe thing to do is to lower the dba for the baseline for union county i urge you to do so thank you mr nuda are there any questions from council okay thank you stop b2h's argument about idaho power's noise monitoring methodology is focused on the company's use of mp11 to set the average ambient sound level for nsrs in the morgan lake area however all of these arguments were completely invalidated by the company's supplemental noise monitoring in morgan lake area which yielded ambient sound levels that are virtually identical to the ones that that we received at mp11 so all this focus on what's wrong with mp11 is simple misdirection mr anuta also referred to our monitoring as spot monitoring well mr stanley performed spot monitoring for three idaho power performed monitoring round the clock for three weeks which was the same monitoring protocol that was approved by odo for all the initial monitoring so our supplemental monitoring was robust and lengthy and can't be fairly be called spot now in response to stop's concern so we did do this supplemental monitoring the monitoring point that we selected for the morgan lake area which was the area of most concern was right adjacent to the park we chose the quietest place in the area that we could to provide the most conservative results for mp11 idaho power measured an ambient sound level of 31 dba which is one dba less than what we had found at mp11 one dba as our expert explained it's not perceptible to the ear but it create if we adopt that approach which we agreed to do two more nsrs that will be mitigated under our plan now stop e2h has taken exception to the fact that the hearing officer didn't accept the monitoring results of his own expert mr stanley which was indeed significantly lower than what we received from mp11 or 100 but as i said that took place in just three and a half hours and as pointed out by both odo's expert and our expert mr stanley failed to follow the most basic procedures for ensuring and verifiable and reliable data and in the end while mr stan stanley initially said that he had produced an ambient uh ambient level for the area he had to agree that he never really intended that that's not really what his uh monitoring was intended to do stop betwh also argued a list of um criticisms of idaho power's selection of mp11 as the proxy and i see i'm out of time and i'm going to be respectful thank you miss rachner are there any questions of miss rachner like counselor jenkins so this is hanley um lisa not i'm having trouble finding it but i was pretty sure that i had read in the exceptions that mr stanley admitted that um his measurements and you just alluded to that had problems because one he didn't calibrate his equipment um and two um it was only for the four hours i i think mr stanley did acknowledge through his attorney there was some email back and forth that he had not calibrated his equipment he did something i can't remember if something called like a spot check of his equipment but didn't calibrate his equipment his equipment also hadn't been calibrated as required under deq rules you have to have it calibrated a year before you do your monitoring that didn't happen he didn't do a calibration in the field i don't believe he ever admitted that that was the problem with his monitoring but i you'd have to read his testimony he seemed more to be focused on the fact that he had to agree that since he only monitored for three hours he can't possibly have claimed to have captured any representative example and he did in his monet and he did in his monitoring results note that it was a quiet night with no wind well many nights are quite windy there's a lot of trees out um in that area which means that it's loud when it's windy so um so on that i think mr stanley did acknowledge that his that it was just the brevity of his monitoring meant that it really couldn't be used to um set any kind of a responsible level thank you any other questions from council okay thank you thank you",

        "text": " try to incentivize additional affordable that would cause the project to become a prevailing wage project which is going to drive up the construction cost which will then drive up their loan cost their Debt Service which then makes it harder for the project to pencil so uh we arrived at the 15% um going back oh probably four to five years ago when we started having conversations about doing the single property urban renewal areas to provide an incentive and working with developers and getting their input on that where that sweet spot is between um affordability and financial feasibility and so that feedback was that 15% is kind of right in there um and then we carried that over as a policy into the mtip property tax abatement program which is set at 15% so both of those program pro programs are at that 15% affordability level at 80% or less L of the area median income so that's how we're just defining affordability um no that that doesn't mean that we couldn't go to a higher level a higher requirement um it it does start to get kind of nuanced with what's going to trigger greater operational costs right um and make it so that the project doesn't pencil but but we still have to go through the development and disposition agreement process um and those negotiations and absolutely something that we could explore well I I speaking for myself I would love to see us explore that and see what those options are I would be very much in favor of that I appreciate the fact that we have made revisions to our policies to make affordable housing something that wasn't even on really on our radar screen in many ways for a long time so I applaud the progress we've made I just know that this is something that keeps coming up in our community a lot we're all painfully aware of the fact that if you make minimum wage there's a good chance you can't find a place to live in town if you make $25 an hour you might not be able to find a place to live in town and there's a lot of people between 15 and 25 bucks an hour who I worry about and are not just my constituents but our constituents for all of us so I appreciate those questions I think that's all I have for now yeah we could also look at a more um tiered structure so perhaps rather than 15% at 80% or less Ami maybe we look at 25% or 30% at 110% or less Ami that provides um more flexibility in the level of affordability that they're targeting but they could go a little bit higher for a greater percentage of units okay so um a lot of that's just going to come down to the math okay and I suppose the other option which isn't necessarily an urban renewal area Department question but are there other Housing Voucher programs either through sha or other Community Partners that could help those folks live in these units that aren't Ur money that don't raise the issues that that you've just raised I don't know I would just like us to be creative because it's not every day you see a project like this so thank you for answering my questions you're very welcome yeah counc nioka thank you mayor Hoy um Miss retherford thank you uh for introducing the idea of potentially having more of the workforce um affordability concept which is 80 to the 110 or 85 to the 110 I think something and I think that that's where we're really missing um and so I think that that is really quite a nice idea to find out if that might work you know well I'm going to give the credit for that IA to counselor Stapleton who asked me if that might be possible well kudos to both of you thank you further questions or discussion councelor Stapleton uh thanks I'm I'm just curious about next steps you know a lot of times counselors will bring up something that they're passionate about or that they care about and would like to see movement on um if this is a conversation that you know councelor nordik would like to have and I'm sure there's many others um could we maybe count on you to loop back with us or or Loop in the city manager to see if we can maybe get some small group work sessions on that yeah so I think I'm hearing maybe two different issues so one is tied directly to this development agreement right and how we're going to address affordability for this project but then the larger policy issue of uh for our other programs Moon tip urban renewal areas and so on if we want to kind of reframe the affordability structure of those programs yeah and thanks for kind of dicing those two out because I think you know Council ndec and were talking earlier and she's really interested in in having the conversation about this particular property and I don't know where we are um in in the process and if it's possible to talk about Workforce housing or or or where we're at because we know these projects really do take off and and sometimes we get on the train and it's a little late um but I do know that overall we want to have a conversation about the policy but is it too late for this particular project no not at all we are at the beginning so everything really starts with with this agreement which then allows us to start the the real negotiation yeah thank you um yeah I would love to hear some followup maybe a small group meeting on the calendar would be great absolutely further discussion councelor Phillips uh thank you um and thank you for the the conversation and pulling this item um I think I'm I'm supportive of trying to get a little bit more and to tailoring it in a way that might be more beneficial to a larger number of people um I just want to ask it sounds like we're in the process and now that now is the time to do it but are there any tradeoffs to um exploring this new um idea that's been kind of discussed just now so the biggest trade-off again would be if we're trying to incentivize this by more urban redual dollars or public dollars into the project and triggering prevailing wage and and the impact that that would carry through the project um but I think there are also some other options that could be explored um um so you know I think we need to start having those conversations with the development team um talk through a few different options and ways that it could be structured to increase the number of affordable units and then bring that back perhaps to a small workg group run that by and then as we start building out you know more meat to that agreement the framework of that agreement then that would be coming back to council at executive session thank you I appreciate that um I mean what I'm hearing is that there really doesn't sound like there's much risk of delay by starting this conversation now and that we do have to be careful with the triggering the triggering the prevailing wage because that could make this project not pencil out um I mean I I think that this is an important project I'm glad that we as a city and as an urban R renewal District had the funds to get this project and to kind of ensure that there's this uh ability to ensure affordability here but we do need housing at all levels um in our state and especially in our city um and I think that this is an important project so I I look forward to seeing it move forward and I I plan to support the this motion thank you councelor further discussion will the recorder please call role for mwen I board member Gonzalez board member Hoy I board member nordik I board member Varney's absent board member Stapleton I board member ber Nish shoka I board member Phillips I chair Hoy I motion passes all right on the information reports we just have one are there any questions on item 6A okay uh the urban renewal agency is adjourned and now I will call to order this meeting of the Salem City Council for Monday February 26 2024 if the recorder will please call the rooll councelor Stapleton here councelor nishioka here councelor Phillips here councelor Gwyn here councelor Gonzalez here councelor Hoy here councelor nordik here councelor vanney is absent mayor Hoy here councelor Stapleton do we have any additions or deletions to the agenda not tonight all right it is now time for Council and city manager comment do we any councelor Stapleton yeah I just wanted to give a quick update I'm chair of the um now I'm going to Blink on the name our committee Solid Waste committee was sure where you're going I was going to try to help you out but I could staring at you as if you're going to tell me um I just wanted to update Council on what we have been up to it really is a rather fun committee I have to say um councelor nishioka councelor Gwyn councelor vanney and I serve on this committee and councelor Hoy is also on the alternate as an alternate um and uh Ryan zinc if he's I don't think he's here but he is staff member that is helping us with that um and it really has been a great um time that we've been learning a lot about our waste um just the whole cycle from beginning to end um and we've been going on site visits and some of us are even going on ride alongs with haulers um and really getting to know uh the whole process and the challenges that are involved uh we have been meeting our partners um whether that's in the recycling Community or at um the county um and of course our haulers as well and this last meeting we had some really interesting information given to us on the Census Data overlaid with the with the solid waste data um and really really interesting I know um this last year we talked about possibly going to 90 gallon cans and um that was a whole real interesting conversation here but then to see that data overlaid with the Census Data um was really fascinating and so uh we're just getting into all of that stuff we're having a lot of fun there and um thought you all would want to just get a brief update on what we've been up to thank you counselor are there further counselor comments councelor Hoy thank you um I was happy to attend the police foundation breakfast with the chief um this week uh last week rather officer jance's video of",

        "text": " back into the river and essentially the same thing happens only on the bridge we understand that you know horizontal directional drilling is a while it's commonly done you know you need to understand the geology you need to understand what else is there that you shouldn't interfere with for instance around bonneville there are fish passage facilities we're aware of that so clearly it has to be cited cable installation has to be cited to avoid anything that that shouldn't be touched all right next the areas we are looking at uh for the point of interconnection and we have not a specific site control at this point as i said before converter stations require five or six acres each um photo shows the uh vicinity you can see that kind of on the left it says harvard and substation uh what we're expecting is to be able to uh obtain rights to a small portion of some of that vacant land that is across the willamette and to basically drill across the willamette uh to the harvard and the um bottom photo is near bigot again uh there is a quite a bit of vacant land a lot of it is already federally owned and we would expect that uh somewhere close to big eddy there will be room for a five or six acre inverter we would expect to bring the cable up you can see the difference between the green which is in water and the yellow which is on land that's a conceptual view of how it would be done it has not been microcited we are aware for instance that there are um areas uh closer to the dam that have some cultural significance uh to the tribes so that's the kind of thing that we are increasingly aware of and as i said before expect well more than expect will avoid all right next this schedule is and i'll just speak to it briefly starts with the northern grid planning and um we have already um you know applied in the first cycle of the northern grid plan planning process that uh ended in 2021 they did not choose any uh of the proposed independent transmission projects or really any projects to study further so we're going back into the northern grid process of this year and that's a two year cycle were hoping that we could uh get through the northern grid process earlier than it turns out that we'll be able to so we have launched our permitting kind of full bore that's why we have hdr on board i would say that the permitting line would probably have to extend out all the way to about third quarter of 2025. that would bring the commercial operations date for the to about the end of 2027 so again this schedule is a bit too optimistic that said to bring it online by 2027 if you remember back to previous slide that showed the growing need for transmission of any kind and if you combine that with the uh renewable energy mandates in oregon and you know 2027 uh would at least enable to a significant extent a new resource of 1100 megawatts to help meet those needs which have to be met by all right next please at this point i'm going to let susie here ask susie kavanaugh of hdr to to run through briefly uh some of the considerations that that we're already trying to address thanks chris thanks council for letting us present today um some of the things that we've taken i mean there's a lot of technical considerations as you're well aware with all the projects that you provide oversight for an approval on is you know the some of the bigger picture items are you know the natural and cultural resources chris has already pointed out that we understand the constraints around the bonneville dam and the fish passage that's already located there um in addition there's navigational features um that we need to consider and i you know would like to just focus on the fact that a lot of this is in the water and so it's going to be really important as chris mentioned and understanding what these considerations are and working really hard to avoid the environmental and cultural resources in the area chris's team along with hdr has already working with the army corps of engineers um and we've identified you know quite a quite a process with them in working through you know the permitting requirements that we're going to need on their side on the federal side and so um you know we've obviously realized that there's going to be some permitting with both the state of oregon and with the state of washington to make sure that we're you know moving this project in the right direction next slide please yeah let me jump back into this real quick this is just sort of to illustrate uh aware of of you know some of the important resources and have already begun in a preliminary basis not formal uh with the treaty tribes so we've uh fortunate enough to be able to make our presentation in one case to the board of trustees that was to the uh um and we understand there's a long way to go in identifying and avoiding impacts and uh any issues that should come up but for instance the uh the fishing areas uh around the bonneville dam the first foods areas uh i think there's some uh fairly close to the to the dalles that kind of thing we want to be very very sensitive to and you know we've been advised from the very beginning communicate with the tribes and make sure we can at least reach a mutual of what we intend to do and how it might affect them so we have tried to do that thanks chris next slide please you know other natural resource considerations um species protected under the endangered species act um you know the columbia river is really important native migratory fish and their habitat we understand in discussions with the core and just an experience in general that there are going to be seasonal restrictions and work windows that need to be abided by to make sure that we minimize impacts the best as possible chris already mentioned the water quality considerations and the options around the harbington substation you know with the willamette river being an ideal place to place that cable with that super fun site being there it's it's not ideal so we're looking for other options there um and so working with the core um will also involve you know doing wetland delineations and understanding the process for the waters of the u.s and those permitting requirements next slide so this is just a little bit more detail you know how we're physically looking at moving that cable out of the river around the bonneville dam and back into the river and there's still quite a bit of work needed to do with the corps of engineers and then also you know on the natural resources side to understand the best place for that cable to um exit the river um be trenched and then so that it's subterranean and then re-enter the river to continue on so um yeah we've gotten some initial considerations and input from the core the core process is going to involve national environmental policy act or the nepa process there will be the the core section 408 process also tied with that will be the clean water act um 401 water quality certification process and the simpson 404 permit for waters of the us also with the cultural resource and with the corps being the lead federal agency that national historic preservation act and that section 106 process will be driven through that federal process as well um so there's a lot you know we see a lot of permitting requirements we've got you know endangered species act section 7 consultation that'll need to occur with noaa fisheries you know i mentioned also that we've started um conversations similar to this just in presentation of the project with uh the washington and um environmental facility by saying that wrong energy facility sighting their council there in washington so we're hoping that potentially we can see um kind of collaboration since this you know the the washington oregon boundary is kind of a jagged line that runs through the columbia river so it's going to be no involvement on both sides so we just want to do our best to do as much upfront collaboration and coordination as we possibly can okay next slide chris you may be able to speak to this one a little bit better but um because i know we don't have our our engineer on the line with us but you know working with the core um we've been discussing with them how we'll be able to work in proximity to the navigation there's a lot of technical considerations there um the minimum depths and other considerations as far as what we've kind of already discussed the features to avoid um in the river bottom and then we are looking at the pre-dredging operations and then there's a lot of management in regards to the sediment then that has stirred up into the water just to add each each project has its own unique features and challenges our experience out here was also a multi-state excuse me effort that involved in our case the states of new jersey have wildly different but that also had to fit in with the corps of engineers and the federal permits as well which which it all did so um we're we're used to um bringing the permit requirements uh into sync with each other in fact that's a key aspect of being able to get a project like this financed so you know we have to do that as susie mentioned you know we've already started uh discussions with the corps to talk about their their requirements uh to avoid any sort of impacts to navigation which of course is one of their main reasons to exist so uh you know we that that is all part of the um micro sighting of the route to determine uh whether we're inside or outside the channel how deep the cable needs to be buried uh what resources natural or cultural or physical need to be avoided that whole thing and you know you literally go sort of i want to say mile by mile but it's actually more uh micro than that uh to determine the exact cable route and and how to kind of thread the needle in order to get the cable safely into the river minimize impacts and bring it up on shore i don't think i had anything else to add chris if you wanted to wrap up or open the floor for questions i guess well i'd be more than happy to take questions uh and hopefully i didn't go on too long uh i think what we're trying to impress uh first of all this is introductory worth it we're at the beginning of a long process we've already taken it through the feasibility stage with hdr find out whether there's any you know fatal flaws this",

        "text": " know benefits associated with those projects that are attributing to the power system um and i think you know in case it was sort of unclear beforehand you know the you know pge's are the viewpoint that yeah it makes sense for you know utility slash customers to pay for those power system benefits that are benefiting the you know the grid and the power system um but i think we do i think it is important to parse out and appreciate the sort of suggestions from others on the call to sort of differentiate the sort of costs and benefits that are you know sort of power system focused versus um you know income tax generating focus to borrow the last example uh you know we could consider like borrowing language that's used sort of frequently in other spaces where like sort of above market costs are you know sort of thought of as being an amount a quantity of costs that sort of go beyond what is sort of you know compensated for and sort of recognized as a direct power system so offer that for if people folks are like looking for language that is used in other spaces to help sort of differentiate between those costs and benefits that sort of attribute directly to the power system versus those that you know attribute to society more broadly we can consider using that language to help make this that distinction thanks to me um so we have two other hands up we'll get to those and then after those we'll go to break this conversation's great what i want to flag is that i am not sure although we can try that we can get to an agreement uh as a group on this for anybody who's been kind of paying attention to this issue for a long time it's pretty obvious that the money where it comes from is not something that there's necessarily going to be on agreement so we'll consider internally if there's a way that we can try to wordsmith this in a way that we think will work for everyone um that kind of doesn't make us the deciders as an agency obviously or is the work group on what the appropriate source of funding is for this because it's not i just don't think it's going to happen for there's just going to be disagreements so we'll try to figure out how to like get the principles right um for folks to agree with it and then we can move on to yeah like we need to figure out how to present the two views clearly and therefore allow room for there to be disagreement but to move forward so um james nikita uh james go ahead first then nikita and then we'll go ahead and take a 30-minute break when we're done with those two all right i'll i'll try to be quick um i have a pretty strong objection with the insuring costs are not shifted language i mean that seems very absolutist first of all the word and the whole framing of cost shift is something that's been used by utilities in various states to fight against net metering to really you know reduce the opportunities for customer generation claiming that any loss in revenue is somehow a cost shift to other other customers and you know i just want to be very clear that that's not framing that i i think makes sense in in this report um at all um and so yeah i i i guess without going into like a deep dive of uh perspectives on on that topic i just want to express discomfort with using that cross shift language in this in these guiding principles great thanks yeah i think that also feeds right into what i said right before right that there's just going to be disagreement here so how do we figure out how to make both points and allow people to be comfortable with that um all right nikita yeah thanks i'm not sure if i have anything like specific to add just adding and highlighting um some points that have been raised about just really how important it is to value co-benefits like climate benefits that that benefit everyone um and and the economic benefits um that angela named um that also have more widespread benefits um or or impacts um in a good way um and also yeah i agree with james and i think that that just needs i think that that piece around cost shifting um just needs to be like parsed out a bit if we if we are really exploring the range of benefits and who is um just like how they're being distributed and what types of benefits we can we can uh maximize um if we like address and reduce barriers that i think that yeah i just think that probably as you mentioned it's just like further investigation okay well i really appreciate the conversation it's been really great and like kind of no surprise where we ended up there's a lot to agree with but then where we are right now there's some disagreement so we'll we'll do some chatting during the 30-minute break internally to see if we can kind of come back with something and see if if it works um when we get back from this conversation um and and by the way it's perfectly okay for the report to say that there's two different perspectives on the this top these like kind of related topics and and we are happy to capture that of course um we want to hear both and understand both i think we do um but what i want to do is give the break we'll come back we have a whole chunk of the day that's dedicated to talking about recommendations and going through the outline at the end so we'll be moving on to the recommendations and small breakouts on the other side of lunch um so um but it would be good to see if we could have just at least agreement to disagree within the principles if that makes sense when we get back so that's what we'll start in 30 minutes from now which means we'll come back um at 11 35 just because by 7 34 that's too weird see you soon all right it's 11 35 um and this is when we're supposed to be back in action i'd love to see like some raised hands or people coming off camera to say hey that they're back when i see that we have a fair amount of people back look at all those raised i'll pretend they're smiling faces um then we can get back into oh a thumbs up that feels very good we will go ahead and get back to our agenda um as we discussed we spent some time tinkering with the slide right before this break slide trying to add in some of what we were hearing um so we kept maintaining for affordable energy rates for all oregonians um and then we took that promote equitable distribution of costs and benefits for all oregonians and then tried to to say that we acknowledge the varied perspectives on the appropriateness of using regulated utility rates to pay for benefits that do not contribute to maintaining the uniform delivery of safe and reliable service at just reasonable rates for all electricity customers so hopefully that kind of does the trick here as far as guiding principles where we're just asking that as we have these conversations people acknowledge that difference of opinion um and then a reminder that we are going with what i am now calling the spaghetti approach of all the recommendations that we hear we're not looking for to get consensus because we know we will not um and a lot of that will center around this particular point so mark has his hand up and then if anyone else has thoughts on our attempt to handle um those two it's the third and fourth bullet that we were trying to kind of thread a needle so like acknowledge the disagreement but maybe find some common or was mark just saying hey i'm back okay i will take silence as consent and move us on so i'll sit here quietly for like a few minutes and then or like i'll just count to 30 and then we can move on all right that's 30 seconds silence is consense i guess in this case so thank you for taking a look at that if anybody i mean they're not going to hear me say it but gets on late and wants to give feedback we can figure that out but uh we will go ahead and um move on stephanie if you're ready it was we have a hand up it happened sorry i'm sorry i just was getting my phone um i just wanted to mention someone had local versus global as a bullet and i think that that that's important i think the bullet you have is fine but i do think this is not just about utility rates you know as an oregonian i also feel like you know impacted communities in one can benefit from these projects but impacted communities in a different area that don't benefit from the same project they're the burden and i feel like someone rates that as it as a question so i do think it's important that local versus global benefits i just wasn't sure we had agreement on that which was the issue so maybe we could acknowledge the very perspectives as we put here and include acknowledge the varied perspectives on that bit yeah so just you know some a similar bullet around you know possible disagreement but that that's something that should be considered okay i think we can figure out how to weave that into that acknowledging variant perspectives piece thank you all right i will move us into the recommendations portion of our session first i wanted to show the work group um the different points that were raised in the forms submissions thank you to everybody for submitting and these are just exactly as they came so um they're you know just copied and pasted that's why they're all in quotes here i am not going to read through them word for word i just want you're gonna get this afterwards i'm just going to give you a high level of what's going on here so this first one is talking about um the fact that a lot of cous that are getting their power from bpa are already getting low carbon low cost energy and so they just want to think about the value proposition there next one is basically the same idea um of those low costs yeah they're not grouped they're just literally in the order in which things or at least that i copied and pasted and so project funding taking into account retail rate impacts this is kind of along the same lines of what we've been talking about in the guidelines um someone suggested re-capitalizing the small-scale energy loan program and targeting public entities so this one is dealing with the fact that a lot of uh the uh bpa territory they have limits on what they can put on the grid so just some paths forward and the want of a lot of these communities to produce more there we go and then this one it came um actually we",

        "text": " is what Loops back to the Department's requirement to explain uh the Public's opportunity to participate in the process and so again this is a little bit hard of to pull out a succinct issue statement so again we're trying to kind of pulled exactly what she said there um and we can go to Miss Gilbert's age three let's see okay all right so procedural questions and recommendations regarding whether public notice is accurately describe the issues and process on page one um so and yeah that's how we captured the issue statement um if Council wants to uh clarify an issue statement again request for contested case should have a short plane um issue statement so we did our best of capturing what it is however we were all um together uh on those DPO hearings and council's review of the DPO um Miss Gilbert provided oral testimony she requested that the record remained open because she was not aware that she could comment on condition revisions um in in the Pro on the draft proposed um and so um I feel like Council probably understands what the issue is and then has red reviewed her request for contested case this is just how I've captured it here so uh and again we miss Gilbert raised the issue on the record in the context of her not understanding that she could could comment on those she talked about one condition with the vegetation management plan but then again over here with the request for contested case um this is a a very lengthy request I do want to note that she did submit um the the proposed order staff reports a lot of the information is already part of the record so it made it a lengthy request but a lot of it is information that's already in the record but then there was additional information again that wasn't submitted on the DPO so we're not looking at that information to the extent that we are are understanding what the request is the question we're looking at does it raise an issue or factor law that affects council's determination that the facility with the amendment complies with the applicable laws and standards and so really um in the rule reference uh it's a little bit difficult because Miss Gilbert routes to a a requirement um that we're supposed to do as part of the hearing or as part of the notice um which I would say that doesn't that's not the threshold that we're looking at here for a contested case request that um and as provided in our response here uh the department feels like we've done did a sufficient response of uh meeting what has required us of us or and Beyond um in our rules the department really tries to reiterate multiple times uh at several steps during the process with opportunities for public participation are and what the scope of what the public May comment on um at council's review of the DPO and in response to Ms Gilbert's request to leave the record open we did pull up the notice of the contested case and it does indeed in the very beginning say what's the what's this amendment the amendment is adding these areas to the site boundary and also revising condition languages there's another area in the notice that specifies that I think part of Ms Gilbert's contention is the designation of what council's scope of review is is misleading the public to make it seem like they can only look at those areas added to the site boundary and not condition revisions but the reason why we include Council scope of review is that's kind of what your that's your the big question of what council is asking yourself in your review of the the orders or do these areas comply with the standards um but and I'd say also if anyone were to read the draft proposed order and the applicable sections where the department recommended revisions and amendments to um it was done in red font to easily um which is to to me it's evident that's part of the draft proposed order we have a whole section in the draft proposed order that gave a summary of what the revised conditions are and the basis for it each section provided findings and support for the condition revisions um and there was also the attachment which is the draft amended site certificate attached to the order which the notice looped back to as well as multiple times in the draft proposed um like that yeah it's um so I feel like it is or the department feels like it is there and open open to comment on um Council also we talked about this in your review of the comments um stop bqh raised concerns um with uh the the blasting plan the erosion and sediment control 1200 C or maybe we just talked about that um the vegetation management plan we talked or an uh helicopter use plan we actually talked about all of these the reasons behind and we went back to the rationale that we provided in the draft proposed order for those condition revisions um in response to stop b2hs um comments so so I I feel like we we visited that so we are saying No this does not raise a significant issue or fact or law that impacts council's previous findings um and then we do go through kind of a procedural history here of the areas where the depart where it was designated that site that revisions to the are open for comment we're dealing with then the request for contested case by Miss Gilbert on a procedural issue the failure to notify the public of ability to comment on site certificate condition revisions are there any comments or questions from Council counselor Condon thank you Vice chair how I'm wondering if you can pull up the notice uh the public notice that was given and I know we we reviewed it previously but if you could pull it up this I mean it seems to me the issue is related to the notice um there might be other underlying it's a little the request kind of completes several things it says failure to notice but then it also talks about requirements that we're supposed to do during the hearing but yes say say the notice so here's the notice of the draft proposed order uh so here in the summary amendment of site certificate language to some work support implementation and um let me go back to my staff reports I kind of I know I'll go back to that notice um councilmember content just uh presentation draft post order notice okay so page one right and so page two there was also uh Patrick had pointed something out that I didn't point out there and I don't recall what it was thank you Kelly um I wanted you to pull it up just to refresh my memory and I thought I remembered it at the top I mean the title is request for comments on the complete request for Amendment one and draft proposed order certainly speaks to the draft proposed order and the ability to comment as as I understand that notice okay which is the same for all of yeah councils any amendment in any any Amendment any revisions if it's part of the draft proposed order including and the attachment every Amendment um includes a draft amended site certificate attached to it it's all it's all open if it's part of the DPO it's it's it's pretty much open to count to to comment on um I think uh an aspect of Miss Gilbert's uh issue is her not being aware that she could comment on conditioned revisions but then taking it a step further is that and then the implications that uh the lack of the ability to then carry forward that those condition revisions may impact the entire facilities ability to comply with a standard or because she didn't know she could comment on condition revisions and revised conditions could apply to the entire facility and not just to these portions that that um taking away an opportunity to have a contested case on on those items but it's going back it's kind of looking at whether like the contention that we're then opening up the whole approved right thank you okay Council any additional questions okay then um do we have a motion someone's prepared to make let's check okay counselor buyer Mr Vice chair I move that the council deny the request for contested case on the procedural issue the failure to notify public of the ability to comment on site certification revisions because for the reasons provided in the Department's September 15 2023 staff report the issue requested does not raise a significant issue of fact or law that is reasonably likely to affect the council's determination on whether the facility with the change proposed by the amendment meets the applicable laws and Council standards included in chapter 345 divisions 22 23 and 24. okay we have a motion is there a second thank you counselor Devlin so um we've got a motion in a second uh secretary Cornett could you pull the council Richard Devlin hi hello Ken Howe yes and buyer yes Gordon Truitt yes Cindy condom yes motion carries Mr Vice chair thank you secretary Cornett so Ms tardy weather back to you thank you okay and now we're going to go on to Mr John Williams comment or request contested case request again I did my best to provide counsel our understanding of a uh short plane issue statement in the request I'm going to pull up Mr Williams request now um okay well I actually have his DPO comment as we remember Mr Williams provided oral testimony and then we recite received a Verbatim uh oops did I open it next um a Verbatim response to the comment um now uh so this is his draft proposed order comment so he has concerns so Mr Williams is an impacted landowner um primary primarily all the vast majority of it was from the route approved in the ASC there's a minor Road change segment as part of rfa1 on his um and uh I think that's maybe 280 feet long 216 I'd have to I'd have to look that up I believe that that's understanding Road segment so in his DPO comments he kind of he talks about some Geotech work um and his understanding that Idaho Power has been doing surveys but he hasn't been re hasn't received survey reports and then he identifies issues with his understanding of uh Tower locations and their impacts to Wetlands and then to also cultural resources now we know as part of request for Amendment one there aren't Towers it's just this small Road segment so really I think that these a lot of these issues are carried over from from the application these two specific resources that cultural resources identified here I believe are resources that were found as part of Sir the ongoing surveys that were done after Council approved the facility right so when it comes to cultural there's site access issues Idaho Power was able to do a lot of cultural surveys we have really long resource tables of everything found and then conditions again paraphrasing um that say you know as part of the section 106",

        "text": " plants will absorb the toxicity and uh make the seeds dangerous consume uh and you've just ruined rued a fire of that size is going to be so difficult to fight because you you're dealing with panels everywhere uh is it would be a a a nightmare if you don't know what a fire's going to do in this array in this area then you have no business discussing this as a renewable energy I was approached by multiple developers wanting to do this and as soon as they couldn't answer that question I said hey I'm I think I'm out not to mention the Absurd subsidies that they were getting this is everybody should know this is just a sham he said what do you want what do you want per acre per year said what do you want I said I don't know I'll take the current current panel dollar figure and I'll multiply it by three so I said $1,200 per acre per year he's like I think I can do that I'm like wow so this is all coming through the Biden administration's infrastructure Bill and I'm like wow what a waste to support something this strong that produces this little amount of electricity and potentially can damage a soil but then have you ever looked at the Oregon Department of EGS website how they're screaming about Acres being taken away from agriculture it's like do any of the agencies actually communicate back and forth they're literally saying this is a wreck we're losing too many acres too many valuable crop land Acres the the odoe over here is trying to get this all thousands of Acres used Sola uh so I don't I don't I don't I I just I don't get it I don't get it I don't understand the push I too thought about this agraval take so hey let's try to con configure a combination of propop land use where you have supported panel arrays you farm underneath it and so you maintain a more balance between the potential for weeds to be out of control you still can generate some electricity but everything has to be very very it's a very uh specific sort of landscape I'm talking about so I shared that with one of the developers he's like I can't do that he goes I know what you're talking about I can't do that I don't I really don't have the it's just it's too complex it's too much money to set up a a field that has rows of arrays but you actually can Farm successfully in between those that's too too far in the future for what I need to do today so I hope this makes sense to you because it doesn't make sense to me how could strip Farmland from producing what the world needs and then we could also put it in Jeopardy of long-term soil destruction from contamination from whatever's in not that I know that that's for sure but that nobody could assure me that there weren't risks with what comes out of and drips down from a fire nor could they tell me what would happen in the hail event that we had what in 95 I believe we had a hail storm that took down uh a lot of props um saw an Instagram post where a destroyed solar array so there you go it's like how short could this 2,000 acre solar farm be lifespan potentially I don't know but I appreciate you guys so much I really didn't come here intending to do this but I have firsthand experience and have thought about this and we're like this is financially more than we would ever make for a second on Dryland wheat but I'm like I can't I can't be the generation that puts something on our soil that damages it I don't want to I don't want to be that I don't want to have I don't want to make that mistake thank you Mr Myers thank you appreciate it um anyone else in the audience wanting to testify tonight come on forward state your name and address please cam don't go anywhere I talk your grazings uh Chris Rous R Au U 72 967 Strawberry Lane lexon Oregon I represent North Lex power and land and Farms so I may be the resident expert here because I do live in the middle of the wagon trail solar farm they're out my front door and my back door and if I had another door would be out there too so uh on the issue of fire first thing I want to say if you're a plann owner get involved with your developer which is what I do I take the first step we've had all these discussions about what they brought up tonight actually and we keep working on them all the time as far as fire at least on the development that's on our place this moment the land the developer has more to worry about fire from me than I do from them be ground doesn't burn but I get wheat fields that R around it they'll burn and we've had this discussion of future development what to do of some things about fire breakes erosion gravel roads things like that we can get in more detail if you need to um the other thing was um God dang it was fire breathing ah weeds so we do work uh proactively on the weeds weeds aren't usually an issue uh unless you let uh grow stuff in there then yeah there they'll be they could become an issue then it comes with a two-edged SW sword if you have a bunch of grass in there not only can weeds get in there they may not if you're doing your job but it also increases the fire risk on both sides of the fence that now I'm not opposed to having Gras into those things but in the right circumstances and I do have places that do that but you can work with your developer uh lastly I say is um as your resident expert if you got questions fine otherwise let's build the son of a and go okay okay thank you for your testimony anybody else in the room wishing to testify okay let's um Nancy could you WebEx uh Miss Kelly hail has her hand raised Miss hail I have unmuted your mic you are ready to comment hi thank you um first of all I want to say thank you to the energy siding Council um my comments tonight are in support of wagon trail solar my name is Kelly hail ke l l y last name hail h a l e we and I am a co-trustee with my brother Russell Kilkenny on the Kilkenny the first year of operation after Dad's passing can you hear me yes okay the first year of operation after Dad's passing in 2016 when we just had Farm ground we basically had no return on the investment the ground is a very fine syty Loom soil we have no access to water nor will we have any access to water the average yield in that area is close to 30 bels to the acre the price to of wheat in 1975 was similar to what it is this year land values are roughly $500 an acre for our ground versus irrigated ground which is roughly 12,000 an acre the first year after the turbine installation gave us roughly a return on investment of about 15% it allowed us to inre acreage as a matter of fact we let our CRP contract expire and that increased farmable ground on our property of another 700 we've seen a net gain in production from our relationship with next era they have been extremely productive Partners they've paid to clean up our property they're incredible stewards of the land also they've been very good to moral County they provided additional jobs and also sponsorships to local events I just want to say thank you in advance for any support you might give to this project thank you Miss Hae thank you let us go through the rest first um Nancy any others on the WebEx there are no other hands raised at this time why don't you check the phone then I have no phone ends right now okay make it quick it concerns the uh money that we're talking about on OSU yeah oh Chris R again Strawberry Lane liing Oregon can was brought up about the OSU goal three stuff yeah and the reason that's hit dry land is because farming because that's where the stuff's being taken out of it's hitting uh to the dryland farming and so all that directed to his research on farming trying to be more productive um and then I think there may be some money actually going towards it could be all I better not say that I'll let you them talk about but there could be some other money directed something else could help farmers there too so that's why it's hit it that way it's on Range ground then yeah yeah look at okay thank you are there any council members that would like to provide comments to the Department or the certificate holder councelor Byer um thank you all for coming out this evening and um just to staff I'll be really interested to see the Marl County letter on the goal 3 exception and I know um Odo staff has worked really hard on trying to understand mitigation for loss and not even total loss but for this change of use of farm grounds so I think we're all working to try to understand what the best mitigation looks like in this situation so thank you all thank you councelor Byer anyone else counselor Imes thank you chair uh Kitty Imes for the record and um I do have some comments regarding the Wildfire mitigation plan um specifically exhibit V attachment V1 on page 11 there's some comments in here about the plan will be updated by the applicant every five years and so I have some concern about that um our last public meeting we talked quite a bit about wildfire mitigation plans and um striving for a more cohesive um approach so that we see these plans becoming um just better I guess in general um and also um better you know more frequent inspections and I did see in this one that they had actually put that information in there so that's um but again um also want to reiterate that um you know speaking with the First Responders in this area is really really important um all those fire districts that are impacted by this project um reaching out to them and um also you know what their capacity levels are and how are they going to respond to the fire when it happens because it will happen um we need to know that they have been engaged um and that and what their comments are because we don't ever get to hear from or from what I gather so far I haven't heard from any local fire responders um to these matters so I'm very curious about that and um also wanted to ask this is",

        "text": " decision the board of county commissioners needed to define and adopt by early 2023. These next few slides are going to be fairly wordy, so I apologize. There's just a lot of information that is out there. So the identified community needs as listed in the report were part of a larger conversation that was happening between the consultant team, jurisdictional team to establish this engagement approach. And so we worked with espousal and espousal worked with crew to identify what these funding priorities should look like specifically for Washington county. And so, thanks to the amazing work by that consulting team, we're able to identify community needs using large and small group facilitated dialogues, surveys, polls and bilingual interpretation and material translation. The identified community needs were distilled by espousal strategies, reaffirmed by community partners and presented to I'm not going to read through all of those two, but please feel free to take a second and look at those for a second. Super significant. As we talk about funding priorities, it was looking at kind of the overarching what is needed from community as we're going through this pandemic recovery and these funding recommendations are how we should do that to fill those properties, if that makes sense. A more detailed description of community needs organized by sector is included in the appendix of the final report, which is attached to the council packet. The sector's highlighted in the recovery needs discussion were health, economic development, workforce and housing and wraparound services. These were directly intended for Washington county, but I will highlight them in the context of the city of Hillsborough's Arkham investment before looking at what's after looking at what the county's proposed investments were, question markus sure so economic development can have a prior and so in Norway, when we think of it. But does this also then include things such as arts, culture, entertainment? Is that also included? I can tell you exactly what was included. It was trailing opportunities for entrepreneurs and small business owners, equitable access to resources for small businesses, efforts to help close the wealth gap and consider reparations. Continue to support technical assistance and access to capital grants, stipends, not just loans, nonprofits, capacity building, funds for grant writing, economic justice, racial wealth building, generational wealth building or procurement exposure like my people's markets, opportunities for micro enterprise and then safety as a considerable source. Hi, this is Councillor Alcare. So some of my question has to do with about reporting and movement of funds from county to the city or county to nonprofits and ensuring that the reporting was going right and that people were getting paid. And so can you talk a little bit about that, Marcus? So, yes and no. So, yes, in the sense that one of the lessons learned that I'm going to be talking about as part of this report is about how we were clarifying what exactly it is that we were doing. This was all very new. This was a new endeavor for all three jurisdictions. And in terms of the no, I think I'm going to pass it to Simone because Simone was there and was running the budgeting for all of this. Thank you. So the ARPA funding was actually federal funding that came directly to the city. We will talk a little bit more about what the county intended to do with its funding. There's some noteworthy information, if you don't mind holding a little bit longer. Marcus will talk a little bit about some of the challenges with Washington county and their tranche two funding. Sure, Marcus listed some of the economic opportunities, types of economic opportunities, but I kind of didn't hear mentorships and apprenticeships, skill development and these kinds of things that I think are in demand and there they are in the future. Is that a separate sort of subjecting category? If I'm understanding the question that may have fallen in a workforce, and I can list out those things that were under workforce if that would be helpful. It looks like you're going to get there, so that's great. Okay. I had slides for these, but I hid them so I have all the information for workforce. It was affordable and accessible child care through a multi sector lens, affordable transportation, affordable housing, access to technology to close the digital divide, education, training and resources for low wage and service industry workers. From there, opportunities for community outreach and relationship building, tech equipment, language services, programs for single parents and access to training, education, jobs, and let me just. Councilor, sorry if I don't answer your question. Please yell at me again so I can make sure I can. All right, so looking at the outcomes from. Looking at the outcomes from the. From Washington county standpoint, from January to March of 2023, the Washington County Board of County Commissioners met and adopted a framework for ARPA funding applications. There were cbos provided public comment to the board of county Commissioners, many of which are representative of historically and currently marginalized communities that viewed the funding proposal as not reflective of community needs identified through this CRU engagement process. And so some of those investment outcomes which were presented to CRU by Washington county, our workforce development, small business support, broadband, public health mandates, those three that have stars next to them in the front were ones that kind of directly relate back to those identified needs. Then there was also investment in effective ARPU management, revenue replacement, strategic planning, and congregate facilities. Congregate facilities projects. The congregate facilities projects included significant investments in correctional facilities, and that was really the piece that relates from whose perspective relate to us. And so crew. Marcus, can I just back you up for a second? Can I come back and ask my question again? Sure. Okay, so. And I'll narrow this down. And I don't see an intentional example of wrongdoing. I'm just asking about that. Something had changed in the way that the work was getting done between the county and nonprofits. I think it has improved. I'm just asking you to speak to that just a little bit, if you can. I'm not sure I fully understand. Is there possibility. Is that pertaining to accountability? Is that what you're talking about? Well, in a way, yes. These outcomes. But if that's what you're referring to, just asking. There are at least three nonprofits that I can think of that got funding for housing from the county. Things went down. They got staff, they had programming. Yes. This is all new. I'm just asking for an example of what happened between the county and nonprofits as much as what we know and what's in our control for Hillsboro. Thank you, Councillor Alpier, for clarifying that. I'm sorry, Simone. And if that doesn't make sense, I can withdraw the question. No, no, not at all. I think maybe slightly unrelated to this particular presentation, but a really good question, if I take what you mean around housing, that is likely more connected to the supportive housing services. That's just one of the examples. Okay. Okay. Yes. That's just one of the examples. I'm just saying a nonprofit? Yes, there were, certainly, and I'd like Marcus to actually answer the question, if he can. Okay, I'll do my best. And like I said, I'm not sure I fully grasp it at this point, but while we were looking at all the work that was done through the ARPA funding that was done by this community engagement project, it was really looking at how we can advance community engagement through the use of this fund. There was larger amounts of ARPA money that was being allocated and has been allocated. There's been some really amazing work that's been done with that funding, both the city of Hillsborough and with the county, but that's not necessarily what this portion of the ARPA. I understand, but I appreciate you answering my question. Okay, thanks. All right, so finishing up on this outcomes piece, the engagement outcomes that were kind of reported to me, to us through espousal, about what happened with that first section that transit funding allocation was, there was a disappointment about perceived lack of transparent communication. There was requests for more information around the board of county commissioner's decision, and there was a demand for more responsive and accountable decision making in the future when it comes to allocation of these large amounts of funding. And in May of 2023, after that decision was made, county staff did attend the committee to share the county's perspective on outcomes. So there was some response from that, bringing it back to the city's ARPA investments. I want to put out that all these numbers are approximate, but while the crew recommendations did not directly inform these cities, the city's ARPA investments, it is encouraging to see the alignment in the way that the city is utilizing ARPA funds with the needs of community, acknowledging the hard work and intentionality by the city to learn from and be a part of the community. I think coming in as a community manager like that, that feels good to see that and to see where those alignments are. So looking at these numbers here, these top four, I kind of connect to the identified outcomes, identified needs. Sorry, I. And so about 50% of our ARPA investments went to things directly reflected in the details that they need. So health, economic development, workforce, and housing services. So those asterisks highlight those. Public participation in government processes is a foundational component of a strong democracy and a pathway for healthier communities. Washington county, the city of Hillsboro and City of Beaverton solicited input from community partners to establish to meet a high standard for their effective approaches to developing meaningful and effective community based policies and procedures. So to begin, an evaluation was conducted of tools and approaches currently being used to establish a foundation for policy recommendations. Foundational elements included definitions for community needed for frameworks, spectrum of community engagement",

        "text": " of energy siting Division I would also just like to announce in the room today we have representatives from the state language project including David Waller and their resident and State Attorney from stole Reeves Miss Sarah Stover hurt us as chair Grail has already mentioned this agenda item will include three parts I'll do a brief overview first of the facility and the amendment request and then chair Fair will open a hearing on the transfer request after that concludes then we will go through your review of the transfer request and any issues raised on record so our overview this transfer request applies to the state line win project site certificate this site certificate is a little unique in that it does include two certificate holders and within the site certificate itself it allocates facility components into two the units are separated by geography and they have names and site certificates State Line one and two is one unit name and then Van Sickle two is another nickname and then the site certificate includes separate and distinct conditions for these two and then assigns the certificate holders to each of one of those units so the two certificate holders are LLC subsidiaries of nextera energy resources those two LLCs are FPL energy Van Sickle 2 and FPL state line to Inc the scope of this transfer request applies to the Van Sickle tube facility components which are owned by FPL energy State Line tubing hopefully that makes sense okay so under the state line win project in totality it is an existing operational facility uh um 223 megawatt wind and located in Umatilla County so on the screen is a picture of the site boundary the larger polygon on the western side I guess uh is state line one and two and then this other polygon is the Van Sickle two unit and just to note that that is the unit that was being repowered in the last couple of the site certificate was originally issued by Council in 2001 and has subsequently been amended seven times so this would be the Eighth Amendment and again the request for transfer is a request for transfer of site certificate ownership for one of the certificate from existing certificate holder FPL energy state line to Inc to band sickle to wind LLC okay so before we roll into the transfer hearing that um just a reminder so fsec rules require a site certificate Amendment if there's a change in ownership of the facility or the certificate holder and in this instance we have a change in ownership of the facility facility unit area as we've discussed the an amendment to transfer is distinct from the council's sort of normal type a b or even C process that has its own procedural requirements in oer chapter 345 division 27 or 400. um where it only triggers two of counts of Standards generally unless you're a CO2 emitting facility you don't see those very much anymore and those are the organizational expertise in retirement and financial Assurance standards so a transfer request has to include the information requirements that go with those standards as well as a certification from the new owner that they agreed to abide by the terms and conditions of the existing site certificate in place so Council scope of review here would be to determine whether the new owner has demonstrated an ability to comply to meet those two standards and that the new owner has the ability to lawfully possess or control the the site of the there are not many procedural steps in a transfer request it's really that we the department has to issue a notice upon receipt and notice of a comment period and of a hearing and then Council has to conduct a hearing before they make a that is why we're here today and so now I will hand it back over to chair Grail I believe we've already opened the hearing so I will just step to the crossover to where you were before apologies for us so I'm gonna head without you there so just so I get straight back out do I need to do anything different um no I think just uh basically defer probably to Nancy if we have any um anybody in the audience we would like to comment um and then anybody There's an opportunity if the certificate holder or the representative would like to comment they can as well all right so we'll look over to Nancy so just to make it ever been aware I think he would like to raise your hand in your you're going to look at that bottom of the right of the main window this is set up by the consider Amazon parts are symptoms and that will raise your hand if you can improve it again if you are participating on the phone press star three you under your telephone keypads underneath your hand and then we'll Press Start free again this time thank you we will call out for a moment would you like to come on up while we are waiting for anyone on the globe we have someone in the room who wishes to speak thank you madam chair good morning Council staff my name is David Lawler I'm the regional director for development for nextera energy resources uh in your fine State and this transfer is is important as we're going through our repowering construction phase which just is a way of an update looking like it will push into 2023 but not very long to 2023 and so um yeah we're appreciative of it and then we hope that we can come to the conclusion on the matter thank you thank you we have no one else on the phone according to Nancy uh wishing to speak this last call are there any other individuals in person on the WebEx or on the conference line who wish to testify or make comments on this transfer thank you Nancy so um again with Hodges for I don't know what time we need to allow maybe one moment okay just to be sure all right sure well just for the record no written comments came in thank you okay well at this time there is no additional testimony so the transfer hearing on the request for amendment to transfer the Summit Ridge when Farm site certificate is closed the time is now 9 so the hearing is closed so that gets us over to us so Sarah has come back to us and uh we will turn things back over to Sarah esterson senior policy thank you very much okay again so now we'll move into your review of the transfer request and as a friendly reminder the transfer request is proposing a new owner a new certificate holder in the site certificate for the basically two facility components um and that new owner would be Van Sickle to win LLC just to highlight some of the information that you were provided in the transfer request it included attachment A1 which is the certificate of formation from the secretary of state state of Delaware dated April 29 2022 in attachment A2 we were provided a certification from the new owner agreeing to abide by the terms and conditions of the existing site certificate and the firms that assets would be transferred over to them and then attachment A3 is an organ registration with the Oregon Secretary of State of the LLC those are required in rule and just affirming that they were provided and included what the rule can you brief overview of the procedural um for this transfer request there's a little bit more history before the the start date but um we received a formal notification of the certificate holder's intent to transplant on November 22nd 2022 that identified who who the new owner would be and identified December 2022 as the pending transfer date then we received the formal request on November 28th we then issued our notice of receipt of the transfer request of a 10-day comment period and of the December 16th hearing that notice was issued on December 6th just conducted the transfer hearing on December 16th and then your review and potential decision is on the same day okay again we um we have been monitoring today if any comments were received up until the close of the hearing and concurrent we did not receive any written comments during the comment for a review of an amendment to transfer there's two standards that are under review council's organizational expertise and retirement and financial Assurance standards and then if applicable the CO2 standards would also it's the case for this one facility okay so now we're going to review the organizational expertise and the ability of the new owner to satisfy the the organizational expertise has basically four components it requires Council to find that the new owner has the ability to operate the facility in a manner that protects public health and safety they have the ability to operate the facility in compliance with site certificate conditions all other applicable requirements and that they have the ability to restore the site to a useful non-hazardous condition so some facts that were presented in the transfer request about the new owner they are a Project Specific limited liability company fully owned by nextera energy Resources LLC which is the same structure as the existing certificate holder it's just a new LLC the new owner and certificate holder have requested in the transfer that Council rely on the organizational expertise of its parent and then offer three jurisdictional facilities where there's this LLC to parent relationship and that is the Wheat Ridge renewable energy facility too the original energy facility three and then the state line win project okay and then I just wanted to give you a little a few details about those three projects where again the certificate holder is an llc's wholly owned subsidiary by nextera so using those experiences and structures to say this would be equivalent Wheat Ridge 2 was constructed in 2020 it's a 200 megawatt win facility in Morrow County it was constructed in about 12 months operational by December during that time frame up until today no violations have been issued to that Facility by fsec or any other state we have not received any complaints through pre-construction all the way into operation related to site certificate complaints we were made aware of a complaint for the Wheat Ridge tree facility at the county level that was we believe is outside of council jurisdiction it has to do with um sort of annoyance of light Flicker at Night by the flashing on the turbines but we have been working with nextera and asking if they respond to the County's concerns and they have been very responsive so just pointing that again as experience with the LLC to parent structure where to date for that project we've had success the Wheat Ridge renewable energy facility three is a 50 megawatt solar facility in Morrow County it was kind of started Construction in 2021 and was completed by 2022 a similar situation where we had no incidents",

um all of you here when the punctuality award because it is nine o'clock on the dot we are just going to give folks another minute or two to amble in and then we're going to start the meeting so hang tight good morning everyone I think we're going to go ahead and get started Linda can you begin reporting the meeting please thank you I hope that's recording great uh good morning everyone my name is Rebecca Smith I'm a senior Analyst at Oregon Department of energy or Odo and I am our subject matter expert on all things hydrogen so today there should be uh an agenda available um online on the webpage where we included information about how to register for this meeting uh Jessica perhaps you can drop that link in the chat in case you haven't seen it um the goal of today's meeting is to bring Folks up to date on what's happening around a potential Pacific Northwest application for a regional clean hydrogen Hub uh so Odo has teamed up with business Oregon in this endeavor and so you'll hear from both of us today uh I want to introduce some folks from Odo who are on the line so we have Linda Ross who is online and you can message her privately if you'd like she is handing all of the technical matters today and then we also have Jessica Rikers who is going to be helping me in keeping an eye on uh folks with their hands up um and you know keeping the discussion guided and I'll get into a little bit more of how the meeting is going to run here in just a second so so yeah so the agenda is um we're gonna All I'm gonna do our introductions business Oregon is gonna say a few words and then I'm going to talk about what the regional clean hydrogen Hub opportunity is and I'm not going to go into a ton of detail in there in that there's a lot of information out there publicly and if that's an area that you're not as up to date as you'd like then by all means you can reach out um to me or to the renewable hydrogen Alliance uh and I'm happy to to walk you through that in Greater detail uh because I'd really like to spend more time on you know what I think is the meat of today's work which is trying to give you as much Insight on what's happening at the Pacific Northwest hydrogen Association as possible and um we're gonna have a guided discussion uh because we'd really like to hear from um about how Odo can best represent Oregon interests on the executive board at the Pacific Northwest hydrogen Association and which I'll think I'm going to start referring to as the association uh today and then um you know get your feedback on what you'd like to see in a hub in general so Odo if you don't know us we're the state's energy office um we have um a mission uh that we've recently updated through some strategic planning I'm not going to read all of this um but basically we're here to provide um you know a central repository of data about energy and a big part of the work that we do is education and technical assistance and so today uh for the meeting how we'd like to run it is we uh have panelists which is essentially me and business Oregon and then attendees and we have some Community agreements that we were exposed to at another meeting and we found them a really useful way to frame how we'd like everyone to approach today uh and so these are here you know to be present and ready to learn to be respectful to others um and you know especially remember the idea that learning often happens outside of our comfort zones uh so to listen uh to learn first and then to supply information or perspective second and as I mentioned Linda Ross is here for all your technical issues and please apologies in advance for any hiccups for example I know that getting the registrations done today um for today were a little bit you know we had some technical issues there I apologize WebEx is not the most user-friendly platform I'll just leave it at that so the objective of today's Workshop uh as I said is to share information about what's going on um around this Hub opportunity and really to hear your questions uh that we might be able to answer today or that we might take back to the executive board at the association and to really also hear your feedback um so there's uh first I'm going to give um a presentation uh first we're gonna hear from business Oregon and then I'm going to give a presentation during that presentation uh absolutely please uh feel free to ask clarifying questions about the content I'm going over and you can do that one of two ways you can uh throw it into the chat um or you can raise your hand and Jessica will call on you I'm also going to stop every few slides and see if there are any clarifying questions and we'd like to hold off on the discussion until after the presentation is over I've tried to keep it relatively short so you don't have to listen to me talk and then when we get to that discussion um we do have some discussion questions that were included in the agenda those are really a jumping off point and you know we need not hold the discussion to those topics specifically so there is an opportunity to move Beyond them so during the discussion uh if you have a question or a comment that you want to make uh you can use the raise hand function as mentioned Jessica Rikers is our moderator and she'll call on you now one way that that might hinder kind of an organic discussion is if you have if we're discussing a specific issue and you want to address that issue specifically as opposed to moving on to another issue then we'll ask that um that you make that clear um in the Fung in the in the chat you know say I want to talk about this specifically uh we're trying to balance keeping you know keeping it from becoming kind of a free-for-all where we don't get to hear anyone because we're hearing from everyone at the same time but also to facilitate discussion um so we'll see how that works and then absolutely I'm your point person for this discussion so and all things related to The Hub at Odo so if you have any uh you know if you wish to follow up with me afterwards please don't hesitate to reach out um WebEx everyone's favorite platform um there are if you're not familiar with um I envy you uh so there are a couple of different raised hand uh upper options you can do it down here um at the bottom with the reactions there's a raise hand option there's a second place you can do it which is here if you look at that participant list and you see yourself you should be able to raise your hand um we are using the chat functionality today so you can ask a specific question in there um or you know when we're in the discussion you can also say Hey you know don't neglect me I want to talk about the specific issue we're asking everyone to keep their microphones off unless um you can have your camera on or off uh leave that up to you and so first um I would like to give it over to our friends at business Oregon uh Mark are you are you here

is the state Economic Development agency I just want to be brief this morning and say hello to everyone and let you know that we're happy to be here as a co-sponsor of this effort with Odo although definitely Odo is in the lead on this so go to Rebecca first and she knows a lot more on this topic than I do um just a little bit about our role and how we might be able to contribute I'm part of our Innovation and Entrepreneurship team we're the team that's always looking at what is going to be coming next for Oregon's economy where can we help emerging early stage businesses or new technologies uh get a hold in Oregon to our state's economic Advantage we all in addition to the Innovation side of things we also have Regional staff we have recruitment staff we have infrastructure people we have business finance people all of which can be brought to bear on particular projects we have believe and active recruitment project related to hydrogen as we speak so this is a real thing now for us not just theoretical so whenever opportunities come up we will draw on our variety of expertise across the agencies to help however we can so happy to be here happy to contribute how I can if anybody who has follow-up questions about business to Oregon let me know I'll drop my email in the chat and you can reach out to me whenever you'd like but thanks for joining and thank you Mark uh business Oregon has been an incredible help in terms of getting this off the ground and then certainly helping us identify uh folks in Oregon who might be interested to be here today so I want to talk first about the the regional clean hydrogen Hub opportunity in general when the infrastructure bill passed the federal infrastructure bill in 2021 that included 8 billion dollars in funding for what were called Regional clean hydrogen hubs we've heard now a few Communications from usdoe about what this Grant opportunity is going to look like they had an RFI last year um and then they've had another RFI this February and then they had a notice of intent this summer and where we're at with it is that we're waiting on the actual funding opportunity announcement or foa to drop so we've started to hear some details along the way from doe about what it's going to look like but of course they've said this could change at any moment so we're all on tensor hooks waiting for that foa to really know what the opportunity will specifically look like however some things are coming into view that seem like they're gonna they're gonna be the case so for example uh we've heard that it looks like uh there's the possibility for 500 million um to one billion dollars per Hub um that's a lot of money and this is all part of the Doe's hydrogen shot so they've got uh this goal of getting to one dollar per one kilogram of clean hydrogen in one decade so that's their one one one goal and whereas in Oregon for example Odo has been working on a renewable hydrogen doe approaches this uh technology agnostic uh they're looking",

        "text": "so my clock now says nine o'clock um i see we have about six people in addition to uh the odo staff so i think i'll wait one more minute to see if we have a few more people join us and then we'll get started so thank you for joining us and we'll begin shortly okay we still have a few more people joining so i'm gonna wait just a few more seconds before we start okay it's 902 so i think i will begin good morning my name is wendy simons with the oregon department of energy and i am a rules making coordinator at odo and the hearing officer for today uh just a few words about how this hearing will uh kind of the sequence of events how it will be organized so i'll start with a few introductory remarks and after that my colleague rob delmar will give a brief overview of the then i will say a few words about the draft rules and then after a few formalities and remarks about how the rulemaking process will work and the various deadlines etc we will open up the floor for uh again good morning my name is wendy simons with the oregon department of and i am the hearing officer for today and uh on behalf of my colleagues i'd like to thank everybody for attending and participating in the hearing this hearing is being recorded to maintain a permanent record today is january 26 2022 the time is approximately 903 the public hearing is being held online and all attendees are participating so materials for the hearing including the draft rules are located on the odo website so oregon.gov and then if you follow these tabs in order that's the get involved tab and then the community renewable energy grant program and this is a rulemaking for program so rob could you move to the next slide and we'll say a few words about using or oh sorry first we have uh our statement for the oregon department of energy for those of you who might be new to working with odo we've got our department mission here and a brief synopsis of the what we do and our main functions so the oregon department of energy helps oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable energy system we advance solutions to shape an equitable clean energy transition protect the environment and public and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for current and future so next slide please rob so this is an overview of some of the functions in webex and a few things in particular to point out along the bottom i think everybody uh except maybe a few of the panelists and myself at this point are heberger is our host she has the ability to mute and unmute people so when we get to the um comment portion and also if people have questions at the end um you can uh raise your hand and see if i can yes there's some information down at the bottom under reactions where you can raise your hand and you can also use the chat function to communicate with us and just a one brief tip make sure that you're sending your chat to um either to everyone or if it's specifically about issues with your connectivity or wanting to give a you could send it to the panelists or to the host and then she will know to unmute you um and another tip on that mute button if you are unmuted it will display in a green color um we know sometimes people don't catch that and they might be talking and things that they didn't intend for for everybody or didn't realize that they were still not unmuted so if it's green then you're unmuted and you can be heard by everybody else the list of participants are over on the right as well as attendees um at some point i was planning to ask everybody to please use the chat to just say who you are and who you are working with or who you're affiliated with uh just to identify yourself for uh the record because we we do keep a um i mean we've got a long list of people i'm right now i'm seeing 28 attendees so it would be great for people to identify yourself in the chat and that will help help us and help each other and help us with record so i'm looking to see if there's anything else to make sure to tell everybody but i think those are the main main points so uh rob if you want to go ahead and flip or to the next slide that might be the beginning of your slides of your yes so um at this point my colleague rob delmar i'll hand it over to him and he'll give a program overview thanks wendy i'm rob del mar and i'm a senior policy analyst with oregon department of energy and i'm going to go through a few slides for a quick overview of the program i think that for the attendees of this if you've already read through the rules you're probably pretty familiar with this but we wanted to provide a little bit of background so right out of the bill house bill 2021 we get sort of the purpose of the and the purpose as stated in the bill is offset costs of planning and developing community renewable energy projects support projects in traditionally underserved communities promote small-scale community renewable energy projects and in this case small scale means less than 20 megawatts and finally provide direct benefits to communities across oregon by improving energy resilience creating local jobs promoting economic development and offsetting local energy costs this program is a little different from previous programs that we've run here at odo and one of the differences is that this program is only open to public bodies in order to apply for the program you have to be one of the entities on this tribes counties municipalities special government bodies such as ports and irrigation districts and also the public universities consumer-owned utilities and the bill has a provision that it's not available in cities greater than 500 000 people and so it's not available in portland and that was essentially a nod to the portland clean energy fund which is able to provide funding for similar types of projects within portland and so the idea is to take the funds for this program and really spread them around the state and focus more on the rural areas there's two budget carve-outs within the 50 or more of the grants have to be awarded for projects that are serving qualifying communities and 50 or more have to be for projects that are energy resilience and so the energy resilience projects would include a renewable energy generation system such as solar but also include some sort of backup storage component like batteries so that it could provide services within the community in the event of a power outage qualifying communities have a definition the bill and within our rules and this is how they are described in the bill communities of color communities experiencing lower incomes tribal rural and coastal communities communities with limited infrastructure and communities traditionally underrepresented in public process and adversely harmed by environmental and health hazards and this includes seniors youths persons with disabilities so as you can see it's a fairly broad list for what is a qualifying and a lot of communities will presumably be able to check several of these boxes within their as they describe that the communities being served and that will help them to um qualify for that budget farve out and also for some priority scoring which is um described in the rules and in the bill the rules that we've all read leading up to today were put together by odo staff with a lot of help from an advisory committee and the advisory committee was described in house bill 2021 and we spent most of last summer recruiting members and we ended up with a really great list of folks to help us with this we have representatives from tribes from cities counties representatives from environmental justice organizations i won't go through the entire list now but we did have a lot of help from some very qualified folks we'd like to once again say thank you to our advisory committee members for all of the help in developing these draft the timeline for the program started late summer early fall last year where we recruited our advisory committee and we started to work on program design and from september really through now we've been working on the program rules and from now until march we're going to also be doing community outreach and continuing to add staff within the department of energy to administer the program and in march that's when we're going to officially launch launch the program by issuing opportunity announcements the opportunity announcements will be for four different categories of grants two of the categories are for planning planning energy resilience projects and planning renewable energy only projects those grants are up to a hundred thousand dollars and can cover up to a hundred percent of project cost and we will also have two categories of construction grants energy resilience grants can get awards up to one million dollars covering up to a hundred percent of project cost and construction grants for renewable energy systems only with no resilience also up to a million dollars but limited to 50 percent of project cost and grants will be rewarded awarded on a competitive basis and will include performance agreements and time limits for completing the this is a graphic version of a kind of simplified flow through the program and so this is what the application process will look like this is described within the rules but we wanted to go through briefly the process so it will start with an opportunity that opportunity announcement will lead to applications being submitted to the we will complete an eligibility review where we're verifying that the applicant is an eligible applicant one of the public bodies and also that they have submitted a project with an eligible technology has to be renewable energy and energy resilience once we confirm eligibility the prod the applications will go through a competitive review and that will lead us to being able to announce the awards for that particular set of opportunity announcements and those projects that get an award will then enter into a performance agreement with the department of energy once that performance agreement is in they complete the project or in the case of planning grants they would complete the print the planning of the project we would go through a review process once the project is completed which would include on-site inspections for construction grants and if the on-site inspection final meet all of the requirements within the performance then we would make the grant payment and it's very similar for planning grants except that we would not have the on-site inspection and with that i will pass it back over to thanks rob um so i think as rob uh the process that we came up with in the program design working together with the advisory committee is very closely reflected in the rules but just a few words about",

        "text": " is aware that re-vegetation is uh commonly and in this case is addressed under the fish and wildlife habitat standard but there's also a you know as a backstop or additionally supplementing to a mandatory condition that requires re-vegetation on the site um the council also has um well under oar 345 2500 6 sub 10 is a a requirement that the council includes as conditions in the site all representations and and supporting all representations in the application and supporting record the council deems to be binding commitments made by the as necessary to avoid or minimize a potential impact so this is interesting because in the presentation there are conditions that appear that don't necessarily weren't necessary to meet the standard but were an applicant's representation to minimize or avoid an impact uh does council want me to us like just want me to like continue or do you want me to pause at the end of like does council have any questions about the general standard of review helen this is marcy and i'd advise you to pause and give folks a chance so we don't have to go backwards sure thank you this council have any questions about the general standard of review thank you subsections one and two of the council's organizational expertise standard require that the applicant demonstrate its ability to design construct and operate the proposed facility in compliance with the council's standards and site certificate conditions and in a manner that protects public health safety and its ability to restore the site to a useful non-hazardous condition under the standard the council may consider an applicant's experience and past performance in constructing operating and retiring other facilities in determining its compliance with the organizational expertise standard to evaluate whether the applicant demonstrated an ability to comply with the council's organizational expertise standard the proposed order provides an evaluation of the applicant's relevant with constructing and operating similar facilities and considers whether or not there's any regular citations regulatory citations have been received for those under this standard the council department recommends conditions one through five be imposed to meet this standard so as noted earlier obsidian solar center llc is a project specific llc um as applicant and all so therefore relies on the organizational expertise of its two parent companies obsidian renewables and lindgren development to demonstrate compliance with the oh to demonstrate compliance with the so obsidian renewables one of the parent has developed or financed 24 pv facilities and has permitted three other solar facilities in addition to the obsidian solar center that are currently in development in lake county these facilities are fossil lakes or solar which is a 10 megawatt solar facility which is also in north lake county airport solar which is a 40 47.25 megawatt facility airport solar which is a 10 megawatt um oh and uh airport solar which is a 10 megawatt solar facility that's down in the lakeview area which is south lake lindgren development it is a subsidiary of swinnerton incorporated and through its subsidiaries swinnerton builders in swinnerton renewable energy has constructed operated and maintained solar projects that total over three the applicant notes that the facility is likely to be operated by swinnerton renewable or uh its affiliate okay uh so the department recommends organizational expertise which requires reporting to the department any changes in the parent company that could impact the certificate holders access to resources or expertise of the parent organizational expertise three four and five um relate to um compliance for whichever contractor they select to construct and operate and retire the facility that that subcontractor and contractor comply with all laws and terms of the site certificate whereas organizational expertise condition four um highlights um which council has been kind of briefed on this for other facilities um it is the or the ability for the department to to issue a notice of violation if any terms of the site certificate are violated and then recommended organizational expertise condition 5 includes a 72-hour reporting requirement for any conditions or circumstances or incidents of incidences or circumstances that violate the terms or conditions of the site certificate underneath the council's organizational expertise standard there's also a requirement requirement for the applicant to demonstrate its ability to restore the site to a useful non-hazardous condition and this is uh discussed and met under the council's um retirement and financial assurance um and does council have any comments or questions about the organizational expertise standard i'm not sure who can see um this is cindy yeah cindy condon um thank you um with respect to the organizational expertise condition um it seems to me there's judgment there um and i know this has to do with the standard so the makes a judgment about a change that could impact they're not required to report in each every change it's just if they determine that it could impact it's up to them is that that's correct i i you know i'm i'm just i'm kind of curious why they just are not required to report any change to avoid the judgment yeah yeah no i guess uh that is one i'm pulling up my proposed order here so i can look at the exact wording of that condition yes i i do see how that could be that judgment in there i don't know if that is the intent of the condition um you know i'm just actually i'm looking up here oh shall report to the department any such as those examples so actually i think that that so here we actually took out that could that yes my my slide my powerpoint presentation slide isn't reflective of what the condition says in okay all right i there was against my question no that's a good that's a great observation thank you sorry about that and just one more um different subject so um the other projects that you identified in lake county i think are much smaller projects than this one correct uh yeah yes i don't have um like the acreage but if we're just looking at the megawatt yeah generating yes they're they're less less generating capacity so you can infer that they are a smaller footprint yeah and so i guess um with respect to expertise um are there in is this their um i think i had a conversation that this was their largest is it largest by um amount i think the largest one you mentioned was 47 megawatts maybe yeah that and and what a much larger project means in terms of expertise i'm if that presents uh any concern with size well underneath the standard the looks at you know several items which one of these in here you know the applicant represents that it has not received any regulatory citations for any of these other solar facilities we also look at whether or not an um has uh conducted or completed mitigation for other similar projects oftentimes for say a local or smaller non-asset jurisdictional facilities there may be other requirements as part of a conditional use permit or as other agreements an applicant has um with other agencies or governments um but uh as council's aware council we have pretty substantial mitigation so in the proposed order um whereas there aren't you know finite examples of completing mitigation projects for these other um what the department points to are the mitigation obligations that are required in site certificate conditions to be able to comply um with uh other council standards and that those mitigation obligations would demonstrate that applicant does have the organizational expertise at least without regard for this particular facility and the impacts and mitigation for such a large solar facility okay thank you um any other questions does it look like any okay thank you the council structural standard requires that the council uh evaluate whether the applicant has adequately characterized the potential seismic geological and soil hazards of the site and whether the applicant can design engineer and construct the facility to avoid dangers dangers to human safety and the environment um the information that supports the council structural standard is found in exhibit h of the and in the review of exhibit h the department works uh very closely with the oregon department of geolog geology and mineral industries or dogami um in the review of this information um i just want to note that there are no active or mapped faults or seismic hazards at the site and the primary hazards that we talk about in the proposed order are um which relate to soil impacts and then these are discussed further in the subsequent slides um underneath this standard uh the department recommends structural standards one through four which as noted under the general standard of review this includes mandatory conditions that relate to this standard as well the applicant's geotechnical and geological consultant cornfirth consultants prepared a preliminary geotechnical and geological summary report which is included as attachment one to exhibit h and underneath recommended structural standard one the department um recommends uh and this is uh typical in most site certificates then a site-specific geotechnical report be conducted and there's um that that report must adhere to um and it would include um conducting borings and subsequent information from those borings and that there be foundation specific investigations appropriate for the the structures that would need foundations um such as the substation and then there would also be soil and rock laboratory tests um and soil and rock classification and um the applicant proposes to use the results from this site-specific geotechnical report to refine its soil protection and erosion control measures which is discussed later on under the soil protection condition one i believe this is my last slide on the structural standard okay i'm going to move forward yes please the soil protection standard requires the council to find that taking into account mitigation the design construction and operation of a facility is not likely to result in significant adverse impacts to soils um the applicant's assessment of potential potential impacts to soils and compliance with the soil protection standard are included in the application exhibit eye however the department also pulls and synthesizes and it's also just soils are discussed further um in the proposed order under other sections and in the application an exhibit g which has information on materials and k which has information about land use um the map here shows these soil map units within the site boundary and identifies the the soil types these soils identified within the site boundary uh which is important are designated as the highest ranking for susceptibility for wind erosion the department recommends soil conditions one and two be imposed to meet this standard so construction and operation activities that would impact soils um would be from grading that would happen for uh access roads and facility components such as the o m building substations uh the collector substations the step up substation battery storage and the inverter and transformer units associated with the solar modules other potential impacts include erosion from wind and water accidental chemical spills noxious weed infestation or reveget",

        "text": " I think we will open it up to folks that are on the webinar and I just want to point out if you were oh sorry out of the total project costs with the two cables that you're putting in how much is the cost or material and how much your labor and other infrastructure costs so if you were to add a third cable how much would that cost interesting question uh I'm Richard Primark I'm Fiat Lux Modis we're an opportunity Zone fund what I'm going to do is and see if I can elicit some help from one of our our other members that's here today uh Jeff could you see if you can sort of feel the ballpark answer on that sort of this microphone here Chef wood I'm I'm with power Bridge uh part of the development team um the uh we don't have a detailed breakdown on all those costs at this point in time and adding a single additional cable wouldn't necessarily help us if we wanted to expand the overall size of the facility we'd need to expand our converter stations to match and then we probably would would put a two more cables into the we've sized our facility to match the capacity that's available in the AC system that allows us to draw 1100 megawatts out of the dowels today if we go higher than that the entire AC system beyond that needs to be expanded as well so we've done our studies electrically to see what was the optimal sizing for pulling energy out of the dowels it it would be substantially a much greater broader project if we tried to increase capacity over and above that given where the AC system stands today hopefully that addresses your your question what you're looking for thank you Jeff yeah and if anyone else in the room has a comment please make your way up uh otherwise if you're on the webinar right now uh I just want to point out that you can raise your hand to provide a comment um there's a participants button at the bottom of your window if you press that a small hand icon should come up in the lower right hand portion of your webinar uh window and if you're on the phone you can also provide comments you just have to press star 3 on your keypad to raise your hand and then when you're done commenting please just press star three again so um Again One Last Call for anybody in the room that wants to provide a comment yeah please my name is Gary Kuntz and I'm curious can this project operate with either the C negative or DC positive pull out of service where you might have a ground return and does that cause magnetic field problems this project will only operate with two cables in service the neutral is taken care of at each converter there is no uh common return or the plus and minus cables and there is no ground return for that either that's that's dealt with in the converter design thank you you're welcome Try Not to cause of static Rudy silicory could you clarify where the Dells bigetti 2 where it goes into the river and how that interacts with the scenic area I mean you had mentioned it was going to be a horizontal drill but is that going to be throughout the entirety of the scenic area where it overlaps Nancy can we go back to the slide which shows the one that's more of the zoomed in one yeah from our slide deck I think is the the more focused one and then while they're doing that I had a question about the in-water work window because Eula Connor broadcast spawners uh Pacific smelt and that in water work window well it's a the in-water work window in the Lower Columbia is a nightmare for anyone trying to work as you guys might be aware but that you look on window really shrinks down your opportunity to work in the Lower River so I would look into that well and and we're aware of that I mean we've we've seen uh how each state has in the past imposed its own work windows and they do not necessarily align uh we're aware of that um uh and so we are expecting Tight Windows whatever whatever that might mean but uh we know that the Fisheries agencies uh are certainly going to be very much aware of you know what needs to what we what what we can't do uh in order to protect the the those kinds of consideration and I know that they vary species by species uh so we're aware of that again you know a mile and a half a day doesn't sound like very much but uh if you did that you know for the 83 miles you know you could get there in I'm doing math in my head but you can get there and you know 60 to 70 days of actual work and that could be done in a couple of so the windows don't for our purposes the windows do not have to be huge we feel that we can uh comply with the windows that are any windows that are reasonably imposed if it's between 6 a.m and 6 p.m we could have a problem but it but yeah we're and we're familiar with that and we complied with those uh uh and our other projects it's important to understand that as as we manage our process from permitting into permit requirements will be baked into the contracts that we have with our our OEM suppliers and our our cable supplier fully understands that there are these requirements that are placed upon them uh we've been through it with them transpaying through it with them other projects have exactly the same issues and so as you as they propose to construct the project what they will do is factor that information into how they execute the work that becomes part of the project so it's it's not like you have a set of requirements okay now you have to build it to these requirements they're part of the conversations as we speak already they have an understanding of where we're going with this project what it's all about now they would have to go about it and and probably a good excuse to uh to name the contractors that we have used in the past for both our projects uh for the uh converter technology uh Siemens and for the cable manufactured installation it's a company called uh they're both Global publicly held companies that have extensive experience in this kind of Technology all over the we appear to have our map getting back to that so let me let me jump in because you brought up one question and the scenic area regulations um and so in terms of that's essentially what the notice of intent process is is for is to figure out what are all the different kind of uh requirements including land use and Scenic air regulations are part of the land use requirements so you know should the project be proposed in any area that's governed by the scenic area yeah that will have to be those those regulations will have to be adhered to just like any local land use regulations whether they're county or city this Project's a little bit different in that you know most of it is in the water um and so we don't know whether you know Hood River County has land use regulations out into the water or the city of Moser or Cascade Locks so that's what this process is about and and it's the same goes to the scenic air regulation so you know our this is this area entirely within the urban area of the Dalles and if it is then the scenic area regulations wouldn't apply but if that it is then they would and then similarly on the Washington side where it pops out above Bonneville Dam if that triggers the scenic area regulations that wouldn't be us because that would be on the Washington side but it would still be required that's fair I just the map I couldn't recognize or uh compare that to the scenic area map that I have in my head so I didn't you had mentioned that it was going to be above ground no this is the only portion that's above ground would be a 500 foot a nectar between the uh our converter station next to the big Eddie and big Eddie itself okay so that's uh that's the only other than the converter stations themselves that's the only uh uh visible element of the project this gives us an opportunity to talk about horizontal Directional Drilling and how it applies to our project we have certain locations where we have to transition from Underground to although in the river bottom it's still underground underneath the water but anyway the longest the short story to that is simply with there's a technology called horizontal Directional Drilling and what we will do is for that particular one in the dowels we will start back on the uh the municipal side of the railroad tracks from there we will go underneath fairly deeply we will go underneath I-84 we'll go underneath railroad tracks we'll go underneath the marina and we will come out further out in in uh the river will have built a box-like coffer Dam around that and what we do at that point is we create the transition and then we bury it and it's done it's over it's it's not visible it's not there where it's going to get in trouble uh from anchors or anything like that um it's it's a technology that is that is quite beneficial it's the same technology that's going to allow us to get from uh one side of the Willamette underneath all the problems that are that are in the sediments there and up into the harborton substation so excellent well thank you all very much thank you yes sir Sam Churchill of Hayden Island again uh that brought up uh a question I I was wondering uh if uh apparently you've talked to Florida Portland with this this is part of Portland property that you're dealing with so is that is that kind of a done deal or I wouldn't call it a done deal but we've had extensive uh conversations and we're moving toward a letter of uh uh with the port of Portland so yes is is the answer and and the conversation side is owned by the port uh most of that part of Hayden Island which you probably know is behind a fence uh is uh controlled by the port of Portland and much of the Rivergate Industrial Area through which the AC cables will pass uh some of it is owned by the ports of them is owned by the the uh uh interests that have bought land but most of that is leased so yeah we absolutely need the cooperation of the port of Portland and at this point they've been very uh uh I don't want to mischaracterize it they've been highly Cooperative because they see this as an opportunity not just uh you know for their business interests but also the whole clean energy aspect of it and the community benefits aspect of",

        "text": " that haven't been mentioned before. And they go back to the two key issues that your attorney mentioned that you need to pay attention to, which is public interest and the comprehensive plan. Public interest is right here. This is public interest. I am here. And the two gentlemen that I rode with because we talked with our neighbors and they want this project to not go ahead with the change. Many of our, everybody that I've spoken to, that my clubs involved with and my neighbors say no. When I walk in driving over here the same way. So I'm sure everyone in this room has the same comment. There's many more people that would want to be here that can't be here, that would say no to this. So this is the public interest. Public interest, I agree, is infrastructure. That's important. But you need to also look at what you're seeing here as public interest is equally important. The second thing I want to talk about is the comprehensive plan. One thing in the comprehensive plan that you looked at too is others have mentioned about all the other projects that are in the pipeline now. For rental units throughout the southwest 200 quarter. There's over a half a dozen of them, thousands of different properties. We have an influx of coming in there. There's a county in Florida that I saw in the news where they say they're going to stop all development until they can resolve this. There's so much in the pipeline now that's coming out. It's time to not give more green lights out. We need to take some time, take some breath and get this correct and do it correctly. Thank you. Thank you for your comments today. Mister Brush, are you present? I think we've already heard from Sandy Matlock. Am I correct? Thank you, Gary White. And after Gary White, we have Carole Van Van Cooney. Come on down, mister White. My name is Gary White. 92 80 Southwest 96th Court Road, Ocala, Florida 3448 one a proud owner of a home and on top of the world. Some history. Years ago, 33 years ago, Ken, Colin and Cindy Colon owned the shopping center and I started doing business with them. And son of a gun, they sold the shopping center to a holding company. We had a nice merchants association. Everything was fine. He made all kinds of demands of the new owners. All kinds. I mean he literally walked over the property to be sure the demands were being kept. Well, he forgot. Now the place is in shambles. That's been in bankruptcy at least once, maybe twice. They can't find anybody that can afford to hold the place and the place is not doing so well. And that started about 18 to 22 years ago. So let all these promises and all this. It's going to happen. It's going to happen and we're going to keep control. Don't pay too much attention to him because he's already got a track record of not paying any attention to them or us. The great people who live on top of the world. Thank you. Thank you, Mister White. We have Carol Danconi and behind that Kathy Neshtali. My name is Carol Vancouni. 820 Southwest 94th street. We are a senior commercial business community. Please don't rezone for apartments. The presenter said they were vested in 1973. This is 2024. Things have changed. Please say no to rezoning. This kind gentleman said that they could have approach DRC instead the development review committee, but that would have raised questions. But we're here raising questions as well about flood zones, compatibility, public interest, non gated gates, power lines, noise and security. If you approve 312 units with adults, children, friends and family. We're going to be impacted by a minimum of 1200 people a day in an already very congested area. And there'll be predictable risk of child endangerment. My nephew was struck by a car. And if you bring apartments with children to on top of the world that will be point a. Point B will be McDonald's, Wawa's wendy, we still suffer because my nephew is hit by a car place. These children will run and skateboard and bike across 200 and they won't make it. If their mothers send them for milk at Walmart and they run with a change across to Burger King or Taco Bell or maybe across 200 to McDonald's, they won't make it. This is against public interest. This public and these children, they are your public. I have seen adults run across 200 barely make it. I have seen adult biker cross the 80th to Walmart barely make it. My nephew was watching tv and then it was laying in the street. Please don't endanger children. Don't let this be your legacy. We don't need more apartments. Thank you. I'm sorry. So sorry for your loss. Miss Nesh Talley. And behind that, Leslie Miller. It's Nastallie. I'm Kathy Nastalle. I live at 8672 Southwest 83rd circle in Ocala. 34481. I'm going to revamp what I was going to say because the majority of what I was topping on has already been discussed in light of the presenter that just was at the podium. There is a child safety issue with this apartment called proposed apartment complex going up where they're proposing it to be. Safety is an issue. We've been hearing this more or today, this morning and this afternoon about public interest. What does a public interest really mean? Is it a bunch of blue shirts here today? I'm here to support my neighbors who are in on top of the world. No, the blue shirts don't mean what public interest means. It basically means the safety, general welfare and characteristics of the surrounding communities. And Oto definitely surrounds the proposed location. The rezoning is contrary and to a marked degree alters the essential character of the Gulf coast cart community neighborhood, especially with the added congestion. It also impacts the health of the community by impeding access to emergency vehicles, increasing traffic on one lane, entry both directions on both properties. In reference to what another presenter said, I was at the intersection the day that the fire truck could not access Oto's 99th and ran into oncoming traffic to turn left. Increased traffic means decreased response times and a possibility of increased additional accidents. And we haven't topped on if there's children going to be living in the potential proposed apartment complex, how are they going to get in and out of the school bus? Where will that school bus be? It already cannot turn. They've proven that in the traffic report. So do we have children on the street on 200 crossing? And who's going to watch the safety of our children in the community. Thank you. Thank you very much, Miss Miller. Hi, Leslie Miller, 9698 Southwest 94th Avenue, Ocala, Florida 34481. Thank you all very much for having this and letting us talk. I'm referencing an email that hopefully you all had a chance to read that I sent last week. I'm going to highlight it here. If you remember that diagram that had the red with the green buffer and those little yellow triangles showing views. The far right triangle is my parents house. It is on 84th Terrace. And a year ago my mother was diagnosed with dementia and two months ago we had to move them to assisted living. Their home had to go on the market. And in February, even though there were a lot of properties listed in on top of the world, Zillow gave it like a 96% chance of being sold before the other properties because of all the advantages that it had. And I won't go into them here. Unfortunately, as word of this development got out, the number of showings has dwindled and there was a contract ready to be written on the house. I got an excited text from my realtor and 20 minutes later she said I had to tell them about the development and they walked away from the contract. My parents need that money from the sale of their house because their income from my dad's post office pension and his small VA pension do not cover the assisted living facility cost. And we had planned the sale of this house to cover that gap. The condition says that adjacent areas are not to be unduly negatively impacted. If that property issue is not a negative impact, I don't know what is. Thank you, please, for considering this decision that you make. I know it's a big one. Thank you, Miss Miller. That does conclude everyone who has signed up. However, if you have not spoken nor donated your time and you would like to address the board, you're welcome to come forward now and the same process will apply two minutes and name an address for the record. I see one person rising and I invite anyone else who again, would like to address the board on this issue to please come forward. Don't hate me because I'm beautiful. I'm Susan Byrne. I live at 9587 C Southwest 84th Terrace. I had not planned to speak, but I saw numbers of pictures of my house and your demonstrations about how great the tree border is. I live there. I can see through the tree border. I see headlights on 200. I see lights from Cody's. I do not want people. Another thing I'll add is a parking lot is certainly not a buffer. I was young, professional, and lived in an apartment, and I would come home at two in the morning after being at the bar on Friday night, and we would party in the parking lot. There's no way you're going to keep people out of the pool at night. There's going to be too much noise, too much light, too many people walking in and out of the place. And that's all I have.",

        "text": " systems that come into the state of Florida or come into Marion county. We have. There are follow up inspections, but the majority of the standard systems do not require reinspection. However, if a system is failing, and Commissioner Bryant and I were talking about this, if a system is failing, then the health department should be notified, we go out and we do a reinspection. If it's failing and there's effluent on the ground or even if there's signs of the system failing, we work with that homeowner. We issue abatement notices. We have the regulatory authority to get those corrected. So if we have the system you mentioned, is that the enhanced system, the enhanced system, the one you permit? That's the one that requires. Yeah. And our special zones that are permitted. Some of those. Not all of them. Some of those require annual inspections. Some of those. There's the peat moss system that was created a couple years ago that does not require an additional inspection. But a lot of the aerobic treatment units, which are the enhanced nitrogen reducing systems, they require monitoring, do have a question as a follow up to that. So, Mark, if we wanted to put something in place for that, is that something that we'd have to go through the state to get? Like, if we wanted inspections on septic systems, if that's something that we wanted to do, I would suggest that we. We sit down and talk about how we would create an ordinance that would require. Require that maintenance there. Several years ago, something like that did pass through legislation, but it was repealed. It was, I think, requiring three to five year inspection inspections. That was prior to my coming here, so it was probably around 20 1415 but I think it was repealed. I mean, there is that cost associated, depending upon the pump out. If you're requiring inspections, there's going to be a pump out. It was actually requiring three to five year pump outs is what it required that everyone do that. If that's something that we wanted to look at, I would be happy to sit down and we could talk about a common sense approach to that, which would not be too big of a burden upon our residents, but would also meet the regulatory levels that you're looking for. So we would do that through county ordinance. Thank you. What's a big problem? I mean, we're the second or third largest county relative to septic tanks in Florida. You are correct. It depends upon what day of the week it is. We are the second or third. Lee county is obviously the first. Marion and Brevard flip flop back and forth on the number of permits issued. And so we are. We are right up there with the top out on that, just in case you want. Well, I know, and I'm not saying that I am in. If you do, we could look at similar. I would be happy to give you some similar processes like that that we've seen either through the state or nationally. And we can see where the problems have been and what some of the pitfalls have been with those types of programs. Absolutely. Anything else? All right. Hey, thanks for a great job. Thanks for the friendship. I appreciate it. Again, we couldn't do this without you all. Appreciate you all so much. You may make my job easy. I am. I apologize. When I was setting up the fund and I got the request from the health unit, the amount of the funding was less than the revenue that's being generated by the flat millage. So what I did, pending direction from the board, is I took that excess revenue and I just put it into reserves. We do have to have a reserve for contingencies of $280,000. I have to have a certain percentage in this fund by the statute, but they are also allowed to have a reserve for capital so that you could take the excess millage, if you so choose, and set it aside in that fund. Once it is levied in this fund, the revenue must stay in this fund. That is one requirement under the statute, that any interest income or anything else that is generated in this fund has to stay here for this purpose. That for the current, the upcoming fiscal year, zero 2 ML plus a little extra, it's $632,368 that can be put in that reserve or a 0.02 mil adjustment or you can leave it in the reserve for cash carry forward, but I'm looking for direction from the board. They always have capital issues and something, so something's going to come up. I think it's better to leave it in the capital line and if they have building issues, we'll take care of it. We can accumulate funding in that reserve for capital. It allows for that in here specifically allows for the accumulation of capital. And then at some point in time there's some logistics that have to be worked out with the state as to when and how it's spent. At the moment, I would say leave it in the reserve for cash carry forward or into the capital. Capital, I think. And we can move it out if we need to. Well, right, commissioner, it's in cash carry forward. In the very near future, we need to do work on the Bellevue office. It needs to be, they need a new building in there. Well, maybe. Or a site built. Well, we will do whatever we can out there. But the capital budget, right, it will be in the capital fine to leave it in there and we'll build it up over the next couple years. And I don't know what we do now. That's where right now it's in reserve for cash carry for which is not a capital account. That's when I was proposing the budget. I knew that there was funding available. I did not know how Mister Lander's request on to spend it for the capital. So if it's the consensus of the board, I can change the itemization in the line item budget so that when the adopter comes out, it will show as reserved for capital instead of reserve for cash carry forward. That way you're showing the intent to spend it in that way. Correct. Okay, I will make that adjustment. Thank you all so much. Really appreciate it. Thank you. The budget item. So we're going to recess temporarily so they can reset the equipment. We'll be right back. This is a workshop. You are joining the workshop. Chairman Curry, vice Chairman Stone. Commissioner Bryant, Commissioner Zalick. Here I have four proofs of publication. The first proof of publication is of legal ad number 899733 entitled Notice of Intention to consider adoption of an ordinance published in the Star Banner newspaper on July 3, 2023. Then I have proof of publication of display ad entitled Notice of Public hearing to consider the partial termination of a chapter 163 Florida Statute Development Agreement for 95th Street Holding, LLC, published in the Star Banner newspaper on July 7, 2023 for item. And then I have proof of publication of display added title, Notice of Public Hearing, consider the termination of a chapter 163 Florida Statute Development Agreement for 95th street published in holding published in the Star Banner newspaper on July 7, 2023 for 1522. And I have a proof of publication of display Ad entitled Notice of Public hearing to consider the termination of a chapter 163 Florida Statute Development agreement for the 95th Street Holding, LLC published in the Star Banner newspaper on July 7, 2023 for item 15. Two, three. Just a few opening comments. Do this before each meeting. Number one, if you have a cell phone, if you please turn it off, put it on mute. If anyone has hearing difficulty, we do have devices that we are happy. If you'll raise your hand, one of our staff will come out and give you a hearing device. Don't be shy. It's not much fun being at the movie if you can't hear it. But is there anyone that wants to have one of us? All the comments will be on the record. Excuse me, I'm having a lot of trouble with my throat today. So there will be no talking from the audience because everything has to go through the microphones and to the clerk and to the minutes. So a lot of times on issues, we'll have people getting their heads together and they'll start chatting and then I have to gavel it down and we don't, we don't want to do that. This is a fact based quasi judicial hearing. In most cases, if you come up and the county attorney will go into this in a little more detail, but if you just think something or don't like something that's not going to really cut it. Just think of yourself in front of a judge talking about an issue. It's fact based. You have to give the commissioners enough information to either vote in favor or against whatever the particular topic is. Everybody will be heard. We do have a two minute limit. However, I'm pretty liberal with that in regard to if you're just up there talking and you're down a rabbit hole, then I'm going to cut you off. If your conversation is adding to the decision making process in regard to fact based information, then I'm pretty liberal with that. I don't think I've had anybody leave a hearing, whether they won or lost in their hearing, that was not satisfied with that portion. So we just don't want to cut people off summarily. The order of appearance, of course, staff will introduce the particular topic and then the applicant will be called forward at that point, anyone else that wants to talk to the item, if you have an attorney in the audience, if there's opposition. Then we'll call those folks up for those comments. Then it will go back to the applicant to",

        "text": " stakeholders to come up with a pretty unique agricultural mitigation plan to address those impacts uh this includes the creation of a agriculture mitigation fund um and an agreement with Maro County to establish the fund and create an advisory committee to uh administer that and the idea is that when we start construction of the facility we will be committed to paying money into this fund um and that those funds will ultimately go to benefit um Dryland wheat uh projects in the county or um the agricultural economy more generally and lastly we have committed in our application to continue our engagement with uh neighbors around the project who may you know uh feel impacts from the facility when it comes to traffic or dust control or other things and want to make sure that we're taking their farming operations into account as we're planning for the uh construction and operation of our facility and make every accommodation we can to um avoid having those impacts Chris pretty much covered this already but just to point out again we're currently in the public information meeting phase of the permitting process here we anticipate receiving the site certificate in a few months and then we'll probably spend the entirety of 2025 kind of in preconstruction um planning phase getting all of our final designs working through the final iterations of our plans um arranging financing you know ordering equipment hiring contractors Etc it's a pretty big undertaking to gear up a project of this scale and then uh like I said before we anticipate constructing the project in phases over a period of uh roughly four years from 2026 to 2029 and if you go to the next slide there's just a little bit more detail so the top chart here and this is included in the application as well uh the different colors represent different construction phases and then the chart below uh the corresponding colors reflect the estimated construction worker headcount that will go with those phases um so you can see we kind of have overlapping phases through time construction on those phases ramping up and ramping down and it all kind of balances out to a fairly smooth ramp up plateau and then ramp back down uh sort of feel to it and this helps with planning it helps with making sure that there's adequate housing and and that we're not kind of in a constant up and down flow of construction workers coming in and out um also important to note that this represents the estimated construction headcount for the full proposed design including all of the potential battery storage if we end up not having battery storage on the project we expect these numbers will go down by about 200 so instead of plateauing it around 900 maybe we're plateauing around 700 um again many many details are available in the application but we just wanted to highlight a few uh Key Construction considerations that have been described and addressed in some detail um everything from vegetation management what kind of ground cover is going to be planted how it's going to be managed U water use and water sourcing where are we going to get the water from how are we going to use it how are we going to preserve those um a water resources in the area uh dust and weed control and you know working with uh the Maro s and Water Conservation District has been a big benefit for us to learn from the experience of the Wheat Ridge facility which is operating right next door and uh figuring out some best practices practices that we can Implement on our project um there's some going to be some limitations on working hours that we expect to to be as a condition in the certificate uh Workforce housing is a key consider ation and we've been engaging with stakeholders to try to find solutions for that and make sure the housing is there when it's needed um traffic management includes a transportation plan a road use agreement with the county make sure that all of those roads are well taken care of and able to support what we need to do uh safety is obviously a big concern um so addressing you know best practices for everything from Fuel and chemical storage fire prevention and control and what do we do if we discover something on the site that we didn't know was there making sure that those processes and procedures are in place um so again this is just a sample and there's tons of detail in the application and if folks have questions we'd be happy to to dig into it a bit and get into more detail with that I'll just say thank you and um looks like chis is going to open the the floor for questions and uh we have plenty of microphones up here and look forward to answering as many questions as we can you thanks Logan yes so uh yeah we'll go ahead and take any questions or comments from people in the audience um we'll we'll also I'm going to go ahead and take questions from people in the room first and then then people online um so up on the side you'll see instru for if you're online and you do want to comment please raise your hand um there's a small pane on the bottom right hand of the main window that says participants go ahead and click on that and then you should see a little hand icon um click on that do we have anybody just called in on the phone okay so we we have some call in phone users as well if you'd like to raise your hand on the phone just press star three and then after we call on you and you make your comment um press star three again and that'll lower your hand um with that is there anybody here in the room that has a question um I'll be Fielding questions about FC process and and we'll refer over to the app team and yeah go ahead and come on up yeah if you don't mind just so everyone can hear you thank you so much um I'm I'm Dy Goble and I'm with the moral County Planning Department uh and I wanted to say first and foremost that um your team has been really uh excellent to work with and we're we we're very impressed with your um agricultural mitigation plan and we um have started to see a lot more of these large and small scale solar projects and we feel that your teams just really set a very high bar for um what what we need to be expecting from um agricultural mitigation we feel that you guys have um demonstrated just a great perspective of the uh importance and the value of our um agan so we really appreciate that we appreciate the effort over years that your teams put into it so so thank you so much for that um we've only just started reviewing your um materials and uh we're looking forward to um you know providing comments during the FC process um and a few uh questions off uh from the start that this isn't necessarily tied directly to um the a plan but for weed mitigation we we were wondering if you guys have um contemplated the use of Agri voltaics um for for weed management and vegetative management as well as um impacts thank you well first of all thank you so much for the the compliment and uh likewise it's been great working with the the planning department and and with the county officials in general so thank you um I guess I'll I can maybe start an answer to that and then maybe hand it off to some other folks but um we did look early on at uh the opportunity to put sheep inside the facility um obviously that's comes with its own set of challenges especially at scale um we're certainly open to considering um kind of AGR voltaic Solutions even though that's a emerging field in the industry um but for now what we've proposed in the application is to use more traditional um vegetation management and um you know again working with uh stakeholders who have been involved in other solar facilities in the county and and learning from those best practices so anything you want to add to that Lana or I think just um just on the sheep piece is a project of this scale is there's there's a lot of water demand for for sheep and if you had enough sheep to actually maintain all the vegetation at this side that would that would also have other unintended consequences that Len maybe if we could just mention the um exhibits and attachments for the vegetation plan and the weed control yeah good point um the exhibit P has a couple of attachments there's a um revegetation plan um that talks about vegetation that will be planted underneath the panels and and in between the panels and how that will be managed um so it's important to keep the vegetation at a level where it doesn't shade the panels and also uh for fire fire management as well uh and then um there's a weed management plan I think revegetation and weed management I forget which ones are together um but that also addresses making sure that there are not um invasive species that are taking over so thank you so much I appreciate your response thank you thanks Daisy and I'll just jump on to to say thanks everybody at the planning department for being so engaged in the process and the border of Commissioners and same to the AIO staff as well thank you uh any anyone else in the room that like to a comment thanks good evening I'm Mark Kendall and uh I'm a Oregonian and uh interested in your project and I am most curious about the how the timeline for decision making and what the decision tree looks like on batteries um given this uh tight the fsec timeline how do you get an fsec permit with with a battery that is one maybe that maybe I I'm curious what the timeline what the decision tree is on um lithium over uh zinc or what sure thank you Mark um if the current timeline holds that that we have shown tonight or roughly two years from start of construction so some of those final procurement decisions will be made closer to to breaking ground and you know in this industry there's a lot of kind of constantly changing Dynamics when it comes to supply chain and availability of equipment uh you know Evolutions in technology Etc um so I would say you know likely over the the next year or so getting into 2025 when we're going through final design and Engineering um making the those kind of firmer construction plans and Contracting decisions is likely when we'll okay be making those um decisions and um with all of that in mind you know we we attempted to in our application preserve a little bit of flexibility um for some different Technologies right given that it's you know still a decision that um needs to be made closer to start a construction so um I don't know if David Weiss is available to jump in on that and speak a little bit more about the uh EPC management project delivery team's approach to that sure um",

city of at the end of this short presentation we'll ask two items first that you conduct a public hearing and then second that you approve a resolution in order approving the so the proposed area for transfer that was requested by this city is identified in Blue on the map it's a little small but it's just south of the TV Highway and goes down to cook Road and this portion is within the city of limits and the city requested the transfer the road is classified as a local Road and it's not identified on the long-term jurisdiction map and so therefore staff determined that it's in the public to make the transfer so notifications regarding the transfer were made and there's no known opposition at this time at this public hearing you may receive additional testimony to consider So based on the information presented staff asks that you conduct the public and then approve the transfer thank you are there any questions of Mr Shetler on this topic I don't have any question but I just wanted to

re-sworn so that's great so today I'm just going to walk you through a proposed amendment to our mstip bonding cost sharing program project list at the request of the City of Beaverton and then we have a companion item that would approve an intergovernmental agreement in order to actually exchange funds so with that oh I'm clicking on my computer huh um gotten spoiled with zoom meetings okay so just a quick background on the mstip bonding cost sharing program so it's it's a part of the major streets Transportation Improvement program but it is really a separate slate of projects that was adopted and those are being funded through bonding against incremental increases in the mstip revenues that have occurred over time and they were originally adopted this list by the board back in 2015 the initial list had 20 projects with an estimated cost of about 140 million dollars the board has approved one prior amendment to this list and that was to swap out two different Bridge projects that were in the South Hillsborough area and in that case as well as in this case the County's commitment is fixed it doesn't increase the County's share of funding for a project here but in both cases we've been able to leverage additional funding sources and then this change has been reviewed and endorsed by the Washington County Coordinating Committee prior to bringing it forward to your board and this is just a quick uh reminder this is the map that was originally adopted again with the 20 projects and the 140 million dollars there we",

starting point we're taking into account existing laws policies targets um existing plans including uh clean energy plans and integrated resource plans uh that we're aware of and and learning from um studies and data analyses that that that we can draw on including not just ones in Oregon but we're also looking for example at what the Northwest power and conservation um is coming out with BPA um pck so we're we're looking at the big picture and then um in the middle is more of an elaboration on what the uh energy strategy needs to take into account so you can see here if you look at the bullets sort of on the left of the middle um we need to evaluate the options for how we produce transport and deliver energy how we ensure that we're using that energy as efficiently as possible uh we also need to uh consider important issues related to energy energy touches on everything and everyone so it's important to look at the effects of different pathways on environmental justice um focus on community benefits understand land use considerations um energy burden and um making sure that that that certain communities aren't disproportionately impacted by the transition we'll be looking at economic and employment impacts uh energy security and the impacts of broader energy Market discussions energy resilience which increasingly is is a very important part of the discussion and Community energy resilience as well um and finally on the far right um is a framework that we have for how to ensure that um when we are framing up our engagement that we're being as inclusive as as diverse um and as thoughtful as possible so that we're really hearing from uh different um different perspectives from across Oregon and here at the bottom there are just a couple of kind of foundational pieces first and and I and I heard this in the comments earlier it's it's really important that we reflect the best available information data analysis and time Horizons uh to achieve the state's policy objectives we'll be looking out to 2050 just to answer the time Horizon piece and the idea is to periodically update this analysis so this is not meant to be a oneandone this is meant to be a process we're going to learn from this process and over time we'll continue to learn as as things change next slide please HP 3630 directs uh the energy strategy to develop Pathways to meet Oregon's energy policy objectives but doesn't Define energy policy objectives so this slide gives us a little bit more of a sense of of where um where we're starting from uh we have an economy-wide objective in the form of executive order 204 and that uh that objective is at least 80% greenhouse gas emission reductions by 20150 we also have a more specific but also very um very broad-reaching objective in the form of HB 2021 which is our 100% clean um energy standard by 2040 that covers um electricity investor utilities and we have the climate Protection Program which covers natural gas liquid fuels and propane and uh calls for 90% greenhouse gas um emission reduction um level by 2050 so those are the I would say the anchor policies that are driving greenhouse gas emission reductions across the economy at the same time we have numerous other important policies that are helping to drive uh emissions reductions and shape the compliance Pathways um for for often that that feed into meeting these broader goals uh this is just a sampling we have many more as you can as I kind of indicate here in the words but but just to name a few we have the clean fuels program Advanced Clean Cars 2 clean trucks uh building codes Appliance standards um those and many other policies also play a really important role um in helping to drive um us towards a a clean energy transition um and our approach in the model will be to incorporate these policies into the modeling process and to um to look at what compliance would look like um by 2050 so what the pathways are to to meeting these various objectives by 2050 we go to the next slide I want to talk a little bit about the the structures now that we uh have uh kind of built in to uh ensure that we're providing kind of various ways to engage in and inform the process I think it's really important to emphasize that this is not just an academic exercise very far from it uh the whole process of developing an energy strategy is meant to be a conversation on how we undertake um both the analysis how we can um learn from different perspectives to inform policy and uh to work together on defining what steps we take next there obviously is a technical portion of the analysis we've hired CTI as consultants but this piece is is is really important and will inform that process uh so we have an inter agency Steering group that uh serves to to ensure coordination between State agencies uh various agencies share responsibility um over various policies and so we're meeting to make sure that that coordination is happening about once a month and you can see here the agencies that are listed as um kind of the core participants in that group that uh we're also talking to other agencies as well so we're um we're very conscious that this doesn't include all agencies that have an important voice in the discussions uh today we're meeting with you all the Advisory Group um and and we'll talk a little bit more about your role shortly but I'll just say here that that uh you're advising us throughout the process to help inform decisions that we're taking um we have as we heard diverse perspectives and and lived experience of professional experience uh represented here from across Oregon and and you'll be meeting once a month um similar to the inter agency Steering group to make sure that we are um checking in regularly um giving you up dates regularly and hearing from you regularly to inform the um the process from kind of start middle and and finish of each of the um each of the engagement um kind of rounds that that I'll talk about in a moment we also have working groups which are focused on the details of the modeling so these are subject matter experts able to inform the modeling and the technical analysis um who will be meeting in July starting next week and through August of this um we also are engaging in tribal consultation and government to government conversations to ensure that tribal perspectives inform the energy strategy um we're reaching out to the members of the nine ferally recognized Indian tribes in Oregon um and to to tribal organizations as well and that's that's an ongoing process throughout and we are organizing a series of listening sessions uh to collect broad views from across the state this is perhaps the the broadest um opportunity anybody can join it's not as much of the time commitment as a working group for example we want to make sure that we create this space where we um as Odo can really uh listen and hear what folks have to say about priorities about concerns about the types of questions that they would like to see the energy strategy answer and we have two listening sessions scheduled to inform the technical work the the modeling uh also scheduled for next week and we have one during business hours and one after hours to also help make sure that that folks with different schedules can participate next slide please so um this slide pulls together the project phases and key deliverables um kind of over time along with how we plan to consult with with folks over over throughout this process so right now we're in a phase where we're working on the technical approach on the modeling and the timing is roughly July to the end of the year um and then early next year and into spring we'll be developing policy recommendations and then the final report is due by November 1st 2025 it's actually due on Halloween that's a Friday so it'll be a Halloween deadline um so you can see that for both the technical approach and policy recommendation those are really kind of two out of three sections of the final report and so we envision uh very similar process for how we would engage uh F folks for both of those um to develop both of those um parts of the energy strategy so as I've mentioned we've we've already scheduled listening sessions and working groups for the first phase for the technical approach um we'll be meeting with you all uh we'll be meeting with the inter Agency Group um we'll be Consulting with tribes we'll be um engaging and reaching out to EJ and Equity groups and we also Envision having public webinars kind of as bookends to the to the the process of developing the technical approach and the same for the policy recommendations so in June we had a webinar to give a preview of what we had in mind for for kind of Outreach and and now we're starting that process and then around September we'll have another webinar where we'll explain where we've landed and provide an opportunity for folks to hear that um and and to provide some some feedback and then when we have draft um modeling results uh early next year we'll have an opportunity for public written feedback and we'll have another webinar then to present that piece so we kind of Envision the webinars to be previews and updates kind of throughout the process um as we develop the policy recommendations we'll follow a simp similar process also for presenting draft policy recommendations getting some feedback on that and then um towards kind of be into the summer we'll be drafting the final report we'll present a draft final report for feedback um and we'll work on finalizing that in and delivering it to the governor and legislature by the deadline next slide please um so I'm almost done this is my last process slide I promise but I think it's important for everybody to just have a sense of What's Happen happening when with who and why uh so this is just a timeline with key deliverables uh you can see 2024 and 2025 kind of up in in light gray so right now um the engagement to inform the modeling and technical analysis is from uh essentially the June 3 date was was the webinar where we kind of gave a preview was coming and then by September 9th we'll have to have finalized all of the discussions and come up with a final uh structure for what scenarios we're modeling and and and what inputs we'll be using September roughly to December will be um the time that the modeling will happen we need to leave some time for that to it's it's a very labor intensive process so that'll be happening preliminary results published um probably early next year then we'll have final modeling results shortly after that once we've",

        "text": " we finally considered the characteristics of building types and then the amount of land that is needed for that building type to get to a land need um but first this first step here we allocated employment growth to The Standard Building typologies and so you can see this figure is the distribution of employment Space by type in the city of Sherwood ugb and with the total number of jobs a little over 8 000 we see that we're going to grow the most um in general industrial and office and flex building Park and then we looked at the change in employment allocated by building type and then you can also see here that the net changes we're gonna um see the more more growth in the general industrial Flex and building Park as well as office and that Flex building Park has a lot of like manufacturing and distribution uses as well so then the next step is to really get to that land demand analysis and this tells us how much land is needed for those building types and job types and so um I'm just going to get down to the nuts and bolts here we are looking at a total of uh 485 roughly net acres are required for our job growth over the planning and then we looked at all the different factors to get to the net acres for each one and the models show that Sherwood will need about 143 Acres of employment land for the next five years so this is the short year scenario here our next step was doing the buildable lands inventory and we updated our buildable lands inventory and we took out roughly another 41 acres of land in that inventory the results here show that Sherwood has 956 total acres in commercial industrial planned designations but of that 956 acres in the ugb about 520 Acres or about roughly 54 are in the classification with no development capacity we have 233 Acres or 20 about roughly 24 are constrained and only 208 acres are actually buildable land with development capacity all right and then this is this is actually one of my favorite tables in the analysis this table identifies lot size by planned designation and billable acres and you can get a lot of information actually out of this table here because we always talk about what needs do employers have um the employers that we are trying to attract our Target Industries really need those large buildable Lots and this is telling us that we don't have any Lots in Sherwood that are between 10 and 50 acres or wheat and we don't even have any lots that are greater than 50 acres um so this is pretty important as we as we move forward so this is our um short-term land supply for our goal nine requirements and the results show that Sherwood has about 24 Acres of buildable commercial land and in the short supply of land we have about 94 Acres of buildable industrial and that's on about 125 tax lots and that's the five-year forecast so it's sort of hard to you know wrap your head around 94 Acres on 125 watts highly personalized it's not viable of land for any kind of not any kind of Target industry that the city is looking forward work contractor storage that you can use for other types of things but to get the higher paying jobs that the city council is seeking we're going to need semiconductors Advanced manufacturing those kinds of Technology type jobs that that uh quality Jobs family wage jobs and I guess it's my first bullet actually on the slide we have a limited inventory of available sites to accommodate employment uses and answer could ask a follow-up question about that hundred and that 125 watts leading to 90 Acres because I'm I'm trying to wrap my head around that too it's less obviously it's about a you know average of two-thirds or seven you know three quarters of an acre per lot like are these are many of these contiguous or are they all just spread out all over the place and why do we have all these tiny Lots zoned some contiguous property but that's that line acre in the nine Acre along the dalkeith lane Corridor that area under multiple ownerships and and there's no way for us to require it to be assembled but you cannot really develop some of these uses on a nine acre lot frankly you need to have some consolidation of the properties why do we have so many tiny lot zoned industrial that's I guess it's a question for another day but pretty interesting in the Portland region quite frankly that's one of the challenges of tracking more technology to the Portland region yeah it's it's a common request that Mayors and other cities are making of Metro and the state is help with how do you bring in all how do you bring all those plants together to make a project come together but it's very it's very all right so um our 20-year forecast of employment land made so this last slide here on this table is showing us that exactly things of about 270 um that first bullet there I just talked about that but the city we should continue to monitor our flights that are 10 acres and larger to ensure that there is sufficient opportunities for small to Mid mid-sized businesses to locate within Sherwood a quick question on that last slide what's our deficit over five years you had us earlier so long was it 24. we had our short-term I can answer that it's 23.9 total acres is it aggregate deficit um we haven't received any public testimony on the eoa we did send it out for our agencies to review we posted notice of the this ordinance what kind of feedback did you get from the other well docd I mean we work closely with the Department of land conservation at the state and you know they you know they were a member of the attack and I think they were very supportive I mean my interpretation being somewhat new to Oregon is they were pretty supportive of the process we've also been working with metro metro understands exactly what we're doing we didn't get a comment letter uh from Metro we didn't get a formal comment letter from Metro but we actually operated some language into the report stating why we didn't use their regional forecast and that's because their forecast rate Within the lab but they didn't object yeah that's new yep again I'm really pleased with report so are there are there any things that Metro or Salem could do that would help us to consolidate any I mean are there incentives or other things that can say hey if you guys put your Lots together we'll buy it at a premium so that we can well let me let me let me try I mean obviously the legislature has been looking they adopted Senate bill for they've been looking at Senate bill 5. Senate Bill 4 is this for Semiconductor development because Oregon is in a very very competitive battle and I don't think we're quite as competitive as Texas or Arizona or a lot of Upstate New York is getting more semiconductor than than than than this area so that's for uh then sp5 I understand that because of the uh the the the issues in Salem right now is is really the incentives a lot of the incentives and that's going to require that uh both parties I think get together in Salem and be able to consider the kind of incentives that that could be available for the growth of advanced manufacturing so it's not just semiconductors is it it's advanced technology manufacturing that's a stake uh here in the greater Portland greater Portland area and Sherwood in particular yeah and outside of incentives I mean we're dealing with private property so and and um you don't condemn property for commercial projects so I think the best thing we do can do well yeah that's there's always an exception right well but but the best thing you can do is in this and I think Metro and Salem can help with this it's about networking connecting people building the relationships with all those Property Owners connecting them with developers to try to put stuff together that's exactly exactly what happened on Oregon Street right you know and we connected all those folks and we were able to get a project going but it's it's private property yeah that's fine Bruce I was just going to say it's private property but there's oftentimes a dollar amount where the incentive says hey if you do this you know we can we can make it worth your time doesn't matter where the dollar amount is coming from yeah that's right Mr Mayor I have a I have a point of order and a suggestion yes I believe we need a motion to go past nine o'clock I actually made a note oh yeah and and second of all that in relation to that and given that we have another public hearing my suggestion is once we get done with the presentation we hold we hold our deliberation until the second reading on this topic just in the sake of time um I I am fine with that so can I have a motion to extend our meeting past nine o'clock for let's give it another 45 minutes 9 45 10 plus you tend to be safe okay okay I'll make a motion to extend the city council public meeting to 10 pm I write it most in a second um all in favor of extending the meeting till 10 pm say aye all right I like the target 9 30 but motion passes regardless of some um let's so so I like Doug's idea I think we can close out of the the discussion of public hearing on this sort of discussion at this point and we'll hold it over to the next meeting did you have something oh I do want to mention that Jerry Johnson is on the on the line tonight about the analysis he can answer them I have questions thank you Jerry well done on the report all right um so we are moving on yeah yeah we're gonna take a five minute recess for a bio break for everybody and uh we'll come back and tackle the next are we are we still live recording awesome all right we are back from our short recess and just uh real quickly here before we close out ordinance 2023-006 I'm going to open up the public or for public comments do we did we have any public comments and then I any in the audience in that ordinance the previous one that we just nope in any online all right I'm going to close the public heating public heating public meeting public comments I'm getting a Punchy here um and and we will move on to the next all right so uh 2023-007 which is adopting the Sherwood camping code and we have uh Ryan actually",

        "text": " it's not just a wish list right you know so um because you know if we only have a certain amount of money and somebody suggests that they want to um underground II okay you know you know it's sort of like that's probably not going to fit within our financial and the financial constraint is also ODOT it does include State we have to also plan the state in our any other questions thank you we will move on now to um item five sustainability directors Network regn meeting week julana Ling to you yes um so I was able to go to the annual meeting for the Cascadia Regional Network um and a couple take takeaways that I wanted to share with the group um it's a really great Regional Network and one of the best things about it is it can build capacity especially since I am one person I can um kind of take advantage of some of the programs that other communities have already already built so the other Consulting work that other communities have done and adapt that to our community and move that forward kind of FastTrack some of those uh programs um some of the things that they had going for them um especially with the more developed uh communities in the region they have funding uh opportunities that seemed pretty interesting to me so um some of them were based on taxing the carbon industry so like gas stations if they aren't going to have VC fast charge they would get a very substantial increase to their regular business tax and if they did operate um easy fast chargers they would keep with the same um tax uh rate and so it help fund sustainability initiatives for those who weren't willing to privatize that step towards um and then the other thing that some of the sustainability departments did is they had ways to kind of charge in departmentally so for providing sustainability Services they would kind of recapture from some of the Energy savings or other savings that they would help provide inter departmentally so thought that was pretty cool um and then there are kind of three pillars of where sustainability work gets done it's been educating incentivizing or regulating and enforcing um newer programs are normally more in educate and in moving towards incentives and more established programs are in uh incentive with a little bit of education and then the well established well well resourced uh communities have widespread widespread uh education incentives and enforcement so seeing where we can kind of Leverage each of those um and then one of the cool things that I got to see was the um District energy so uh in the US not a lot of people not a lot of municipalities have um energy that they generate and distribute so seeing that being done was was pretty cool um they were using geoexchange which is unlined uninflated pipes that are going underground and leveraging that temperature differential provide low carbon energy and hting for buildings residential and then um there was e car programs in Portland they worked with uh Rocky Mountain Institute to do a study on um lowincome multif family and to see what their um current Mobility options were and one of the uh unfortunate things that they uncovered is people in Road situations sometimes have to use the most readily available tupus option and that sometimes we you all trust and so hearing that kind of anecdotal this is what people do in a pinch here are some other options um they are looking into how to establish uh ride share EV ride share at low income with a family um you mean U-Haul trucks not to move things but just to travel yeah just to go to work go to appointment so a very highs so um they're looking at kind of uh circumventing that type of uh single use uh trip Transit and then there are some municipalities that are looking into um kind of Outsourcing their uh Fleet for certain things obviously not like a back trck or anything like that but for some of the smaller Vehicles having it be with the ride share so then somebody else is managing that and um there are two ways they can do that where either employees would just go into the municipal account and register for chair or they would have primary and first use during business days so Monday through Friday 9 to five and then evenings and weekends it would be available for the public car share so interesting ways to right size a fleet at a community scale um and then uh finally there was a lot of talk on climate lens which brings us there any questions um so the climate lens is uh a tool for decision making there are a couple different types of tools there are some uh local examples that are currently in Pilot phase and then we can talk about pros and cons and this is meant to be a policy discussion so as much as I have stuff up here I would love to hear more of like what you all are thinking in terms of um what you want out of such a tool so first where does this tool come into place so what is the Nexus that that causes that triggers a climate line to be applied is it a new policy and would that be at a department level or would it me to be Citywide would it be a new procedure so procedures are more task oriented and less um less General would it be a new program would it be funding would it be existing or new if it's existing would it be like a stamp of approval in the budget book or if it's new would it be verifying that programs policies are sorry funding would be a go noo um and then would it be something that has required city council action or are there other ideas of when you would like to see it applied this is where you want any feedback all along the way if you want to wait till the end I have time for too I always have to say but I your time um well how many are not knowing where we're going okay um I will go and just keep this in mind and we'll Circle back okay that'll work um so the first type is quantitative so this is a scoring tool for identifying projects that meet or exceed a threshold for sustainability um something that kind of sets this type part is it is use of modeling and expert analysis to identify significantly beneficial projects um this one is more suitable for uh robust policies programs or funding um the example Community uses it when um different departments or divisions are applying for carbon tax funds um the Regional Community is currently piloting this program so I'm not going to discuss that program's name um there are examples that are out of Ontario Canada's clean air partnership program um so this is the example have three categories or sorry criteria the first is go noo so they ask is it an is it a climate related emergency is it an isolated emergency is it critical to health and safety um risk caused by climate change and then the other go noo criteria does it reduce greenhouse gas emissions or energy consumption is it part of the city's climate action strategy does does it reduce greenhouse gas emission and or is it a critical enabler critical enablers are um reducing energy consumption which could help effort um and so if it doesn't meet one of those two criteria it's a noo so it wouldn't go through this process at all um if it does go through those um it would have either a um it would go through the quantitative criteria so this is where you'd find the uh modeled extent of emissions reduction you would know the cost of that initiative you would see how it plays into environmental justice so that could interplay with um the equity scoring tool and it would look at the health and resiliency um and slow safety so that would be the Quan and then they would look at some qualitative so because that doesn't Encompass all of what going on in the city they have it look through um a little bit more descriptive thing so that's where you would talk about if it has organizational alignment so is it a council priority would it improve organizational Effectiveness is it um something of community interests other considerations would be um internal resource capacity do we have the people and the funds to make this program go um were there recent investments in similar initiatives is there additional funding so if we're looking at the electric vehicles um there's IRS funding so would we say there's a component of that that wouldn't have to go from other budgets and then is there urgency so is it something like we don't uh improve Energy Efficiency we'll have to improve the capacity of our building's energy consumption um that is an example of that type of policy so it looks through different criteria and then you get kind score and a narrative to see if that would go through and in this case if that would get just a question so the top one where it says a climate related emergency um so you're saying it has to be an e so if that's a no then it's a no go so it has to either be a climate related emergency or okay reduce so we have a qualitative example which is more of a questionnaire this is um a low barrier option and it's more of a way to connect with plan action staff um it's EAS VI so non-experts can can look at it and evaluate their projects policies programs and um get some help in collaboration around achieving the city's climate goals uh this next this could be a lot lower barrier because it wouldn't require as much staff input and um there's a regional community that currently has um this in draft form and then outside of our region there's uh Kiron county has been using something similar to this for the past couple years is that California or Canada that's they're all in Canada except for this one has a draft that's local but not out yet um um so these are some examples of questions that could be asked you'd want to know like what the policy is have them describe that how does it contribute to Salem's climate action plan and Emissions reduction goals um are there climate mitigation or adaptation measures implemented into the plan give a little more detail on if so what are they if not why not um will this initiative result in an increase decrease or the same amount of emissions and then if unknown how would that be tracked so again we're not asking them to have any details on that specifically I can go in and help them look through that and there are tools that I can connect them with to get more details on that um and then how does this option compare to other options clate impact what factors are considered in selecting this option um are there opportunities to enhance this project what are the associate costs and implications how will it be monitored and evaluated um for alignment",

        "text": " the end of ps6 standard ps4 and ps6 and i i have the language so i can include it either now or later on it just depends on council preference i like to do these piecemeal this is and then do you have a suggestion to either of cindy or todd have a suggestion as where to add the approval is it in six uh it would be condition six yeah this is council member condon i deferred it todd my mind was a question first and so if approval if there's not an approval process what i'm what i'm concerned about is that as i read this there's a submission of a plan and that checks a box without any review or approval and i know that's not what's intended so whatever wording would be uh yeah for the record todd cornett um again on this one i don't have anything specific to say right now we can articulate the intent and then generate the language i think the the direction is in this case very clear from council at least i feel very clear on it used to say this is hanley it looks like it used to submit for review and approval by the department in consultation with the county department planning departments it looks like there it was there are you suggesting that it be replaced be added back in yes yeah i think staff yeah and i'm ready to okay to articulate the straw poll if you're correct if you're okay so this would be for uh issue ps4 agree with findings of fact conclusions along conditions of approval in the proposed contested case order pertaining to issue ps4 with following modification uh change condition six and the to require uh approval review required department review and department approval okay thank you good yeah yeah is that yes clear and you cannot use it okay cindy condon jordan truett yes ann buyer hanley jenkins yes prairie choctoot ken howe yes okay thank you council okay so again the public services standard is uh composed of a number of of different public services that are being looked at um as uh kellen described for us so our next um exception issue from the proposed contested case order uh is from mr horst it's issue ps6 and this is a traffic safety issue whether the applicant adequately evaluated the potential traffic impacts and modifications needed on hawthorne and motor layer drive it's in parentheses hawthorne loop the hearing officer addressed this in her opinion she found that hawthorne loop roads are paved and maintained by the city of le these roads are not proposed by idaho power in the application for site certificate to be modified and are therefore outside the site boundary she also noted rebuttal testimony that had been provided by idaho power's expert witness which stated that substantial modifications may be necessary on privately owned portions of hawthorne drive but that it is unlikely idaho power's expert witness had reviewed aerial imagery and testified that the private access portion of the road is generally 15 to 23 feet wide with dirt and gravel with horizontal curves ranging from 60 to 75 feet radius idaho power generally needs 14 foot wide road surface and 16 to 20 foot wide turn radius therefore substantial modifications are not anticipated actions identified for the private portion of the road include blading to maintain the surface and water for dust control but no widening or slope reinforcement is anticipated idaho power indicates that a helicopter would likely be used to airlift materials and equipment to avoid tight turning conditions so the hearing officer went on to find that the council doesn't have authority to address limited parties claims that these roads require substantial modifications for safety or are inadequate for construction vehicle use because of geologic hazards what the hearing officer cited to in support of this is a prior decision of the council from the wheatridge case which they at that time the council decided that if a related or supporting facility and a road would you know fall into that if if it was included if a related or supporting facility is not proposed by the applicant in the application for site it cannot be reviewed or required to be reviewed by the council the hearing officer also looked at traffic control measures that idaho powered proposed including pilot vehicles traffic control flaggers warning lights signs and all these things are going to be addressed under the traffic plan which is a component of public services condition number two these measures will be vetted as part of the finalization of that plan not only by the department but also in consultation with union county and the city of legrand um as applicable depending on which roads are in which we have just a couple of more parts of this the one of them is dealing with geologic where idaho powers expert witness had noted that where substantial road modifications are necessary in an area of geologic hazard idaho power would complete engineering and consult with a licensed civil engineer to ensure the design of the road modification accounts for the potential geologic hazards and protects public health and along those lines idaho power proposed a condition in response to the issue which the hearing officer recommended be included in the final order she included in her proposed contested case order the new condition states that prior to construction or road modification in any area designated as a geologic hazard by oregon department of geology and mineral industries data and maps for example as landslide or debris flow fan or by relevant local zoning ordinance and maps the site certificate holder and or its construction contractors will consult with a licensed civil engineer to assess the proposed construction or road design in relation to potential geologic hazards so again that was the new conditioned language proposed by idaho power adopted by the hearing officer in the proposed contest case order so that is my summary of where the proposed contest case order stands on this issue and with that it's time for mr horst's oral argument you start the clock on me i just want to say one thing real quick is that um we're uh we didn't all stand together you know sit around and say hey we've got nothing better to do than give idaho power a bunch of problems um i you know i've i run an auto repair business that's where 100 an um i i've spent hundreds of hours on this so i take this very seriously so with that said i'm i'm basically ready um the uh i want to start off by uh what jesse had just said there he said a lot of things which means there was a lot of issues on this particular contested case there was 13 safety issues i have with hawthorne i didn't have right i had i have four contested cases i had to kind of pick and choose i did not have time to write except exceptions for all four cases so i picked the two more important ones replied to those my primary goal is to get mill creek right the mill creek route completely off the application altogether there's absolutely too many too many issues it's a very steep hill um the lower part has no sidewalks uh they should not um this shouldn't have even been on the plan to begin with um the letter in several letters from ida uh to idaho power from the city of legrand the city of legrand specifically said the legrand city council strongly requests ipc removed the proposed routes from their application of the two routes identified in the application the applicant selected the one that's most impactful to the city of legrand as their proposed route they cited the existing geological fault the steepness with and condition of the city streets that would uh need to be used to access this route um they there was uh there's a couple of misinterpretations the the dirt paved sh uh steep portion of the road um has some uh sharp corners that are completely blind you can make one vehicle can get around it but if you meet another one coming around any of those three three big corners uh it's not wide enough for two cars you can't you can't stop on a downhill gravel road quickly so those are some serious issues city legrand also requested required traffic and safety plan by idaho power prior to using this route the judge said in her findings idaho powers traffic plan required by recommended public services condition to adequately addresses traffic safety concerns idaho power has not submitted a safety plan for this area at this point in time um on march 24 2020 mark stokes of idaho power wrote a letter to several of us on the mill creek route specifically said the following over the past two years the community has shown the preference uh the morgan lake route alternative that's why we're pursuing it instead of the mill creek route since your property is near the mill creek route you no longer have to take any further action um i've had three other interactions with idaho power and they've said told me that every single time yet here we still are um i'm asking the council to not just to to just remove this route completely it should not be there there's too many issues we've been uh told that they're not going to use it and several of the applica several the other contested case people dropped their cases just be for this reason if no other reason do it for the safety of the children that have to walk down a very steep model hair model there and hawthorne drive with absolutely no sidewalks anywhere in the entire housing project and there's only one way in and out of this housing project with no sidewalks and then they have to walk across a busy street to get to the first sidewalks in the whole area so again um i i highly recommend a request that the council removed this route completely it there's a all the other routes are better it does not need to be thank you for your time mr horst are there any questions from all right thank you thank you good morning lisa rachner again for the record uh the proposed access roads of hawthorne drive motor drive those make the paved portions make up hawthorne loop and the unpaved portion of hawthorne drive have been the subject of some controversy in this case in its application the company did include uh the unpaid portion of hawthorne drive within the site boundary because we conservatively estimated that there may need to be some substantial modifications but concluded that no modifications would be required for the paved portion and as explained by in the testimony of the company's expert luke grieb for the application the company did perform a desktop review of access roads knowing that it would need to finalize transportation excuse me traffic management plans after final route however in response to concerns raised during the contested case mr grieb did go back",

        "text": " do that do you guys have any questions about that where what we've done this last year council member buer chair gr um when I listened in on the Lexington public hearing one of the comments was about the Drone from batteries associated with storage for solar so just want to make sure that that's considered as part of the noise update I think in 2004 we probably didn't account for that it may just be background noise um I I don't know but since that comment was raised it's probably important to have um a noise analysis or measurement of of that kind of constant noise which yeah absolutely so just to be clear the uh the carve out sort of so to speak for the wind rules did not like negate the need for analysis for wind turbines uh and nor will it negate the need for noise analysis for solar projects it's just a it's just a change from the base assumptions in terms of like the noise floor uh for the ambient noise and uh I don't know if you want to speak to anything more beyond that yeah there's really um so there are sort of two thresholds related to noise um for any any industrial facility kind of in a sort of a new area and the first is that you can't um either you can't exceed 10 DVA above what the current um Baseline is and then the second is there table that there's a maximum not to exceed um because it has public health and safety impacts so the what the wind um change did was it allowed for the applicant to use an assumed Baseline um and then that way they didn't have to spend as much time you know and money doing um upfront work so they could use the assumed and then if they're um go above 10 DBA from that Baseline one they're either precluded from doing that and this is related to a noise sensor receptor so house a school you know a church something within proximity um and so that that modeling is desktop versus um on site um there still has to be you know actual modeling later on but in that sort of front end they can use the assumed DBA and then you either can't go over 10 you know increase it by 10 or if you do you have to get a waiver from the landowner that waiver process could be the land owner doesn't care they're fine or they request new glass new insulation some sound wall something to mitigate the the impacts but but that ability for the landowner who's going to be impacted can negotiate whatever it is that they're interested in to ensure that um and then um so it's really that two things that using that assumed DBA Baseline and then that waiver process proc that only exists currently for wind because that was it the specific carve out that Tom's referring to so our proposal is to make that same those same elements applicable to solar um a solar panel does not create noise but the inverters the Transformers the electrical lines the battery storage 100% those make noise and in most circumstances that we've seen you know in solar projects those exceed those not to exceed maximum thresholds at the point source that doesn't mean that they're NE necessarily impacting you know adjacent um noise sensitive receptors because of attenuation by distance you know that goes down but it means that that needs to be evaluated um because the location of houses you know you know can be in close proximity to some of these facilities so so again the base idea is it's worked for wind um it doesn't doesn't remove any standards or requirements um it just allows for some more flexibility uh for the for the developer of the project um and then um one other element is you know these are not Council rules as you're aware they're the Environmental Quality commission at the Department of Environmental Quality rules so we may be the only ones implementing these days I don't know um but the you know because this is not your rulemaking we're not asking you to have this on the list we you know have um had a conversation with the EQ they're interested moving forward but what they said is hey we haven't implemented these rules in 20 years or something so you know you have the experience this is really more oriented towards you know your stakeholders so while they are going to be the decision makers we're going to be doing much of the leg work um and you know a lot of it was done before we're not CH we're not proposing anything really any different than what the wind rules say so it shouldn't take much um substantive work on our part but it will take some sort of procedural effort on our part that's why we want to make you aware of it because you know even though it's I would say probably hopefully minimal it's still going to take some time and so you know that's going to be primarily Tom's time so that does um remove his ability to work on some other things at the same time CH Grail just to follow up yes so thank you that explains that it's sort of A Safe Harbor for the developer um the Baseline measurement um and then I think these are the standards we applied for the transmission line for correct okay okay so yeah it's the same it's the same overall standards that apply to any facilities whether it's wind or solar or uh transmission lines or any type of facility the only difference is based on those 2004 changes which are only applicable so this is to update to apply to solar and thank you for doing the work of an agency yeah council member pan thank you chair gr just a question and um came up in B2 discussion as well with when we noise the noise standard seems to be directed at human um impact is there any analysis done I don't think it's in the standard at all um for wildlife not explicitly but implicitly um so you know this standard is for sort of you know either new industrial uses on you existing industrial locations or you know nonc currently industrial locations so creating you know a new kind of big um you industrial use and what's that impact and it is primarily oriented towards and it's not Construction in its operation primarily in fact exclusively oriented towards um you know impacts to you know people um we have noise is is an issue that is evaluated in protected areas in Recreation so those AR those don't have to meet the DEQ noise rules they're just hey what's going to happen with this project is it going to impact a protected area that part of that protected area is related to you know keeping the noise down we look at that we look at that same thing for recreation um implicitly you know that also would be an issue for wildlife so that would be part of the evaluation on the fish and wildlife habitat standard there's nothing in there that says that but if you're creating big booming noises you know in a particularly sensitive location that is for whatever reason sensitive to noise that will be part of the evaluation you know of that impact to um the habitat thank you chair gr Vice chair how one one last quick question is this going to be a DEQ noise rule or is it an FC rule um thanks Vice chair how uh yes DEQ only so it's currently only a DEQ noise Rule and that's why this case it would be either the director um or the Environmental Quality commission making changes should they agree with these rules so we've you know we you FC has been implementing their rules as your noise standard for a long time we did look um early on could we create our own noise rules um that created a lot of complexities and problems because the DEQ noise rules don't go away they are directive um in statute and if you created your own noise rules um we would either have to go back and have DEQ through the statute make reference to that and create the carveout for us and then create our own new set of rules related to all of these uh and so we did look at that as an option but essentially all of it goes back to DEQ so you know the idea was even if we wanted to do our own thing we would first have to make that resolve through DEQ otherwise we had DEQ noise rules and fsec noise rules and there was any kind of conflict um you know the initial assessment was the DEQ noise rules have more Authority because they come out of Statute yours would are do not would not come out of Statute they would only come out of your your ability to create rules public health and safety that is generally your Authority through statute but not specifically noise so the resolve was really what are we trying to get to most of our projects are solar these wind sort of carve s have worked well for a long time let's just do this in a very surgical Manner and just make this you know applicable to just solar is what we're primarily seeing right now so that was but we did a a pretty significant amount of research to come to that conclusion yeah quick followup yes um are we adopting the rule or we making a recommendation to DEQ and they'll adopt it just DEQ okay yeah so I'm working with uh some folks over at DEQ um they're essentially doing they're doing a lot of the procedural stuff too so we are sort of acting as subject matter experts on this R making and then we're working together to actually get it out the door but then they'll be DQ will be the ones approving the rules any more questions expecting so much feedback on that one uh okay uh next slide did she get for doing so well on the previous agenda item I know okay so here's the uh here's the exciting slide this is proposed projects for 2024 and you'll note uh this is a substantial list given the number of projects we completed last year but we are going to just you know do our very best to get out as much role making uh work as we possibly can um pending sort of as you see here we basically have racks for all of them so that's sort of the kind of main factor in my mind in terms of the ability to actually uh accomplish this work or at least get it started in 2024 depending on how far down this list you go um so um you can see them here but I'm going to go through them one at a time so let's go ahead and go to the next slide so starting with the uh site certificate uh Amendment rle making uh we sort of pitched this last year to be on the 2023 schedule it it is you know sort of pushed to the end of of of last year we started on the",

        "text": " I don't know very much about those things I'm learning along the way but there they appear to be fairly robust and our analysis for organizational expertise relies mainly on representations from the applicant and um I I do believe we need to do a a deeper dive um uh we have letters from organizations saying I'm sure they will be able to get uh security um the Articles of Incorporation tell me a very different story and um that's a general comment and I know we we do have a plan for perhaps looking at this further but I want to make a comment with respect to this application and I um I think our analysis is is somewhat lacking so and I understand it's consistent with um the basic analysis we've done um in the past but I would like to see a stronger um of specifically financial information and their ability to start the project when they're telling us they're starting it um construction so thank you Mr chair if I might yes secretary cornette thank you for the record Todd cornette um so yeah just in response to Vice chair condon's comments so I just wanted to kind of remind Council where we're at in terms of Ru making um there's only different ways we can deal with this you know I think you know one of the ways is Ru making and so we are you know we we've completed the ru making alignment sort of the first phase of that that one's done uh we're we're doing the second phase uh this year which My Hope is that we're going to then consolidate the standards with the application requirements really that's more of a sort of you know not substantive the intent is not to to make any substantive changes to the rules um in terms of the standards themselves or the application requirements but then that's setting up for the next stage which would be the phase three um starting potentially next year where we'll then start looking at individual standards and then the application requirements for standards so that's where you know Tom's obviously here and other council members are here as well that's where at least we you know unless we hear you know direction from Council um prior to that we will definitely you know include that in you know that Ru making you you'll establish where you think that priority is to do you know organizational expertise um in relation to other standards but I think that's exactly where it would be the right opportunity to ask those questions of what really you know should be included in the application and what should the evaluation be um at that point I think then you the applicants and developers would be participating um you know members of the public others who where we can provide a lot more evaluation in that context so um just let everybody know that that is on tap uh unless we hear beforehand you know we want to make some change in direction that we are going to be looking at that what the outcome is like any rule making we don't know until we get into it but but we definitely have that on tap Vice chair Condon um thank you I apologize for the for the dog um and just a a comment at the last meeting um councelor Byer had brought up the question about is there a letter on file and I I did see in the material that there was a letter from the parent company um uh certainly committing the resources or behind the commitment to resources but um I believe that it talks about operation of the facility as opposed to construction and operation and um you know the parent company may managing many projects at the same time and um I would certainly be more comfortable with this letter talking about uh construction and operations not just operations but I so I I just ask that you review that letter thanks we move on I think so okay thank you very much uh Vice chair cond appreciate your comments thus far um okay so on to soil protection the soil protection standard requires that Council find uh that taking into account mitigation the design construction and operation of a facility are not likely to result in significant adverse impacts to soils taking into consideration soil risks such as erosion and chemical spills the applicant's evaluation of potential adverse impacts for this facility um considered the entire area of the solar array to be permanently um and in the DPO the department recommended conditions that would require the finalizing of an erosion and sediment control plan a Reclamation and revation plan construction and operation spill prevention control and now um we did there were comments on the record of the DPO um relating to the soil protection standard um specifically the differing approaches of vegetation management between two solar sites um where one site appeared to use chemical application instead of vegetation management and the other uh had more of a vegetation management approach or long-term soil impacts now uh in response to these um on additional review and consultation with the Oregon Department of Agriculture the department recommends um in the proposed order that Council include well recommends in the proposed order that Council include additional measures for long-term site stabilization and vegetation management into the soil protection standard findings these uh additional recommended measures which again were developed in consultation with the Oregon Department of Agriculture would include um among other things quantifying disturbance levels based on a final design layout the development of a fugitive dust control plan prior to construction additional consultation for uh for the development of revation methods and soil compaction testing both pre and post um we uh consultation with the orgon Department of Agriculture also um resulted in revisions to uh the noxious weed control plan and the Reclamation and revation planned um but those revisions are are in line with these additional measures that are presented here on the slide I do have those plans in the red line should Council like to look at them right now or I can move on but they are in line with this uh summary bulleted list okay I think I'm seeing a nod I will move on okay land use the land use standard requires the council find that a proposed facility complies with the Statewide planning goals adopted by the land conservation and development commission Council may find compliance with Statewide planning goals if the council finds that a proposed facility complies with applicable substantive criteria from the affected local governments acknowledged apprehensive plan and land use regulations that are required by the Statewide planning goals and in effect on the date the application is submitted the applicant uh for this facility requested council's consideration of a reasons exception um so going on to this next slide in the DPO the department recommended Council Grant an exception based on the uh four listed reasons here it being the four reasons being uh the the facility is locationally dependent there would be minimal impacts to agriculture within the subject tracks and surrounding area um agricultural related economic benefits and minimal impacts to other environmental resources projected uh by standards on the record of the draft proposed order both the SAG or the special Advisory Group um I see council member IMS has her hand up please council member i'ms um my comments are related to the prior um standard so I'm I'm I'd like you to finish your presentation and then maybe we could go back to that sure okay okay um so on the record of the draft proposed order both the SAG the special Advisory Group and council members expressed concern about the reasons recommended by the by the department as justifying a exception to goal three particularly uh related to the evidence and Analysis for the minimal impacts to agriculture within subject tracks um and I'll get to our our evaluation on the next slide um but also in the draft proposed order the department rejected the applicants argument that the proposed facility responds to important state and County goals and priorities as a reason justifying a goal three exception so now um as I just mentioned both the SAG and Council raised questions about the difference um between mitigation approaches proposed by the applicant as well as the applicant for the Sunstone solar project um and this is relating um minimal impacts to um and I just want to note and it's here on the slide that the two proposed facilities um that were referenced in comments the Sunstone solar project as well as this project The Wagon Trail solar project uh relied upon an agricultural economics analysis report by Eco Northwest Eco Northwest did both of the reports for both of those um and I do want to remind Council that to Grant a goal exception Council must find three things first being reasons that justify why the state policy um embodied in the applicable goal should not apply second being um the significant environmental economic social and energy consequences anticipated as a result of the proposed facility um that have been identified in adverse impacts that would be mitigated in accordance with the rules of the council applicable to the sighting of the proposed facility and lastly that the facility proposed facility is compatible with other adjacent uses or will be made compatible through measures designed to reduce adverse impacts so um with that in mind based upon further review of the applicant's analysis and in response to uh special Advisory Group and council's questions um the department sought legal council review of the Eco Northwest report the agricultural econom economic analysis report um and with that additional review for that specific report um the department has ultimately concluded that Eco North West applied similar methodologies in their analysis of both projects um and that the report for wagon trail demonstrates that um The Wagon Trail solar facility impacts to the agricultural economy would not be significant thus um under that uh finding or second point for Council to find uh and Grant a goal um the department does not believe that the report demonstrates that the impacts would be minimal for the wagon trail solar project um in other words there would be there would be some impacts it wouldn't be minimal there would there would be some therefore in the proposed order the department is that the theil find that minimal impacts to agriculture as a reason to support the goal exception be dropped like we don't think that that's um appropriate anymore with our additional evaluation however um that still leaves uh three reasons um that would justify taking an exception to goal three and those reasons would be that the dependency uh agricultural related benefit um and minimal impacts to other environmental resources protected by standards um with our additional review following comments from the SAG and Council we're also recommending uh amendments be made to land use conditions recommended land use 14 and 15 to ensure that um the mitigation funds represented in the application for site certificate uh are remitted prior to uh my next slide I guess just summarizes what I hope I just discussed um and so I guess this would be a great time to see if Council has any questions with uh the land use standard and how we're addressing comments received any questions from Council chair",

        "text": " do that activity we look at their ability to obtain a bond or letter of credit and then um we have this it's a legally binding requirement we'll talk about here in the slider too across mandatory conditions as well as individual conditions that they a certificate holder have a bond or letter of credit using a financial institution which is mostly aaa rated institutions and pre-approved by council that we have that in place prior to so just a little bit of an overview of where this standard came from um so the the standard originated at the same time that the council was established in 1975 where the where the legislature gave council the authority to adopt standards specifically addressing the financial ability and qualifications of an applicant to construct and operate an energy facility and then it was in the 80s when council started to adopt standard thumb statute um and i think in the beginning it was they were specific to types of energy uh rather than one wholesale standard like we have now and then it was in the to look at the ability of the applicant to obtain a underliner credit and then through the 90s we came into 2002 which is where the all of the previous energy type specific standards were consolidated into one which represents the standard that we have today um and so as i understand it the standard hasn't been modified since 2002. so i i think um i just wanted to take the time to make sure everyone understands the crossover and importance some standards and our division 21 um because it's all not everything is interrelated with everything else but there's a lot of information across our 30 exhibits that can feed into the evaluation of the retirement financial assurance standard again just making sure council understands that an application for site certificate has to contain exhibits and they're called exhibits a through cc that's 30 exhibits those exhibits have to have information that aligns with the information requirements in oar chapter 345 division 21 and it's extensive and this is the information that has been established as that that should inform the evaluation of compliance with council's 12 primary standards which apply to all f-sec jurisdictional energy and of course there's many other requirements beyond those 12 primary standards but we'll just stick with that for now so for the retirement and financial assurance standard there is a specific crossover with the organizational expertise standard and with conditions that are referred to as mandatory conditions and those are in rule and division 25 mandatory conditions apply and must be included in every site certificate for certificate holder so just to highlight you might be familiar but in the organizational expertise standard council has to make findings about an applicant's ability to retire the facility and their represented experience in retiring the and um that they have to have a demonstrated ability to restore the site to a useful non-hazardous condition so clearly those are some of the same requirements under retirement and financial assurance and so we look at some of that information that feeds into the organizational expertise um any of their experience and again you know what they what they provide uh in narrative about their ability to hire qualified contractors um and then just for your reference so our mandatory conditions i think we've pulled four here that have crossover with retirement and financial assurance and kind of give us more a very strong regulatory hook to um protection under the standard so we have um uh the a mandatory condition that requires that they submit a bond or a letter of credit a mandatory condition that requires that they um upon decommissioning within two years i believe submit to council for approval a final retirement plan and then they have to follow that retirement plan as they go through decommissioning in order to terminate their site certificate and then there's one last condition that if for some reason they don't aren't able to come forward with a retirement plan that gives the mandatory condition gives council the authority to create and impose one on their own okay so now i think we're going to try to do something that is i hope isn't overly complicated but um chase is going to explain the information requirements of exhibits w and m which both feed into the retirement and financial assurance and give you some context by helping you specific examples from the last application that this council approved give me one second and i will try to give it over to chase okay there we go let's see i do it okay thank you first can everyone hear me and also see my screen okay good thank you uh thank you sarah and and good afternoon madam chair grail vice chair howe and members of the council again for the record my name is chase mcveigh walker a senior signing analyst with the studying division at the department for the next couple slides i will try to provide an overview of the division 21 requirements for both exhibit m financial analysis and exhibit w site restoration and i'll start with the informational requirements of exhibit w which are here before you on your screen the information provided in exhibit w provides an overview of the decommissioning and site restoration activities that will be taken at the end of the facility's useful life and an estimate of their costs while the rules do not include detailed the information must be specific enough to validate the decommissioning bond or letter of amount proposed in exhibit exhibit w must include information about site restoration um including these five uh bullets which is the estimated useful life of the proposed facility specific actions and tasks to restore the site to a useful non-hazardous an estimate in current dollars of the and unit costs of restoring the site to a useful non-hazardous condition a discussion and justification of the methods and assumptions used to estimate uh site restoration costs and lastly for facilities that might site uh contamination by hazardous materials a proposed monitoring plan such as uh periodic environmental site and reporting or an explanation why a monitoring plan is unnecessary and now i'm going to try and do something a little bit tricky and show in this slideshow are you still able to see my screen okay and so what you should see before is half and half i have my current slide that i was just talking about with the information requirements from exhibit w on the left and on the right i have um exhibit w as provided by the applicant at the time now certificate for the madras solar energy facility and so this is the complete exhibit w provided in the complete application for site certificate and so i'll just thumb through these eight pages to show you what was provided let me see oops oops to begin with the applicant at the time and exhibit w a useful and estimated useful life for the facility and for madras specifically they estimated the useful life to be 40 years and then they copy out and say however it may operate for as long as there is a market for the production of electrical and i did look up um what was provided or s provided as an estimate for useful life originally for the montag wind power facility and in 2010 when it was originally approved the estimated useful life 25 to 30 years so i mean i know that's a wind facility and this is a solar facility but there is a range in what we're receiving as far as an estimate to useful life is concerned that's just next we roll into the narrative the applicant provides for retirement restoration um and there isn't actually a like a set methodology but they have to follow it's whatever they provide when we evaluate and here it was uh just narrative on the restoration actions which then flow into discussion and justification of the methods and assumptions used to formulate their cost estimate table which is at the end of this exhibit and we check and see if there's any check there there in-text citations and links provided to to validate what they're saying we also uh look back through the 29 other exhibits to to check and make sure that total tons match up to what is represented in exhibit b or you know water usage we look at water and we we so we just we do thumb through the the rest of the exhibits to make sure that what's represented here and their justifications and methods and tasks are and consistent and so here for madras as far as the monitoring plan is concerned they they indicate that it's not expected to cause site contamination and they provided a reason with why it's not expected and at the tail end of the exhibit in exhibit w we have apparently cost estimate and here they actually provided two cost estimate tables one battery storage was incorporated in and one where battery storage wasn't and this first table is the example where battery storage wasn't incorporated in and what we do look at is the units used in the quantities the cost per unit we do compare that to data sources and other cost estimates and something that i constructed myself a couple years ago when i was trying to cost estimates for particular facilities was a excel spreadsheet where i looked different approved and proposed um and specifically here we have a couple wind and natural gas and i wanted what i think what i was trying to do was compare the cost per acre of disturbance from generating sources because i was interested in seeing how it lined up and if there was a way to correlate cost per to new facilities and validate uh their cost estimates and i also looked at costs per megawatt generated and what i've what i've found and i apologize it's not it hasn't been expanded since but what i found was that solar in general on a cost per acre of ranges or usually falls in the range of like seven to ten thousand dollars is where we usually end up and these were all three of these bottom rows were for the boardman solar energy facility um in their original application but um this first one was our department's uh consultants estimate this was what was provided by the applicant when they followed cost estimate guide the department had for wind and this is ultimately the breakdown from the final order but like for for madras for example i did look at i don't have the number i apologize but i looked at what this total amount was or subtotal was and i divided that by my disturbance acreage and i got in that that seven to ten thousand dollar range that amongst other things is one way that i have been comparing facilities and and and validating what's validating the estimates and maybe just to um tee off that a little bit so if you if everyone remembers that this is one of the findings the council has to make that the amount for the decommissioning is satisfactory to counsel um and so we do spend a fair amount of time trying to make sure that the",

        "text": "It. It. It. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Marion County, Florida, county commissioners meeting. Today is March 5. If you could please. Well, no, let's call roll first. I'm sorry. Thank you, Madam Clerk. Chairman Stone. Here. Vice Chairman Bryant. Here. Commissioner Curry? Here. Commissioner McLean. Here. Commissioner Zalick. Here. Thank you. If you'll all rise with me for Commissioner Zalick to lead us in the invocation and pledge, bow your heads with me. Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for the opportunity to be here today to lead this community in discussion. And, Lord, we ask that you grant us wisdom as we approach that. Father, we ask that you continue to be with our first responders, both our police and our fire, that continue to sacrifice to make sure that we're safe. And, Lord, those that are continuing to protect us overseas and the things we see and that we can't see. Your grace is abound upon this community, and we just ask that you continue to bless it in our service to. In Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you for being with us today. I would like to share the announcements that we have this morning at 10:00 or as quickly as we can. While we are together this morning, we will pause from our county commission meeting and go into a public hearing to adopt the procurement ordinance. Immediately following behind that, we do have another public hearing regarding the amendment to the Marion County Public School impact fee ordinance. Today at 130, this board will meet again on a workshop to finalize the $0.01 infrastructure surtax project list. Again, we'll be together on March 19 for our regularly scheduled Board of County Commissioner meeting on the third Tuesday of the month here in these chambers. And that morning on the 19th, we have a 10:00 a.m. public hearing to consider an amendment to the Marion County Land Development Code related to section 4223 rule, commercial zoning classifications, intent, list of permitted and special uses, development standards and design. That same afternoon, on March 19, at 02:00 p.m. the county commission will meet for zoning. So those are our only announcements today, and with that, I will move us to item number one on our agenda for proclamations and presentations. So moved. I've got a motion by Commissioner Bryant, second by Commissioner Zalick. All in favor indicate with aye. Aye. Any opposed? That motion carries unanimously. Our first item proclamation is for the National Red Cross Month, and Skip Kramer is here. The national community volunteer leader for the American Red Cross of North Florida. And Commissioner Bryan is going to read that. And behind that, we'll have our gardening month proclamation with John Holcomb, and we've got Commissioner McLean, who will take the lead on that. So, commissioners. All right, come on up, Skip, and anybody that you have with you. Good morning. So good to see you this morning. How are you, sir? Good morning. Thank you. Beautiful city. Good to see you as well. Good morning. Good, good to see you. All right, Skip, you get to be the guy front and center here, unless there's somebody else that you're appointing to be front and center. And the rest of you get to come in here in the middle of all of us. And we're excited to have you here this morning. On behalf of the Red Cross and on behalf of the Marion County Board of county commissioners, I'd like to present you with this proclamation. It says, whereas the American Red Cross, established in 1881 and originally chartered by Congress in 1900, operates without federal funding, relying on volunteer efforts and donor generosity, and whereas the American Red Cross is dedicated to alleviating human suffering during emergencies by mobilizing volunteers and receiving support from donors, responding to over 65,000 disasters annually, and providing vital services to armed forces members, veterans and families, and wHeReas, march is nationally recognized as Red Cross Month, commemorating the organization's 143rd anniversary, the 110th anniversary of Florida's first chartered Red Cross chapter, established in northeast Florida in 1914, and wHeReas the American Red Cross has a history of responding to emergencies in northeast Florida, including support during the Yellow fever epidemic of 1888, the Spanish American War, and the Great Jacksonville Fire in 1901, and wHeReas the North Florida region of the American Red Cross, spanning 13 counties and serving as headquarters for the 35 county Red Cross North Florida region, helped over 1200 families affected by disasters and offered vital services to military members and veterans in 2023, with ninety cents of every dollar donated directly supporting mission services, now, therefore, the Board of County Commissioners of Marion County, Florida, by virtue of the authority vested in us, do hereby proclaim that the month of March 2024 be known as National Red Cross Month, honoring everyday heroes who step up when help can't wait, and commend the volunteers and paid staff of the North Florida region for their continuing humanitarian service to Marion county and to the state of Florida. Duly proclaimed this fifth day of March 2024, signed by all five county commissioners and attested to by Mister Gregory C. Harrell, our clerk of court. So thank you for all you do. Wow, there was some interesting numbers in there, so I'm going to hand you the microphone and you can tell us about anything that's happening or maybe any needs that you may have at this point and say anything you want. This really is an honor, and I want to congratulate the commission as you all approach your 180th birthday anniversary. We share March as Red Cross month, but also Marion county month. So it's just really a pleasure to be here with you. The folks that get it done are the ones to my left. This is an outstanding team of Red Cross volunteers and one of our pate staff members. And I'm going to introduce a few of them. First, Ricardo Rosario, very handsome fellow in a nice suit. You're looking good, Ricardo. He is the disaster program manager that serves this area, so he is sort of your man on the ground, and he is in Gainesville for his center of operations, but he serves all of the counties under his umbrella. When I saw one of our volunteers kiss one of the members of the commission, I know we're close in the community. Well, Joe Lacugnada, of course, is here with your fire department, but he was recognized as a volunteer of the year, I think, two years ago, Joe, for the partnership that not only his response to disasters, but also the partnership with his fire department for his work. Nadine and I just met live for the first time this morning. We talk about, we don't call them senior volunteers. They're legacy volunteers, and I'm now in that state status. So we're delighted to meet her as one of our longest standing volunteers here in Marion county. And let's see, I, did I miss anybody who I got. Oh, Mark. Mark Greenberg, also looking very distinguished. I almost made him a pay staff. Mark is another volunteer that has been recognized, but these are the folks that are responding to you here locally. What do we need? How do we make this work? It's all with volunteers. The message this morning is we are looking for partnership opportunities and for organizations, faith groups that we can form partners with and individuals that we can bring on board as volunteers, because what happens? And we had almost 100 responses last year to single family fires and events here, including some multifamily apartment fire, very large, one tornado that went through. These are the folks that respond. But it can be a burden if we don't have enough volunteers. We have about 30, 31 in Marion county. We would love to have more. We will train you. We have virtual, we have live volunteers, and we have all of the functions that any large organization would have in terms of opportunities to volunteer. I'm a volunteer. I used to be a paid staff person years ago. For the last 20 years, though, I'm volunteer, so those are our needs. And I would just like to thank our volunteers that are here serving in Marin county and Ricardo for making it happen here. We've had about 45 responses, Red Cross responses so far in our fiscal year, which is last eight months. So we're busy. We're busy, but we love to have more volunteers. So thank you for the opportunity to make my little speech and my appeal. How does someone become a volunteer? Very easy process. It's all done online to get you started, and it's redcross.org dot. You get to a website and on the bar at the top, there is a selection there for volunteer. When you complete the little application, it automatically routes to our chapter area so that we. And within 48 hours, you're contacted and you're ready to go. We do a background check, just like other organizations that serve vulnerable populations, be it the Boy Scouts, YMCA, et cetera. But it's very, very simple. And then we start training and bringing you on board, engaging, giving you opportunities to do so many more things. Whatever it is you're interested in doing, it's about the volunteer having a great red Cross experience. Well, thank you for all that information. I'm going to go ahead and give this to you, and we're all",

        "text": " we should probably walk a little bit of time just to get an introduction to that okay um so we're ready in January day that's good very that's a good one to defer to the professional staff that the the the board the board can direct us to do that research if they'd like Ken's idea yeah I'll summarize it um any other comments before uh we move on to yes Florida okay I was just going to say back to um the position letters that we send out the one about the analysis of Alternatives letter I mean I I honestly didn't feel prepared to weigh in on it and that's that was just that was sort of unpleasant I think I even emailed you I did not understand and um you know I guess that's that's my responsibility to a degree but really I'm not usually totally clueless about something and that just had me baffled it could have been the day I read it I don't know but I think a subcommittee or Sun preparation for these letters before they go out so that so then I uh you know understand you know what what what we're common a little better I know for um the staff can facilitate a call to talk through the points and clarify any that is an idea as an interim step between the subcommittee and finalizing absolutely okay so the next item on the list is uh Mark is going to tell us about vacancies on the board we still have vacancies we have we have one right now I mean the legislative ones of course are going to potentially get changed which is out of our control but we still have a vacancy that we needed to build so is this vacancy public at large yes okay so if you know anyone that would be interested please talk to them or give uh Max and either phone number and we'll talk to them is there a region you want to focus on yeah one more thing that I could plug uh the permission of speaking of regions um our division is also working on the energy security plan for the state um and we just got uh State energy program funding from the defense to do that last week and that's exciting because they're late but earlier than we were expecting um but we are doing a Outreach Statewide and looking for organizations that represent underserved historically underserved communities um and environmental justice communities so if you have any suggestions for folks that we can contact and get involved in the process early on to really get some input on where mitigation and have the best bang for the buck for those communities that would be welcome so email Max annoy and yeah our nuclear issues our energy security plan covers electricity liquid fuels natural gas petroleum and propane that's what I meant propane it was a p word I might suggest that I don't know how we do the Outreach but uh moral and then you may tolerate behind it will be uh Oregon's first two majority minority counties and uh you know largely Hispanic and whether we did with some Outreach that or Spanish so our next meeting will likely be in the hermists well it's important okay but we didn't mention last year we'd already been bored you know it's probably a balance between going to the site versus staying in our state but close to the same right it's just right there and I would suggest foreign worked well for us last year but of course check the calendar the place another major obligation the first week of October uh the emssab meeting is in Oak Ridge so Environmental Management it's like the right specific Advisory Board okay and the Hanford Advisory Board is making their calendar uh in June so we can make sure they work around us okay okay well we'll send out some emails for specific things but look towards the second week of October um the Boardman um River Lodge was always a great place to stay yeah people are medical there is over there bring your own water would it make sense to reach out to c2ir and see if the Googling the host we could do that too yeah what's that see yeah that's a good point we did go to the math question yeah you have to go to the reservation and you understand very beautiful hotel experience sounds good okay uh that concludes for business unless anyone has anything else to add I I have something please I've been talking talking it around a bit and it sort of falls into one different proposed to that on the board to address and I'm very concerned about of radioactive Wastewater into the Pacific potentially this June well I think it is going to happen this June and I wonder if the board can take a position on that and it's very short notice even if you would do it I think it's dire so the I guess a question for uh our agency friends is that in the purview of this board in any way shape or form it seems outside of this perjury of the story I would say all right okay might be outside of the produce board yeah I wanted to suggest we are focused on Hanford and Northwest issues and how it might affects the state of Oregon and I'm not sure that the water will affects the state of Oregon although but we do have a question report it seems it seemed I think I'm leaving for the board but that seems a little Beyond but I would feel a couple of those agency fair enough fair enough I just thought I'd throw it out so yeah okay thank you anything else anyone I I said one quick thought of course being the Newbie here I'm trying to keep my mouth shut until I figure out where where things are headed but I thought it was interesting person panels not here to to argue but um you know when the suggestion was made that you know they are quote unquote setting aside 80 um I thought that's a bit of analogous to say look we're going to allow 80 of water flow down the river it's the massive quarters of any trading it's the other 20 um and then it falls somewhere between you know the unrestricted uh industrial uh portion in the 100 sector right or uh the 200th sector which is is is the ongoing stuff right now maybe at grandfather's forward or the suggestion that the southeast area is is something different and they're able to sell all portions of that and uh you know Laura's suggesting well we need to go back and make this pristine why not 100 Christine has started there and the suggestion that well you can't go uh you know post settlement uh pre-manhattan why I don't know if so for me it's kind of interesting you know like where we all in this and this whole thing I mean great question sorry I have similar thoughts and and they share that question about their their Monument lands have been set aside by the area that seems on the southwestern portion of the site and then across the um and I think that's probably included in when um Brian Harkin was mentioning eight percent of the land has been set aside the notification like well yes and it always has been that's sort of a buffered some right to decide him other people around so um it's hard to say you know and the uh I hope by the way I'm gonna say I hope the board enjoyed the format we did today is a little different uh we didn't get the typical updates from the agencies like we often do but that was in the trade-off to having a more of a focused conversation about one thing and I hope it was worth the organizational plan okay um yeah I was happy with how it came together yeah I might also comment that we didn't see a lot of difference in their vision of these animals they seem pretty well aligned at least in the short term about the direction that the site is going I I saw a pretty big but they their Vision was not using it first up and then so sure Simon from Yakima folks that they also were saw the main use being traditional uses they both did the same open to certain kinds of development as long as they were involved in it but it also very much seemed like they had a vision of it not being used for industrial industrial partners and things like that and Kermit even mentioned it from this person if you sign I didn't know but I forgot to forget but I didn't have the opportunity to bring it up about co-management use that Embrace a few times in code management that's a very that's it that's different right than just having federal government Representatives running the whole site it's quite a different approach um and you mentioned that a few times so I think it would be interesting to understand the process for the release of land uh where that goes and who's in those conversations and how does the public get involved in that or how is the school get an opportunity to weigh in on that because it's quite easy for them to sit there and say well we don't know how because they don't that's not their focus but there are people on site who do have at some point the land will be released and how could we if we choose to stay support the tribes in we have that table where decisions are made on what the future of the piece of land is because it looks like it will be that's that's the nature of these to the size Panther so I think about that and the blender it shouldn't no more try to understand more and it was interesting to hear the idea that the institutional controls or deep restrictions and that's the way it works normally but the land out there isn't needed yet um because it's Federal and it doesn't have a d so you can't put a deep restriction yeah so when that's the first step of transferring it is to to create a deed for that person that's being transferred so that's where that process would start and I wonder if there's a Washington process for you know commenting on the creation of a deed diet it's an interesting question yeah yeah it's not a thing that usually comes up very often right now how many personals out there that don't have Deeds I can't think of many thoroughly on yeah I think it's very nice to talk about being at the table about And discussing this but I think the place is going to be decided is in a courtroom okay anyone anything else Dan just I think we should kind of keep paying attention to the office of legacies management and how they're doing it on other sites because there's the picture they painted to put obviously management abilities it's not just matched with folks who live around rocket Flats seem to think of the opposite like a Spanish for people who keep an eye on that thank you comments from the uh the back section the peanut gallery yeah Gary Rogers Tom mentioned Hanford more information",

        "text": " I'm chair girl Cindy Condon um just to speak to that I I understand that technical expertise but to me on the front end and um and this could be argued I suppose um it's the financial resources that are required to to do the project to um even start the project and obviously they can get a bond or we they wouldn't start construction without the bond but um and I'd be maybe incorrect In thinking this but um this site certificate should we issue it has real value and the state of Oregon and landowners and uh people approximate to to the project maybe are relying on on what is presented in that site application and so for me the financial resources and the financial assurance that they'll have the resources necessary to do the development um is an important piece of that expertise because they're telling us when we get a site application we're going to start construction within three um and we have this great plan but if they're not given the financial resources to do it um they have a valuable site certificate that we've issued that doesn't benefit the state of Oregon as we saw it when we issued the site thank you for those comment I just want to check in with counselor talk to to make sure he doesn't have anything um well then at this point Patrick were you going to say something after Cindy just made her last comment no okay so at this time I think um for myself um I I understand um the comments that have been made I like the idea of the condition being consistently applied I think this is a bigger lift than than just quote verify an organizational expertise and I want to make sure that we allow time amongst ourselves and then staff so if we do engage or when we engage we're making that we're doing it um and the most thoughtful manner I believe there's going to be significant interest from from stakeholders on the topic and so that's something that I would be mindful of Todd I I guess my question is do we have to you know we have to make a decision right now this was an information item and I think that um I I would you know be curious to you know see where it fits in um overall I think it is important I think there's definitely room to tighten it up but I don't think this is going to be a de minimis effort so Madam chair to respond to your question it's not any time it's not this um so you know we have the rulemaking um we'll be luckily luckily we can get through the phase two rule making alignment because we have the contested case one coming up we have the amendment one so we have a couple of big ones coming up so you know we're looking you know into 2024 anyway so we it's sometime before we would even realistically get to this even if you know at that time when we get into that phase three rulemakings even if you decided this was the top priority of Standards to look at these two standards it still would be likely in 2024 um so we're a little ways out no matter what again unless you wanted to re-prioritize you know your rule making schedule which you certainly could do but if we follow the rule making you know we would be getting into that phase three likely in 2024 then we would come back to you with the request of what is your preference in terms of priorities of these standards and certainly you could revisit this then but it is good to know now if you know at least at this conversation you're thinking yeah we absolutely want to pursue this and we think this is you know the highest priority if not one of the higher priorities that gives us some ability to kind of plan and I totally agree with exactly what you said I think there's going to be a lot of interest in um I think this will take some time we'll have to have some good thoughts about this even before we initiate you know rule making and Rule making advisory committee but I agree that there will be a lot of interest in participation in this thank you so from from my perspective I mean and maybe I'm just my brain's not quite working because I focused on something else to fly uh what I would what I would propose is that we say you know I think all of us acknowledge the importance of it um I'm not a fan of altering the schedule just because there's always going to be a thing and we haven't had and I don't mean this you know to minimize the issue but it's not as if there has been a you know a serious safety incident or even a financial thing that we've identified where something has quote been broken so to speak so I don't I don't personally think we should alter from the schedule that we've already set um and this is one of the challenges of virtual meetings right uh I if you know Tom as the rulemaking rules making coordinator probably had something to say uh on the topic so my opinion is keep the schedule as is and put this near the top of a priority list um those are just my thoughts chair Grill this is Kent yes sir I agree with you completely high priority but uh stick to the schedule thank you anyone else have an opinion to that idea this is Cindy I I agree with that as okay thank you this is Anne I agree I think it's good to keep with the schedule and do some more homework on this pretty darn complex issue excellent thank you well Patrick thank you very much that was extremely informative and uh I would say thought provoking because now my mind is churning um on a new topic that I hadn't worried about very much now I'm not worried but I definitely have ideas so thank you for breaking that down in a way that was uh uh palatable to digest and understand we always appreciate uh you providing the Insight that you do to yeah your welcome is helpful for me to go through it uh yeah these are always available also if you want to refresh your recollection just a reminder you can always revisit our Council meetings on on your website and if you'd like this presentation in particular I'd be happy to send it to you separately uh that would be wonderful thank you all right well we're gonna move on to our next agenda item which is the Cascade renewable transmission system special Advisory Group appointments this is an action item we have Christopher Clark Odo senior citing analyst prepared to present Christopher welcome and the floor is yours thank you chair Grail can you all hear me okay yes yes uh well thank you uh yeah as you said for the record my name is Christopher Clark I'm a senior citing analyst with the Odo sighting Division and I'm going to be uh presenting staff's recommendation for Council to a point uh local governing bodies as special advisory groups for the Cascade renewable transmission system um next slide please Nancy great so uh as a little background on March 7th uh Odo received a notice of intent to file an application for site certificate for the Cascade renewable transmission system the applicant is Cascade renewable transmission LLC uh which is a joint venture of power Bridge LLC and sun2o partners LLC I believe power Bridge came and gave you a presentation on this project uh last year I believe um Power bridge is based out of Connecticut and they've developed uh similar transmission projects connecting to New York and New Jersey uh one of those is called the Neptune uh project and uh the other is called The Hudson Project I believe um I'm going to go over some of the specifications of the Cascade renewable transmission system in the next slide um I did just want to point out that due to the size location and capacity of the proposed facility is a energy facility subject to abstract jurisdiction next slide please okay so and forgive a typo here this project or this facility is a proposed 320 kilovolt DC transmission line that would span about 100 miles between the dials and the majority of the wine would be buried in the bed of the Columbia River using a hydrojet cable burial machine or a jet plow that's sometimes called additional segments would be buried in Road right aways adjacent to the river or installed under some channels and some other areas using horizontal Directional Drilling there'd be two converter stations constructed at near the both points of interconnection for the line in the dowels the line would interconnect with the big big Eddy substation at the BPA complex there um it'd be connected to the big 80 substation with about 500 feet of overhead 500 KV AC line um on the Portland and there'd be a converter Station built in the Rivergate industrial district in North Portland um and that would be connected to pge's existing harborton substation which is a little South there and across the lamb River uh by about three miles of uh 230 KV AC wine that would be either buried underground in Road rights away or and then installed under the Willamette River using horizontal regression next slide please so yeah this map just shows kind of a vicinity map of the this is the proposed alignment that was included in the notice of intent um there is a bigger site boundary which I can show on my next slides but I just want to point out that in several places though the line as it's proposed would crossover into Washington in particular there's a about Seven Mile Stretch that would be trenched in the right-of-way of Washington State Route 14 and some other roads near Stevenson to avoid the Bonneville Dam complex um all the sections of the the line that are in Washington um will also be subject to review by the Washington half staff um and then the entire projects also subject to Federal review by the Army Corps of engineer in other next slide please so since we're talking about special Advisory Group appointments I did just want to give some detail of uh where the line crosses uh through local jurisdictions in general in Oregon the wine is in Wasco Hood River and Multnomah counties and then uh six other cities this map shows where the wine passes through the city limits of the dowels as you can see uh the line connects the spaghetti which is that green square on the right hand side of the image uh kind of winds down the BPA complex and then follows Highway 197 up into the city of The Dalles it then passes along the rights of way of Highway 30 and East 2nd Street and then would enter the River via horizontal drilling near the Dallas Marina this uh so yeah you can see there that it then exit into the portions of the river",

        "text": " region. So this is a good location to have this. It keeps the major, the larger trucks off the roads that travel all the way would have to travel all the way across the county from every lot and every tree that's being trimmed and serviced and cleared here in this region. So this is almost a traffic reduction project. So you're not sending people all the way across the county. I've got a map of some of the locations that these are available in the county. There's not a lot of them. I believe we've got about three that are identified. If I can come approach and pass these out. The distances that you'll see on this map are, as the crow flies, they're not the routes that it would take, but the closest one is 14.4 miles away, and that's the baseline landfill. And so that would have to travel underneath. I know you've heard complaints before of people when we're doing rezoning requests of neighborhoods in that region, of all the traffic congestion that we have underneath on 484, going underneath the interstate, all those trucks are going to pass underneath the interstate there. If they don't come here when they're doing the work in this region, then the other ones are approximately 21 miles away, straight direction. I don't know how many miles it would be if you had to drive it. Probably closer to 25 or 30. But this is a sensible location. It's on a large piece of property. I mean, we're talking 2600 acres. They've got the equipment. If we're worried about fire spreading, they've got the equipment on site to fight fire loaders, excavators, those types of things, you start getting a brush fire, they can go and cut a ring around it really quick or just put it out by running over it with the rake. I've actually done land clearing in the past, so I'm fairly familiar with it. The air curtain is the way to go to keep your smoke and your ash way down and not cause a problem for the neighbors. So they're putting everything in place to make this a good, well run facility. They have their water management district permit for consumptive use to keep Dustin and to have water on site if there was a need to work for fighting a fire. And they also move forward with FDEP air permit. So they. One of the requirements of the FDP air permit is for them to have a zoning in place that allows them to perform this type of activity. So I believe it's a good location for this type of activity. I would say if not here, where this is a need, it's something that has to be done. If you're not. If you don't provide it somewhere in the county, then you're going to start seeing illegal dumping occurring back here on some of these empty lots. It's not something we want. There needs to be an outlet for people to be able to dispose of this type of material. Very good. Thank you. Yes, sir. Any questions for applicant real quick before he sits down? Okay. Anyone here like to speak in favor of this? Seeing. None. Anyone like, are you guys in favor or opposition? Right. You all in favor? Okay. Anyone like to speak in favor of it? You're welcome to come down. Can somebody get me oxygen? I haven't ever had this many people come in favor of anything of mine. I'm surprised. Yeah, I thought they're in opposition. And you'll state your name and address for the record and then also sign in? Right. Thank you. My name is Stormy Helton. I just. I want to. I just want to state a few things. At Marion Oaks. There's heavy equipment on those roads every single day. I don't know if anybody's been out there to see the building going on out there, but it is insane. We get hired to come out there and to haul all of this debris from all of this land that is being cleared, and then we have nowhere to take it because dumpster closing down daily. They're shutting down because they're full, because they're grinding Gru. And Gainesville's not taking the chips anymore. So what do you do? I mean, we have to have somewhere to take this stuff or the building has to stop. The land clearing has to stop. So that's one thing. The other thing is, like he said, the roads, 484 I 75, highway 326. It's overly congested. And 90% of the hauling that we get calls for is out of Marion Oaks. And I mean, it's a lot. There's a lot of building going on in there and there's probably five or six more years of building going on there. And there's already. If you drive around Florida Highlands and Marion Oaks, there's illegal dumping everywhere. So I am definitely in favor of this. We need something like this in Marion County. I have spoken with the Department of Environmental Protection and they are very much aware that there is an issue for where we can dump our debris. So definitely in favor of this. And I ask that it be passed. Okay, thank you. Anyone else want to speak in favor of your address, sir? Sorry, I need her address for the record. I'm sorry. Address? It's 451 Northeast 155th street road. Citra 32113. Anyone else like to speak in opposition to this? None. Is an application. None. Would the applicant like to come back forward or are you good with what you've. I'm good with what I've said. I mean, if there's any questions that you got, I'll be happy to answer them. Okay. Hearing none, I will close the floor to public comment, open it up to the members to make a decision and a recommendation. I got one question on that. The parcel that's up above there, I think it's probably to the north. But is that stockpiling site or is that burning and grinding site? Question perhaps for staff or Mister Tillman? So it'll be. They'll be stockpiling and burning at both locations? Both site a and site b. With over 2000 acres, why is it right up against where there's property that could be residential buildings? I mean, it's where. It's where the activity has been occurring. And so rather than relocating and rebuilding everything because there haven't been any complaints in the past, it was a sensible location to continue that activity. Is this an existing location? Old location. You're reopening it or this is a brand new location. So site b would be new location. This is existing location that the activity has been occurring on a site? Yes. On site a. It's already existing. That's correct. And that's. Staff has opposition on that too. Right. It's been existing without approval. Without approval. Right. Somebody. Right. It's been operating. It was not. There was not a zoning in place to allow it. It was occurring. That's correct. Any other questions, just for purposes of the record? There was one letter of opposition received. Thank you. That is part of it from a property owner that says she's within 300ft of it. That is part of what staff provided. So I would like to clarify that the 300ft notification that the lady says she's 300ft away, I don't know exactly where she lives, so I do not know. But they notified everyone around the entire 2600 and something acres, so it's not like she's necessarily three. She's not 300ft away from this site because nobody's. 300ft away from the site is 375 ever. It's a 375 anyway, so nobody. Miss Tillman. Yes, sir. Is there any way to get to this area without having to go through this 165th or 63rd street? What I'm trying to say is that the only. Not that I'm aware of, sir, I would have to study that to see if there was another route to get there, but I do not know of one off the top of my head, but I haven't researched to see if there was any other access at all. So your question is going through neighborhood, right? Right. So suppose we deny, let's say we go with the staff recommendation. It's going to go through many, many, many neighborhoods, not only one in 14 miles, 21 miles. They can pick any road. Well, I just. Yes, no, I understand. If there's anything. How do we. They could put a, you know, go without having to go through this residential area? And I recognize your question, Mister Bonner. You're looking for a. An alternative access that would allow it not to occur. But I don't know that it exists, as per. I'm just saying it's just difficult to take this kind of decision because if you do, you have this problem and if you don't, you have that problem. One of the things, what I'm just thinking about also here is there's, and I've somehow or another heard of this somewhere else other than in this room. Those trucks are still going to. Going to come in or somebody's trucks are going to come in to collect the debris that's already in that Marion Oaks and 100% waterways, is it? Or the one anyway, the subdivision to it. So trucks, some trucks of that size are going to be on that road anyhow. And my first thought was, but not daily. So, hey, is there another way? But if you send it out to 484 and then back around a different way, now you've just kind of done the same thing, added the trips. Well, a road like 484 is going to be built different than a local residential road in Marion Oaks. I'm sorry? A road that's in Marion Oaks is going to be very different from something like 484. No, no, I understand that. But you're still going",

was out objection are there any objections or comments or hearing none the meeting minutes from the last meeting are approved uh the next order of business is uh Laura Feldman will offer the land good morning everyone we respectfully acknowledge that our advocacy activism and learning takes place on lands we inhabit throughout Oregon and Washington and cared for by indigenous tribes and bands since time the Hanford nuclear weapons side encompasses culturally significant lands belonging to the Wanapum and tribes and bands of the Yakima Nation the confederated tribes of the unatilla Indian Reservation the Nazareth tribe and the Spokane Indian Reservation we acknowledge the economic and social values including systemic racism classism and the disregard for indigenous black and immigrant communities that made harm to this place the interconnectedness of the people in the land and the natural environment cannot be overstated the health of one is necessary for the health of all we recognize the pre-existing and continued sovereignty of these another traditional ecological knowledge and perspective on how we might care for one another in the land we are honored to be guests here we commit to working towards cleanup and future tribal use as stewardship of these lands these Waters thank you Laura um we do have time for public comment at 2 15 this afternoon toward the end of the meeting so we will be happy to entertain any comments from the public at that time so now we're going to transition to the main topic of the day and that's a panel discussion on the future use of the Hanford side so Stephen better the Oregon Hanford Creed on board Vice chair is going to facilitate the uh the panel discussion so over you Stephen all right thank you so uh we want to try and do is have our panelists kind of gather that table over there at the end so that we can see them um so uh maybe I should uh maybe I'll introduce to our panels are and then who has their introduced if they migrate to the table at the end of that work yeah all right so um we've got a really wonderful group today we have Brian Harkins from the VOE um and then that was technology and uh uh and we're in Contreras on the phone with uh those purse um and uh and then there's like a reply from trident butchered everyone's name and while we're getting situated oh yes uh so the the structure that we're going to have is uh everybody will have a uh um a chance to speak for a few minutes uh their perspective and their groups sort of uh notion of where the use of the site or the ultimate kind of use of the type might look like um it may seem really far away it is really far away but it's also never too early to start thinking intentionally about where thank you oh there you go and if you're on the phone uh only and you're muted uh you can hit star six to unmute if you have a yeah so maybe uh I believe everybody um had a chance to put together some compared thoughts so what I thought we'd do is maybe kind of go in order and then we will have uh Transit tour of a discussion period kind of thing we've got some discussion questions and of course I want my information for each other we can have a have a conversation so um then actually um Brian the Julie how about you take it away and start us off thank you um I did send some slides in did you want to use them or you just won't be absolutely let's uh let's pull those slides up so um I thought I would take a moment and just so tangential subject to what we're going to discuss here today but I just to acknowledge what's happened in the recent uh history of Hanford recent meeting I've been there 29 years now there's a lot of things that have happened since I've been there so although most of you are recognize when I talked through when I started there one of the first projects I was on was the infamous Burpee tank five people have forgotten what it was like back when it started there and what the controls were in place and the hazards that we faced with the Berkeley tank and the potential for that tank to I worked at pfp and if you were to go where PFC stood it's no longer there has been completely torn down and they moved we're very contaminated facility when I started there the badge you went to the 100 area to get your badge and um and there's hardly anything left in the hundred area there's a couple facilities one under cleanup there's one other use of didn't know and then there's a few buildings the fire station et cetera that's still there but most everything's been there for years when I drove by the area of the Dome or like a little small reactor drum stood there as a monument it's all gone all cleaned up and so as you go around the site there's a lot of work that's done a lot of change has happened probably the most too significant things that I point out this time is we are so close to starting a bit I expect that they'll restart up the heat of the melters hear about the 1st of June so they're going through the startup testing of the replacement components it'll be a significant step forward when we introduce right ways into that facility slow methodical process to start up so we're still a probably almost a year away from introducing rad material into it they'll go through a very careful testing to make sure all the systems are going to perform as expected and within the requirements but a huge step forward recommencing work now on the hlw facility to get that system or that facility online big step award for the sign so uh and then the other thing I I'd point out is when I started there established a set aside organization called twrs for tank farms and that's where I started in twrs that became the office of river protection and the two offices have worked together but separately potential that the the offices were separated the way they were in other cases it was just the natural uh evolution of the site but we really did deviate in our processes and the way that we uh progressed the mission and as we look forward to today how that established orp to Sunset and we would go back to one office as we anticipate that we've worked hard to start integrating those two offices back to one office in doing so we're identifying areas people are efficient perspective in our mission office so bring that as just background as we start this discussion of where we're going the department has has said that we've had at least 50 more years worth of cleanups were yeah the significant amount of work that still has to be performed and in that work as we talk about future land use we need to be looking forward to that day but we can't jump the dive either we need to have the site cleaned up where it's safe for people to be honestly so the steps that we'll talk through and discussions at this big today are good I just recognize all right I'll jump through this it's a fairly short presentation with just a quick discussion about uh the Hanford site land use plan so so doe Office of Environmental Protection uh our Environmental Protection excuse Environmental Management uh you know it is the largest environmental cleanup program in the when they established em there were 107 sites across the country that they're responsible for cleaning up 92 of those cleanups have been completed we're down to the last remaining 15. some of those smaller sites are progressing towards the last steps of the process West Valley for example they're tearing down the the containment structures and making progress there and so the list will continue to go down but there are still significant sites and EM owns all of Hanford whereas if you look at the Savannah River that's a coincide em has all of that the significant you know as we complete our end our mission the processed by Billy award return over the land to the office of Legacy they are responsible for the post-closure responsibilities at ensuring future protection even help in the environment so there is a process that if you can look in the daily order it will describe the process for when the cleanup work is is finished and what happens to the land processes",

introductions of the uh Odo team here thank you everyone uh just wanted to uh say hello and thank you all for uh coming today this is uh uh our first uh on camera or meeting advisory committee meeting uh in several months uh we've been doing it just a little bit differently lately but uh as always it's nice to uh get back and and join up with our committee members as well as the public uh we've got a couple of different things to go through today we're having a little bit of a different type of a meeting today we're going to uh uh cover items that we usually cover in the advisory committee and then as many people know we've had some proposed rule changes based on statutory approved statutory changes to the C program and so we decided to extend this meeting just a little bit uh so towards the end we're going to have some additional time uh for some public commenting uh that's going to be at that point isolated to uh the rule change proposals uh that's going to be a part of the presentation that my colleague James uh is going to be doing here a little bit later on um but before before we get going just want to uh introduce myself and the colleagues here from Odo uh my name is Jason canal and I'm the senior incentive analyst for the C program and I'll go ahead and turn it over to uh my colleague Patricia also in the C program now who has just recently been hired to come into that position so go ahead Patricia I I'm Patricia I am here to help with the c program but I'm also helping with the uh the background of the of the webinar so if you have some issues or need some help um please put something in the chat or raise your hand and we'll we'll see what we can do to help you out um D hi I'm Dart Hedley I was formerly in uh Trisha's position as an analyst on the C program and I'm currently the manager for energy incentives at Odo yeah James hi James kogal uh policy Tera Odo working across a number of the programs and I'm also the administrative rule coordinator so be talking about uh the program rules a little later on um pass it over to Christie hi everyone I'm chrisy split I'm the Oregon Department of Energy's government relations coordinator but also helped kick off the C program and I will always have a special place on my to-do list so glad to be here today yeah we'll go and take it to good afternoon everyone I'm pandin krishn Swami I'm the assistant director for energy development services division um welcome to the advisory committee meeting um back to you Jason and Christie thank you well uh thank you everyone let's go ahead and jump into the uh next slide please um real quick before we get going as always we're just going to go through a couple of uh Logistics uh and just wanted to make sure that everyone is aware that we are recording uh today's meeting and it will be posted online uh afterwards uh and feel free to uh use the chat feature to ask questions uh Patricia is monitoring the chat and we'll probably utilize that a little bit more we get into the public comment period uh and as always uh if you have a question even advisory committee members uh please use the raiseed hand function to indicate that so that we can get you set up to ask your question uh and as always we we sort of have two public comment periods for this one uh we're going to go through the advisory committee portion and then we'll have some uh uh both advisory committee time to discuss items on the agenda as well as than any public comments related to the meeting and then as I said before we'll have an extended time to get exclusively into public comments on the proposed uh rule changes for the C program uh and if you have any questions Patricia is in the background to be able to help you with any Tech issues and if we could go to the next please thank you I'm just going to leave this up as kind of our general uh slide so that you can look to see how to operate WebEx uh in this capacity on your screen for uh responses asking a question or use of the chat we'll just leave that up for just a moment and if we could go to the next please and uh as always just want to be sure that uh how we're going to facilitate this meeting is that we do have uh as panelists our advisory committee uh and the Odo staff that just introduced themselves uh moment ago and as I said there's going to be time reserved for uh public comment on the agenda of today's meeting and then the followup for the rule changes uh and as always we really like to begin these meetings before we jump in uh by talking about our community agreements and these are designed to Foster inclusive and a respectful meeting uh we just want to uh have everybody uh just follow along and agree to uh being present and ready to learn from the information provided and comments from any particular individual uh as well as uh including respect into that in your communication and responses and just like to remind folks that learning often happens outside of our comfort zones and it's and we can be okay with that and include that in our discussions uh and then uh listening to learn and not just only to respond and uh just also just want to thank everybody as always we're doing these online things the Gremlins the technical Gremlins can pop up at any time and uh if we have that please be patient uh we'll definitely try to work around that and as I said before if you uh have any particular technical issue or request Beyond just a comment please chat uh Patricia uh she's available to help you with that and so with that we will dive into our agenda briefly on the next slide please so uh this meeting we're going to uh as we wrap up this aspect we're going to dive into uh going over some possible legislative concept changes uh christe's going to give a breakdown on that we are going to because uh Christie actually does need I believe to exit this meeting a little bit early uh we are going to have a quick little time for advisory committee comments and questions for chrisy about this concept change so it's another little uh change in our normal format uh and then from there we're going to just do a brief uh C program update uh very briefly on our our current grantees and and some of the highlights as well as a quick update on where we're at in the round three process and then of course we're going to go into James he's going to do a presentation and breakdown of the proposed rule changes uh for the C program and then as I said before we're going to get into uh some committee feedback and discussion uh on this advisory portion uh and then some public commentary uh on both the meeting today and the proposed rule changes and with that I'm going to toss it over to my colleague Christine thank you so much it's nice to be here um talking about this today so um we so I kind of want to start by just noting that in a minute you're going to hear about recent changes to the to the program that already passed through the legislature that I know Jason wrote you about during or right before the legislative session um one thing I think we at the Oregon Department of energy have is an attitude of just wanting to make sure that we're constantly improving our programs to make sure they work best for the people who are using them so in this case the eligible entities for our program for the community renewable energy program includes public bodies consumer own utilities which by the way most consumer owned utilities are public bodies but we wanted to Loop in the cooperatives who are not public bodies as well so consumer owned utilities are listed out as well tribes are listed out as well and um we know that we've been getting plenty of applications from public bodies and from tribes but our consumer utilities from the beginning of the program um development have raised some questions and concerns about the program and so one of the things that they brought to our attention really from the very beginning was concern about the definition of the um the energy resilience projects that we have um for our program and that's because our definition of energy resilience in our program includes the um a renewable energy aspect and there are many energy resilience projects that are out there that a lot of our utilities would like to be able to complete or find funding to help with completion um or with planning for that matter I suppose um have to H don't have necessarily a renewable component there's also an issue in our consumer own some of our consumer-owned utility territories where they can't actually add more Renewables to their grid because of their contract with the bonnaville power Administration to buy um to one of their um power power providers so it kind of creates this situation where they really the program was designed to include them very intentionally but in many cases they feel like it's a program that doesn't work for them and we've been hearing about that and um thinking about ways that we could potentially make some changes in the future really since the Inception of the program and um we heard about a situation with Federal funding that needed some attention and this was sort of the the idea that we put for forward to the governor's office and one thing I want to be really clear about is that's where we are in the phase on our legislative Concepts right now right now we've shared our ideas for legislative concepts with the governor's office and we don't yet have a red light a green light a yellow light on any of those we're just waiting to hear back um so it could be that they decide we're not going to move forward with this concept but for now since we are we did put it forward we wanted to be really transparent with you and really take a minute to get feedback from you all about the idea um right now every project under C must have a renewable energy component and at least 50% must have a resilience component and the possible legislative concept we put forward is that up to 20% of funds could support resilience only projects and this also dovetails with our um our recent County um energy resilience planning grants that we have and it also dovetails with Federal funding and",

        "text": " generators other than themselves that is the value proposition for renewables developers in general for having an rto and congress recognize that fact insane for purper projects in rtos the must purchase obligation that we go through trench warfare in the west about because we don't have an rto that no longer has to happen for larger qf projects it's a little bit different for for the smaller qf projects and that that value proposition holds true as much for ders as well in that case it's less of a resistance by the utility transmission than the absence of an adequate platform in places without an rto that an rto thank you spencer i don't see other hands raised adam now i see him now i see a real hand i'm looking at my little digital hands sorry i couldn't figure out how to do it i haven't been i'm i'm new to this as well the only other organization that i know that uses this is bpa i one other thing i i just want to say first of all i really appreciate spencer laying that out i think that's an important thing to keep in mind that the value proposition for an rto does include this sort of non-discriminatory to to the system that we're hoping results in more renewables i want to point out another thing that i think is important to to bring up that's kind of missing from this is you know we talked about jobs and you know one one common theme from rtos is the presence of large commercial customers that procure clean energy so these would be like your facebooks and your amazons and your apples and the big data center companies that want to be able to procure renewables and the reason they prefer being in an rto region is they can procure renewables from a a project anywhere within that system through a virtual power purchase agreement only can happen in our region through use of either green tariffs or modifications to existing tariffs that doesn't open that don't and i may get some pushback from this from folks on this call but that really don't open up that opportunity to the benefit of an rto one of the benefits for an rto in this region is that corporations that want to procure want to set up shop they want to build data centers or they want to set their headquarters in a state that has access to renewables um would prefer to do so in an rto because of that access and so that is a potential um benefit in terms of jobs bringing more companies to our state for the access that they have of uh procuring these renewables through vpas that don't currently exist right now in oregon i just want to point that out thanks nicole and i see uh travis uh cameron yeah you you'd asked for a input and uh with renewables i know you know we we definitely are trying to move and the renewables especially with the offshore wind that is something that uh i know this uh of interest to us again i come down to uh creation of an rto yeah i would rather our renewables continue to work to our current platforms i i do see concern over these small renewable projects um in the way that ferpa drags some of these utilities into access with these smaller projects an rto could make that even worse i don't i don't believe that every project should be built there are there are things that advantage customers through the utility system and every single renewable project is not something that's going to benefit customers just because it's a renewable project so not every developer has the best interest of customers um a lot of developers have the best interest of making money off of their renewable and so i think the utilities do balance that load and assets and resources to try to best serve customers and the best value and i don't know that independent power producers are are there to have that same shared great uh thank you travis for the feedback um i see uh i know robbie had to sign up first but i saw ben let's go to ben aquila and then we'll go to ravi um i just wanted to kind of say as looking over some of these a lot of them seem like they're issues that aren't necessarily related to rto formulation and so i i guess even in the last conversation i feel like an rto is a platform that enables kind of collective policy enables either through legislation or through sort of agreement at an tl level you could do things about renewables but i don't know that it necessarily implies each of these things would happen i think a lot of people are thinking to specific examples of rtos that may or may not have different policies and and i just don't think those are fundamental to the rto i think a lot of what we see here is concerns or fears about ways that rtos have gone but not necessarily implicit in developing one so i guess i i think an rto is a some of the things are absolutely fundamental a reduction in curtailment you know that is absolutely part of forming an rto and it's a huge advantage of it and it's fundamental to it a lot of things in this are just not not related to an rto per se but related to subsequent decisions that are made at an rto or by legislators or other policy makers that are setting forth the rules for the rto and so in a lot of ways i think an rto gives you options and i think that's a huge value and something that should be and i think there are some things that are inherent but i think there's much of this that is not and so i guess that was my main theme yeah ben thank you for that feedback you know that's that's something a recurring theme i think in some of the comments are you know uncertainty around how rtos are designed and being able to evaluate things so that's i think one key piece of um kind of a lens to think about with feedback the legislature around are there certain uh discretionary things that we would like an rto to do that they don't necessarily need to do right are there certain priorities we have that we want to see whether it's on governance or it's support for renewables or whatever it is um you know i think there's yeah it's not necessarily always uh inherently tied up with the rto but let's go to ravi next and then uh mary winky thanks thanks adam and uh thank you ben i i think you took my point away that is exactly what i wanted to make as my main point and remark one thing that i would like to add um when considering and you know in your paper providing your paper to the legislation rto definitely you know could help increase the renewables uh could could help improve the market for but i think maybe my comment is more on nicole's comment that you know uh the the googles and the apples and and all the server farms you know they want a site in an rto because it gives them access to renewables you know northwest is not an archaea yet it is a bilateral market and yet we have hundreds and thousands of megawatts of three of these data server farms that have come into either central oregon or the morrow county uh uec can probably evaluation they're still growing they're both the places and we're not an rto the thing that what they're looking for is access to renewables and access to transmission and i think we need to focus more on that part at least i i wouldn't comment on the manufacturing and the job proposition here that it's not my place to make a comment on that but um in terms of you know getting access to renewables in an open environment and rto may be able to facilitate that but again it falls on the governance and how your market structure is and how your operation is transmission planning will continue to do what it does whether it's in a bilateral market or whether it's in an rto the policies and the contractual rights as someone i think fred had pointed out earlier that that may make it a little smoother and easier and removable pancake rates may make it easier versus where we are in the bilateral market so so i like i like things to be focused on on the things that are going to be different in an rto that cannot be accomplished under a bilateral market to show the value of it rather than you know what can be achieved in a bilateral market that we have today should not be highlighted as what the rto gives because you can still get it in today's market um and to what extent i think we have seen uh in the last decade with the amount of integration that has happened and i i recall correctly northwest powerproof footprint has over 18 gigawatt of removal that has been uh added on to the system i'm not talking dp i'm talking about the guitar power pool footprint that's a pretty significant amount that has been uh and the number comes from the power pool so i i could be wrong here but the but that's the number they come that they have come up with however one last point adam and to the to the team here when i made the comment on incremental incrementalization which we'll discuss at the later stage one of the things that i want to mention when we talk about renewables is that the the area that we need to focus is the development of western resource adequacy program with an effective coordination with our regional entities eim is there we need to work on the western resource adequacy and make that a success what we learn from these programs will help form the base and that's where my and i don't want to take away the future discussion now but that's where i was heading when i made the comment and incrementalization all of these are great point of resource renewable interconnections and access to renewables in the system they're all great point transmission complexities surrounding it all great points but doing it in incremental approach gets you to a more success than trying to jump into an rto because i don't think any of this conversation has shown that there's a absolutely a remarkable 180 degree turnaround benefit of an rto versus what we have today so i'll leave it at that for for for the next conversation okay thank you robbie for that teaser uh mary thank you so i was going to make a comment i think kind of similar to what robbie the point ravi was making in terms of the problems that we're solving by or or by joining an rto or",

        "text": "great thank you so um this is the third workshop for the energy facility sighting council's protected area Scenic resources and Recreation standards rul making um the first two meetings focused on some um more General applicability issues and the protected area standard issue and today we're going to be focusing on the scenic resources and creation standards mostly although um we can certainly uh look at some other issues uh as folks want and time ups and I guess just before I go further make sure everybody can hear me okay and also if you're um dialing in on the phone um or uh are joining us otherwise I would ask you to mute yourselves unless you're speaking um just so we don't get all that background noise um and then W I'll actually if you're still listening I will have you remind me I know this should be on our instructions on our web page but if you are dialing in on the phone uh and you wish to uh mute yourself through WebEx I believe that is star Three G have a look um I can put that in the chat um and star three is I think to raise your hand I'm not sure what the the mute is so that must be star star um yeah that sounds right okay uh and then um for everyone else uh you should have in your participants pan a little hand icon um at the bottom uh that allows you to raise or lower your hand um and hopefully you all have gotten the hang of that by now but if not um I can pull up the instructions page as we go along okay um so to uh start off we're going to do a whole a brief round of introductions and then we'll get right into the issues that we have identified for today's Workshop um the first two issues so hopefully the first half of this meeting will discuss uh appropriate study areas and methods for impact analyses under the three standards that we're looking at in this Ru making um most of the feedback that we've received so far on these issues have been related to visual impacts um so that's going to be our Focus but we'll uh we would we would appreciate hearing on other impacts or other uh issues um related to study areas and the methodologies that you wish to provide and then the second uh set of issues were raised by stakeholders earlier in these proceedings and those are related to the methods used to identify uh significant or important Scenic resources under the scenic resources standard and um important recreational opportunities under the recreation standard um finally we'll close out the meeting with closing marks you'd like to make and then we'll discuss next steps um at this point in time we do expect for this to be the final workshop on this Ru making but we can reassess that at the end of this meeting um I will just say now that we do intend to um prepare our updated issues analysis um reflecting the conversations we've had during all three workshops um and uh prepare our recommendations and draft proposed rules and then send them out uh for review um before we go back to the council with draft proposed rules so um that's what we're thinking now but we can kind of revisit that at the end of the meeting um okay and so to do introductions looks like we have about 21 folks on the phone so I'm just going to go ahead and uh I'll down the list if you want to um introduce yourself tell us what organization you're representing and uh make any brief opening remarks we'd welcome

joining us um is there anybody I miss who may have joined while we were doing introductions so uh feel free to just jump in and introduce yourselves and then I'll have our staff uh introduce himself as well this is Jimmy Kagan I'm with the institute for natural resources and manage the Oregon managed area protected database excellent welcome Jimmy okay and hearing no one else um Sarah would you like to go ahead and introduce yourself to the group sure thank you so much um my name is Sarah esterson I'm a senior policy analyst with the um Department of energy division um great well uh again thank you all for being here and for your time um we know this is a big commitment to take time out of your day uh and join us but we really do appreciate um all the feedback that we can get um especially on these issues which I think we can all agree are near and dear to many of our hearts um protected area Scenic resources and Recreation um opportunities are things that most of us care about a lot and uh it's really important to make sure that we can you know balance the needs for providing some regulatory certainty to our energy developers and certificate holders while making sure that the council can really address impacts to these resources um and so oregonians in general so um looking forward to a good conversation and um you know a s tough conversations at some points in time but uh we think that these workshops have been really productive so far and um we're hoping that we can get some good input on these issues uh which were actually many of which were were raised by you also um with that uh I think we can move on to our first uh and um go from there so the first thing that we have on our list for today is um whether the study areas for impacts to protected areas Recreation opportunities and Scenic resources are appropriately sized um as a little bit of background um the study area is the area which must be evaluated for potential impacts to resources uh in the notice of intent um there's different stud areas for different types of resources and impacts uh the information in the noi is then used to identify the analysis areas for the application um those analysis areas may be different than the study areas used in the uh for the noi but they they can also be the same um and that analysis area is the area that would contain resources that the proposed facility could potentially affect uh some stakeholders have recommended reducing the study area sizes for these three standards uh especially for renewable facilities and solar photo voltaic power generation facilities to give just a little additional background on um the current study areas in the rule include the area within the site boundary of a proposed energy facility plus a 5 Mile buffer for recreational opportunities a 10 mile buffer for Scenic resources and a 20 mile buffer for protected areas um the noi must generally identify the resources Within These study areas that could potentially be impacted by the proposed facility and then the department uses that information to establish the an analysis areas that will be used to develop the more in-depth impact analyses in the uh the current division 21 Rules kind of describe what different impact analyses must be provided as part of the application um the three standards require uh several different types of impacts to be analyzed some of which overlap and some of which do not um all three of the standards requires an impact uh of the analys the an analysis of the impact of facility structures and plumes both the protected areas and Recreation standards require analyses of noise and traffic impacts uh and then the unique analyses are the protected area standard requires an analysis of uh impacts on water quality and quantity inside of protected areas the scenic resources standard requires an analysis of the impacts of loss of vegetation and Landscape alteration we'll have on the scenic resources the recreation standard requires analysis of L of recreation opportunity um I'll just note that in some cases a resource can be detected under multiple standards and in that case um all the different requirements would potentially apply um so we'll probably be looking at whether or not this Vin diagram is correctly laid out uh when we're doing our application process review rul making which is currently just getting started u but we thought it'd be helpful to highlight these differences to inform the discussion about what the appropriate basis for the study areas are um also um help promote that discussion we've identified a few different discussion questions and uh so this is where I guess we'll start asking for input I think I'm going to go try to go through these one by one um that doesn't work we can kind of skip around but for now uh I'll go ahead and ask uh anybody uh if you have advice on",

        "text": " goals and then the standard actually provides three paths for how to interpret that requirement and make findings i'm going to show you okay so hopefully you can kind of see that the three paths are then here under little b sub two b of the land use standard and it basically says either council finds that the proposed facility complies with all applicable substantive that's path a path b is they don't comply with an applicable substantive criteria so either council approves an exception or otherwise finds that the proposed facility would be consistent with statewide planning goals or path c which is the project is consistent with statewide planning goals for this project the applicant has requested council review under path b um and so that is how the analysis in the proposed in the draft proposed order is presented um and so like what the applicant doesn't comply with is the acreage threshold for solar which is the goal exception so that's kind of what triggers path b so as kate mentioned in the intro the facility is proposed to be located in umatilla county so it is then umatilla county's development code and comprehensive plan that are evaluated to determine the applicable substantive criteria i also want to note that council's land use standard establishes a special role for the governing body of the local jurisdiction for which a project is proposed to be located and that special role is called a special advisory group the governing body is umatilla county board of commissioners um and then we're that as the special advisory group they're tasked with working with the department to identify what those applicable substantive criteria are given what the proposed facility is and this proposed facility is quite interesting if you haven't gotten but it has wind solar and transmission lines and all of those categories have separate land use criteria that apply so the land use section covers an enormous amount of criteria given those different zones or different also to add into the mix that the project crosses five zones it's predominantly in exclusive farm use zone which on the map here on the the um beige shading is exclusive for museum and then you can see in the square inset it is the ue the proposed uec transmission line that then hits four additional zones i think in about the uh half mile and those additional zones rural tourist commercial light industrial or an efu maybe it's just four zones so um then i think i we wanted to point out this is where the solar is on the right hand side of the slide this shows the different types of soils okay so as kate mentioned we've selected two topics to cover for the land use overview that's two of a gazillion so if there's anything other than what we've chosen to describe for your interest please obviously feel free okay so the first topic we've heard a little bit about already today but it is a umatilla county zone provision that applies to the wind facility components and it's a two mile setback from wind turbines to rural residences that are non-participating with the project in the application the applicant presented an argument that said they did not believe that this provision met the council's definition of applicable substantive criteria the two-mile setback was not required by the statewide planning goals in our review we agreed and provide a robust analysis in the draft proposed on the record of the dpo hearing we received comments the umatilla county planning director bob walder who has been authorized by the umatilla county board of commissioners to speak on their behalf um and he expressed disagreement with the interpretation that's presented in the draft proposed order and argued that it is applicable substantive criteria for a little bit um more context the two mile setback would affect up to eight residences um that was what was presented in the application and i think based on our review of the microsighting corridor it would be 11 residences the applicant also confirmed that of these residences that could be impacted they would be between 0.3 and a mile away from the wind turbines i wanted to show you bob's comments i can so to the extent you can see this you did receive this as attachment one to the staff report for this agenda item and so essentially again he's saying we interpret the rule to mean that it is comprehensive plan and development code that are required by the statewide planning goals not that the criteria are required by the statewide planning goal so that's what his comment is saying and if you can tell the difference i've tried to underline the this is the definition of applicable substantive criteria umatilla county believes this required by statewide planning goals applies to the comp plan and land use ordinances our interpretation is that it's the criteria that are required by the statewide planning goals i would like to note that this um particular question of what criteria from a zoning ordinance or comp plan is meets council's definition was a big issue in obsidian so we thoroughly evaluated this as a party to the contested case and then the hearing officer evaluated and also agreed with our interpretation that it's the criteria that are required by the statewide planning goal not the two plans just for your reference okay and then i would also like to offer that we um sought our uh advice from our doj on this comment from umatilla county where we are um based on that advice maintaining the position in the draft proposed order so does council have any questions i'm chair this is hanley so we have additional comments today on the record concerning a two-mile setback those comments do not the need for an evaluation for this particular umatilla county code and so unless that happens final order i think the department and the council should continue recognize that it's the applicable substantive criteria this isn't the right anyway it's that relate to the statewide planning goals and therefore two mile setback it's not something that's required by the goals so i think that has to be our position we see something different from the county and the applicant and even in that case i still think it should be final orders position at um it's the applicable substantive in the goals that are that are applicable thank you okay thank you and there is a provision in rule that allows the department to consult with reviewing agencies before issuance of the proposed order and we fully plan to coordinate and share the analysis that we have done with umatilla county just to maintain a good relationship yes so i've got a question here um i'm understanding correctly i think what hanley's saying is that the applicable substantive criteria would be those of statewide planning as opposed to the applicable subject criteria are those criteria that are in the acknowledged plan of the county i think i think the criteria of the acknowledged plan of the county are what would apply to address the statewide planning goal as the acknowledged plan of the county is implementing the statewide planning so i'll be interested in hearing what council says when you're starting to tease out which one of these is correct i i patrick would you like to add anything because we did ask him to evaluate this so you see the two bullets up there so um my understanding is the until the county's position is because their comprehensive plan and their land use ordinances are adopted consistent with the statewide planning goals anything in them is applicable substantive criteria required by those goals that's their staff's position is that that's too broad it's the specific criteria in the comprehensive plan if that's effective as a applicable applicable sort of ordinance or you know standard or the land use and so we look at those individually not as a whole not the entire comprehensive plan not the entire land use ordinance but individual elements of that land use ordinance to say is that required by the goals so in this case two mile in the exclusive farm you zone does the goal three require that two mile setback our position is no lanes goal three does not require that and so our evaluation is that then it's not required by the landing schools every county that has efu zone would have that same two-mile setback but their position is that we're looking at it too narrowly and it's the broader because they adopted their comprehensive plan and their ordinances consistent with all the goals that then everything in them is applicable substantive criteria and required by the goals so they're broader or narrower really is what it comes down to okay the next topic is the goal exception so um the proposed solar facility would use or occupy up to approximately eighteen hundred acres in exclusive farm use owned land the conditional use requirements for a solar facility in efu zone land establish acreage thresholds of 12 and 20 acres for high value and arable land respectively and this proposed solar facility component would exceed both of those so because they can't comply with these acreage thresholds they have um are required to request seek council approval of a goal exception um as matt mentioned earlier um i believe that he explained that the soil classification within the solar micro siting area a natural resource conservation service and that it is high value farmland due to its location within the columbia valley viticulture area although and do and including slope and aspect criteria that have to be met to meet the high value farmland threshold and of course there's no viticulture going on there the the applicant is seeking a reasons um where the reasons include minimal impacts to agriculture there are several sub reasons to that a local economic benefit locational dependency and then minimal impacts to other environmental resources in the draft proposed order based on review and evaluation and weighing of the merits of the evidence that was submitted staff recommended only two of those reasons go forward and that was minimal impacts to agriculture and local economic benefits and then as we've discussed council members howe and jenkins provided comments on the record of the draft proposed order hearing expressing concerns about whether the reasons were site-specific specifically recommended consideration of site-specific components like or the unique ability of the site to provide both wind and solar at the site and as you've you've you've received the applicant requested a 30-day extension at that hearing to submit additional evidence and on the 15th they provided a supplemental packet that was provided in hard copy and electronically to counsel and i i think i don't want to repeat what you've heard or maybe what you've reviewed but in response to the specific recommendations that we heard out of the testimony from council we wanted to that in the supplemental response applicant explains that the wind energy site was selected based on favorable interpretation of wind the site allows for wind and solar which provides a balanced generation it has robust wind resources and that allows the site itself allows for shared infrastructure of the two technologies being wind and solar i think we are interested in whether council has any further concerns or comments that we should be in that goal exception chair this is",

this evening's meeting of the Planning Commission is called order there we have the roll call please yes commissioner Frye he said that he would be absent tonight commissioner Heavener he said that he might be attending commissioner Kaiser commissioner milliman commissioner Mori B do present commissioner podar stated that she would be absent tonight commissioner will Vice chair died looks like he's absent Sharon Lockwood looks like we have four in attendance thank you I interrupted you you oh I was going to say that we don't have a quorum right thank you well our first item is a director's mordell I'm the planning and development services manager for Washington County a couple of items for updates today um as some of you may recall from your briefings on the climate friendly and Equitable communities new state rules we were required to update our community development code relating to parking regulations we requested an extension from the state on the deadline to adopt those changes the original deadline was July 1st so we didn't have very much time to do that and dlcd did grant us an 18-month extension on that so we have now until December 31st of 2024 to update our development code this is really good because the state land conservation and development commission is considering updates to those rules they'll be considering those updates in July and November so it makes a lot of sense I think for us to wait to update our development code until we know what the final rules are going to be so you will hear more about this going forward that's relating to the parking reform B requirements which require you to either eliminate all parking minimums or price and manage on-street parking so we'll be doing some technical analysis and sharing information with you as we go forward and consider what amendments we need to make to our code to come into compliance with those rules we are directly implementing the parking rules that already came into effect which was no minimum parking for certain development types things like day cares and regulated affordable housing and within proximity to Transit corridors so we have staff guidance to directly Implement those pieces of the rules and there was no extension possible for we also received an extension on some of the transportation performance measures requirements so we now have until 2027 to adopt those that sounds like it's a really long time from now but I think it's going to go really fast but the benefit of waiting until 2027 is that we can hopefully roll those Transportation performance measures into a major update of our transportation system plan so these are all good things we're really happy to be working collaboratively with our partners at the state in order to make the updates that we need to make next update the legislative session we were tracking a number of bills that were held up while the Senate was unable to achieve a quorum and so we are anxiously awaiting what's going to happen this week the legislature has to be done I believe on Sunday I think that's their last day Rob's nodding so I think I got that right um so if any of those bills that we've been tracking do move forward and move on for adoption we will provide an update to the Planning Commission most likely by email and share that with you um and then finally we have a number of items in our tier one work program that we could support with grant funding and so we're tracking a number of grants that are out there um in particular there is some State grant funding relating to housing which could support our community development code assessment work that we wanted to do in order to simplify Our Community Development code so we will share with you what we decide to do moving forward but it's good to see that there's some grant opportunities out there to help us support this work so that's it for updates moving into our meetings for tonight's meeting you have two work sessions we will be talking about our significant natural resources update on that project and then giving you an overview of the 2023 Urban growth boundary expansions and Tigard and North Plains and talking about next steps because you will have some actions to take on those for our upcoming PC meetings we have a pretty light summer so we are recommending that we cancel the next few meetings unless there are topics coming forward or things that the Planning Commission would like us to share with you but we don't have any ordinances ready to file imminently and we didn't have any work session topics identified so right now we'd recommend canceling July 5th the July 19th and August 2nd that would bring us back on August 16th at that time we would tentatively be able to talk about the ugb expansion ordinances but that sort of depends on timing we could think about some other possible work session items since that does give us a little bit of time to think on that agenda and that's all I have for the director's thank you are there comments or questions for Ms Wardell uh I have one question who writes the grants oh we that's a really good question um typically we write them in-house sometimes if it's a very technically specific Grant we will hire outside consultant support in order to do that thank you all right thank you let's go to our next item which is Public Communication yes go ahead please oh I'm sorry for interrupting I just wanted to know that um Vice chair die and commissioner will have joined us and so we have six now uh PC members we do we do have a quorum excuse me yeah thank you and we do have one person who has signed up for Public Communication this evening we ask that Mr long please start by saying his full name and real quick season what was the amount of time for the testimony uh 10 minutes since he's representing a good evening it's nice to see you all my name is Jim long I reside at 10655 Southwest Hall Boulevard and Tigard I'm chair of cpo4m I'm also chair of the CCI League committee for Community involvement subcommittee on significant natural resources and I'm here to talk about something that's not on your agenda but it's connected a little bit but it's not on your agenda and I sent out to uh to Todd a few hours ago a uh a compilation we've put together a draft we put together and I don't know if you've got it at all or not did you did that get forwarded to I guess not since you're not nodding um it's a bird and Critter list uh it's a draft we put together so we have a draft of a burden crater lift that's an incomplete but evolving list of bird and critters that originally started in the old town of Metzger in an unincorporated Washington County and in response to um go the lcdc goal five enforcement order in Washington County as we talk about protecting habitat for wildlife we need to be aware of the many diverse name species so page two of what I'll be sending out if you don't have it already is the cpo4m bird and critterless compiled by two brilliant Neighbors near 82nd and Cedar Crest Pat Forsyth who is a science journalist and Rich Hanson who was a retired biology teacher for Tigard High School so this list which includes 55 birds and over a dozen uh Critters uh which it was was compiled by them for what they saw and heard and smelled and it covers just two acres of land that was the focus of a land use approval by uh Department of land use and transportation back in 2015 it's it's a list of of uh of the animals that were there and since then I have taken some things compiled the lists off the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife website of other creatures that we believe would be in Washington County I've been working with a A friend of mine who's a retired habitat wildlife habitat uh specialist with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife to identify those things the fourth page includes other fish and wildlife outside of Oregon but many people love birds and watching wildlife and and they're in their native environment so this list is it's just a list it's not an inventory of wildlife or a census of wildlife but simply beginning of a list of what exists in our community now and um I I could do a screen share if you allow screen shares I could show it to you uh I'm seeing Teresa kind of shake her head no um but so I have this list and I sent it to Todd earlier and I guess I should send it also to the clerk for the Planning Commission because it's something I do want you all to see uh talks about the different types of birds the amphibians uh the mammals the reptiles the game birds and um other um and of course we talk about threaten and endangered species as well as other things now I'm not a botanist or a biologist I don't want to pretend to be but I'm very passionate about this we want to get this information out to you I've been learning a number of things I mean there's a lot of animals some are daytime animals die urinal animals and summer nighttime nocturnal animals like skunks and raccoons and then there's also vuscular animals which come out in Dawn and dusk so there's a number of different animals that are we want to name and talk about make people aware of as we go through this process uh of looking at a new ordinance perhaps for for fish and wildlife that has clear and objective uh standards and also on this list I have started to develop the rare habitats for native plants and the oak Savannahs the wet prairies Wetland prairies and Oakland Upland prairies and these habitats were not included in the original habitat assessment guidelines so the person who's helping me from the retired person from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife was a petition around one of the appeals that was approved by uh Luba particularly regarding the habitat assessment guidelines so we're looking at uh uh you know invasive species and the fact that there are declining species for more than 60 percent of the birds are declining and we don't really necessarily get into all the other smaller Critters the bees and the butterflies which are also declining so my my ask of you is uh maybe you can help if if you know your neighborhood and your uh appreciate Wildlife if you see something that's not",

        "text": " before you take action on the amendments to propose revisions to Marion County codes sections one seven one one nine zero two zero and one seven one one nine zero two five arise out of a Greenway permit application that was filed by a private entity to build a structure in the purported right-of-way between my home and Ms putnam's home in butteville the application was improper for many reasons starting with the fact that it violated existing county code because it did not include our signatures as property owners the private entity apparently convinced Marion County staff to ask you to change the code to permit them to proceed with the project on our property without our permission or signatures we oppose this project because of the damage we've already sustained as a result of the early parts of the project since the county and this private entity began installing Park amenities in the small strip of land between our homes it has become a magnet for illegal drug use garbage dumping excessive noise additionally people attracted to this area now trespass on our property with frightening regularity at all hours of the day year round we ask that you reject the proposed revisions to Marion County code sections 17119-020 and 17119-025 which have the sole purpose of making it easier for the county to allow a private entity to impair property please see the letter submitted by our attorney for more details on why this action is improper and why the project is attempting to facilitate is unlawful this would affect not only our property but all properties of the citizens of Marion County who could potentially be affected by this code Amendment thank you thank you Julie any questions I don't have any questions for Julie yeah I have a question for Brandon as I this I don't remember talking specifically about this issue with regards to this change this change is broader than any impact it might have on this issue isn't that the case that's correct could you talk about when it was presented to us could you just sort of remind us about why is it necessary so what emerged from a recent louva decision was that we don't have a parallel in our code our code has an application can be made by an application can be signed by so a property owner can make an application the property owners signs it we currently have it where a governmental body can make an application but no one can sign and so we're we're making that parallel happen so in the future we we are able to bring forward land use cases like an easement where the board and others can consider making decision on Marion County owns a lot of right-of-way with easements like the state will often just own it outright but when we have working in easement say if we're adding a travel Lane and an easement it requires a conditional use someone has to be able to make that application and sign for that application for that work in the easement now when the actual decision or land use case comes up and there's a decision is to be made then we can evaluate how the criteria apply to that whether or not this is the proper use of the person making the application and signing it all of that gets evaluated as part of that land use and this is like we had a situation where Marion County foreclosed on a piece of property a long time ago before any of us were Commissioners and we own a a strip of land that's like 46 feet long in between two properties and we were talking about whether we can sign an annexation agreement to basically allow it to be annexed in the City of Salem right so that the development can go on there so I think this is a little bit broader than than just uh the butteville issue I'm sorry no go ahead thank you you're fine so what we're doing today is we're adopting a broad generalized code but at some point in the future once this is passed if it passes today an application for a land use case and that her particular situation scenario could could come forward to the county and go through the standard procedures we're not saying today that what she's speaking to is finalized correct right okay I just want to be clear that while I understand what you're saying this isn't a saying go forth and do great things with some easement in your front yard this is much this is Broad to the entire County and our ability to do our work in the county and then there's these um procedures that have somebody has to make an application in your case in order for anything to happen in the future once this passes well my understanding is currently the code states that all owners of the property must sign and we're the underlying fee title owners the county has an easement right away over basically over the top of the property but we're the feed title owners So currently we need to sign off and agree that they can make these changes the county wants to remove the requirement that we sign off on this on the changes they've made I I don't want to get too deep in the weeds here it's just caused a lot of problems for us as a community because of the Marion County allows this Park that they've installed to remain open 24 hours a day and I don't want to get into the details of the future case please I I just want to understand Brandon so she's saying that this ask in this particular code change is removing their ability to have a say is that well no I don't believe so because when when the application came forward we still have to make a determination for instance that the appropriate local government for say agency has made an application for Public Works project and so an opponent could argue you know this is not an appropriate Public Work um but this and then a signature of The Brokerage state agency for that or the public agency this allows an application to be brought forward to build and make those determinations have those arguments have the pushback it preserves all the rights for Neighbors opponents property owners to have their part of the process to appeal and to come before the board for a decision so I I want to add this because I'm reading 17 119.025 it says application shall include the following signatures and number one is signatures of all owners of the subject property so this change isn't eliminating that requirement but it is saying for an application filed by an entity authorized by a public agency or utility then then that that agency or utility can sign the document so I don't know that it's having this the effect that maybe you're concerned that it is well maybe Brandon can clarify it's my understanding that it is removing the signature requirement of the property owner that's correct the properties wouldn't have to sign for a public works but the it still has to be a public agency project and they can still argue that this isn't an appropriate public agency project there's ways to still be involved in that process I want to clarify though the the public agency would have to own the property that they're applying for though wouldn't they public agency has to have an easement right to do the project it's a type of ownership yes this is why we're objecting because we are the underlying fee title honors and the county is not and so there they've done something that has caused harm and they want to do and actually it's a private entity that's doing these actions with the counties so this is the improper action did you well this is kind of did you purchase the property subject to the easement or did you did you grant the easement after you purchased the property no um I purchased the problem question because you asked TS too right okay I'm sorry so did you purchase the property subject to the easement or did you grant an easement after you purchased it I did not Grant an easement so you purchased the property subject to this easement I didn't really know about the easement when I purchased it um but is that that's identified in the deed isn't it yeah yeah so it was in the record that you received when you purchased your home in the deed we deal with this a lot with citizens a lot around roads in Marion County and most homeowners don't read Deeds personally there's actually a lot of debate about that it's an historic home from 1886 that my great great grandfather built so there's we've had different title what's the word like Fidelity do research and they come up with it's very difficult to determine from the documents that were established in those it's very very confusing sure I believe and it's not actually in my property deed that Marion County has an easement there's nothing like that so I don't think we can get into your specific issue here but I do think there's this question we have to consider which is a public agency be able to sign a land use application and it just seems like there's so many other issue places that we run into this where we own property that if we don't have the ability to sign a land use that really prevents us to use to use that property I think if you own it outright that's one issue but the problem here is Marion County does not own it outright and so it sounds like Brandon you're you're saying you this these amendments would the requirement for all Property Owners to have signature Property Owners within an easement would not have to sign but the public agency that has the right to do certain work in the easement does have does have to sign well again I don't want to get into the weeds but there are many other codes that are being violated with this project so now what is to stop Marion County from coming to you with any of the codes that they're violating that they don't like and now having you amend 10 other codes Marion County codes that's the problem I foresee Gene can you speak I don't I mean it's not a practice of Marion County to just go and violate codes and ordinances like I've only been here two years but we have a pretty stellar legal team that makes sure we don't do that I think there's a I think my understanding of the underlying case wasn't that funny was that we didn't have the authority as an applique as a easement holder under our code to be an applicant and what Luba said was if you want to be an applicant you have to amend your code so that's why we're here today it's not that we're we violated anything it's that we were directed to take this action if we want to be an applicant thank you can I ask a question Brandon so is there a way in this change to make sure that we're not removing the and I don't know that",

        "text": " a time frame that is being built into this process you know the report or a complaint comes in has to be responded to within so much time is that part of the it is so there are in in our rules are requirements for reporting in some cases and when they have to report what is a what gets a little fuzzier is the timing for having something resolved um and so i think in the sense you're we wouldn't have like a hard and fast time built in there what i think is important though is that we know that there is a plan and that we're tracking that there's closure on these things i i think in the past that i'm not saying we weren't doing it but i don't think we were sure that we were doing it but now you know if i go back to the scrum meetings what do we do in those and the first thing um pull up the incident log and we look at what incidents are open and what should be happening on those and there's a status in them they're they're gonna be open or they can be closed basically so if they're they're not closed then there's some action that we're still waiting on and we shouldn't allow things to fall through the cracks at least with the way that we are tracking these now and i would have not felt as good about saying that before we went through that exercise okay thank you uh just another question on the last item um you just talked about is the developing how council evaluates an application how how would you go about that as the council members change and might look for different information and the guidance that you're you give and yeah i i'd have to kick that one over to a sighting analyst to answer i think i think i'm not the best person to answer that i think it's a good question and will be one of the challenges in trying to prepare a document like but i think it can be done we certainly should be able to i mean and i think from a developer standpoint they would say well you know if you can't provide some basic guidance that you know fall and give me some guard rails at least then um you know are we being consistent enough or is the council being consistent enough and how applications are developed are evaluated so i'm probably not answering a question real well but that's the answer i can give you well the reason if i can um the reason i asked the question is um as council members come and go um we have different perspectives and whatnot and that it's a document that is given to somebody as opposed to just counsel as to get counsel from the analyst as to what's going on right now unless that document is kept pretty darn current i think it could be problematic thank you councilmember condon that's a that's a great point we'll we'll have to be careful putting it together and you know there'll be areas where maybe we can't give them a lot of guidance because it would be difficult to reflect change i don't think we want to try to certainly we're not trying to put something out that takes the place of the council evaluation but again it's more what information needs to be provided for the council to do their evaluation you know we're not certainly don't want to get into the area of trying to give people you know legal advice on how to put together their application we would steer clear of that but thank you for that input and the the wise warning thank you record todd i can address that to some degree as well and i think the value you know of this idea is you know we see some patterns of consistent um issues where applications are incomplete and i think it's those areas where we can focus on to say look you know we see more often than not here's an issue that comes up where we're gonna you know deem your application incomplete and ask for additional information so if we could provide some better guidance to them the idea is to get the completeness um and we can tell them you know how to better go about that and to wally's point absolutely we have to be very careful that we're not providing you know legal advice or you know indicating if you get to this phase that's tantamount to approval because completeness is simply enough information with which to evaluate the request not enough information to deem or to determine that the um the request can be approved so so that's really more for the value of the uh applicant and try to you know to resolve some of these consistent patterns of incompleteness that we see for the record this is marcy grill if i'm may cindy what my suspicion is it's the title because it says how counsel evaluates versus um thank you chair girl i was thinking the same thing as i reread that i thought i gotta rename that one so i didn't would have i would have would not have had a comment for the case thank you comments or questions for wally yes anne and wally thank you for the presentation new to the game so this is probably the wrong question but the scope of the program assessment is is there an outline of that somewhere thank you councilmember buyer yes there is um and i'm sure it's um in one of the folders from a prior council meeting but i will find that and make sure that you get that so you can review it i'm just curious more than anything thanks much uh for the record todd cornett just one last point on this and i think um it's important is so this is our um you know what we are planning to do but i also want to make sure that it's clear to council members if you have thoughts and ideas for us to work on that aren't on here you know process improvement activities you know related to anything or you know applications amendments for how the public participates how we work with reviewing agencies or you know how we work with council and provide information to you please let us know i mean this is the stuff that we see but we're one component of this overall process and we recognize that we don't know everything we don't see everything so should you have thoughts and ideas that aren't on here please let us know anyone else thank you ali the next item on our agenda is the echo solar project appointment of special advisory group this is an action item we have christopher clark odo senior sighting analyst who will recommend that the council appoint the morrow county board of commissioners as the special advisory group under ors-469480 subsection one for f-sec proceedings related to the proposed echo solar project chris welcome all members of the council uh for the my name is christopher clark and i'm uh here for this agenda item and my capacity as a senior citing analyst excellent um thank you for doing with my technical issues um so i'm here today as uh madam chair grail uh said to recommend that the council appoint the special advisory group for the echo solar project it's a quick overview of this project um the echo solar would be a 1.25 gigawatt solar photovoltaic power generation facility with up to 7.5 gigawatt hours of distributed battery storage capacity the proposed site consists of 10 900 a predominantly cultivated efu land in morrow county that's about 17 square and the applicant for is echo solar llc which is a wholly owned subsidiary of pine gate renewables llc i've included a vicinity map here you can see the facility is located just to um south and east of the boardman bombing range highway state highway 207. i've included another view here just to show the proposed facility site boundary in relation to um other energy facilities in the vicinity you can see the wheatridge facilities in orange and yellow um there and as i think wally showed in his presentation um the site boundary kind of interlocks with the proposed wagon trail solar project which is in the red hatching i know that's a little hard to one thing that's not shown on this map this proposed facility would interact with the existing uec transmission line sort of at the north west corner of the site boundary yes thank you marcy so is the proposed site boundary in black sorry yes uh councilmember jenkins the proposed boundary is the black bold outline there thank you are there any other questions from the to the northwest of where the those facilities what's all that shaded area to the northwest is that bombing range yes it to the northwest that is the boardman bombing range you can also see i don't know if you can see you cannot see my my quicker the cardi reservoir um up here to the northwest so the the boardman bombing range is that uh um but it's not that entire darkly shaded spot i think that's a maybe an artifact of the gis photography so christopher this is handling um the transmission line is the purple and white dashed line the uh i've cut off the key on this view here but i'll leave it the purple and white dashed line is proposed transmission lines and i will look to someone else in the room that may be the route of the proposed b2h line i see when a fossum has her hand raised and she she may know the answer oh that's okay i thought the blue and white was labeled as existing right yeah so i think you have this blue and white line which is the existing uh uec blue ridge line and then the purple and white i believe is is a proposed transmission line and i believe that's the proposed v2h1 i'm just really quick so in the middle that where the orange so there's the outline of the project area and then the little square in the middle i yeah uh thank you councilmember condon i believe uh that the other site boundaries are clipped so they don't appear in the middle but there may be some there is some overlap any other questions about this map and i will point out the um we did we received this notice of intent on may 10th it is available from our website if the in if the council member does have questions on it um i think there will be further opportunities to review this um and certainly it's out for public comment now oh and we do have a public information meeting scheduled on this for uh later in july in boardman um i can get that exact date well i will continue with my presentation i believe it's july 27 but i don't want him to speak for the record todd cornett and and you know if any council member would like to attend that either in person or virtually uh please let",

        "text": " was a fire access hookup or that sort of thing that would be you know captured in that alve then that would be a problem that would need to be addressed but otherwise they didn't have any any you know glaring concerns that would be that would you know cover the proof concept type of uh work we're doing right now I think that gets us up to today great excellent um do we have any questions for St got um I am wondering if there were any if you have any recommended like text changes from your discussions with the downtown organization or with fire like are you recommending any additional criteria based on those conversations we're not at this time because the feedback from that was kind of captured previously since it paralleled what we had did see and if anything M you know minor typographical type of alterations but nothing that would be substantive nothing substantial um do we have any uh do you anticipate adding any additional conver any additional text based on that I guess I'm thinking about like the fire access like are we thinking about adding anything that would say you know cannot blck service access or something like that I theoretically we could add that since it it's not doesn't really deal with historic visual character um I don't I don't know that we it would be necessary because because you know it would be the type of thing to be captured in other aspects like say there was some other aspect of codee that would H okay that really wasn't tied to what we're addressing in terms of the historic visual character okay so I'll just yeah support that so part of so a security gate would most likely require a permit a building permit and and firewood review as part of that and so it wouldn't be we don't have the Larks commission and Sr C230 doesn't have regulatory Authority so there's no code to hang our hat on other than as Jake mentioned design standards but it's captured in thew perfect cool just wanted to make sure yeah commissioner WS just so you're not the only one asking questions can I miss the downtown Advisory board meeting when this was presented there and I feel terrible about that but at that time did Kimber I'm sorry did Sheree uh mention anything about that these would be covered under strategic projects Grant you hear did that get brought up at all and my point is and it's also segue into the next thing of making sure everyone's you know interde departmentally cooperating since it's a website and that can be changed later if there would maybe a little blurb or link that by the way there's a way to help pay for this yeah I feel like that helps when goes oh this is so honorous I follow these rules and then we follow up with oh but it can be helped and so that would be my suggestion or question if that's a possibility yeah so yeah you always has money we I should say that we have a little bit of money but that's a good idea so we can talk with uran about link perfect okay great um are there any other comments or questions about the text it sounds like we're getting pretty close to kind of the final aspect or the final I don't know product here okay great well I think to sort of sum up our discussion um our one suggestion was to maybe add a little bit of information to the educational website about the opportunities provided by The towntown Advisory Board um and we don't uh have any concerns about adding additional language because it seems like things like um you know fence height or uh the fire access is covered by other code sections so we don't need to worry about that anybody say something else okay great I think that's it do you guys have questions more questions for us okay right perfect um then I think we can go ahead and move on to our next item all right the next discussion item is going to be the work plan assignment so sorry so this is just an opportunity if you've done stuff and things and I'm looking at Chris Morris who seems to be doing lots of stuff and things um just share what youve been doing you know the the you can share well mystery you can talk about all like Bush house if you want you talk about chaining support that sort of thing uh so um Bush House Museum we have been working with them for the last 18 months they're shifting their um approach to how the museum is representing the history they're doing more of a restorative history with that house um also bringing in a more contemporary gallery on the second floor house um those things have gone outside of Permitting so we're getting them back into a position where they are permitted to have um concerts they're doing Concert Series in the house they're doing lecture series they have some Diamond events the house have Gall so it's um a lot going on oh yeah y I'm glad that we did glad we can move that forward and get aligned with the new also right so some of this is being driven by structure the city Jake is really yeah and then we have Ching Ming coming up and um I'm not sure what's well but I yeah I don't know if you want to speak to it but and I didn't bring anything to share but maybe next yeah so um the Chinese Community is really excited about building something new there IND I don't know if you were part of this conversation last year if you overheard them uh so while myself as an archaeologist and historians love that we're reusing the original they're like it's broken and makes us sad so they want they want a new one so um Chris and his firm have graciously worked with the Chinese Community to come up with a conceptual design so we're very early on in the process this will eventually come to you guys because it's in the Pioneer cemeterian which is National register listed uh but just wanted to give a shout out to person it' be great to next be existing oh yeah trying to get down to the base of it down to the baseet below anyway yeah it' be cool to get there it's really sad that it got buried also smash so again it's like a theme of restorative history it is yeah oh no there's a lot of that around beened so it's great to be a part of that's all I'm not GNA call on any do any of the other committees have any updates to provide we did a email exchange on the survey committee about um some properties that have reached out um to do to do the um local register domination and I volunteered to help with the park nomination so I think that will be um that will be fun and we're I'm still working on the school I'm hoping to have that done by the end of the month so we're we're getting close on that and uh there's a few other properties that um I think will be really cool uh like the Jerry Frank house I would really like love to help with that I'm not sure if I would be able to do all of it but I would be happy to you know support or help as we need to but if folks are interested in kind of covering those other houses that would be another a great thing to do just wrote about for the newsletter great well then we're already and I think then the only other thing I I just want to mention before we move on um I always forget about this may is historic preservation month I don't know did we give up on the turn any maybe we'll plan ahead for next year it's just it's just because it's March and I'm like we're not having a so if anyone super inspired wants to something like I keep I meany but can we like find something like interactive on the interwebs i f you she see when you have an idea yes go just so involved social media that you know he has to do the work together we support you if you have an idea I don't but I'm just sit here think about social no it's just a social you know social media that we've got all these different things like you know kind of like there something interactive that you know we don't have something like an event yeah we don't have like something physical or whatever but is there at least something that we could or we tag on to somebody exactly good ide that's so funny I know I know I'm wondering I don't know how's our like how's the toolbox Grant doing are we doing like well with applications is like money doing well we have money not okay I I think it would be U it's it's such a great program for local homeowners I'm wondering if we could like highlight some of those projects but I don't want to what that I was just saying exactly like just some you know just like something just to push forward you know we don't have to like do something specific but just to you know throw things out like hey it's historic preservation month by the way things maybe feed stuff to Andy let's put down Jennifer from there do have Che said let's we'll just then we just voted that take okay Jennifer's gonna think of a program highlight and we're gonna share it on the webbe we could get on that cashtag right Zary has something to say um we do have our photo contest it is currently open and we're accepting submissions and that will go through um so we will discuss that for in for historic preservation month um that'll be happening we will also probably do our awards that month as well he's more excited look we're doing stuff well I'm just saying there are things that are on the document they're not doing nothing we're going to be are we going to be voting for the awards of yeah you will be voting on the awards and the photo contest awards at the May meeting um assuming we have submissions we don't have any yet but um but those are open and live and we're we're ready for them um and then in your regards to the toolbox Grant um we we have a few for this um month but it could be our next or this cycle our next cycle will open in June so sharing them in May could be a good promotion for like hey it opens next month you can uh sign up for that so is there um maybe like a I don't know like an email newsletter or something that you could send to the Commissioners and we could maybe forward it about the photo contest um there was discussion of Designing a flyer I have not had time to design said flyer but city city update okay there is a news um there's a newsletter or news article online that you could there are links for but um we it's it's just text with one photo from last year",

        "text": " that could have never otherwise existed and it's hard to put into words how beneficial it is to put both restoration practitioners and local farmers together for this next slide please here's just a quick list of all the ecological benefits of doing this kind of development where we're combining clean energy with this very important pollinator native seed work next slide please in terms of challenges there are a lot of challenges with doing this kind of work this especially with a novel approach when we did it back in um there's a large uh time and monetary commitment in in that novelness and especially a large upfront monetary cost of doing this different type of seating doing a lot of hands-on management in the first few years of trying to get the native seeds to be the dominant seed on the site in addition of course we're trying to not have our plants be supplanted by weeds there are type specific issues each site is unique uh there's difficulty enacting these issues on very large sites given first of all the upfront costs but also sometimes just the availability of native seed it's not even a cost issue it's a supply chain issue because demand for these native seeds has been low for so long and trying to get enough for a big project can be difficult one challenge specific to these projects in oregon are the current land use rules a lot of good sites to interconnect or places to place a dual use project given that their agricultural benefits and the soils they sit on under the current regime only allowed 12 acre projects there is a carve out for dual use specifically which if the locality you're in creates a pathway could you allow you to build up to 20 acres and while it's nice that there's a carve out 20 acre projects really not that in the market at least in our perspective given their small size and lack of economies of scale these current rule tamper development and the current dual use carve out does not recognize the agricultural and ecological benefits that these projects can provide especially on land that is currently underutilized despite being on a certain type of soil when we have people like john jacob from the bee business the beekeeper who has not had a new solar client since these new land use laws came into effect so i'm definitely challenging before we go to the next slide please and so yeah our takeaways are this was a really cool project is a really cool project made through collaboration creative thinking and local support especially with our needed state goals but also responsible development and trying to add those additional benefits unfortunately despite uh in the current land use regime um this you know this project had been when these those rules were in effect this project might not have happened um and i i know a lot of other projects that that might not be in the ground because of this so um and despite the agricultural and ecological benefits they provide especially when actually cited in agricultural communities on often on those soils that it's not allowed on these days and then each project has its own community characteristics and what's done at eagle point isn't always possible on another site but there are a lot of ways we can we can do beneficial development of our solar projects um especially these small-scale ones in our communities that is my last slide and i'd be glad to take any questions in the chat just like nailed 10 minutes first and last people good job thank you so much yeah we really appreciate you giving us the extra 10 minutes to take that break too um so if um anybody has questions um because we're gonna go into breakouts next i thought it might be good to just take a minute or maybe two to see if there are any questions on aggro um put up well i don't even want to try to say it i'm done now aggro photovoltaics yeah the term is agro voltaics we also use the phrase we'll use uh so that dual uses a bit easier though yeah i'm gonna go with that one for now i'm trying to throw a photo in there all right i don't see any hands up which doesn't mean people aren't interested i think they're all scared to ask questions because of me keeping time oh diane has a question go ahead diane hi yeah um diane hinkles for small business utility advocates thanks so much for this um and it came nicely after the obsidian presentation so thanks for that order um odo why wouldn't most solar projects like be uh these dual projects but most are like all of them that are on ground mounted yeah i would say i mean i noted in my presentation first of all this is a newer thing this was not done before uh it is sometimes challenging to get the costs down um for and make the economics work out of putting these uh getting this native seed again again because it is isn't in great supply right now it can be hard to get that um we do different you know we have kind of different levels of what we do so a lot of our sites will sometimes the best we can do is getting kind of wildlife permeable fencing in um we can do uh projects with the native seating we actually have a few projects in oregon that actually have sheet grazing on them so there's whole different levels of this and what's appropriate for the project i'd say especially with the larger projects it's it's hard to feed hundreds if not thousands of acres with native seed um and it's just it's just a reality of um both the cost but also just the physical difficulty and technical difficulty of doing that so i'd say that's it also yeah any any development um you know in the past uh like prior to 20 the mid to late 20 teens um you know this wasn't really a thing before then so i think that that might be a reason why as well thank you thanks for response and then angela go ahead with your question and we'll just make that the last question if people can survive my continued attempt to get us back in time i just wanted to add on to duken's reply to diane um right now diane the biggest reason there aren't more agribotics is because they're not allowed under our land use system it's only 12 acres and under and projects aren't financially viable with 12 acres and less so that's really the number one reason in oregon all right that's helpful thanks angela so i do want to just make sure folks know that we went ahead and moved the attendees we have about a dozen of them that are they're watching our group talk up to panelists i'm sorry i've been trying to get my hand up and maybe maybe they hadn't shown oh yeah i just now see it i'm sorry that i'm missing okay hey thanks so i guess uh a couple comments and then and a question or two but i'll make it quick thank you again for this presentation i remember um seeing something very similar uh and around 2018 and finding it interesting and fascinating um i also just have to agrivoltaic is not forbidden by oregon's land use laws it's absolutely available there's nothing that keeps people from doing it but they don't get us an extra credit for it and i i just i just have to push back and say that land use laws inhibiting agri-voltaic in my in my opinion it's just wrong it's um but here's a question ordinary and i know i don't i'm not asking you any you know insider uh secrets or anything um but what what do customary lease agreements with property owners look like do they do they typically have limitations on who can enter that land or who can do things on that property and i mean are there are there any covenants or items like that that are customarily found in those lease agreements with with a private property owner sir john is that is that meant for me or you know i think but i you know i would out for anybody that can answer it i guess would be like in this case in terms of like the beekeeper getting on site or i was just a little confused on who what actually we're talking about yeah so a little context i guess i was i remember talking to um the executive director of the oregon agricultural trust and saying hey you know we've got these projects uh they're out there on um on some pretty productive farmland in the valley wouldn't these be opportunities for that are interested in you know kind of market gardening or or misgardening or csas or something like that that might otherwise have trouble accessing land you know if they're out there maybe you know there's a there's a opportunity to you know get people together and one of the questions was you know what what are they constrained from doing that by the by the lease agreement and so yes i guess that's the question so for instance if if you know pinegate had a project and you're releasing land for a private property owner well that's just not going to be trying to i'd like to say whoever right um um with that lease agreement have anything that would constrain me or some other third party from having to farm that property or or is it customarily be the uh be the operator of the facility that would really conduct the farming yeah i would say i mean it is really uh site specific uh we see this especially as a case when bringing sheep onto farms because you know the the um the shepherd has to like bring on they have to like have access to the site utilize it and then sometimes some insurance issues around that like i don't know what your sheep choose on a wire right so um often those will be um those are often figured out in those contracts and uh if you're talking about like trying to grow plants under panels often we're working uh you know with farmers who own that land and are leasing it to us so often it will be the landowner um who would be the one doing that although i'd say agrovoltaics in the sense of growing crops under panels is still very hard to do and do an economic scale right now at least to my knowledge of it i i will drop in the chat i previously worked at uh on a report about our dual use and agribolt takes uh in oregon and washington and i'll put that report in there and it talks about these kind of specific issues all right and angela and john there's a question for john in the chat from angela so when we go into breakouts john if you want to if you want to answer that that'd be great and john i wouldn't be able to see",

        "text": " do we know any rumors I mean typically people uh are approached by developers get you know want options on the property and things before they actually listed anything um I know there's a couple of big firms in the residential side in this area that have done a good job of locking up a lot of land I don't know about theal players yeah I can answer that so we know I think this map is is good um as as a starting point uh there's background conversations going on between developers and these property owners and some of them are talking to the city as well um we've heard an attorney on the record during one of the sure would West meting say that there have been offers made from from developers on some of these properties already and they are the ones that are showing no response right now so you know we we know that there's more interest and frankly a lot more going on than than what's shown here um and that's okay this is a very specific survey um but I think we're we're aware of more activity going on thank you good question appreciate the help there Y and that was actually going to be my comment as well so thanks good perfect um all right so with all that in mind now we're focused on the mix deployment area these are the sorts of things that uh McKenzie as a as a design firm looks for based on our experien of Designing employment projects for pivate so what are some of the considerations well kind of hinted at some of this earlier but west of elart Road there's multiple property owners and the parcels are a bit smaller so that's a bit of an impediment if you're trying to create a large development site particularly if we start do out numers like 40 acres or 50 acres because it would mean that a property owner I mean that a developer would have to approach multiple property owners and get them to agree in a on a time frame that works for development so so that's a challenge west of elt Road uh you'll also see some slope west of Elbert Road um some over 10% teeny little bit over 25% um fortunately most of the area that's you know envisioned for employment is outside this the steep slope areas um so it's not a um it's not all encompassing and thankful for that um but it it would um it would limit the types of buildings that can be constructed in that um the road locations the conceptual Road locations that were shown um obviously the the spacing of those affects um the ability to create large Parcels uh and so uh par and there's also City Block City Block size standards and there's Transportation related separation requirements for uh vehicle safety and so um interestingly if a project were proposed that strictly met the Box spacing requirements then it would going to with rather a small parcel um and so there's there's precedent in other parts of the city where large uh employment project have come in where the planning commission's been willing to Grant a variance on the Block sizing standards in order to allow these large scale development projects and so something like that would let be required here in order to create a 40 or 50 acre par um I mentioned it earlier the BPA electrical transmission Corridor it's kind of on a diagonal here that doesn't totally include all development but it does specify or where buildings themselves could be um some uses can be allowed under that buet certainly not buildings and then finally I mentioned this earlier about the Metro Title 13 designations the significance of those areas hasn't been determined um and so you know it appears that a concept plan you said kind of arbitrary uh curved Arc of the road to decide that well to the north west uh some impacts will be allowed and to the southeast they would they would not occur um so that's something that we're going to look at in some of our various thoughts about how large Parts this could be created uh and then here's a a diagram with a bit more from Janet and her team a bit more Transportation intersection spacing standards so just just kind of a graphic to help us think about and analyze like where where would roads be um are there opportunities for repining it what are the uh what are the spacing standards in general at a high level you know arterial roads which are Roy rod SCH Sherwood and lward those all have wide spacing requirements you don't want every single development to have a driveway on material because it's it's not safe and so the idea on those is to the extent you can you then driveways you have intercepting streets at the appropriate spacing and you have development speed into onto those um side streets whether they're collectors or local roads um and so there's some minimum and maximum spacing standards that we listed here so with all that in mind we decided let's start sketching um so the goal here was can we find 50 acre development and um we've got what six different scenarios they're not in any particular order or priority um and as preview our first question um for the advisory Comm the mean is are there any to speak to you what do you like what are your comments um so the first one here was just if we leave the roads exactly as shown in the concept plan U what size development sites can you get and so you know most of our attention is going to be east of Albert Road because that's where you've got large uh SWAT of property not too steep um and owners all of which help to um make development easily so here we've got a range um you know in the 303 and the 30 some acre size one just over 20 and then west of lward smaller ones we've got a couple at three acres or so one at five one at 10 and a couple approaching 20 acres um we also added just just to help keep things in mind uh we added some notations about how much of that area was designated as habitat so some of these if uh if encroachments are allowed if the El's allowed then the 32 Acre Site is viable but if it's not allowed um then this doesn't become a viable site at all because nearly the entirety of it B in Title 1 habitat can so that was the first one scenario a um for scenario B we thought about what if we delete uh what if we eliminate this highlighted Road segment here from the concept plan maybe it's needed um and so that would allow you know a 50 acre parcel in the northeast corner in about about a 21 equ parcel still have EPA though uh running through that so not the most ideal but you could considerably put a building on either side of the BPA Corridor although the the bottom left here is a little little harder to get to not quite as attractive and then the rest of the the map we do the same for scenar C what if we took out some more so everything highlighted in yellow is is Rogues that we thought these could potentially go away um and now you've got a couple of really good siiz Parcels in the 70 acre range particularly if we realign the roadway here to uh extend conselman Road just easterly as far as you can and then intersect the um with Ry Rogers Road similarly on the west side if this North South Road were eliminated you get some bigger Parcels nearly eight Acres 25 acres and a couple you know 15 acres plus or minus and to provide access here we're suggesting creating a new Road in this location um and then we've got just different variations on moving roads and adding roads and what shape and size U sites could we get this one's got 58 acres and 70 Acres so the main difference between D and C is um in C we're assuming that uh this title 13 area could be used for development and in D were assuming it could not so there's some sort of policy Choice in E we looked at a sort of a you know a road Cur linear road that instead of coming down from the north and heading west it comes up from the south and then head West that could allow this upper right corner to be about 76 Acres and in the final scenario we just said well geez what if we got rid of all those intervening roads what should you do then and it's about 150 acres obviously the BPA line still runs through there that's 15 acres and themselves so 10% of the land would be in that BPA Corridor but you know if the if the ultimate goal were just can you make as big a site as POS possible um and scenario F would be with right off so I've talked at you for a while now I'd like to get some feedback um anyone with with thoughts observations fatal claws please tell that hi everybody um I uh appreciate the conversation about the Upland habitat and Erica and I have had some offline conversations about that as well and um some of the thoughts that I have are that I would uh want to be cautious about presuming that those areas that are designated inventoried as Class B Upland habitat could necessarily be developed um and Eric and I have sort of talked through a little bit of that um and that there may be some ways that it is um for example depending on a potential easy analysis that the city could maybe undertake uh if and when these areas are brought into the urban growth boundary um but if that the outcome of such an easy analysis would be uncertain um and if that easy analysis didn't occur then there would be essentially I'll just say sort of automatic land use restrict on development under the Metro rules um that could prohibit uh most but not necessarily all level of development um so I guess maybe some thought I have is uh to the degree that we're relying on some of that Upland habitat area including those areas that have been concept planned as mix employment for sort of meeting some large parcel land need um I would encourage us to sort of think of ways that we could find the large parcels and meet Industrial Development elsewhere outside of the Upland area um I'm curious about some I was looking at scenario f um I'm sorry scenario e the one right before this and there's that Dash blue line that follows the Northeast edge of the Upland habitat area which um I like and I'm wondering if it's necessary to also have that dashed Blue Line further south or if that road segment could be removed in order to avoid the potential of you know uh severing this Upland habitat and building roads closer to that rip",

very close to here they're working on uh this uh 27th Street Avenue which is a Christmas tree lot and it's a beautiful apartment we have been awarded uh roughly $17 million to build this project in the City of Salem uh you know we all know there's a housing crisis here in the state of Oregon in the City of Salem these homes uh we're partnering with also local community members midw Amit Valley Community Action Agency uh seed of Faith Ministries is one of our also major partners and co-developer in this project this development uh it is a three phased approach uh the first phase will be 120 units of one two and three and four bedroom apartments um family siiz units there will be a 3500t community room with multiple meeting offices rooms a resident service so really trying to foster a community uh right now there's a basketball court design there in multiple playground areas um nice 15ft pedestrian pathway cutting through the property some information just um you know these units are homes for families so we can't for uh forget all those that need homes so our our goal here is to put roofs over over folks heads um there is a third phase potentially down the line that will be a CO located affordable early childhood development there's a commercial lot that's part of the sale but the real reason I'm here today is uh we have asked the city to help us in this acquisition of land from the hospital there is a timeline with the hospital and their their desire to sell the property and there's a timeline for our funding as affordable housing developers from lenders and also from the state as I mentioned we have awarded funds from the state and so the the request you see in section 5B is for the city to uh to we can assign the PSA to them and and then they'll help us get there with the um with the development and we are submitting for land use at this point in the project and we should be uh breaking ground in the summer so uh that is the goal so July to be building 120 new homes and we'll have a phase two which should be going in for funding request in March April so that is thank you so much for your time thank you I'm here for any questions is needed thank you we'll have a full presentation later on in the agenda and next up is Lyn Takata yes just hit that button so the green light comes button thank you to the um mayor and City councilors for allowing me to share some of the input from our neighborhood association Northeast neighbors I'm chair of nen and we appreciate your service and all of the volunteer hours that you all put in to make our city better so I'm a resident of Ward one and um been the chair of nen for a few years um we over the last six month our neighborhood association has reached out to the various partners that are working on this development seed of Faith Ministries green light development and uh Community Action and we've worked diligently to try to you know create collaborative Partnerships which is ideal um I don't think we've received as much traction as we had hoped um I'm here to advocate for the city to support the goals the council has already adopted in terms of greenhouse gas emissions climate change uh and multimodal transportation if the city does not ask new developers to try to meet those goals We are Never as a city going to meet some of these you know climate change goals and other goals the council has already adopted just good you know kind of PR to say that the city has a climate change plan unless there's some kind of action that accompanies you know that so um I understanding from speaking with a number of people who are in the room that there's a possibility um that we might be a that there might be conditions that could be attached and I wanted to say that we are absolutely supportive the purchase we're absolutely supportive of affordable housing so we're not a nimi organization in any way but we're asking for this development to you know meet some of those goals so we're hoping the council can consider attaching uh some of the conditions to the sale of the property to you know further climate change Transportation pedestrian and um bicycle access and most importantly ped a safe pedestrian Crossings on D Street because this um development serves families and there's three schools where the children have to cross D Street and it's not safe there's no sidewalk on the south side of the street at all so thank you for the opportunity I appreciate it thank you Lynn all right now we are on to the consent calendar counselor Phillips I move the consent calendar with the exception of 3.2e which was pulled by councelor nishio okay second motion by philli second by vanney counselor to your motion so tonight's uh consent calendar consists of 3.2a which

councelor Stapleton absent councelor nishioka I councelor Phillips I councelor Gwyn I councelor Gonzalez absent mayor Hoy I motion all right we are on to item 4A public hearing the city of Sal the city the Salem City Council will now conduct a public hearing to consider a petitioner initiated annexation of Territory located at 572 High Lane Northeast the criteria applicable to the decision is at SRC 26.1 0 g2a Roman Ral I Roman numeral I I Roman numeral i i i and Roman numeral IV and GB Roman numeral I Roman numeral I I testimony arguments and evidence must be directed towards the applicable criteria or other criteria which the person believes to apply to the decision failure to raise an issue prior to the close of the public Hearing in person or in writing or failure to provide statements or evidence with with sufficient specificity to provide the parties and the city council an opportunity to respond to the issue precludes appeal to the land use board of appeals on that issue a similar failure and to raise constitutional issues relating to proposed conditions of approval prudes an action for damages in Circuit Court the hearing will begin with a staff presentation the applicant is limited to 10 minutes applicable neighborhood association limited to 5 minutes other interested parties limited to 3 minutes the applicant may have up to 5 minutes rebuttal testimony limited to issues raised during public testimony I I I see Mr Bishop has joined us at the microphone it's all yours oh good evening uh mayor Hoy members of the council uh Bryce Bishop with the Community Development Department here to present the staff report for the annexation before you this evening it's an annexation for property at 572 High Lane Northeast and it includes not only an annexation but with that request a comp plan and zone change to change the land use designations that are applicable to the property upon its annexation so in terms of the subject property itself up on the screen here I have a vicinity map and so on the left hand side or the West End to the West is the downtown so the property in question is over near the East End of the city uh near Cordon road which is the ugb so it's shown in the red asterisk so it's between generally Center Street uh south of Center and north of Auburn and uh again it's you know contiguous to city limits on the North uh South and and East and it is is proposed for annexation so uh in terms of the comprehensive plan designation that currently applies to the property it is uh designated developing residential on the city's comprehensive plan map and with this annexation request the applicant is uh requesting to change the designation to multif family residential in order to allow the continuation of an existing multif family development that's been approved to the north to continue and extend in a second phase onto this property so as you can see on the map uh the designations uh surround the property property include a mix of single family residential which is the yellow area shown on the map uh of course the multif family orange to the north uh to the South uh developing residential uh which is like a single family or middle housing designation and then there's also some public land to the southeast accommodating or Southwest rather where there's a school and uh so it's kind of a mix in terms of the designation there and then we have a a node of mixed use also to the southeast where we have neighborhood Hub zoning so in terms of the zoning of the property because in the county still it's designated uh Maran County Urban UD or Urban Development um and the property that you see the properties in color there are the ones that are in the city all the ones that are grayed out those are still in the county uh so this proposal would uh change the designation of the property to uh with the request to multif family residential rm2 which is the city's kind of medium density multif family zoning we have rm1 rm2 and an rm3 uh so this would be the the middle range rm2 and and then again if to match the designation of the property to the north to allow uh the continuation of a previously approved first phase of a multifam development the Cascade Vista Apartments and so surrounding zoning is uh to the east is single family residential you have U single family equivalent zones in the county where we have single family homes and then again that neighborhood Hub uh kind of uh brown color zoning right there which would allow for a little bit of a a mix of uses there for some commercial opportunities uh near you know this multi family and",

        "text": " jason okay um you know this is kind of a format for anybody who's in the march meeting that we're just repeating for this meeting um these numbers that you'll see throughout kind of these um introductory slides where i refresh on the key topics that we're going to talk about and that we receive feedback on they correspond to the prompting question document that the department put together early on um back in the beginning of the year and so if for folks that wanted to follow along or want to refresh on the complete kind of list of questions that link's available for folks to uh to to click on um via the pdf of the slide deck that's available on the website that richard just pointed out um and then and then yeah this one only had basically one big question with a few you know strands of questions bundled into it but it was basically you know asking folks how do they expect floating offshore when to contribute to to these 100 clean energy targets so these were the themes from the comments that we heard um i'll probably just kind of paraphrase these um and not necessarily read them all for everybody but um it's almost just easy just to read through them floating off your wind is going to be critical to meet oregon's clinicals studies that i kind of just referenced in addition to other studies they do show this tremendous scale of gigawatts necessary to meet those targets and that offshore one can contribute um floating offshore wind can balance with solar um so we saw those maps where solar and wind are available on the west western landscape and they kind of balance each other out they specific some some folks specifically noted the ability to um contribute energy during the winter peak season here in the pacific northwest but when our heating loads increase and our solar kind of disappears and the days get shorter flooding offshore one could also be part of the solution to help oregon and surrounding states meet their clean energy and climate goals and some amount of floating offshoring can play a role assuming minimal impacts to the environment and ocean ecology then we have a few other ones floating after it represents a great replacement resource a gigawatt scale for regional fossil fuel and hydro projects that may be retired this gets back to it's called capacity credit um capacity factor is another term they're kind of related but different but they generally show um you know when resources are available to meet meat load and produce energy so floating offshore wind has high values and i think that's why the comparison is made to fossil fuel and hydro projects because they're also available many hours of the day um floating offshore wind is projected to serve a diversity role in economy-wide decarbonization so i think people um are in agreement with kind of the studies that have been done in the studies that i also uh referenced in the draft literature review load growth and use electricity so that's that's the electrification pieces i talked about earlier and then floating off sherwin in the ocean offers benefits to optimize the amount of land used for solar and wind development on land so that's another kind of key feature for offshore wind is it gives us kind of a not only a new energy tool but a new place for that energy tool that's different than how we've currently approached building energy projects in the past so that's that's kind of a quick wrap up of uh really the common themes i mean we got probably other feedback um on that topic that maybe wasn't seen on that on that slide deck but um a lot of the stuff overlapped and i tried to capture as much of the things that you know people are constantly hitting on in their comments for everybody's benefit here great thanks jason this is uh the opportunity that i mentioned for additional input on this topic so like i mentioned we've kind of gone through different we have identified different topics for today's meeting we're trying to focus the feedback on those topics i know that some folks are sort of tuning in and out based on which topic we're on in the agenda so we're trying to keep to that as much as possible knowing that we're continuing to welcome written feedback on all of the topics on our portal so if you have ideas here for additional input information or perspectives that differ from the feedback that jason just synthesized on clean energy targets or if you would want to emphasize a certain part of that we've heard some emphasis just on the sheer scale in the chat for example that the modeling shows maybe would be needed to meet um the the clean energy and climate change um requirements in the state if you have um topics for future study or engagement on 100 clean or other thoughts we really would welcome that in the chat or um in uh in by raising your hand so i'll we'll just pause here for a bit to give people a chance to think not seeing any rays oh i think uh i see a raised hand from harvey harvey i think you've been unmuted go ahead with your question or comment yeah i got some comments i i sent an email to jason yesterday because i had there was a technical glitch i couldn't get my comments in but i just want to uh i got received that report they sent me a link on that and an nrel report technical report on the uh the wind generator tower and with its configuration of the dimensions the mass it's i would say it's a feat of engineering i can say that uh my comments and i sent some um technical literature about this and my comments is you're out in the middle of the ocean uh you're exposed to uh storms the wind speeds can get over 100 miles an hour you've got a real long i think it's like almost 474 feet if i got that correct 32 foot diameter you got this long slender column i i think you need to look at a way and i said i sent jason some technical literature about this uh ways to reduce the drag forces on the that column uh turn especially the storm because that that wind drag can push that thing over plus uh wave the impact forces those maybe 30 40 foot waves on that structure can push it over and it may uh i don't know what your anchoring system is maybe you're going to have to do a very good design anchoring system according to that report that uh colin weighs three million pounds so you could push that over uh i was suggesting maybe look you look into putting uh either grooves on the column the skin to reduce the drag reduction i think there was one technical report you can reduce it says uh it was a journal of fluids you could reduce they had a reduced drag from uh from a smooth cylinder using grooves a lot on the skin the other thing to watch out for and i saw that and i mentioned this to jason's and my email is that uh there was an example there's a in england there was a company built it was a chemical plant they put in installed a 300 hot foot high cracking tower it was 20 foot diameter i believe on the base 300 feet uh they installed it and it was a 30 mile an hour wind and it had a resonance frequency they called vortex shedding and it started popping six inch diameter bolts on the base that was bolted to a concrete foundation and they had to put a crane in to stop it and the reason why there was a 12 inch and six inch pipe on the outside of the this column otherwise it was smooth that caused a resonance section uh condition or a vortex shedding and that caused it to uh vibrate and uh popping those bolts you know uh so what i'm saying is you to be very careful i'll do a wind tunnel very carefully design this thing to make sure you don't hit a resonance frequency because that could uh seriously uh do serious damage to your yeah it's uh quite a if you can pull this off it's quite a engineering feat i think you're going to need to do a lot of design to make sure that the platform the support platform is stable uh if you're using ballast you might want to put it ballot uh baffles to make sure that the ballast doesn't see water doesn't slosh around adding to this rocking motion so you gotta be very careful about that design and it was gonna be quite an engineering um feat to be able to do that but uh i really i think that that nrel's report is excellent i really uh it's a very good report but this is a massive structure so we need to i would suggest a wave tunnel away wind tunnel and wave wave tank studies to be done before you do their final design and that's my main comment on that that's great um i i'm sorry about the technical issues and i'm glad that you got in touch with um jason it's almost like the um comments that you made were just uh totally ready for the next topic in which we actually have folks from nrel on the line um to speak to some of those topics um i see patrick from nrel i think has his hand up if you want to respond briefly patrick and then maybe reserve the bulk of the discussion for for that topic um go ahead patrick yep you can hear me great uh yeah i think those are all very important considerations in the the design process both for the turbine itself and for the floating substructure there are a number of different companies and engineering firms and and standards agencies like the international electrotechnical commission which have a set of established design standards for offshore wind turbines and floating offshore wind turbines that are informed by many of the concerns that you described thank you great and i think we're going to hear a little bit more about some of those topics um later in the agenda so looking forward to that um thank you very much um i wanted to just review some of the things in the chat as well um the uh there has been a good discussion about transmission uh so i'll just mention that has been continuing as well as comments around needing to consider the scale of the fisheries that will be impacted by the potential for that build out questions about accountability mechanisms in place to ensure tribal consultation labor standards and protections for ecological and cultural resources we mentioned that we covered some of those topics at our last but want to continue to receive written feedback on those topics through our um we also kind of talked about the in the chat the development of all energy resources except for maybe energy efficiency and conservation have the potential for adverse impacts solar has significant land use",

        "text": " the side parking requirements there you a little like sheet then you can I don't know do something a 5% yeah which is one I mean they're going to get be automatic adjustments or variances anyway in couple years so you might as well incen now dis too far down the path I want to be mindful of time we have a code to do so we have no no you're you had more notes I just want to make sure that we get them if they're related I have lots of crazy ideas but I think it's okay city council meeting you get your three minutes my three minutes you four oh get four I think we covered the major think send those to us that would be great so then we can actually start thinking about you know as we're creating our Word program um as far as well what things can we tackle and you know or how should we approach this that would be great just because I'm not sure if I captured everything yeah I I just I mean I've the pleasure city council and the impression I've gotten so far is we're opposed to this I mean the city is suing over it though obviously so I'm just trying to brainstorm ways to the extent possible great I think totally within your burm view Asing commissioner and the citizens advisory committed so bring them on I think you know what what when you start saying these things what I think about is you know how how could we actually make it happen for the code process and all the other state laws clearing objetive there's a lot that this like starts going and so we need some time digest it figure out if there's some some I am curious about the 881 though what I mentioned to your attorney requiring no parking space in disabled area means no Ada spots and yet interestingly throughout the rest of this that it says if you do provide parking the first priority is to who disabled but we're not g i mean it's so weird but I am curious about that is that going to get us in trouble if we don't require at least 88 spots or what supersedes what here you know I don't know it's very yeah but it's State's making us do it so it's it's PR the state yes I think that's the perfect way to say it is like if State mandated us to do something they passed a law that was didn't comply with title six or whatever it is then that's then Federal govern come down on the state okay think are we gonna have another work session because I think the brainstorming of we got we oh yeah oh yeah the we will continue on in regards to um moving uh forward as I'm um developing the other two program yes because if we're going to hearing at this late spring I think it would be nice if some of or some of the other things that we could have just a full brainstorming session of things that we could throw out yeah then one of the other requirements or it should well um we've committed to is definitely uh a public Outreach in regards to like an open house to the community so that they know that this is coming up and it's it's most likely be more informative just because things are but then we're hoping by then we'll have some type of Direction in regard of the litigation um so you mentioned we're acting as the CAC for this right right we have to do this past stuff about it like that yeah you are that hat I know we're looking at specific code yeah no but during the hearing you have to take your uh CAC hat off and think of it as a commission the right hearing I just didn't time because I didn't want to we got months on this well we don't have months but I also when you're saying that public Outreach I don't want the public Outreach to be right before the hearing after we made all the decisions I would like it to be after as soon after the appeal decision is made so that ideas like dance come out and then we get some whiteboards out because if there's any of these quick code things that we can do that helps modify that can be implemented at the same time that's that's what I would see we could reach out to the public both with the ideas of what we've done so far but see if other or other people have right because one of the stakeholders is definitely the commercial um entities that we have to reach out to them and say hey this is but again I we don't know where the litigation is going to be at that time so we just do our best definitely you know if we're having March hearings um maybe early February or late January I just don't want it to be within the holiday base it's it's it's it'sing we'll come back to the commission and talk about our openhouse strategy yeah so this has to be implemented when it we have to have it adopted by or well June because it June 30th next it has to be in effect July one July 1 but they can do that so usually yeah so two hearings in June by Council our hearings in May so it could be February maybe as far as Outreach but um but we want it after the appeal yeah so that's why we don't know I think we just need to schedule it yeah March yeah yeah we we won't know yeah we need we could follow up like after the fact too I think maybe and do another engagement activity with the community to get you know additional feedback for what we do in the future what you know what may make sense for survey we can do a survey online there's lots of Engagement tools excellent but the other the other side of that is getting people engaged so that they understand that we're having to do this and you need to get your legislatures voting the right way if we wait you know there is Chatter on this ex a executive order from the governor so because I was thinking it would be nice with that with that page we have for more information on this on the Sherwood site a stack of our our Representatives the state metro area where they stand on this issue so hey if you don't like it go talk to these people if you do like it go talk to these people but if 3414 coming back up in 2024 we need to get the conversation out there so that yes at our open house they be a whole board that says and talk to your legislator about 3414 I think there's a common misconception right now that cities have a lot more control over their Destiny than we really do in this state any longer and just this week there was chatter on social media that there was even my wife involved in and Kim Young jumped in on it because people do not understand that they're what is the city doing we aren't we have to carry out the edicts of the state so vote differently vote yes okay all right well thank you so more to come and we'll keep you guys informed so I think we're gonna move on to the next good cards F cards F cards wrap up so we had our last work session about a month a month ago September is I think it was I included um all of our changes that we about at the work session and did a track change version and a clean version for you all to review so you want us to just hit like starting at the beginning because like pack of page for a for roof manity equipment a parad language that we ended on was a paret that conceals the tallest part of the equipment from the public Street CU that was the ending conversation like that that was page pack page 37 yeah and it's it's it's crazy it's 4 a the tallest oh yeah a parit as tall as the tallest part of the and actually what what we said was a parit that conceals the tallest part of the equipment from the public public street that was just to be able to because we had it something come in where they were just trying to as long as it's not visible from the public Street they don't need a 12 foot if theed equipment 37 if the equipment's four feet tall and it's in the center of the building you don't need a four tall parabit around it you need it to be not visible of the street what at what distance what's considered it comes up in my world because that's if I'm standing on the sidewalk right in front of the building can I see that antenna on the roof no but if I'm three blocks down walking down now I can see it so within what distance because that that angle is going to change the closer you get I mean it's just a good question because anybody have thoughts on that the standard is is that it needs to be as tall as the equipment right yeah so if that's the case I mean that'll block okay unless you're unless you're at a higher elev I think we what we discussed was that we would make it shorter if it's not visible from the public street but then to your point okay so maybe but there is a certain line though I mean we have to draw so people who might have planning experience let's your guys thought okay so then we just leave like differ on like the height of the building okay then just just make it okay never mind go through every scenario can't okay we hire a planner just to do that yeah perfect we'll just keep it as is and then I I had 42 L there's no l i I had I had an l but it wasn't added and maybe it was only in my mind that I added an L which was a screening plan oh remember I I remember that like landscape screening I'm sorry on page 41 when we were talking about utilities there was a question brought up on the food card pod site utility standards was there a standard for propane was asked because they're usually using propane I am going to come back and answer that question because I didn't no did we already cover your hours question we I think no we didn't ep3 commission will need to consider what hours make the most sense for sites of buing resti property pack page 40 this I wrote down 8 to8 just kind of off the but I don't know if that seems too much or too little Sunday through Thursday well what are the noise ordinances and sure would I would probably go with quiet hours good idea yeah we can say um day it's kind of weird in our code we say Day hours yeah and it's um 7 to 9M H the camping from 9 to 7",

        "text": " shown that it's not irrigated and there's not an opportunity for your in order to bolster that I asked for a more comprehensive assessment of the area and we didn't get it it's not in the 187 pages of supplemental information that we got and I don't understand why it's not there but I think it needs to be that we need something that is specific to that parcel in order to take it out of agricultural Productions yes and I agree with much of what councilor Jenkins has said I may come down on differently on whether or not they're not their burden of approved but this is this discussion of goal three is something that a council needs to take very seriously as we see more and more and bigger and more complex so this is kind of since I've been here this is the first test case on a goal three exception and what that burden of proof needs to be um and and we are to some extent setting a precedent so being very thoughtful about this is going to be critical as we look at other projects I've worked as the Umatilla Basin Watershed Council coordinator in the way back so I'm somewhat familiar with this area and the production capabilities um it's an odd parcel it's a you know or two tax slots with these mixed soils and one is a class seven which is by definition under lcdc rules not available and you know it's hard to tell from these Maps what that looks like on the landscape is is it a pocket of non-irable is it running through is this really um impossible to put crops on without in this area and maybe we just need a bigger aerial map to show what's irrigated and what's not around the area but we don't have that in the record to see if if there are not an irrigated Parcels that are being cropped in this area we just we don't have that um I sort of look at this parcel and I think well if it were really good Farmland it would have been Farm by now but that's that's not one of the criteria right I think looking at the other criteria about impacts to surrounding agricultural Parcels we didn't get any negative comments on that but it's it's whether or not the applicant has met their burden improved and I'm sort of on the fence on that well they do want to remind Council that the analysis area for land use is the site boundary in one half mile from the San Jose boundary so you know again it's one of those things so that's what is so saying looking at re you know uh like the regional assessment about how far out yeah yeah so you know exactly like you you articulating exactly what you were looking for to me was more clear than of what was said at the DPO hearing which was a regional assessment how far out what exactly are you looking at um so I think that I mean yeah where wherever you land but just you know part of the comments in the last few applications have been paid development Community do better and I think that these are good there's good information because also again the department to require it we have you know we have the project order which we can adjust uh the analysis area in but it has to be something you know a pathway that's evident for the application or for the applicant to then do that evaluation so we're still within the scope of what they're being requested to um I also uh you know wanted a part of the aspect of the um this evaluation is those existing transmission lines over the parcels does also have you know it's an outside imposition that that minimizes its you know viability to use it for AG because there is this existing infrastructure there that they have to to go around so this is handling from that point this property is offered by irrigation land it's in in Senate pivots and it's not inhibiting the adjacent those transmission lines aren't inhibiting the adjacent land so you know I'm have a difficult time placing much emphasis on the fact that the transmission lines the limit the the limiting factor for irrigation of this property is it's not available duplicate but uh handling very well but you know uh under goal three it's a very high pressure to take it out of Oregon's agricultural inventory land and change it to another use and the definition of farm use is the planting I'm going to paraphrase here planting growing harvesting management of crops and livestock to make a profit and money and uh we have some indication that for a couple of years half of the property did not when it was learned the other half we didn't know it's just incomplete it's um it's not a record that um for the high standard of removing this land from agriculture maybe I think it is what's needed and yeah so so how many years does a farmer have to lose money to demonstrate that it's not viable for dry land wheat well I don't know the answer to that we've got a couple on half of it that we've done it on the other I don't have any information on that and then you look at in context it's agricultural women making a profit and I understand that this isn't irrigated so that is a really hampers credibility to people like this is Marcia so I mean just putting out there did you try something different is it not maybe you didn't make as much money as you want like there's a lot of reasons or a lot of things and I I don't know land won't like them if I'm listening very intently but you know in my day job what I get concerned about is when I make a decision is what you follow me forever so are we attempting to lower threshold that we are then going to be held to and we can't justify other than to say this impact of these two people individually in my world and our Labor Relations Human Resources space it is focused on the position not the person so because we have these two people come before us and tell us their individual stories which were you know the stories are if you take them out of it somebody else were on that land that somebody else tried a different crop that might not be high value or somebody or do we just get to the point of say nothing gross and I to not put words in your mouth when I think I hear you saying is you're not convinced that all avenues have been exhausted to deem it not that it should still be um not so be Dean exclusive farming at that high value is that fair you know this was handling so I guess to answer to you and Calvin it's not the individual Landover and and what I wanted to be able to try and do was provided Avenue for a successful demonstration that they met the reasons exception the requirement and that's why I filmed rather than evaluating failure on these Parcels evaluate successes on whether there are successes on adjoining or nearby properties that aren't being irrigated we didn't get that information I asked for it and we didn't get it and so I always try to find a way to get to a solution and that was my way of trying to get to a solution on this it wasn't to say gee you didn't do a good enough job um up on farming this property but my concern is that we have three categories of agricultural land we have high value we have Parable and we have non-arable and the lcdc solar rules were designed incentified development on non-arable lands and so the threshold in order to be successful in making an application on non-air lands was lower larger Acres the threshold for requirements was lower now we're talking about arable lands lands that could be farmed for crops but probably not high value groups and my concern is that we're going to see more and more applications on arable lands and we need to make sure that when we process a recent exception application for those that we have some reasons for taking that land out of agricultural production and certainly you know the threshold is much higher for high value foreign soils and lcdc's even addressed those as a part of their administrative rules on the left side of Oregon and so you know I think we're now being asked to evaluate arable lands and whether or not we should be allowing solar facilities on the internet and I think we need to be very clear about what is needed in order to meet an entity facility signing accounts until three exception I'm not asking for an alternative analysis which is what's required in the lcdc rules I'm asking for an evaluation of this particular margin and reasons why it should no longer be available for agricultural use and very clear hey Cameron this is uh Professor buyer I think Handley has articulated the information we've received and what what we need to make a decision on goal um racing is an issue um just even knowing in the community if grazing is in use in this part of accounting that wasn't addressed or not just having a better idea of um lawyer dry land Agriculture and as a bird in in this part of the community um as opposed to whether a particular farmer was successful so again it's it's the context of looking at other projects and really safe we need a minimum firm approved to make a decision on this yeah thank you council members um that was all I had for landius okay all right thank you so much I appreciate those good good conversation um the council's protected area is standard now we're gonna we're gonna move kind of kind of quickly well we're gonna go faster then we'll slow down yeah it's I think we're pretty good protectors Council is this because we've done some rule making the protected areas standard kind of lists out the protected areas that are are protected underneath Council standard I have a figure here pretty hard to read this is a a you know a visual impact assessment but again it's just kind of hard to read on on this scale so uh really there's there's um 12 protected areas the analysis area for protected areas is 20 miles so it goes out pretty far here um and I'm just like gonna pause we do and remind Council of the the very interesting administrative document that we have it is the project order this is something that the Department issues in the beginning of the process that it basically goes through and it kind of walks through division 21 and it says what it's a guide rather than reading the rule it helps that applicant get to a more complete application the department also you know we've really tried to move because it used to just be really you know a regurgitation of division 21 and we're really trying to be have it be more helpful you know like if the department on every application we're",

        "text": " that the staff is recommending that we move all of the actions that we identified forward either you know something that needs more study or you know a high tier one two or three um priority um so that's one question is you know are we comfortable moving all of those actions forward and then and then secondly you know power are we feeling about how we would be describing the benefits of the actions and uh putting them in tears so any comments on either The Proposal from staff to move all the actions forward or comments on further reflection on how the the scoring worked yeah just one further comment on that so originally we thought that when we would do this analysis that the hybrid and the electrification scenario would be significantly different in fact the hybrid was actually initially called alternative fuel scenario but when we found was there wasn't enough an alternative fuels to actually create a scenario unto itself so we had to borrow a lot of the actions from the electrification to actually meet the goal in the hybrid scenario so there there was that big overlap between the two the two scenarios 18 programs were common to both and there were five that were different in the hybrid and seven that were unique to the electrification and so all of those uh and and then we thought about we might have a conversation but we did not have a conversation at the council about which pathway uh would be preferred over the other so without that conversation which I think would be a pretty big conversation are at this point and we can have that conversation in the future at this point to move this forward we felt like all of the actions that have been proposed should be moving forward into the next phase of trying to figure out how to to create action implementation plans well we we can talk about that assumption right now commissioner magnera and then oh Zach do you want to just add a clarification and then if that's what you put your hand up to do yeah thanks Terry McDonald I just wanted to add that some of it so we'll get into this in the recommendations discussion that'll come later but um part of the overall recommendation on these is also to continue to do public engagement on these actions um you know there's a lot of conversation as we were going through the co-benefits analysis and the scoring that uh you know we could only do what we could do with the resources that we have and um so there is uh also a recommendation um to have some more public engagement on these items to help in designing the implementation and also uh trying to figure out whether you know going one scenario or the other scenario is better or not we don't have enough information at the moment and so um one of the recommendations later that we'll talk about is also trying to have um recommending that Odo do a Energy System state Energy System planning effort to try to get at some of those issues so just want to provide a little more holistic context about how we're thinking about how they work together thank you Zach commissioner magnera yes just a reflection on the uh the activities that reached uh or that made the cut which is that they're for the most part from a co-benefits perspective going to serve more urban or developed um and I know we've got the natural and working lands work that's happening and that in general where most of our emissions reductions are needed are in more urban areas but that might be something worth noting for the report just thinking from a political perspective that there are a lot of legislators who may not see their communities in this work so I think it's uh important for this body to help communicate that or to help explain why there are fewer uh recommendations that might be specific to rural communities and of course the existing buildings piece will have a very big benefit especially heat pumps for communities that are very dependent on bulk fuels but nonetheless I think that is something that stands out to me and that may stand out to other legislators and that we should anticipate in in kind of how this gets conveyed and messaged really good point I think we've talked about trying to show some of the county results too and maybe help people see where where this is going to touch down and not so or where are the different actions too so we'll we'll um both include narrative and maybe use some of the county-based information to um illustrate potential benefits across the state um but also you know where some may vary just a comment on that I that's totally true what commissionera said about the Transportation uh ones but almost all of the Energy Efficiency ones are a hundred percent of households they will have heat pumps or heat pump water heaters or an increased weatherization and increase uh the resident the residential commercial building codes which would be Statewide so all of those affect everyone in the um and and I I think I've often said uh that the one way to deal with the the uh the issue of equity in terms of Rural and low-income moderate income is make sure that the low income amount of income first in the rural folks first because they always end up short of getting the short end of the stick and so but that's related to how they get implemented not what because these are all 100 of homes will get go get heat pumps for instance in a rural community and talking to to my community about some of the work that the state does even if you say 100 that people don't always see themselves in that so I think being really explicit about it or saying in implantation we can really prioritize communities like that's really important to name because I think while it may be feel inherent or implied to those of us on this body it's not in a community like like few and like being really explicit that this means you is something that I found in my work I have to go out of my my way to do and would encourage this body to do the same yeah it certainly can be something we put in there as a recommendation in the report for sure moving forward with all the actions in one form or another kind of other thoughts about the rankings and how we should be thinking about it Zach you want to bring up like slide 17 in our summary slide not seeing any hands just the two things from my perspective um really wanting to make sure that for things that are underway we maybe call those out like we did the the two actions that were still in rule making when we were doing the the scenario modeling um but you know potentially thinking about characterizing some of the things that are already underway a little differently so that's that that's I guess one of my concerns and then the second is I I um I think we do need to kind of provide here's how we here's one cut at setting um we tried to look at co-benefits you know there may be other co-benefits that weren't included in our analysis that may be a really important reason for us for a legislator to or an agency to move something forward you know for for example on the congestion pricing that you know just a huge impact that has on on getting goods and to to Market um and and back so um I think I think we should um make sure we're not setting this up to be a rationale not to do things um and really trying to think about how we can help the state you know think about this in a holistic commissioner Jackson uh I think you must be muted you don't look like you are but okay sorry okay there we go um I want to support the staff's recommendation for how to present it uh to move all the actions forward um I think as Commissioners we may have specific preferences but I think the way the staff Bracken uh put it together it's much more of informational and I think speaks to uh your point about uh being it uh useful and in a way to inform I also want to support commissioner mcnaira's recommendation about adding the that information I think putting forward the recommendation to do all of the items and making it as information as we can it can actually move things forward versus us being prescriptive so although we may have individual preference as I do I think not being prescriptive is the path forward to success and um actually getting things done so I just want to support the staff the way they've recommended it to move forward great thank you commissioner Jackson uh commissioner Ford thank you chair McDonald um I I also support the recommendations as they've been laid out um and I agree with commissioner um perspective on this that I think we have to be careful not to be prescriptive uh I think putting all these items out uh onto the playing field is the appropriate thing to do uh and provide as much information as we can to the legislators um and to the hccs is that as they're looking at at creating legislation and or programs within their various agencies I do I am a little concerned about the tiered approach I think chair you'd mentioned this earlier um not that I don't think they ought to be priorities but I think we can list the priorities by you know 1 to 27 or or or whatever I'm just concerned that from a reading a reader's perspective um I just psychologically would probably dismiss tier three stuff um and and focus on tier one and maybe some tier two and that really give the um due diligence or evaluation of things that are in tier three so if the concept is that we're going to recommend uh all these actions uh and provide the information to support these actions I'm a little concerned that organizing them by Tears May Prejudice the readers a bit and and we're already putting them in priority by 1 through 27 so um that's just a quick thought I have on after reading those materials um yeah and thinking about this a bit so thank you thank you commissioner uh commissioner potowski uh thank you uh commissioner McDonald chair McDonald I mean uh you know I was just a side comment on your uh comments about congestion pricing and I think this relates to some of the other uh actions that are on here you know congestion pricing has a lot of benefits in terms of making our road system more efficient it means ODOT doesn't have to spend as much on Building New Roads and it also provides funding for for roads so those are things that are are maybe somewhat not related to reduce reduction of get greenhouse gas emissions but that's also one of the items that it helps with so I so if we're just explicit about it and saying you know just because it may be in this",

        "text": " taxing boards agree to the exemption exemption the tax exemption is$ 179,000 and so I'm wondering if we have some leeway there that's kind of what I'm asking about thank thank you counselor uh and counselor Gonzalez I agree with you at least in part in terms of I don't want to change the rules in Midstream since we already have an application in process I am certainly fine with uh potentially adding reasonable conditions like our rules allow and that sort of thing I am okay with delaying this uh for for a meeting I don't have a problem with it the developer didn't have a problem with it and I want to air on the side of caution I feel like um there's some good conversations that were had and I want to I want to be able to talk to them more about uh potential safeguards so we don't have any of those things happening that were reported I don't know if those things are actually happening or not but I think we have a duty to at least check it out so I don't think delaying it for one meeting will uh negatively impact the this development but I but I do recognize and uh that we are having a significant housing shortage which drives our homelessness situation and so I don't want to put any undue delay but I don't think one meeting is undue so councelor nioka thank you mayor Hoy um yes I feel that um I I will move forward with voting for um the motion to postpone to next month and um I feel comfortable doing that because the developer felt that they had a bit of time and that does give opportunity to um just make sure that those that came to give public testimony have that right to be heard and make sure that everything is in um good working order the thing that I would hate to do while this group has moved so far along in their process is put a roadblock up saying oh no you need to have more um affordable housing on this project I feel that they've already got all their numbers working so I I feel that I would move forward with it um again but delaying it for the next meeting is fine I think that that brings up the opportunity for us to um potentially make a motion in the future of having staff review policies for mtip and see if there's some additional changes or adaptations that we might need to make so it becomes a bit clear and it feels um it just it feels like we're we're providing as much uh affordable housing as we can with the projects and the cost of those projects so that would be the only thing I'd say thank you counselor just as a reminder I think we did update the mood tip rules in 2022 so but not that we can't do it again but we it hasn't been too long since we did update them thank you for reminding me I don't think I uh knew that date it might have been before I came it might have been before you were on Council I'm not sure anyway so um but it might be just something to review and see if there needs to be any adjustments I think with the inflation and all it it it does make it very very tough to even meet some of those standards so thank you thank you is there further discussion seeing none will the recor please call the rooll councelor Nish yoka I councelor Phillips I councelor gwy I councelor Gonzalez he councelor Hoy I councelor nordik absent councelor Barney I councelor Stapleton I mayor Hoy I motion passes all right councelor Hoy 3.3a thank you I move staff uh recommendation only for the point of discussion if we may talk about this a little bit um hold on we need a second y I'll second thank you sir motion by uh Hoy second by Stapleton councelor to your motion thank you very much um I you know when I hear the word Grant the words grant money I've I think yay free money go for it and then I realize there's sometimes more to it than that so if if it's all right um I would like staff to just share a little bit about what they shared with me today and I was so grateful for a quick response um later in the day and I'm grateful for you guys being here this late and it's uh I just think it's important for folks to understand stand when they see even though it's in the weeds like literally right with the plants um when they see uh projects like this happening they don't wonder what the heck's the city doing now you know and how much does it cost um so if you wouldn't mind just speaking to this uh particular project and whether or not it's already in progress um and is this going to require uh us to hire people to do this work um I see that the city is going to match um it'll be provided by the city in the form of in kind contribution of Staff time and resources including and there's quite a list of things that it'll it will pay for I won't go into those but who's going to do that work is that new people or existing positions uh Robert Chandler assistant director of Public Works uh before I answer those questions uh I do want to introduce uh two people who are responsible for both uh sets of uh staff reports asking for your support to apply for $700,000 of grant funding uh that's Jennifer mongalo and Jeff Johnson uh two of the of many highly professional and capable staff in public works and they've been sitting here for 3 hours and 45 minutes waiting for you to introduce them you're good I owe them so uh the uh first uh report Up is on the uh Pinto Brown Island uh it's an Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board oeb Grant uh this is a grant asking for additional funding for five more years to work on a restoration with uh on Mento Brown Island Park uh and specifically in the Mento Island Conservation Area um it is asking for $550,000 in Grant funds from the Oregon Watershed enhan board oeb um Skyler when did they move in sorry I'm sorry councelor Gonzalez she came off of mute oh sorry about oh um and uh so $550,000 in oeb funds and $137,500 in matching funds over this fiveyear period in kind as councelor Hoy mentioned uh I'll start by noting that that funding is not being uh funded through the general fund that is funded directly and totally through the Utility Fund F uh and and the type of in kind work this is restoration work in uh a Conservation Area uh it does have a long list of the um work but you uh we will exceed that match easily during the five-year period uh there's a lot of work related to Grant Administration reporting monitoring permitting community outreach restoration planning environmental uh monitoring um compliance there's a lot of stuff going on with this um so that's that's where it is so in short it's a great project oh is ongoing this is continuing uh uh five years five years they're here for that five years of uh work and and the work is continuing we're uh fighting a a noble cause against invasive species uh We Can't Stop Now fact we lose all that ground thank you um will this require more of Staff or does staff already have time to give this ah fair enough so thank you for that question this is part of our work plan at has been is continuation of that work with our staff we will not be hiring additional staff to do this it does require additional work which is with the Contracting and this Consulting work uh to do this work on Metro Island great I appreciate that I appreciate the clarification and the um I don't know I guess just for lack of better term transparency for folks to see what we're doing and how it happens financially and so we can um just be real wide open about that I think it's a great idea especially in light of our financial difficulties and our um this the wear and tear on staff and how everybody spreads thin so thank you so much for being here to to sort of seal that up thank you thank you is there for councelor nishioka thank you mayor Hoy um I found I asked to to pull um this and one other item that you pulled already because I simply wanted to say good job and thank you so much for doing all of this work and I am so happy that we're able to um apply for another Grant so that you can continue the necessary work so thank you very much may I respond I'm just glad I'm not the only one who made you stay this late so thank you is there further discussion will the recorder please call the rooll councelor Phillips heck yes councelor Gwen hi councelor Gonzalez I councelor Hoy I councelor nordik absent councelor verney I councelor Stapleton I councelor nishioka heck yes mayor Hoy I motion passes councelor Stapleton I need a motion to extend the meeting because we have um we're certainly going to go past 10 just based on our signups for um testimony and we still have a few more agenda items so I need an extension please I move that the city council move to extend the meeting to 10:30 oh that sounds horrible reluctant second uh motion by stapledon second by Phillips just for everybody's knowledge we have a rule that says we have to end meetings by 10:00 and if we need to go past 10 o'clock we have to make a motion to extend that time so that's what we're doing here is there any discussion will the recorder please call the role councelor Gwen I councelor Gonzalez hi councelor Hoy I councelor nordik absent councelor Barney I counselor Stapleton I councelor nishioka it's a i councelor Phillips I may Hoy I motion unfortunately passes all right item 3.3 B councelor Hoy thank you um I move staff recommendation just for the point of of having discussion about this item um hold on we need a second second second thank you sir motion by second by Phillips counselor to your motion yes um I would just for the same reason as the last item I want to um just be clear about what is happening in Salem and why and how um to note though that when I uh saw this was about fish and I hadn't heard anything about about it I thought I'm calling counselor",

        "text": " a hydrogen electrolyzer is not a synthetic fuel plant you're not giving anything to anybody they still have to go get a local land use approval they still have to site that facility according to local land use requirements they would still have to have legal access to the volume of water that they need to produce the amount of um hydrogen that they're intending to produce so um and you know as as Michael indicated you know some areas of the state you know we have you know groundwater limited areas and and critical groundwater areas and you know water is becoming more and more scarce so this again that's something that a developer of a hydrogen electrolyzer would have to figure out as part of their process and then I don't remember the first part of the question but see more oriented towards you yes so I I was just going to address so the water that is that does go through the process and and does get converted to hydrogen and oxygen that the water would go away yes yes so you would lose water in that process uh a fair amount of that water is used for cooling and maintenance of that electrolyzer you can imagine flushing it out cleaning out things like that um and so within that process some of that water is um you know uh would be considered kind of Wastewater uh and so you know with that it should be tested and made sure before it goes into a Waterway so but that wouldn't necessarily be at jurisdiction but certainly an important piece to it somebody will mind the I would recommend that thank you if I could just make a a quick comment uh on the water consumption issue that was something that was mentioned in the legislative history but there was Al no discussion of it by the legislature the legislature was entirely focused on coal gasification plants that was all the testimony if you look at it talks about coal gasification and that's why we want to put it as as Todd mentioned in FC jurisdiction the other thing that I want to mention it's on this slide and Todd mentioned it earlier is you're not we're not discussing today whether or not Council has jurisdiction over the facility that produces the electricity that the electrolyzer would use use we're just talking about the electrolyzer itself so if if the electricity that an electrolyzer uses uh is produced by a facility that meets the thresholds for your jurisdiction you would have jurisdiction over that facility yeah thank you Patrick yeah and that's why I emphasized at the very beginning by themselves so a hydro hydrogen electrolyzer by themselves not necessarily you know taking that hydrogen and producing electricity or other elements or their components just the hydrogen electrolyzer um plant that's the only thing that's under that we're asking you to review today councelor Grill I for the record this is Marcy Grill I just in my simple mind I was like through first of all it feels very you know scientific techy stuff but is this in my head the same thing that happened with you're being very specific about by itself about the whole generator thing that PGE present it I mean like that's what I see in my mind is oh if I can get a little piece here then it turns into something more so I appreciate the emphasis on by itself yeah thank you council member gril and I think the important thing is this is not a question of should this be within council's jurisdiction this is looking at the language of the statute when it's create when it was created in 1981 is it within council's jurisdiction so this is not a policy conversation this is an interpretation of Statute um which you know people may have different thoughts and ideas whether these should be or shouldn't be within Council jurisdiction that's not really what's being asked it's being asked at the time that this was created this that that this was put in statute you know can we now say that there was an intention that this type of thing was thought through and and should be included in there you know because of again what their thought was at the time in 1981 now the legislature could come back at a future date and there could be a proliferation of hydrogen electrolyzers and you know we see all kinds of issues and concerns and the legislature may say no that's a significant thing we think that should be within FC jurisdiction that's a policy decision this is not what you're being asked today you're being asked to interpret language um that was established in 1981 that's now applying to something that really wasn't anticipated in 1981 um next slide please so with that um that kind of gets to the you know the staff's recommendation so you know we we've evaluated this and again not whether it should or shouldn't be is whether we believe it is based upon the language and our recommendation is Again by themselves we do not believe based on our research you know of the history the context and then comparing the relative Technologies we do not believe and we recommend that the hydrogen electrolyzer does not constitute a synthetic fuel plant as that is defined or as that is part of the definition of an energy facility um in statute so unless you have additional questions we can step away and allow for a public okay okay anyone in the room interested in making um any webinar or phone interest any commenting so nobody wow that's loud all right I do not see any hands raised at this time but let me go ahead and remind everybody online how you would make a comment if you wanted to do so um if you are participating on the webinar uh at the bottom of the main screen there's a set of icons click on the participant and at the bottom of that window is a hand icon click on that hand that will raise your hand and when you're finish commenting you can click it again to lower it if you are participating on the phone press star three on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and star three again when you're finished with your comments there are no hands raised at this time okay I think we can close the public comment and um next slide please back to so getting back to the you know what your options are option one is as I just articulated in our recommendation um option two would be uh the same as option one but with some additional thought or context or evaluation that Council wanted to include on the record um and then the third option was would be that you actually do believe that hydrogen Facility by itself does constitute um a synthetic fuel plant as that's defined or included in the definition of of energy facility and then you would need to provide you know your reasoning and justification for okay any discussion councelor Condon thank you um Cindy Condon um I just want to be clear this kind of comes from my background a little bit this Council would have no jurisdiction over a petroleum Refinery correct well I I don't want to say correct I would say I would have to go look at the rule or the statute to see if a petroleum Refinery would fall within you know the definition of an energy facility um so I'm not sure of that okay um the Practical kind of reality is you know there's no petroleum refineries in Oregon so all of our all of our petroleum comes in from out of state not your question but yeah well and the reason I asked the question is a petroleum Refinery creates the product that this is doing the same it doesn't produce electricity we don't know what the hydrogen is going to be used for or the oxygen and so in my mind I struggled with this actually um but in my mind it came down to that that we don't have jurisdiction or I don't believe we have jurisdiction over a petroleum or would have uh jurisdiction over a petroleum Refinery for the production of fossil fuels so um I view it similar to that you any other comments or questions do we have a councelor gr thank you for the record this is Marcy Grail Mr chair I move that the council determine a hydrogen electrolyzer by itself does not constitute an energy facility as described in ORS 4693 111 AF for the reasons present it recommended by staff do you have a second second thank you um councelor develin so we've got a motion in a second um secretary esterson could you please call the rooll Marcy gril yes Cindy Condon yes Kent how yes Katie IMS yes Perry chak toot yes Anne berer yes Richard develin yes motion carries Mr chair thank you that was very I think it's just interesting now that we're you know we're seeing different you know Technologies and the proliferation of different Technologies and you know the reality is you know the rules and statutes just haven't contemplated you know like battery energy storage systems you know we're the the world is catching up to some of these you know and it's not battery is not a new technology hydrogen it's not a new technology but the sort of significant increase in proliferation of them is and so we're going to be dealing with these things for a while very good okay let's see thank and we are at the end so uh any comments for the good of order oh wait yes uh we got to go back the letter from um the extension comment period extension request by m requesting um the extension and everybody's had a chance now to read her letter and do we need any discussion of that sharings great anybody have a question or comment after reading it yes um councelor buer excuse me apologies I'm not continu this um just just want to acknowledge the request and understand that um there's never enough time to comment but that the comment period that the department offered um according to our Council was 45 days as opposed to the minimum 21 so I um suggest that the department has offered a robust comment period and um would suggest that we continue with this process as staff has proposed okay that that's a motion uh it's a statement but it could be a motion yeah that's what I'm thinking I just had a question yeah is the mapping the mapping tool that the staff uses is available on the website and is um public to use is that correct secretary cornette no I know presenting this assistant director cor um for today um thank you uh council member IM and so we want to take an opportunity um you know most times we actually don't use use you know sort of a uh argis um mapping we use our own like the the same data that's available on the you know aressa tool we talked about the aressa tool it's a publicly available tool um you know online mapping tool and we include a",

        "text": " been um you know the nature of reasons for these applications has been a focus of the council in the recent i'm happy to answer any questions about the hearing officer's rationale at this point and as we get into the draft final of course i'm happy to to answer any questions or about the approach that i've suggested or talk about other approaches as well marcy this is hanley jesse um yes we have had conversations about what is adequate for um a goal three exceptions um and i think this application was submitted in uh um our discussions have been more recently than that um and so it's hard you know it's difficult for the applicant to have addressed our issues i do think that the requirement for reasons justifying why the state body state policy embodied and the applicable goals should not apply needed or could use additional in the exceptions process but i do believe that because of the low value of agricultural productivity for the site and the fact that it does not have irrigation water available goes a long way towards meeting that that is part of the justification that is given that's a long-winded way of saying i really think that the applicants need to do more in the future that's my position and haley this is marcy so kent had made some comments earlier and is this you all this is what you've done for your careers and you're saying it so i hope applicants are hearing you especially for those of us who do not come from that background and your words are kind of rigging through uh in a variety of ways so thank you both yeah i think the standard that this should be measured against when someone's trying to meet this one that this is a renewable resource um we want to encourage renewable resources but that's not really the standard here the standard is why are we taking this out of an agricultural designation in order to accommodate the renewable development there need to be reasons why you're doing that other than gee there's going to be economic benefit to the community the goal for the state of oregon is to protect agricultural lands for agricultural and so you know i i think the best justification here is the fact that this is not um agricultural land um except for very very limited livestock grazing activity and so i think that weighed the most for and i guess i would encourage applicants to emphasize concerns for protecting agricultural lands more than financial benefits because any development is going to provide some kind of additional financial development out there so it's it's the protection of agricultural lands is what we're trying accommodate here and this is the an exception to that that's all i have thank you are there questions from any other council members okay um so the straw poll on this one um i is going to be slightly different here for the time being um i will just ask whether or not there's any objection to the overall disposition of this issue which is that the applicant has met the requirements for a goal three exception i'm asking it this way again because of the slight difference between the hearing officer's approach uh to reasons and the staff's approach to reasons which i think will will save for the draft final order when we get there so again right now i'm asking if there are any objections to the outcome here okay hearing none we'll move on to issue issue five we're shifting gears here a little bit it is whether the proposed project that is identified in the application diminishes the value of the limited private party's private property and business interests violation of a county zoning ordinance and one of the goals of the comprehension plan um and uh and so in this case the hearing officer concluded that the limited parties had failed to establish at the proposed facility as conditioned would result in diminution of value to the private property or business expanding on that just a little bit here this is once again primarily uh an evidentiary question um policy at issue uh the lake county goal to policy 18 provides that private property investments will be protected from incompatible development which might likely diminish property value or unduly increased taxes so the hearing officer concluded that the allegations of diminishment were based on speculation he concluded that they're based on assumptions that construction and operation of the will bring about the limited party's worst fears as he put it with regard to fugitive dust impacts um invasive and noxious weed species um incursions from displaced wildlife negative impacts on personal life stock health loss of organic certifications and destruction of infield and harvested the although the issue here is somewhat different than the previous ones we've been talking about again the the hearing officer's focus was on limited party's presentation which uh um in his view took an unwarranted reliance on on kind of a worst case scenario um rather than um what was uh supported in the record um and and conditioned in the proposed order again as with the the other issues here i've taken a look at the hearing officer's reasoning and think it's supported by the facts in the law so i'll pause here and ask if there are any questions okay i'm hearing none then we'll move on to the straw poll on this issue and that is whether or not any council member has any objection to the hearing officer's determination um that uh the apple can implement the council's land use standard with respect to this issue uh because um the limited parties had not come forth uh with substantial evidence uh backing up their assertion that there would likely diminishment of property values pure grill this is perry yes i probably should claim right off the bat that i'm gonna have to abstain from any type of poll or vote because i have a conflict project proponent has entered into an off project mitigation agreement with the klamath tribes and as such i do have a conflict thank you for stating that and i'll defer to jesse and todd to address anything with that thank you chair grail so um you know based on that uh council member choctoot i would ask that um sit out the remainder of the discussions on this um issue and then um as it sounds like you're planning to do to not um take any informal or formal votes on the project thank you jesse i did not hear any objections so we're going to go ahead and move on to the next issue okay this is issue number six whether application failed to demonstrate that the design construction and operation of the proposed facility is not likely to result in significant adverse impacts to taking into account the applicant's proposed mitigation um in violation of uh the council's soil protection standard oar 345 division 22 rule 22. um the hearing officer's conclusion was that the proposed facility um as conditioned um in the proposed order complies with the soil protection there are um a couple of plans are in draft form um in the proposed order uh that are intended to address um soil protection um the limited parties here specifically asserted that uh of these plans provide any assurance that substantial crippling wind erosion will not be generated by activities on the proposed facility site and that the plans would not create a remedy if that kind of erosion the hearing officer concluded that protestants argument is grounded in assumptions that the applicant will not fulfill its obligations under the site and particularly here this is one of these cases where the siting council is standing in the shoes of another agency in part at least in that case that's the department of inqui environmental quality which would be issuing a permit under the clean water act a 1200 c permit um and so the the um you know hearing officer concluded that um not only the applicants or the sorry the protestants assertions were basically that not only would the citing council and department of energy staff not ask act to enforce the conditions um but that deq would not either you know as uh council member condon asked earlier and i described there are enforcement mechanisms that uh both the council have and deq has are procedures that those agencies can follow if a member of the public asserts that um one or more of the conditions have been violated here beyond that though um in this case um the department itself had recommended um a modification of uh condition um to respond to the limited parties concerns um department's conditions require that the applicant obtain approval um of its finalized escp from deq and the department before beginning construction on the proposed site in response to the parties limited parties then renewing their concerns at hearing the department proposed a further change to that condition um requiring the applicant to demonstrate that all revegetation protocols identified in the erosion soil control plan that's the escp sorry for the acronym earlier are consistent with the requirements and success criteria of the plans and that the protocols address dust abatement erosion sediment control and noxious and invasive weeds as determined by the department deq and odfw there was a modification to the condition there as a result of the the hearing officer concluded that provided additional support for uh his conclusion that the the soil protection standard had been met um so when we get to um so in terms of process here the hearing officer acknowledged that the department had requested a modification of a condition as compared to what it had presented in the proposed order the hearing officer chose to incorporate that change to the condition and so when we get to the draft final order stage reviewing that draft final order um i will point out how um the draft final order incorporates that amended condition and there will be an opportunity for the parties uh to to comment on that changed condition so um i will stop here now though and ask if there are any questions either with the hearing officer's which can i believe to be supported by facts and law or whether there are any questions about this process for acknowledging the handful of changed that the hearing officer wanted to with no questions then we'll move on to the straw poll on this one um and uh see if there are any objections by any council members as to the hearing officer's determination that the applicant has satisfied the soil protection standard um based on the the plans and conditions that had been incorporated in the proposed order and with the one additional condition change that the hearing officer had recognized in the proposed contested case order okay without any objections then we'll move on to issue 7. and just as a reminder there are nine total issues here so we're two thirds of the way through and we'll just keep rolling along so issue seven is whether the application proposes development that exceeds the existing capacity of public and private utilities or facilities including county roads to provide water needed for the construction of the facility",

watch it if they want to see the discussion back and forth and and some of the safeguards and rails and different things that are in place based on new laws the work happen yeah that's a really good point I mean we've had many many work sessions on this subject and and just as a reminder for people that are watching this whole process we're really talking about long-term planning here this isn't a case where we're going to see development happening as soon as we turn the turn the light switch you know as a reminder for folks the Brookman expansion area was done what year was that 20 I it was it was long time yeah and you know two3 somewhere in there so there's so this is really about long term and you know what our City's going to look like in 10 15 20 years you're not suggesting we're going to pull the tiger approach no no so and and beyond that there's a ton of work to do you know even if we do want to see development out there in terms of infrastructure sewer water Storm Master planning which we talked about quite a bit in this last meeting which really allows us to control what Happ so um any other questions before I open it up for uh public I comments but I'll just save until after okay awesome sounds great and as uh Sylvia mentioned we had some written testimony that's already in the record that we all received copies of um thank you and so we'll go ahead and open up for uh public testimony at this point and mayor and Council the gentleman that is online is deaf um he's been here at Council before so he kind of communicated that to us so I'm too sure if Brad was able to connect with him but he asked for a text message when we were ready to accept his comment so he might be able to go before this one before this one before after I need to confirm with bread okay let's go ahead and try to get that done first then I'm sorry Brian is on he's he's on he's on okay um Brian beler Brian beler uh Brian uh welcome to the meeting tonight go ahead and uh we'll start the clock you have four minutes go ahead and start and Brian if you or can we have Brad text him and he's the people should fight back against the expansion of the urban growth family the site actually listed talking points that people should use that were provided by a very well-known land use Advocate who brags about objecting to every single land use proposal unfortunately I chose to resp Bond and stated immediately after that that the first thing that the governor did when she was elected was she declared a housing emergency she said we are building 80% fewer homes that we needed and we're 140,000 units short in the state of Oregon we have a dire affordability crisis and that is contributing to Oregon's homeless crisis unfortun forun someone recognized my name and they tried to insult me you're a realtor he said so let me declare right now that I am a realtor in fact I've been a realtor for 32 years and I think I've re uh represented more homeowners in in Washington County than any other realtor I have to tell you I'm very proud of my profession I help people people buy homes homes that they can have shelter in homes where families can Thrive where memories are made and where wealth can be creative so today we have a social mentality of anti-growth people have their own homes their own yards but they don't want other people to experience the American dream but people need houses and we have a housing crisis this is not about the people having trouble this is not about the people who own houses today it's about the people who are having trouble affording houses it's about the Next Generation that unless we let land into the urban growth bound they are not going to be able to build houses so who is going to fight for them well I'm going to and we need you to also in addition to being a real I'm a land owner and I've seen my share of growth plans I have to tell you I think shwood West is brilliantly done the massive amount of time to develop the plant has resulted in something very special I especially like the hospitality area I happen to own land that backs to that and one day I hope that you will let me work with you to modify the plans plans are meant to be changed I would love to build housing on our property for all affordability levels centered around pickle ball a pickleball Community that's next to the hospitality area so that we can generate tourism so that we can generate Healthy Lifestyles of social connectivity Portland area needs this land brought in it is up to you to help think of future generations and make sure that home ownership can be a reality for our grandkids thank you so much and I urge you to put forth the entire Sherwood West plan thank you all right thank you very much Brian for your testimony and and your timing was spot on very good um we have any anybody else online is that the only one okay um so next we have an inperson um Al come on up and I think your mic is already on if you just state your name and your address okay we'll get the timer going for you thank you mayor and Council for allowing me to test for my testimony uh my name is Al Jack uh I'm the land acquisition and development guy for Venture proper properties and uh we have an Associated Home Building Company Stonebridge Homes Northwest and uh gosh I feel like I'm I've been working in Sherwood West for so long I think I'm on the uh last home stretch of a marathon um but I certainly would be remiss if I didn't go on record at this point uh in support of what you're doing um did I give you my address yet I don't think I did okay 4230 gailwood Street sweet 100 Lake asigo Oregon 97035 uh our company's Sherwood resume it consists at least in the last 10 years of one project mandal farms and this is at the southeast corner of Edan Elward if you're not familiar um it was built uh we started that in 2015 and built that out I think probably through 2020 uh the homes range from 2200 square feet to probably a little over 3,000 sold in a move up price range uh and cons it consisted of in addition to the home lots uh protected Wetland a pedestrian bridge and a small neighborhood park and uh we're very proud of that project we feel it's very representative of the kind of quality work that we do and I certainly hope that all of you feel that it was an asset to the um we there's a general recognition right now and you just heard it from Brian as well that there's a certainly a housing shortage and this is what's brought us the um Statewide Senate Bill 1537 and it's also why the Earth the Sherwood West expansion is so important right now we really need land we really need additional housing uh as you were just heard 140,000 uh unit shortage this this coming from the state Economist and uh I think it's just very very important that we proceed with this Sherwood West expansion as I mentioned we've been working on this for about 10 years uh during that period um we have also been actively searching for additional development land within the city of Sherwood and sadly we have not found any and this is not through lack of effort and and of course housing projects have been done in the meantime but uh just the kind of effort we put into it every year we look at every single parcel within the city limits uh that's two acres or greater and then we go through a vetting process a screening process um things like well is there an expensive home on it that's not a good development p uh does it have a lot of resources on it Wetlands that sort of thing but anyway we go through this screening process and figure out just exactly how many properties there are and we make an effort to go after them uh the last time we did that was about six months ago and we only came up with six properties in the entire um city limits that actually were suitable for development of a subdivision so uh that's that's really not much and that's why it's so important again to um to proceed with the Sherwood West expansion so I think that's really all I wanted to do get on record for that uh we really think that uh the the length of time this has taken has been well worth it uh very excited about the concept plan and we really really look forward to being a part of it so thank you great thank you Al all right so is there anyone else that wants to give public testimony not seeing any with that I'll go ahead and close uh the public hearing and we will go is there at this point if do we have any additional questions for staff or comments from councel yeah we just G to make some com ments as a couple have already said that we've been looking at the talking about this for well for years honestly um but I think this is since I've been on Council maybe my third round that that we could have gone for a asked to Metro for this but we slowed the process down and we're very thoughtful about waiting until we had put some pieces into place like finishing the comprehensive plan updating the content plan um hb21 and for that rle making and getting all of our guidelines put in place for that updating our design standards and just all these things that we said that we wanted to accomplish and have in place prior to asking and while we've talked a lot about that Senate um and the potential risks that it brings to our concept planned over in Sherwood West um I think we have some good Tools in place that could potentially help us get the vision that we want over there by being good partners with the land owners the developers and and um that and that sort of thing so I think at this point I'm in favor of of forgiveness thank you um okay I'll go um no echoing everything Kim said you know I think I've been working on this either on Planning Commission before I join Council or or on councel so for my entire it feels like my",

more Amy schlesser with Odo uh policy analysts interested in intersection between Community energy resilience grid modernization and clean energy transitions thank you all yeah all right then I think at this time we'll pass it over to Emily who's joining us virtually today to provide a quick refresher on iija in 401d funding good morning everybody before I jump in can everybody online and in the room hear me and her okay she had a new herself okay it's it sounds like folks online I think we are having we are having trouble hearing you in on the in-person session I don't know if anyone

for the American people by investing in American manufacturing and workers expanding access to Energy Efficiency and clean energy for families communities and businesses delivering reliable clean and affordable power to more Americans and building the Technologies of tomorrow through clean energy demonstrations and the purpose of the fund specifically for the 40101d formula grant is going to be outlined by the department of energy to improve the all hazards resilience of the electrical grid against disruptive events generate the greatest Community benefits and reducing the likelihood and consequences of those disruptive events Advance the department of Energy's Equity environmental and energy Justice priorities including the justice 40 initiative which we'll talk a little bit more about a little bit further down the road here and invest in America's Workforce all right and the application was due um they've pushed the timeline a couple of times it was due to the Department of energy on May 31st 2023 for the first two allocations of funds under the federal program we have already submitted our application that was submitted on April 18th and you can see our um the link to our our application is on our website if you're interested in reading more about that under the program States tribes and territories apply directly to the federal government once awarded these Grant recipients can then run processes to issue sub Awards to entities eligible as sub-recipients such as electric grid operators electricity storage operators electricity generators transmission owners or operators distribution providers and fuel suppliers Odo is the state agency that will apply for receive and administer these funds and it is odo's intent to focus on electrical thank you and although this legislation contemplates allocations over five years the US Department of energy intends to issue the first and second allocations of funding at the same time accounting for the extended application deadline that they gave us so the first two allocations for the state are listed on the slide there both a little less than 10 million dollars and as I mentioned we'll get both of those allocations at once in this first funding round and we're required to pass 95 percent of these funds through to our sub-grantees program does have two match requirements first the state or tribes are required to provide a match of 15 percent and then secondly our sub-grantees will be required to provide a match as well which would be at a rate of either one hundred percent or one-third depending on their electricity sales in the previous year so that's just a little refresher and now I will pass it back to the room for Rob gilmar to take it from here thank you Emily so photo began work on this program last summer and developed the draft program narrative focused solely on Wildfire mitigation which was presented at a public hearing last and we've done a lot of listening since then including a request for information that we shared with utilities in December and another public Hearing in March and the result was a final program narrative submitted in April that was significantly different from our original draft in August primary changes to the narrative include expanding eligible measures to address all natural hazards and not just increasing the funding allocation to small consumer owned utilities removing the maximum award cap for small utilities and proposing some flexibility in how communities to find defined disadvantaged populations and this is just a good time to note that the narrative that we submitted went into doe and they have an opportunity to come in to get back to us before the final program is approved by Doe so in a waiting order which we hope to get later in summer here's a budget summary showing the carve outs in terms of percentage of sales and also in dollars and so you see the approximately 20 million dollars that comes to us for the first two years of funding according to Federal requirements we would need to spend at least 25 percent of this with small utilities because that's the share of customers that they serve in Oregon however we propose upping this to 40 percent of the funds because of the unique channel is the small utilities base for the procuring federal funds and also with vastly distributed Distribution Systems that results in about seven and a half million dollars in this first round first of all utilities again we've removed the cap and we're hoping for somewhere around 10 projects in this first round and so if you do the math that's somewhere around you know 750 000 per award on average we could do more with less you know funding per utility or we could BPO with large rewards but wait and see what comes into the program um and so that leaves about 13 million dollars for the investor of Utilities in their pot of money so absolutely they narrative also included in a program objectives including mitigating risks associated with natural positives delivering benefits to disadvantaged communities maximizing Community benefits associated with these projects and finally operating under a continual Improvement model to ensure that the program continues to fund the best projects in future years so that gives us flexibility to workout program design as we go this is a list of eligible activities in the group science grant program it includes a lot of the sort of bread and butter reliability projects the utilities have to do just to keep the lights on you know utility poles undergrounding monitoring and control Technologies um you'll see about two-thirds of the way down there's an asterisk next to some distributed energy resources including microgrids and batteries that is included in the list it's included in the federal eligible projects but I put an asterisk next to it because these are not the types of projects that we really want to focus on we have other funds for supporting microgrids and batteries and so we really want to focus more on those you know vegetation management to Natural Hazard mitigation projects and finally at the bottom of the list are what's not included in this program that includes new generations such as solar and also cyber security and again those have different funding screens associated with them so not in this so I know we have a couple of questions here just to kind of um you know in terms of what you're most interested in on these eligible measures I think what might be helpful is if you go back to that slide and just get any thoughts and reactions or answer any questions that you have and similarly in the chat if you want to comment on these or have any questions that you want to ask feel free to put it in the chat we'll watch where I will try to bring it up in conversation as well yeah I do have a common Channel um that it's around microgrids and other you say you know say that those are and I certainly want to say is that those are in the Federal uh grants that we go after which is true um those grants are highly competitive The Residency grants uh national competition as you know there were seven to ten Across the Nation so you know one of the strategies that we took you know when we looked at what's eligible for funding under these the resiliency grants and things that we're talking about undergrounding of uh electrical lines and some of these other things are very expensive we put those into a large National Grant award because it we just can't do much for the states on so we're going to get you know exposure to limited dollars if you have 10 million a year um well I think we can do microgrids for emergency resilience centers and and critical equipment and stuff like that with with the funds um so that that's the strategy we're taking that you know what can we do with the state funds and make an impact versus what could we do with the federal funds that make an impact so um you know that's probably what we're going to submit uh for this event that some of our like I said the larger prior qualifier protection things",

        "text": " yeah Castor buer so I think based on our discussion we probably want to spend time at the next meeting um looking at the goal three exception and any recommendations staff has as to making those particular findings um just because we we want to get that right um I think it would also I speaking for myself be helpful to look at how the soil stabilization and we control plans align because I don't know if those sometimes go at Cross purposes but um just just to make sure we're setting clear expectations there I mean I am not a soil scientist or a weed person but um it just seems like we could be working uh across purposes and um um but really spending some time on the goal three bet thank you chair how there's no gold five resources other than I think maybe there might be Washington ground squirrel or Lawrence vetch that that kind of stuff but that can be we can deal with that conditions just an observation as as we go back to the goal three exceptions I think lining out those findings that oh we don't have G five resources at this site we only have a predominance of category 6 habitat habitat where where we make that finding about other resources it's all in the document but lining it out in support of that goal three exception would be helpful chair um we def we'll focus on those elements at the next council meeting um I would also just let council members know if there's anything else outside of this meeting you know contact you know either me or chase or Sarah directly because if there's something else that you're interested in us providing either following you know up on something that was provided today or something that wasn't talked about today uh please let us know so we can prepare that as well we'd be happy to do that thank you and it is important I mean it's a cumulative effect that uh is the justification you know it's not any given standard it's going to be the cumulative effect as it pertains at least to the goal three exception any other comments thank you yeah thank you Mr Walker thank you so let me yes Council by this is for um the staff in general the tables of public comments with the applicant's response and the Department's response very very helpful and those are just it just gives us a whole whole big picture so kudos to the department staff for presenting the information so clearly Mr chair yes so yeah thank you for the the response on that we're you know we're always trying to figure out what's the best way to provide information is it too much is it too little is it too right what the format is so anytime you either like something or don't like something or have any thoughts or ideas on how to change it please let us know ultim Ely it's your decision when we bring this information to you we want it to be in the best possible way so I appreciate the yeah okay uh next item do does anybody need a break yet or okay I think we're going to take a 10- minute break um so if it's uh does 10 minute sound okay okay so um let's come back at uh 22 after 10 it's uh 1024 and we're starting back up again uh the next item is a briefing on House 3630 which directed the state energy or does direct the state energy strategy and we've got uh like to welcome Edith Bayer energy policy team lead and Michael fr's the senior policy analyst and they're going to do an overview of the current status of the Oregon energy strategy welcome well thank you chair chair how so good morning uh we are going to talk about the energy strategy uh that Odo has been directed by the legislature to engage in and and Odo is going to be leading this work but it's going to be a combined effort with other state agencies as well as we're going to have working groups and and a lot of other engagement listening sessions with the public so hopefully we engage a lot of communities to contribute to the energy strategy which we're really excited about um and so it's going to be related to the fset work quite a bit because we're going to have a lot of land use conversations and conversations around natural uh resources and make some of those decisions um or I guess the the strategy itself won't make those decisions but outline some of the future decisions that the uh the state's going to have to make around energy policy and hopefully we can provide some recommendations to legislature and the governor's office in that process so we're just at the beginning of development of energy strategy this is a great opportunity to provide feedback and start getting in engaged so hopefully we're obviously Enthusiast about the energy strategies hopefully we can get you excited about it if we're successful maybe you'll have us come back uh we can talk to you about what we've found and some of our energy modeling and some of the recommendations we have so we go to the next slide our agenda so we're gonna we're going to talk about organs energy landscape to kind of give a broad overview of what we're seeing and what's happening today and we'll talk about the energy strategy and why we're doing it and the technical analysis that will inform the strategy engagement opportunities and hopefully we'll leave some time at the end to have some discussion uh but please don't don't mind stopping us along the way because we've got a lot of interesting information in the slides and if you have immediate question I don't want you to forget it so let's dive in as we we go along and and uh we'll work with the time we have okay can we go to the next please so this is a sanki diagram and this is trying to show how energy flows through the state how it's produced and imported into the state and how it's used at the use consumption so it's showing the energy flow and so all of the different energy uses we use been converted to BTUs or British thermal units so we can kind of compare uh and contrast the different energies that Oregon uses and basically tell Oregon's story at a really high macro level so I would highlight the energy produced within the state if you're looking over the left what's imported and certainly uh the small amount up in the upper right that's exported as well as if you look to the right the residential consumption industrial consumption consumption so we have some robust goals within the state to decarbonize and so a lot of the decisions we're going to have to make going forward are going to need we're going to to make some decisions around how we want to use some of these resources generate electricity or generate fuels for transportation or some of these inuse consumptions and uh a lot of those are going to be some challenging decisions and some big big shifts for us so we are we do produce a lot of energy within the state but there's still a lot that we import into the state so I do want to pause because a lot of people have questions about this sanki chart so I want to see if you have any at this time Mr chairman I have one question Devin in terms of some of the resources um I'll give you a particular reference to the resource of hydr power um is this a snapshot in it is a snapshot in time just for 2020 right in the sense that um Hydro power is very beneficial to the region um obviously there are impacts uh but it's one of the things makes it possible for us to move away from fossil fuels but at the same time hydr power uh varies from year to year and can vary quite a bit in terms of the availability yeah so it it certainly can uh vary quite a bit so it it does it is representative of this year um but even in that that variance I would say the proportions here are going to be comparable even if it uh year to year you see that change in Hydro the proportion of kind of hydro to Natural Gas to petroleum uh you if I showed you a chart over the last five years this would look it would look very similar because this is at such a high macro level but you're right we we are very dependent on that hydroelectric system and it does it has made for uh relatively inexpensive energy for for Oregon in the past does that answer your question oh yes it does this is K I have yeah the nuclear that's up there that's just because we're on the grid is that right yeah because none's being produced here you yeah so this is uh so the energy Flows In so that's from Washington and so that goes through BPA and and a lot of the uh Community owned utilities that get power from BPA some of it comes from nuclear yeah okay yeah chair how yeah yes um so could you explain a little bit more about the biomass category yes so tells yeah so biomass uh so if we're looking at very little biomass goes into generating electricity but you can see quite a bit goes into industrial or residential consumption and so yeah so people heating their homes using biomass using using wood to heat their homes or some industrial processes that use biomass is whether they're recycling some use product or uh well I mean there's quite a bit that goes into industrial consumption and then if you look see the biomass that goes into Transportation so that would be something if you're making biomass making e all or making some kind of biofuel or something like that yeah so hopefully we're capturing all those kind of um and fuels okay thank you all right well so we'll go to the next next slide please all right so even a simpler level what are the major energy sources that are that we're consuming within Oregon so you can see at another level uh how much it comes from petroleum fuels natural gas and hydroelectric power and at those end resources uh based on the the different sectors we've got how much is used by Transportation the residential sector the industrial sector and the commercial sector you can see transportation is is the largest amount next slide please so this is the what the resources we use to generate electricity just focused on just electricity and so this is what's generated within our state which generate outside of our state that's imported in and so you can see Hydro power as we we've noted is a huge resource in the largest one but we still use a lot of natural gas and coal to generate the electricity that we consume so we have uh long-term goals around from house bill 2021 around decarbonizing our electricity sector and so we go to the next slide so that's going to require changing how we use uh some how we generate some of our electricity and that could",

        "text": " are the first to include assessments of the new resources PG impact need to meet Oregon's 100% clean energy goals so that legislation House Bill 2021 passed in 2021 and so these irps that were submitted around this time last year um in 2023 um were the first go around and the first pass at incorporating um the 100% clean energy targets so these are important irps um the puc is closing up their their review processes on them they haven't issued their final orders but those are forthcoming um and the whole reason I'm flagging these is because um there were discussions that kind of either talked about offshore wind on the on the outskirts or we're directly talking about offshore wind um so for people who are interest in this topic I wanted to flag this um as an opportunity you know to learn more about what the utilities are planning for in terms of offshore wind um in those discussions just high level they were you know the discussions with the Pu and our utilities were around all these challenges to meeting 100% clean energy that we're talking about here at this meeting you know whether it's sighting and permitting or um other technologies that haven't emerged yet fully that aren't totally commercially available like floating offshore wind or geothermal or hydrogen you know all these other technologies that we're still um working on to try to give us all these options to meet our goals um so effectively long lead time resources was the focus of a lot of these discussions so like transmission and offshore wind or um maybe nuclear plants or geothermal like I said a host of Technologies kind of fit in that long lead term bucket um and then I think my last slide is about that question we had with Transmissions so maybe this helps a little bit um so there's two two activities I would say two primary activities in the realm of transmission and this is not focused on anything that California is doing so California is actively engaged you know in transmission planning efforts on their own I should have said earlier on that the stuff I'm covering here are mostly just Oregon specific kind of forums and things that are looking at offshore wind at a large Regional level that Oregon is engaged in of course there's things happening in Washington and things happening in California also related to Offshore wind that I'm not covering today so um the transmission example is a good one not going to talk about anything that kaiso is doing but these two examples are broader than kaiso um one is this Western Transmission expansion Coalition um the acronym for that is westch Tech um and so westtech is um looking at a westwide long-term transmission planning effort um where offshore wind is likely to be discussed and accounted for um westtech is a broad and diverse Coalition of many if not all the sign significant power sector entities across the West um and this effort was spearheaded by the Western power pool um it launched at the end of 2023 so it's um kind of almost where our road mapping effort is and our state energy strategy effort are like in the very early days not fully launched yet um I think they're still trying to hire um some Consultants to help inform their process with this westtech effort so it's um you know a good stage good time for people to you know tune into that if they're interested in tracking that effort um and then the US Department of energy is also leading a West Coast offshore wind transmission planning um set of planning activities one is a study and one is a convening series um so the study launched in early 2023 um that's a 20-month study to assess potential transmission options to support a potential long-term buildout of uh projects floating offshore wind projects along the west coast so not necessarily just off Oregon's Coast but off the coast of California potentially off the coast of Washington um what would that buildout potentially look like um in then how do you get the transmission necessary to connect that to the grid um and so the other one is a convening series that's intended to kind of align with the transmission study and that um just kicked off in January of 2024 um it's supposed to go for about a year um and the point of that is to engage with a broad diversity of parties interested in offshore wind um to discuss the aspects of transmission planning which are most meaningful and applicable to them um so you can kind of Imagine that's a big tense as well invited parties for that convening series include tribal entities federal and state agencies um transmission organizations key interested parties such as cable and transmission providers Fisheries um non non-governmental organizations developers offshore wind developers utilities um and basically pretty much any other ocean co- user interested party can come to that um so these are activities that the department of energy and other state agencies are are least aware of and are tracking um I think Department of energy is equally engaged in both these other state agencies might be um a little bit more engaged in the US doe effort than the westtech effort but a couple examples of um processes that are going on in the world of offshore wind um so that's kind of all I just prepared just to get through but um don't have anything specific ready to go for questions but I can do my best to help offer up other information that might be helpful thank you Jason Senator dembro do you want to do a any followup no I think that that was uh very helpful uh Jason thank you yeah happy to help happy to be here any other questions for Jason or new questions for I'm not seeing any hands up um I do think uh it would be timely for us to plan to have uh transmission and Regional markets on our agenda in in the future uh sometime in the coming year uh we talked about uh Transmission in Regional markets maybe in 2020 so it's been a while since we've had that conversation and I imagine that there's been significant discussions in the interim that might be helpful for us to understand and just understand all how all of these things tie together uh in terms of ensuring that our our energy Supply is reliable and we're making the best use of the resources that we have um to get the smallest footprint we can have of the buildout that we will need so so see that's one of the things I'd like to at least consider in the future Senator demro yeah actually I did think of a followup thanks K okay great and this is uh probably for Jeff um you know one of the things people have been talking about um regarding the attractiveness of offshore wind and the South Coast uh would be if it could be coupled with creation of uh renewable um if it could be used to establish that and I wonder if that um that issue is going to be taken up at at all in the road map and that I suppose would also um require a lot of czma kind of analysis about what the impact of that would be no any I'm very attracted to that notion but I realize it's that there could be challenges yeah uh thank you for the question um that's an interesting one you know there's no reason it could not be uh built into the roadmap conversations considering that it could be a product of offshore wind if you are generating new fuels I think that what I understand of it is that it would require shoreside facilities most likely although maybe not exclusively uh I I did randomly talk to a guy at one of the offshore wind conferences the year two ago who said that he was interested in developing that on our coast and I said we'll watch out for tsunami inundation zones he said what let me give you some information uh so anything that does involve development in the coastal zone would trigger a federal consistency review if it involves any kind of federal license permit or other authorization so similarly to Offshore wind would need to be found consistent with the state's enforceable policies great any other okay see any um we are due to take a break um we're a little bit behind so I'm going to suggest we take a shorter break and come back at 3 o'clock uh but that does give us 12 minutes so not too too much shorter break and then we'll move move into the legislative session update uh and kind of hear how things went in Salem what the results were um during the short session before we move into public comments and wrap the meeting so thanks to everyone and let's go ahead and take a break and try and reconvene just a little bit before or at 3 o'cl thank you Abby can you go to the next slide oh next slide thank you we have good scenery for our break at least for long enough so that we can tell that you're back uh then we can you can turn them back off if you'd like just a bit more time if you're just getting back if you can turn your videos on so that I know that you're we're waiting for a few okay well let's go ahead and get started um and uh just a quick reminder before we move to our next agenda item uh if you are interested in providing public testimony please do um reach out to Amy or Abby uh in the ways that we described at the top of the meeting and let us know um what you that you're interested in presenting and then um that'll help us kind of manage our time when we get there uh to that next agenda um so we heard a brief overview of the legislative session in January right near the beginning of the session uh but have invited uh christe split from the Oregon Department of energy to come and give us an overview of what happened uh relative to uh climate related bills during the session and then certainly would welcome opening up it up to others that might be able to add some information um and or perspectives on the session so with that I'll turn it over to you Christie great Kathy thank you so much chair McDonald I should say it I'm meeting huh nice to see you by the way um so if Abby can go ahead to slides that would be a great place for me to start thank you all right well I think I know many of you but for those who don't know me or forgot who I was since I was last last at the commission I'm chrisy split and I'm the government relations coordinator for the Oregon Department of energy and I always like to start any conversation about what's happening in the legislature with the big picture I think it can be really easy to get down in the weeds or focus on just the issues",

        "text": " construction related uh projects listed in our Capital Improvement plan you've heard some of that this evening the solicitation was released on December 7th and closed on January 24th there was one responsive proposal and because of this our procurement and contracts Department reviewed the process and determined that the lack of response was not due to anything that was actually within chariots control just the vendors decided for whatever reasons they even opted not to so we did proceed under the single bid there were six primary projects of varying complexity complexity and stages and those are the bus stop Improvement plan which we'll be renaming to the accessibility Improvement plan the South Salem Transit Center the deltweb facility and gate security improvements the Del Webb service room construction the compressed natural gas fueling replacement station a reconfiguration of the ch2 office fifth floor and future projects that'll be identified through our CIP process and future Grant and funding opportunities as we move forward so with this contract with Matt McDonnell we will have access to a dedicated project manager assistant project manager contract administrator and several engineering leads along with some clerical assistance along with gaining colleagues and contacts who will be subject matter experts in our building and construction fields which really is invaluable to us as an agency so partnering with a vendor that specializes in complicated navigation techniques is really imperative to the success of this project planning and implementation and project management must be done concurrently to ensure that we are making adequate progress and managing cost increase the longer projects that the more they potentially can cost our project manager for Matt McDonnell along with Associated staff will be providing some of the same some of the following Services Clockwork property negotiations and Process Management oversight and engineering and design phases the National Environmental Protection act or NEPA compliance all matters related to the Americans with this Disabilities Act prevailing wage monitoring documentation construction closeout and really a myriad of other tasks that they'll be helping us with excuse me I'm getting dry so a lot of our most of these projects are funded through uh quite the Menagerie of Grants with local funds covering the match these grants used for these projects are from federal sources ODOT funds Statewide Transportation Improvement fund discretionary and formula funds most of these projects are included in our adopted budget in the capital program section and these projects will be carried forward as you'll see coming up at the budget hearing very soon so staff recommends that the board authorize the general manager to execute a contract with McDonald LLC for project management service for a four for a four base year and three one-year contract extension for an amount not to exceed one million six hundred and eighty seven thousand dollars and with that I'll answer any questions you may have any questions director holmstrom yes thank you uh very much so first of all I'm happy to see that there's uh provision made for potential future projects here so we're giving ourselves a little bit of flexibility for some future things and I'll see a couple ideas in there I think that lines up with what president David supposed to talk about earlier too so that looks good to me um I just had a question about and I'm sure there's a very reasonable answer here to the South Salem Transit Center and some of the work that's listed here my understanding is that we already have pivot architecture under contract to do some of this work yes I imagine it's all figured out who's doing what and there's no conflict there right there's not so it's very clear everyone's role pivot has a very specific role with regard to design and architecture and uh so think of it this way so Matt McDonald serves as basically the employee representative so he will represent our interest chariot's interest in managing the project and making sure things are tasks are getting done milestones and deliverables so and we here at Jerry is me at this point we'll be making sure that that happens that's sort of how that relationship works thank you director Carney thank you president um I have a question about well some of these projects um are kind of one and done right South Salem Transit Center is a big one but it's just one um but something like bus stop Improvement is iterative and ongoing um and both require different levels of Engagement with the community and especially those that are going to be um directly and our neighbors things like that how does McDonald kind of integrate with that aspect of our capital projects sure so uh Ron why don't you come on up and let me talk a little bit about that Ron makes it much more seamless because we had some some of the packages already in process but as far as the community most of the time you know we get the the locations from the planners but when there's issues like parking removal things like that we'll send somebody to the neighborhood association to talk to people I think you know and you you met one of our project managers at one of them and kind of talk them through what what the needs are as far as planning the locations you know that gets handed handed to us but but we will be involved with the Chariots on on the needs for the site planning manager French do you have something to add oh okay director Kearney um and just kind of thinking through that engagement piece um how easy or difficult would it be for your team or your staff to handle a situation where somebody only spoke another language exclusively would we be able to engage with that group yes we have multiple people in our office that can handle different languages I have a assistant project manager that is very fluent in Spanish she was the one that handed out flyers you know construction notices that way if there was any questions you can answer that and I've done that too Within so if we do run into it then we know ahead of time we'll make sure that person out there but if we do run into it and that person outside doesn't have that skill we'll get somebody there super thank you director Duncan I feel like I asked this question a lot so I apologize for those of you who are tired of hearing it but um we have very specific populations that usually attend our neighborhood associations and there are quite a few populations that just really do not attend rather because and a lot of those have to do with age but also sometimes has to do with the type of jobs that they're holding people that have you know evening work schedules usually can attend do you guys have other methodologies that you're able to use in order to contact people aside from just those in-person groups and how do you use those to reach these different populations well personally I've I don't remember what neighborhood association was it's like Chemeketa I went out after six o'clock and did the Flyers and talked to the individual people about what the impacts were you know they want to know what they could tell on the construction is going to take and and why do we need to take a parking and we explain that to them so we do do it after hours to catch these people at do you have any digital Outreach uh we in the past project um chariots handled the digital part they would give us the Flyers door hangers those kind of things and then we provide those but we can do that if we need to yeah I just wanted to add on so uh irrespective of the fact that we have Matt McDonnell that does not absolve us from still communicating and attending uh neighborhood association meetings I think I'm going to one here in a couple of weeks so uh it really is a partnership so it's not solely the responsibility of uh of the vendor well that sounds great thank you thank you other questions I have a question for uh UW general manager Trimble so obviously we've worked with Mount McDonald in the past from all I've heard wonderful reviews I'm excited to prove this contract but it it appears to me that there could be some efficiencies by bringing additional project management in-house and on this list of projects here you know the the future projects line in my mind could be quite large and so could you maybe talk through some of the philosophy behind obviously we're committing to this for the duration but at the expiration of this contract at what point does it tip to where okay no it makes sense we now have the scale to and the the consistent flow of capital projects Capital there's another term that uh manager kid used capital I forget show Capital purchases purchases thank you uh yes uh where it makes sense to bring this in-house so one of the things and thank you president Davidson so one of the things that we're looking at is we are actively recruiting for a capital excuse me a um Chief project and a pre oh my goodness what is that Chief Planning and Development officer made up the title I forgot about it um so looking at competencies and skill sets that that individual would have to help offset uh some of these things and some of it really is Project Specific so you know the more things we do the better we are at sort of understanding how to do them um the you know the more things we build the more we understand so it's at some point there's some you know economies of scale and scope that that would sort of engage in those processes so you know what's great about having mat McDonald or agencies like McDonald as they have this sort of cafeteria of of other people that they can bring in where those were direct employees of the district it would be sort of quite costly and you know we're not primed we don't build Bridges and we don't build roads and infrastructure so we don't do that many uh you know maybe in the future as we look down the road and start planning some of these other things but that's how I would categorize it so we will get some of that with the new uh with the new Chief but um but I think there will always be a need to have a partnership uh with uh with at least Mount McDonnell for the next seven years should this be approved and but uh vendors uh of the like great thank you very much other questions okay see no questions who would like to make a motion director Duncan I move the board authorized the general manager to execute a contract with Mott McDonald LLC for project management services for a four-year base term and three one-year contract extensions for an amount not to exceed one million six hundred and eighty seven thousand second we have a motion in a second any seeing no discussion all those in favor please say aye aye aye any opposed I no opposition motion passage unanimously thank you very much next we'll uh hear about the battery electric",

        "text": "oh I guess I better read it all right good morning Commissioners welcome we're live and over to you chair morning everyone and welcome to the April 11th between Washington County Board of Commissioners work session we have a full complement of Commissioners today uh I just want to share that I will be standing on occasionally because my back has decided to spasm every now and then so this is my work session room form of standing desk so uh you'll see me switching quite frequently uh anyway we have a change to the agenda today item six and seven in our afternoon section will be coming back to us at a future date so uh perhaps we will end earlier than scheduled but we're trying to get that information out to our um as swiftly as possible because last evening commissioner Teresa and I had a special Community Forum uh with the CPO 7 geography and one of those items was part of the topic of conversation so uh that's that's what's up with that so without further Ado I want to turn it over to my colleagues for board communication who would like to go first I think Jerry does there you go commissioner Willie please pick us up second I have to read what Megan told me to write and say do it uh well let's see uh book of the Hillsboro city council last week and that's again I think I've got one more City to go to finish the loop of my six cities that I touch base with on a quarterly basis and just updated them on a variety of things including arpa and some of the thoughts that we're going through on how to spend that money um attended the fair board meeting we've got a fair coming up of course the end of July our 10-day Fair this year and the uh the fun part is that the 4-H organization has really started to come back to life and so we've got a number of new 4-hs that are going to be attending the fair this year I did miss chair our favorite thing the pigway in oh it's cheap this year you call them Hogs I call them pigs and Megan says they're so what does 4-H call it thanks suckers are a little squealy um uh they come in a variety of colors anyway so I missed that it was on I didn't find out about it until Wednesday and then I just playing forgot about it on Friday Saturday morning so I'll catch the next one with the goats AOC Transportation Community Development meeting was yesterday uh we talked about a number of bills that are going through whether or not to support them specifically the ones that I opposed was um uh yeah well on our behalf I think you'd probably agree uh they're trying to the state wants to exempt property taxes on adus and we're saying why don't you just give us that option rather than take that money away from us so uh still working on that Aaron can give you some more information on that if you'd like um and then uh rep Femmes Bill 2677 House Bill 2677 um talking about ODOT and a state of good repair um and I think that has lots and lots of issues I don't I mean again we can get more information from Aaron on this I don't think that's actually going to come up this year there's lots of stuff in there that are problematic and so um I think that's going to require a lot more attention and conversation um the motion did pass with an amendment and so we'll see where that goes out of our committee into yours so this week I am meeting with four schools officials on the Elm Street property um I'm going to force Grove again for the West Tuality Habitat for Humanity groundbreaking uh got a Grace impact meeting TV Highway steering committee volunteer appreciation I'm just I'm sure we'll all be there for that and then for stresslands going to Friday mornings that's pretty great you and I will be running a little late for the volunteer appreciation because we've got the TV get the TV Highway overlap you're right that's all I got who's next I I can go next to her and sorry to hear about your spasm um good morning um I wanted to start off but I just will reiterate the volunteer appreciation looking forward to that I enjoyed attending uh last year so looking forward to this year as well um and we will be late um and then I have a few meetings this just continuing for the public health modernization campaign around asking legislators to support more money um for the public health monetization and then and then telling the story of what that means for us if state were to get 150 million dollars what is Washington County you know what do we get what do we spend in I'm very grateful marrying your staff for putting those talking points together and really appreciate it good numbers um so we'll continue to have more legislators and stuff about and just too close to the loop on the Health and Human Services steering committee for AOC there were two bills uh I think uh Aaron McPherson's uh memo about the two bills that I was asking we ended up supporting it was a pretty straightforward one was the request of Providence Health one was the request of the governor um in our legislative our government Affairs team were very supportive and they sent that explanation so I ended up supporting that and it was a unanimous anyway so no questions and in that steering Community we met OHA has a new um baton I think it was uh his last name um great guy interim because the previous director resigned uh abruptly and um and yeah really really excited he has tons of experience about the the pandemic he was the boots on the ground uh and our staff know and it was really good to learn more and I think he uh I said congratulations to him and he was really excited about the work Washington County did around the uh covet and pandemic stuff and then lastly one thing that I wanted to highlight I thought I was going to spend my five minutes on this topic actually but I sent an email uh last night or yesterday um about we have the TV Highway brt staring committee meeting this Thursday and we come to a really a good comment like good point in this committee work where we're having the conversation and starting the conversation what scenarios eliminate from the conversation moving forward and I just wanted to see if any of you had a uh just a burning do not eliminate the scenario kind of a um because we will have to have uh speak for Washington County in terms of what we think it's worth I did send the comment for from the staff and I included in the email the staff that those comments came from so any thoughts I I didn't notice in your and I might not have read it closely enough just an overview of what the scenarios were yeah so that's why I was like okay well hopefully she'll highlight those in the meeting okay yeah I could do that yeah um thank you chair Harrington so there I shared the market documents but I didn't click through so in the email I said staff are recommending moving forward option one two a or 3A and yeah those that's those my problem it didn't what numbers don't have any meaning to me yeah and I was hoping you all will click on the presentations that I attached but I can quickly tell you what one is one is the whole corridor one is let's try to figure this this is how much it will take to fix the whole Corridor 2A is the Beaverton to four um and it's really no the Beaverton to Hillsborough sorry um one is be written to force growth the whole Corridor uh 2A is be written to um and then three a which is what seems attractive to our staff and a lot of people is uh Hillsborough divorcement or Forest Grove to Hillsborough however you're going to say it so would you say it it would be good if we some idea of wait a second this really would have been a good um short work session topic of just presenting the three scenarios a table of what's driving the the selection of narrowing the scenarios what are the key that are driving the need to do that and as such how to move forward so I mean on one hand it could be a matter of for the near term time frame uh there's only the following Federal programs available for the next five to seven years and therefore given that scenario we need to narrow this down um and part of this is because I have history with Corridor planning for this very same extent as a Metro Hustler and so we just have to be very clear with ourselves and ourselves with regard to our decision making and the public as to why we're in the situation of needing to make it so I'm I'm not at all surprised that there may be a need for this I just want to make sure it's as simple a summary as we can and then help help guide you as your our rep going through that experience yeah chair I I wonder now that we have some space um on our agenda today I wonder I can ask I can text to Brenda and see if there's Aaron Aaron and diami and Steven did a really great job of just explaining this to us and they can do it but if they're available yes thank you um all right so in teams uh conversation this is the benefit of Technology as well with Steven Roberts um the team can be ready this afternoon once we do have some time in our agenda so I just want to give a shout out to our team for their flexibility and listen again good good luck sure terrific Kevin can you update the agenda for us that's awesome great I actually comments on yes real quickly and get your microphone closer this is how we help one another thank you yeah that was just kind of order upside of the table down here with the um my two comments and these one needs to be answered but but I like like projects I understand segment funding that makes sense so your scenario one makes sense to me um I don't know and you don't need to answer this at this point but the the funding where that's coming from I saw that you know trimets and others are doing some value engineering and you can peel some things off but frankly if it's a big ask on the county unless you all know about some money I don't know about I don't see where that's coming so it's going to have to be State Federal Regional money I just don't see as confusing a big lot of money and it seems to imply that they're going to ask us for that and",

        "text": " single-family homes will sometimes will struggle as well but our manufactured homes are really where our working people our people of color our elders were largely living and so the availability of this incentive could really be critical for their ability to purchase the best unit or should they decide to do to return to the community in some other way to purchase a different kind of unit thank you representative marsh uh christy would you kind of talk through the legislation of what's brought us here today sure thank you so much uh representative marsh i also just want to say thanks also to commissioner daughter for joining us and for senator jeff golden for joining us as well and i'm sure all three of them were involved in passing legislation during the 2021 legislative session to help aid recovery and rebuilding for their from those conversations to crucial bills passed one of them house bill 2289 was a bill designed to streamline the rebuilding process and so that bill and the conversations around it gave rise to the incentive program we're here to discuss today house bill 2289 had a provision that allowed people to rebuild their homes to an older building code and oregon's building code over time has become more and more energy efficient and so by sort of turning back the clock on what code people could build to it could lead to less efficient homes and so there was this idea hatch that there would be a companion incentive program to encourage people to build more efficiently than they would if they were building to that older code and so house bill 5006 it's called the christmas tree bill that passes at the end of each legislative session includes a lot of different funding priorities and in 2021 that that bill was full of different um pots of money to help people rebuild and otherwise recover and prevent wildfire and so like i said senator golden representative marsh commissioner daughter local elected officials all over the state that were in impacted areas work together to to make all of this happen and so i just want to thank them for their their help for their constituents and also just um for having the consideration about having a pathway to ensure more efficient rebuilding despite what was in hospital 2289 and from there i'll turn it back over over to you michael thanks thank you christy thank you michael i'll talk a little bit about the program and really our focus here is on wildfire recovery meeting code driving economic recovery and incentivizing energy efficiency looking at our program budgets they really should follow the percentage of the structures that were destroyed it's worth noting that around 94 of those structures were single-family and in manufactured homes with commercial and multi-family structures comprising about six percent we recognize fully that the building types have various varying needs excuse we know that single-family and manufactured homes require considerations that are different from each other and different from those of the commercial and multi-family sector in delivering this program we want to a simple and streamlined delivery that utilizes existing systems that meets the needs of the survivors and the stakeholders in local jurisdictions our goal is to create and maintain alignment with other state agencies including department of business and consumer affairs we're really going to focus on equity and it's going to be a major driver in our program design and implementation and as we're doing today we're going to utilize the public process as much as we next slide please so the oregon department of energy staff have done a lot of research on the number of structures destroyed and rebuilding rates and at its core this this is a program that's to support the nearly 4 500 structures that are being rebuilt with a focus on building energy efficient communities and offering long-term affordability and as michael said the the number of exceeds 5000 but we're really focusing on the residential and commercial buildings and not necessarily on out buildings transmission towers bridges and the variety of other structures that were lost in these fires the program is currently funded through june 30th of 2023 the end of the and to date about 25 percent of these structures have been rebuilt or in the process of local jurisdiction permitting we've examined comparable rebuilding efforts through studies coming out of california and we estimate that around 40 percent of the structures will be rebuilt or in the construction process by the time the the funding sun sets and with that i'll turn it back to you thank you andy so as as christy was saying within the legislation when people rebuild on the residential or commercial side they can't rebuild to what the code was in effect in january 2008 and so when we first you know started this program and take a look at it we looked at what is the energy savings just to get people to the code that's in effect right now in 2021 and there's significant energy savings if you look at uh just single family home the difference between what the code was at that time the 2005 residential code today there's about a 30 to 35 percent energy efficiency increase and that means long-term energy savings for people uh long-term affordability uh that we really think we want we want people to be able to take advantage of and this as we rebuild these communities we want them to make them energy efficient and we want to make sure they're affordable and so there's a great opportunity in designing that that just gets people to be able to offset the cost that it takes to build the code and so we've taken a look at current building practices uh we certainly know that lighting and appliances things have improved but even with the those general improvements there is still energy efficiency gains in getting people to build to our current code and we certainly want to capture that as much as we can and so in looking at kind of a preliminary design how can we offer incentives to get people to build to that current code and also provide education and then some incentives to get beyond that code to take advantage of utility programs that already exist in the market and are there opportunities for us to offer incentives to make that even more attractive to get people to build above and representative marsh highlighted the great need within manufactured homes to provide support so taking a look within manufactured homes because manufactured homes are regulated at the federal level at the hud standard level uh and not the oregon building it's a little bit you have to treat those building types a little differently but there is a type of manufacturing energy star level or a neem standard level energy that's a little more energy efficient home we're looking at can we provide incentives to get people there and offset the majority if not all the costs that it takes to get that more energy efficient home and can we help people take advantage of our program and utility programs and utilize services in southern oregon such as uh to communicate with those public those communities and and make sure they're clear on what that opportunity and and so on the new home on the new manufacturing side offering incentive to get a new energy manufactured home but we've also heard from those communities that the reality is a lot of people could only afford a maybe a previously owned manufactured home and so what is what is something we could offer those people as well as people who buy new manufactured homes and we've taken a look at the opportunity of doing a heat pump replacement program or or taking out maybe the electric forced air furnace that's there and replacing that with a heat pump or adding a ductless heat pump to an existing zonal system within a manufactured home this would offer many benefits improve the quality the performance of the structure and the comfort within it lower their electricity bills offering long-term affordability uh hopefully adding cooling that they probably didn't have before and making them more comfortable and so uh hopefully it's a win all around and it's something we can do to help people that maybe can't afford to get a new manufactured home but it's still an opportunity there can we offer incentives that are large enough in combination with local utility incentives that offset the majority if not all the costs of that install can we make that attractive enough that people can take advantage of it and so those are kind of some of the initial approaches we've considered uh when designing a program but one thing to keep in mind is the costs so what are the costs of the construction of getting people uh to the the current code and so we've taken a look with with the help of our oregon's building codes division on what are the the initial what are the costs to get to the 2021 cut if you could build to that that previous code and so some initial research has said that you know depending on the house that you build obviously this is kind of an average maybe two thousand square foot home the cost increase is about five to six and a half thousand dollars and so keeping that in mind can we find an incentive attractive enough in that ballpark that offsets the majority of those costs uh to make it attractive and and make sure people can take advantage of that but we also recognize many people within this community maybe many single-family homes as representative marshall's pointing out that started to rebuild and that's wonderful i think about 25 of structures have been rebuilt across the um so can we create a program that directly benefits some of those people who have already been able to rebuild the economic recovery of it and we certainly don't want to have any kind of disadvantage because they were able to build earlier and so can we be backwards looking as well as forward-looking with our incentives and offer some support in that way and so uh i do want to ask the group and pause for a moment because we have these numbers the five to six and a half thousand dollars but we're certainly interested in and people with a local perspective we certainly know there's material shortages and a variety of different supply chain issues are do these costs make sense or are people seeing larger costs in this or or smaller ones to build a current code and so i'll pause for a moment see if anybody raises their hand or has some well christy did we get any takers yeah i'm just gonna chime in to say that i don't see any hands up yet um i was trying to remember how to tell people to unmute if they're on the phone because we have a few people on the phone do you remember what it is is it star three or three that to i guess raise your hand from the phone and then i think we can unmute them oh great and then in the time we've been chatting about this so now the folks on the phone know what",

and then you run into capacity on where you can fuel those because that's a whole another thing uh the way that the the service works now is uh they essentially if they're half tanker below and they have a chance they fuel so we have to kind of change the way that they do the service as well and they have to come through our our DB facility and then we have to uh our staff will fuel we'll uh register the fuel use so we can charge that fuel to that Grant but still track it all under our Fleet so various issues there how much additional capacity in terms of like you know land area would we need to keep all of our Paratransit vehicles in the same place as our fix route Fleet I think that's a bigger question than I can answer I can answer uh so uh in this upcoming fiscal year there's funds uh and actually in this year to do a facilities assessment for either expansion or consider a new location uh due to the one of the desires is to consolidate all of our vehicles on one facility and the the call center for our pair Transit service that's still collocated with Del Web no that is with MTM okay okay and so the the idea would we bring we would bring all of that into a single location in an ideal future that's correct thanks okay any other questions director Davidson thank you president Eno hos prey um could you talk to me about uh what a high floor par Transit vehicle how it works for especially given the population that it serves and the um Can it kneel how how does you know getting people into the par Transit vehicle work when it's a high floor director Davon good question question so it's a so there's a difference between some of our our Fleet is low floor which knels uh which uh mirrors the local Service as far as height and angle uh the high floor Paratransit buses have steps for people that are able to use steps and then also there is still a an ADA Mobility device that's uh just instead of a ramp so it has a lift so it still serves the the uh the same demographics uh they're pretty interchangeable um but with if there was a CG option that was low floor that would be preferable but since there's CG tanks they have to keep it to kind of kind of what you think of the oldfashioned Cutaway Vehicles what they what they look like and we still currently have kind of a mixture in our Fleet now great thank you all righty any other questions no D alarm give no thank you I have a very brief brief question um which is rare for me um first of all good to meet you uh we haven't met before and I wasn't here in January so thank you for your commitment through all the economic turmoil to get this project see it through but um director Davidson's question inspired mine I um I I use I'm a wheelchair user and I have um um High floor buses and I was bused to school when I went to public school um for those who don't aren't in chairs but maybe can't because the steps are very high for those who don't know they they're really quite a challenge to get through even for people who were ail bodied what is I I just don't know what is the intermediary like for someone who can't make the steps would want the service but isn't a a wheelchair user how would they they can still request the the use of the lift and but but walking through that so there' be like a chair that you would sit in or they would just stand on it you stand on the platform there there's uh safety uh safety securement so you don't fall out out of it on the when it's raised there's handrails so you can stand hold and and just lift thank you manager Thompson having never been in that position I didn't know so you okay director n thank you president inos presy uh so the question I have is how do these compare the interior compare to the um existing uh vehicles that we have right now and the reason I asked that is because I remember there was an issue um that a veteran had brought to my attention where when he was trying to turn around inside one of the buses he kept getting caught up and um the ultimate solution I think was removing some of the baskets that he had on there um but I just wondered are are they similar in size or are they smaller uh they'll be the the almost the interior floor plan layout will be exactly the same all of the buses that we we purchase uh do meet ADA requirements as far as the uh access points the the pivot Points uh where some of the struggle comes is when you have oversized Mobility devices that would uh just don't fit in those areas but these will have a very similar floor plan to the rest of the fleet perfect you well thank you very much um thank you very much manager Thompson do we have a motion on this item um I move the board authorized general manager to execute a contract with Northwest Bus Sales for the purchase of seven CG Paratransit buses for use in the Chariots lift adaa service for an amount not to exceed 184 thank you I'll second okay a motion in a second do we have any discussion on this director Davidson uh I just want to say that I'm thrilled that we're transitioning to compressed and ultimately renewable natural gas for these pair trans buses I also uh want to put on the record that there will be some Financial benefits to us using alternative fuels like this and I would love to see that money for these pair of Transit Vehicles go to partially fund a micr Mobility study so just wanted to stick that out there okay all those in favor please say I I I I I any opposed okay I I mean I I saw the attempt at the going off mute director Carney so I'm an I I'm an i i I'll take that as a motion passes unanimously thank you very much thank you manager tosson we'll uh move on to our next item director I mean general manager poock may this manager Thompson hey here I am uh good evening uh president H know Presley uh members of the board good evening uh I it was interesting that uh we we just saw a presentation from CFM Advocates about how they helped obtain some grants I'm here to spend that tonight I'm asking the the board to authorize the general manager to execute a contract with gillig to for the purchase of 1040t battery electric buses to replace 10 40ft diesel buses for an amount not to exceed 12 m757 in 20 in 2023 the district was awarded two grants each Grant allows for the purchase of five battery electric buses charging infrastructure engineering and construction tonight we're working on just the bus porun the first grant is a 2023 Lono Grant which is the third time that the district has been successful in being awarded this this competitive Grant the second Grant is a community project Community Project funding Grant the cpf this grant was made possible by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022 and is selected through a congressionally directed application process again in total there will be this order be for another 10 battery buses um once notified of the successful Grant Awards I worked with gillig to obtain some uh price quotes uh earlier uh in last year this locking in the bus costs while work while we were working through the procurement process the good news is that from that time until now using the Washington State price agreement there was a 10 to 12% price increase locking in the price early shielded us from that which is a savings or a cost offset of about $1.5 million so I was glad that we didn't have to pay that and we also because of our our relationship that we've built with gillig at the time of that award and we're looking at the the uh bus pricing we're able to actually tentatively hold our production cues uh and so they until they'll come a time where they say we need a PO or you get back to the back of the line but we're able to kind of progress through that so at that time that essentially the clock started ticking uh bus bus Bills take about 12 or 15 to 18 months to build we're expecting these 10 buses to be delivered December of 24 so December of this year so maybe January we'll see what the production schedule actually does but they usually keep it pretty close all 10 battery electric buses will be procured using the Washington State price agreement and under the procedur set by the Washington Washington department of transportation's public transit division the tables below are actually going to outline since it's two funding two funding grants using Federal several grants uh and it's two orders of five so we'll break out each of those orders and then we'll roll them back up together on the third table so table table one uh we for the low no Grant which is an 8515 match so the grant amount is 343 with the match amount being 94,5 32 with a total of 6,968 we are adding Oregon D funds which is a 100% Grant amount of 645 and that brings a total for that 525 for the cpf grant it's an % Grant amount and a 15.1% match the grant money that we'll be using is 5 157 totaling 525 Table Three takes takes those three grants kind of and rolls them up together to show the toal total of 12,756 Staff recommends the board authorized the general manager to execute a contract with gillig for the purchase of 1040t battery electric buses for an amount not to exceed the 12,756 and I can answer any questions you have hopefully okay any right so would anyone like to make a motion are you're looking at me okay cool I'd love to make a motion uh I move that the board authorize the general manager to execute a contract with gillig for the purchase of 10 40ft battery electric buses for an amount not to exceed 15 second awesome we have a motion at a second and is there any discussion on this motion yes Dr Davidson thank you president um I I wasn't sure if I wanted to",

        "text": " in reality one of the great things that we can do as a city and as a staff is to try to expedite the process because time is really money and and the longer things take the less there's an opportunity for investment plus there are economic cycles and and in many cases developers and businesses want to be aware that the cycle can change and we've seen Now High interest rates we're seeing less leasing as a result of high interest rates so things that things that can happen faster can often be best in terms of timing for Cycles I think might be it's an important part of the conversation you know there are um developers out there that just want to be able to build warehouse space that's not something we necessarily want in P so you know when we think about um bringing jobs to Sherwood that jobs that can afford the housing making sure that we're we're doing what we can to encourage those Industries and discourage the type of we don't want you know we' had and and a lot of that is done verbally with developers but we don't we can't force that to happen in a sense and one of the things that I think well we could I know I want to get to because I think we all know that it's because of the flex code that we have ensure with that it's caused investment here versus in some unnamed other cities and the reality is that there are some cities that have had manufacturing only codes and land sat for long time and so I think there has to be some kind of a balance and I'm not sure what that balance is at this stage but I think that's something that certainly has to be thought about in terms of a process we do it the other way where we say okay we'll do incentives you know by speeding it up but for the first one of this type of business you know what I mean like so that we're we're just to we're not saying you can't come here it's just you know we don't need you know five of that particular type of business we would kind of like to incentivize one or two well I think there's two different two different aspects to this one is the development itself because you don't know all the buildings in the Teton Sherwood Corporate Park which is that project they were funded by by modlo and Modo means if you look it up modern Logistics but in reality because the market here seems to be stronger in the South I5 Corridor which were're apart for manufacturing most of this turned into manufacturing the one exception is that L building but that's in support of the entire semiconductor operation that lamb has so so from and that'll become the regional Logistics Center for lamb from what we understand so no it's not actually that building I'm sorry or is it no no that's that's DW Fritz so in some ways we're fortunate to be in this market rather than the Eastside Market over by grum where you have a tremendous amount of warehousing going on near the airport in essence but the reality is I guess any of these buildings could have turned into warehouse buildings I mean that's certainly possible Dan you guys have thoughts I mean I agree with what you say I think the other thing I'd be looking for in code audits is there are there are there massive red tape like that we can clear out right through through some streamlining I think it goes up to you know kind of goes along with Expediting but um I also want to make sure that we're we're looking at the areas where we can hone toward the outcomes we're looking for you know but not be too prescriptive right where we eliminate opportunities too so that balance that Bruce talked about yeah and I think you know we we have TS corporate the big developments in the talking the poy area with TS corporate which very high success rate in our targeted Industries we have surewood Commerce Center coming online now so far you know relatively few leases confirmed it's about split right now between manufacturing and warehousing wholesale um we just approved uh panat Tony which uh they they do Focus some Logistics mainly but I think it's to be determined what that looks like so I think we're we're really early in the talking employment area like we're in this weird spot where we have a lot of development happening but we haven't we're really close to figuring out what the what those tenants are going to be we just haven't gotten there yet so part part of this could be an audit of what the um uses were actually getting there you come back and tell you percentages hey we're at 5050 right now in the tonen employment area is this meeting our Target or do we need to look at potential restrictions in certain areas and I I think going back and looking at the winds so far and saying are these actually providing the type of jobs that we were hoping for right you because you could have when I think of manufacturing I think of Le and Shirley and the gloves assembly line you know those are those are probably minimum wage manufacturing jobs right so are we getting you know Advan manufacturing obvious but even with manufacturing are we getting the outcomes well and those kind of jobs also they do balance the tax base but they don't really um provide you know Vibe of the city or anything like is this also to address like the small business incentives or anything like that that a butcher downtown or you know would would impact oh this makes sure would feel more you know homey or like a you know what I mean I think that's probably more in the Oldtown strategic process so that'll be separate this is about about the high paying jobs balancing the tax base and kind of the large swats of the land and then we'll do another incentive thing for the that's how we recommended that's that would be our okay thought as to how it might proceed the best yeah this is going to get a become a big project yeah I can separate that yeah okay to respond to your question my thoughts would be if there's a way to incentivize living wage jobs whatever that might be not the warehousing Ian we do have a UR that we can create um carrots with right like sets you for certain types of businesses something we can consider if we did that then that also helped the tax the taex yeah one thing I think there's a lot of options I I like those ideas I think that's exactly what what get at through this code audit is you know I can tell you right now there's no incentive in terms of land use procedures um you know building permit riew for certain industry we we know internally and we're paying attention to it get these permits out the door um but you know and we'd want probably legal counsel to weigh in on this as well can we do a FastTrack land use review for certain types of Industries um can we have our third and I'll get to this in a second but have our third party reviewer or our in-house review if we have one prioritize those projects over others I mean it's it likely will come at somewhat of a cost if we take that approach to General commercial U but I think there's things that we can do non-financially that are just you know programmatically that are going to incentivize certain industries um in addition to the UR okay I was going to say I mean obviously that's a big decision but don't take it off the table I think in the UR we do actually list that as an item SDC something related to SDC industry I think that that would probably have more of an impact the sdc's to entice entice certain kinds of business to come here and advertise that market that make sure the developers aware that there could be a benefit to them if they bring in the right kinds of companies rather than mandating you know just manufacturing or something of that sort which could scare off the institutional Capital which is the basis for all of this happening they want to have that flexibility where maybe part of the site would be manufacturing but part might be warehousing and maybe that's in support of the manufacturing and then need' have both yeah and and very often manufacturing like if you look at some companies without naming any names that are in in that particular Park Semiconductor Company that's in there not lamb um you can see that what they're doing is they have R&amp;D they have engineering they have you know uh they have the manufacturing the Advanced manufacturing side but they also include distribution because that's all integral to the manufacturing process so I think one of the issues is really a building which is totally perhaps uh distribution versus a company that it's part of you know getting the getting the product out of there so they can sell it you know when we say warehousing um would that we could would like more storage facilities could under that Min storage you mean oh Mini Storage no yeah we don't wouldn't love okay yeah it'd be very easy to use up space that's what I was trying to I definitely think there's something to the stdc offset idea I I I like the carrot versus the stick approach a little bit better and if you tie it to either the certain I I like of tying it to to what you said words these are the industries we're trying to attract if you if we can do this legally if you're one of these industries you get some offsets if you're not yeah yeah I there's a lot of and and you you do Market that you tell the developers up front because they're real interested in sdc's I mean we're real interested in sdc's because it pays for things but the reality the reality is that's one of the number one discussion points with us with with developers how do you get credits on your DCS and and you know that kind of thing and and if that can be an incentive a financial incentive that could you don't know but that could be a factor that they were willing to consider depends on the depends on the strength of the of the leasing market right now the leasing Market is not good it's slowed down a lot and so they're just trying to fill space because they're they got their expenses um and and but this that could be a factor that could really at least help push that along oh I'm just wondering I mean I like the idea ofc on one hand on the other hand we rely on those secs right for for the city I wonder if some analysis could be done that okay if we're given X Inc is because we know we're going to get Y in this you know property taxes or whatever",

        "text": " But I have, I have concerns. My first and foremost is the location of this piece of property. And I believe that when I was called and asked about that location, I had concerns at that point. But we've been going through the process. We can't talk to each other. So none of us have had the opportunity to be able to have these conversations with each other. It is a concern as to where this is. I am very familiar with 316, as you all know, I grew up on northeast Jacksonville Road in Spar, in between 329 and 316. So I know the area very, very well. And from where I stand, I just don't feel like this spot is compatible with the surrounding areas. I believe that everyone who has spoke today, they had very reasonable comments as far as what it would do to them and to their properties. And I understand that we're looking at having it. And I commend county staff for what they did as far as putting a plan together to move everything inward into the middle of the property, to try to abate the sound and to try to make sure that if we moved forward with this project or if we do move forward with the project, that it would be as little of an impact on the surrounding properties as it could be. But the fact of the matter is you put 250 dogs in inside outside kennels, there's nothing that you're going to do to be able to mitigate what's going to happen with the surrounding properties, especially when you're in the middle of the rural area like that. Sound travels so far, especially at night when you are in an environment like that. You know, where I live, in the middle of town at night, I can still hear every little thing. When things get quieted down, it's, you know, I would really hope that if we don't move forward with this piece of property, there would possibly be some consideration in allowing us to move forward with the donation and then possibly be able to sell and maybe look for a more suitable location for this thing. I did have a couple of legal questions for Mister Minteregh. You know, we also have to think about the position that we're putting the county in if we move forward with a project like that, as far as with the surrounding property. Owners legally, are there any ramifications for us if it becomes a nuisance and things like that? So I'd like to defer to our county attorney for some questions about that. Okay, so you've got a situation here where you've got competing uses, competing legitimate uses. It's in the public interest for the county to have a suitable site for its animal control operations. We're overgrown our current site, so obviously, we need to find someplace that is going to be a suitable site. I think one of our speakers said, no matter where you go, you're going to find somebody who won't like it. And that's to be expected. And Marion county is growing. And so the more people that move to Marion county, the more opponents you're going to have in many potential sites, which is not to say there are not better sites than this one, possibly, to the specific legal issues, this is a special use permit, and so, therefore, the county has to determine that it's consistent with the comprehensive plan. I think it would be consistent with the comprehensive plan has to be in the public interest, and it has to be compatible with the surrounding property. Obviously, based on the testimony, what you've heard, the main concerns are whether or not it's compatible, compatible with the surrounding property. The whole purpose for a special use permit, as opposed to a rezoning, is that, unlike a straight rezoning, a special use permit allows the county to require conditions to be met. The purpose for those conditions are to attempt to mitigate the effects of the particular use on the surrounding property. So there's a question whether or not the conditions that are proposed here would be adequate to address the concerns of the neighbors. So, having said that on a special use permit, in a quasi judicial hearing, the courts look to determine whether or not the board applied the correct law, whether the board afforded procedural due process to the applicant, which is obviously us and the neighbors. And so, generally speaking, procedural due process involves giving people notice and an opportunity to be heard. Obviously, we've had a lot of people here who have had an opportunity to be heard today, so I don't have any question that procedural due process would be satisfied in these proceedings. The final thing is the issue of competent, substantial evidence. And so then the question is whether or not the board has heard competent, substantial evidence. As to those three criteria, whether it's consistent with the comp plan, whether it's in the public interest, and I tend to think it probably in general is in the public interest. But again, the third criteria is whether it's compatible with the surrounding property. You've heard most of the testimony from. What I heard from the neighbors, is that it's not compatible. When you get before a court on an appeal of a quasi judicial hearing, what the court looks for is not like a car wreck case. Sometimes on some of these tv shows, you hear things about the burden of proof, and if you're in a criminal case, you have to find somebody guilty beyond and to the exclusion of every reasonable doubt. So that's the highest standard. If you're in a car wreck case, a standard is the preponderance of the evidence. All you have to do, if you're the plaintiff, is tilt the scales just a little bit in your favorite 51%, and you win the liability issue. But in this case, competent, substantial evidence. What the reviewing court looks for is whatever the decision the board makes, is there any competent, substantial evidence to support the decision you make, notwithstanding the fact that there might be all kinds of competent, substantial evidence in opposition to that? So the court doesn't weigh whether it's 50% of competent, substantial evidence or not. But you have to have some competent, substantial evidence on the issue of compatibility to support your decision. If you vote in favor of it, obviously, if you haven't found any confidence, substantial evidence on the issue of compatibility, then obviously you should not approve it. So you got the issue of, is there enough evidence from the county staff report and some of the. You had a handful of people who were in favor of it. From what I heard, the people that were in favor of it were, generally speaking, in favor of the county needs a new facility somewhere. It doesn't necessarily have to be here. We need a new facility somewhere. So, again, those are the criteria for finding a special use permit. Now, independent of the special use permit, there's another legal issue. And so if the board approves the application and developed the site as a kennel, then there's a question, are there any other legal pitfalls for the county? And there are potential other pitfalls, and that would be the pitfalls of a nuisance action. And so under Florida law, you can have both private nuisance actions and public nuisance actions. And generally speaking, the main differential is a private nuisance action tends to be people that are really close to the use as opposed to the community at large. Whether or not the fact that this would be a county owned facility would throw it into a public nuisance, I'm not sure about that, but either way, I think there's a potential for a nuisance action. In part based on some of the testimony you've you've been hearing today. So in my research on dog kennels in general, I can tell you that just like many illegal issues, it comes down to the specific facts of the situation. There are some cases where, going back to the. To the special use permit or conditional use. In some states, the courts have sometimes overturned county decisions to deny a special use permit for a kennel on the basis that the evidence that the board heard was not competent. Substantial evidence. It was speculative. It was worried about potential fears that might never be realized. I can tell you in general, based on the things that a court would look at, notwithstanding the comments that a number of people have said in general here, on the issue of valuation, most of the comments I've heard would not be deemed competent, substantial evidence by a court. As far as the issue of valuation, I'm not, by saying that, I'm not trying to discount the very real feelings and emotions that the people that spoke had in mind when they were making their comments. But I'm just saying that. Just saying that I believe my property values are going to go down. Generally speaking, is not sufficient evidence for a court to give any credit to that. On the issue of the traffic, as our board, we just had a workshop on traffic issues yesterday. Generally speaking, on a road like 326 316, the idea of having 70 cars a day is not deemed a significant amount of traffic anywhere. So that in and of itself would not be a significant issue. I think probably the biggest issue that seems to be the focus of most people concern has to do with the noise issue. And I can tell you that there are cases where some courts have upheld the denial of a special use permit for a kennel, in those cases, privately owned. But I think for purposes of our consideration, it doesn't matter if it's privately owned or government owned, it's still a kennel. As far as the issue of the noise, some courts have upheld a denial of it on that basis. But then going to the second issue of nuisance, there have been several cases where the courts have upheld a nuisance action against the kennel, even with significantly fewer than 250 dogs that we're talking about here. So there is that possibility. Obviously, that would depend the nuisance action. Generally speaking, you wouldn't have an",

trees and many mentioned uh the Oregon white oak or large trees um or improving the wildlife Corridor were feasible in the urban unincorporated areas that was some of the feedb that we've heard um there also were some concerns about our draft Concepts as well um many property owners were concerned that having map resources on their property could affect their property value or future development potential regulations could limit what their currently allowed to do on their property like tree removal or adding on to their home and the development Community comments um they appreciated that the rules were not changing existing processes for sites with riparian wildlife habitat they felt that those were sufficient um but they were uncertain about adding significant habitat that could be regulated which was a change um they were concerned about adding cost for tree inventory or mitigation requirements so moving on to some of the next steps um so we last week uh you heard we've reached a big milestone with the filing of the ordinances 901 and 902 and they're available for review I see some of you have some some Stacks to look at um our email notice to interested party goes out on Friday and then we're also mailing notice to Property Owners with map natur natural resources on July 3rd so that's another big mailing that's going out to um Property Owners July 10th we'll have a Planning Commission work session and that's going to dive even in more detail and you might have a chance to uh have more more questions as you look at the at at the um the ordinances and the language and we're going to talk more about the es analysis as well and then our first hearing is uh July 2 24th and then we have two other um Planning Commission hearing scheduled one August 21st and the other September 3rd as needed and then October 1st um we have scheduled the first Board hearing on the ordinance and that was September 4th oh did I say what they say third yeah so um now it's time to see if you have any questions thank you both very much um Commissioners questions comments I have a few questions it might help to go back to the slide um 18 and my question there was 18 yet yeah 18 just went um the word within if the proposed development is within the ver SNR um does within mean wholly Within within you're not oh go ahead yeah yeah that's a great question um so the portion of the development that would be within is the so if for example you had um something that you were doing that took up your entire site but you were encroaching into it would be the portion of the development that is within I see yeah okay so right yeah um and I think what we and we'll go of course into this in great detail um at your next work session but uh the idea of a verified repair and Wildlife pound or your verified Upland boundary there is a process that an applicant coming in verifies the boundary and uh for for the repairing boundary for most people who are within the Clean Water Services service boundary um then they would just get a a verification from clean water services and it's basically the vegetated corridor and uh for the Upland boundary they can either accept the boundary as it's mapped um which is kind of the clear and adductive path to establishing that boundary or they can go through a map thank I'll go ahead if other Commissioners are not wanting to jump in at this point slide 21 please that's about um trees and replacing trees and um um I was wondering if if a significant natural resource area contains trees that are still important for habitats um and how those are addressed mean can you remove those because they're non-native that's yeah yeah that that's kind of the short answer yes so we're regulating the trees the inventory would be regulating only the native trees and there's a native tree list that you'll see of the trees that are included that are also six inches in diameter at breast height that's that's a regulated tree so the inventory and all the the trees that are subject to the points are includ are those so if it's not a native tree it's regulated okay and they they can do what they they don't get extra they don't get points if they keep it they don't get points if they remove it thank you chair Lockwood commissioner Kaiser has his hand up oh thank you Kaiser thank you chair Lockwood I had a couple uh questions uh the first ones that comes to mind is uh we're using the Metro Upland map Upland Maps why are we using the the old existing county map anymore I mean it's from the 80s uh why aren't we just eliminating that and just going with the metro map well in some cases there was uh some overlap of the the Metro mapping and the county mapping and there also were places where there were areas that were mapped in already in protected status that the county had had mapped and so that those areas the county areas alone are also included as as important pieces of retained habitat follow know those still significant I mean have they been degraded have they been ground truthed at all or are we just assuming they are because they're on a map from the 80s well they F fit the methodology that we used for the Metro inventory as well as the county inventory so if it wasn't developed if it was the if it was part of a habitat pack um all of those factors that made it significant it was it went through that same um threat identification process and we used um Aerials the same as if we as as the Metro inventory so would I guess the suggestion here is that because one thing was significant at one point it is significant forever then unless so unless we adopt new maps that add more significant resources that that's kind of what I hear there I mean but we don't always know that something stays a significant natural resource over time if it's been degraded for any number of reasons right so I I guess part of my my question or comment here is uh we're relying on aals for maps we're relying on on other people to map and we're not really looking at it to make sure whether or not it is significant significant or not I I understand the expense involved there I not ignorant to that but it is problematic um for me anyway um couple other questions I had I would like to see an old versus new overlay map that kind of shows us what uh the progression on this I know we've we've had this kind of go through a couple of different um iterations with the with uh the courts and I would love to see how the map has changed over that time if possible Le at least from where we started to where're we're going to be uh at the end of this I don't want to make too much more work for somebody but I would like to see uh some mapping that that actually showed that overlay uh versus where we have been if that's possible and if I could just jump in on this a little bit because we have something mapped doesn't mean that we're positive we're right about that and so if it's mapped and nothing's happening on that property nothing happens but when a property comes in for development that's one we require the actual ground truth thing inventories delineation any of that that would be necessary in order to confirm what is actually on the site and then that informs what part of the process the developer goes through next and also it's about it's about tree it's about trees and whether there's native trees of meeting that threshold so that's really kind of the determination that it's significant it's been ident it's been identified so if that sites degraded as you speak and there's um non-native trees or there's um no trees at all then then there's there's nothing to inventory or there's nothing to protect through the course of development and commissioner to your to your second part of your question about how the maps have changed over time so part of what you'll see in your packet and they are eight and a half by 11s so it may not be super clear there are 11 by 17s on the website um but there are the the old Community PL plan maps and then the proposed Maps so you'll be able to compare those two um it's not an overlay uh because that this very would be very very difficult for us to show because there was a lot of overlap between metros and hours and um but we also uh will have a report shortly the uh EC analysis report that will um have a number of tables I think the inventory will as well that that talk about how many acres were in each of the categories and how does that um how does that look now uh so what it was and what it is now so you'll you'll see a lot of that information shortly okay uh couple other questions uh asum we're going to the point system or the thought behind the point system is that's a clear and objective standard right I mean youve got a you got something you can count theoretically what do we have I I mean perhaps that that part isn't totally developed yet but do we have an idea of how that that point system works and and the width and breadth of it is it you know a 10o scale 100 point scale kind of what what what do we have there well it's it's based on the size of the the trees that are native six inches or more and we'll go into that more at the next at the next meeting that we have um so I think there's no I don't think there's a maximum points that that for for no there's not so for I mean I mean certainly I would think a you know a 100y old oak tree with a very substantial uh diameter you know um would get both the points for its diameter as well as the bonus points for being a white oak so that's where you would see the most trees or excuse me the most tree points so if one were to preserve that on a site um it would and you were keeping 50% of the tree points keeping that lets you maybe remove other trees that are you know going to be balanced by that to achieve that 50% so it's not saying you have to keep that particular tree but it is certainly going to we hope encourage people to keep those large uh in particular the White Oak that's why the",

        "text": " experience for developing similar projects operation plan how are you going to maintain an operator project and again these are focused Sports microgrids and solar so they it's not a perfect carryover we want to have the project adequately described within the application and there's no question as to the project that's getting funded if it's a 20 billion dollar project and you're asking for 800 000 we would like to see that you've got the rest of the financial staff figured out so that's our financial plan construction plan you if it when's it going to start how long will it take to construct these are the types of type of information that you would like to have to see that we have a effectively fully baked project coming into the program complete and performance next slide these are moving on to some of the advocacy rep program and again this is a whole lot that goes into a single criteria head points in that photograph we want to see that there's been essentially Community with these projects if you're doing something like a resilience of there may be more opportunity to have this community discussion than something like you're yeah that's that's what I've always been struggling with that yeah and they don't care they don't care about how and the different cou like the Municipal Utilities have a lot of um close Partnerships with the city but it seems like there might already be like a networked effect in and some of the cou so like for your award for example who comes to those meetings but we I imagine curious about like they talk about pieces there we have a lot of these memories are all you know or the board jobs accept policy and telling the organization they don't like it down under minutiae and we explained to them doing what we're doing so that kind of large-scale capital projects and things like that but they didn't at least for us boards don't buff boards don't typically get involved on the day-to-day I would just urge a lot of flexibility on this point and allow the applicant to describe the community benefit and not have the rigorous requirements about how we go about demonstrating Community benefit I mean if we can provide a good description of what benefit comes as the community without saying that we've held you know a bunch of community meetings about fuses and steel holes I mean I I think that should govern I don't think some of this stuff makes sense yeah so before we heard about essential Services we could have a separate criteria project provides enhanced reliability to apply right whatever that could be a specific criteria that earn points that you don't have to talk about fuse but it brings the benefits I think that's I think it comes into more of an outcomes-based but we do that well I would think that that things uh similar to the we just we're talking about the the Partnerships that we have with our Emergency Management folks if we could get letters of support we can explain what a community benefited to them particularly and on the brand application we can describe what the community benefit is but then if we have the the groups the fire stations the the the Emergency Management folks uh uh hospitals uh you name it write letters that support for in particular I think that would that would help immigrating if if you were considering the community impact that a hospital saving well they're trying to make this line that serves me more resilient than uh I think that should have some waiting yeah so getting at the those Emergency Services um service and another one that we talked about briefly in the narrative is just communication with either the county of the city um because that opens up certain channels of discussion that might bring some out of the another one experience guidelines is does it serve a community if it's highlighted or otherwise to find with a disadvantaged and I think you're going to guess deny yeah would you get to that a little bit later it's pretty popular now so we can go there and want um but so yeah that's three right there there's some services communication with local Devastation and serving the disadvantaged community and those could be sacked up in a table and we can give them 10 points each and that's 30 percent of the total store content it's been pointed out by several of the ability books that the customers really don't care about the fuses or the circuits or the scada it as Virgie said it's the outcomes you know will I still have drinking water will I still have sanitation will there be in place for warming and pooling and food preparation you know can medicines be children you know those are the kind of outcome metrics that typically don't fall under the puc but it could make a big difference in this well and I think the other thing you have to keep in mind is the government structure I've done a solar energy which is governed by a board of directors democratically elected from these small communities I mean they're representing those those areas and the board endorses that project that does submit you know that's casted sort of a community outreach right I mean these people are elected by those people our third City yeah they're the people that elected to sort of like so they don't have to get involved in fuses but you know the board of directors is involved in that they will be briefed on this I suspect they will vote on it and endorsing projects so I mean I think you have to look better that's the way their government they don't do this on their own they evaluate Community we have the co news and leg up there's one way in the center of 50s are all coordinary decisions or city hall or however they get to it but there's a pattern in France what we want is the criteria that differentiate between Clio view with every Coop has been stored how does this one project store item or lower it's what we need to get to the criteria and I think we're getting some some examples here and we want to hear about the fuses too that's in the technical all right so maybe we'll go down to the next slide it's um so some of these are pretty specific to that program which was I mean those of you who are familiar with the CBI program it was very timely legislature and so a lot of these come right out of the registrative lane so again researchers presented as examples would be really do that in running City it looks like uh energy of the silliest for the Spanish communities that's this back to it so and you know after these open houses we will be able to go back put together a brat version of some criteria and share of that element this isn't going to last chance to discuss this um yeah just ask I heard I heard a comment that one of these was liked which letter was it that you might oh Jay Jay okay and if there are ones that you like or dislike and even just want to throw out a letter so that we have that feedback we can kind of take expense as well yeah so that's our um vertical facilities for that one there's a lot of points to the Sea guys maybe we'll go to the next slide again some of these are a little more focused on that there's some economic development discussions a local jobs we recognized it for a lot of the consumer owned utilities of the be their own rooms and that's an opportunity to prepare an action but it's maybe these we also have genographic diversity and technological diversity not representing model coins but this is kind of how we proposed it for this program as well we couldn't even bump this up we really want to see the money flow all over the under economic development is the City Club studying on top of the energy resilience plan pointed out that there are many many small businesses that won't be able to survive without certain essential services so that could be an economic development aspect of you know the ability to keep small businesses operating during disasters it's it's like a normal Economic Development criteria but in this case my thing yeah survival we can't process a credit card they can't say the business so it's the last one like different types of resilience projects like you don't want all reconnect during things being submitted or what what is that getting at well this again was from the sea rep it was prior to Diversified Beyond his soul to bring some points to undertake the homies but this program could be you know show us some fuses and some reconductoring and some underground and you can support it and get their value for that yeah I wonder about that I mean I I think that should be defined by the utility um you know that they're they're going to put forward their highest in-depth project it doesn't I don't think that that's relevant I guess I would say I mean well because one of the diversity in technology was to keep it out we use eliminated solar and allowed from thank you all right so maybe we have we eliminate the diversity technology we put it all diversity and again these are five percent of the total points and had in this factories in this program I wasn't proposed we could say five percent if you're and we could come up with some way to say this County only has one then they get five points for this county has five each one gets one point try to spreading that one that way I think that's valid or argument to have it because let's work in all of our populations along the IFA performance but here's a whole lot of utilities outside of behavior quarters so I think it's good to have Carnival project diversity be represented so the folks far away how about utility type you know Co-op um PUD IOU would that be something to consider in terms of uh instead of just geography maybe utility type yeah um try to spread a little down to although some cous had more Wildfire exposure than others as well so that's yeah that's what I was thinking and me I would try to do as much of this as risk-based uh did we aim and progress that that may landed an area without very much risk versus the ignoring area that has a lot more risk they're different types though I mean like like some of the cities are going to be more impacted by Ice storms or yeah you know things like that so yeah but I agree it should be rest space I think that would be part of the maintenance by accident could a criteria be leverage of other programs like you know by doing this Douglas is able to you know support the sea rep and it should or something that shows that it you know you're most cascading effect yeah this project also contributes to not only good resiliency but sanitation freshwater Communications and those kind of things as",

        "text": " uh for example um you know did the applicant um uh use current data from reputable sources to identify the high-risk areas and did they you know how they adequately described how they'll inspect their components and that that's not a good one but um you know the the next undersea here we have you know have the preventative inaction actions and programs uh identified by the applicant minimize the risk of components causing wildfire risks to public health and safety and damages to resources protected by cancer standards been minimized so there are some sort of standards if you will built into these criteria um whether or not those are clear enough for the council to make uh consistent decisions is is you know up to you um i do think that as the council implements this you can also build a kind of decision record about what you think is sufficient and that will help staff kind of implement this going forward as well yeah so christopher and marcy um i like e because it does include incorporate the mitigate the wildfire so there is that your mitigation concern that you had there cindy thank you all right well i think we've gotten actually into uh the remaining issues i kind of wanted to discuss i'll go ahead and wrap up my discussion and see what i have left i think i wanted to just review quickly the um fiscal impact statements and the uh oh the racial equity statement which i didn't talk about for protectors i would like to bring up here um so we've kind of gone over the issue about what the criteria for the plan should be you've seen what's in the rule language if there's any further discussion on this i'm happy to bring it back up um i did want to point out that uh like i said we try to stay pretty close to what the puc is requiring but we did cut out specific their the their criteria that's specific to public safety power shutoffs and that both the protocols for conducting power shutoffs and the protocols for engaging with communities about when and why a shutoff might happen and what to do when a shutoff does happen we just didn't think that was appropriate for council standard since the facilities that you review and approve do not serve end users of electricity um those besides uh the the transmission bulk transmission lines which are really part of the um bulk transmission grid and are also already subject to poc transmission you know we are really looking at um bulk generation facilities that that are feeding into the grid but not going to somebody's house um and then we also cut out any information about uh development and implementation of administration administrative costs uh one of the underlying questions here is that kind of the pucs decision criteria is really revolves around uh effective mitigation strategies with you know costs to consumers partially because that's you know a big part of their mandate but that's not really part of the council's review so that's just that note there that we've recommended we stick pretty close to what the puc is requiring except for public safety power shut off community engagement and cost development um and then the last thing i wanted to bring before you all is whether or not there should be some kind of exception for facilities that are subject to apuc or consumer or utility approved wildfire potential prevention plan right now as far as proposed or existing facilities in my mind that would only include the eugene and medford transmission line uh operated by pacific war and uh the um and the and the proposed orbit to hemingway line which both operate under a plan um there are a lot of utility owned generation facilities uh that that are on the landscape but those don't seem to be addressed by the plans so um as as far as i'm concerned i think we've written it in a way that would just say uh those transmission lines wouldn't have to submit uh something new to us um but uh the could address that if you want and i'm happy to bring back this is marcie i just want to have a clarifying question it's my understanding that the investor and utilities have to but the consumer consumer own they just have to submit the plan so how do we say that it's approved if they're just submitting it based off of their own recognizance yeah they have to have a plan but they aren't subject to the specific criteria so um and they i guess to complicate this further uh they i don't believe uh are required to submit their first yet i don't know if that's coming later this year or not i can't remember what was included in the statute for that deadline um so there's no examples out there that i know of for us to look at yet um understood and i do agree that if they already are required by the puc which is going to be more stringent than what we would require would be redundant to roll them through it so that's just my chair um the record talk hey chris i want to make sure that we got through issue number seven if that was when you had the criteria open and you were going through them but oh sure to make sure that that that actually got through um well i i didn't hear any additional comments on these paragraphs a through e here but if there were uh yeah happy to discuss of go ahead haley the heads are all mod no here so okay thank you okay so no i'm not hearing further discussion on on this exceptions issue you know the other way to slice this i think would be to say well everybody has to meet the standard but if the standard is now that you have to have a plan you know they could conceivably just submit their plan that they've submitted the pse but um i'm not sure how how well that would work so we can keep the exception in as proposed and and also see what the comments are like i said i i guess i i didn't give my spiel quite again for this one but this is not your last opportunity to make changes to these roles and if there are public comments uh you will be able to make adjustments at the before you adopt permanent roles so marcy this is hanley go ahead hanley yeah christopher my concern with us adopting the requirement for the oh no it's the anyway for the ones that the puc is approving is we're reapproving it so what happens if we don't approve it and the puc has um i don't want us jurisdictionally to be responsible for something that the pucs already approved i guess so i i i would support the exception thank you chair jenkins and one thing that just popped in my mind i just saw this morning that the puc had adopted some of their new uh new safety standard rules and so their rules contain pretty detailed requirements about inspections and um vegetation management and like trimming and things like that and i do believe that those more those requirements uh do apply to the consumer-owned utilities as uh transmission lines as well as the investor on utilities so i just wanted to circle back and address uh chair grill's comment and say that even though there's not specific criteria for consumer-owned utility um there are specific uh inspection and safety protocols and puc rule that are applicable to their to the best of my understanding thank you cindy fondant i just want to make sure operating in good space here so with respect to this question so i um i'm affiliated with the consumer owned utility and so i want to make sure i i remain silent or when i just with respect to this issue and if you could give guidance that would be for the record todd cornett i'll make a initial response and i'll look to patrick to correct me if he uh has a an additional thoughts or ideas um this is a legislative process during rule making which is usually you know a fairly open-ended process i think you know if somebody has some background or you know information i think disclosure is appropriate i don't believe that there's any issues here with you continuing to participate on this rulemaking although i do appreciate the so but again i will look to patrick to see if he has any different thoughts on all right patrick we're having a hard time hearing you you hear me better anybody know a little bit it's still a little difficult okay i'm gonna turn my volume all the way up is that any better good good enough as i understand that councilmember conan suggesting that she just not participate with regard to discussion of this particular issue issue number eight is that correct i agree with todd we're early in this process i don't know what your affiliation is with the consumer owned uh but if you if you're suggesting to recuse yourself from discussion just of this issue i think that would be appropriate clarified not necessary for you to recuse yourself from discussion of you know this rule making in its entirety kill so i will recuse my i'm on the board of a consumer-owned utility so i think it's appropriate i refuse thanks well i i will go ahead and move forward hearing no more discussion about this exceptions issue and um i just you you know you'll have your opportunity to make the final discussion so if there is more discussion on this just please let me know or if you'd like to see the draft language that we've drawn up um i can bring that up uh but to kind of conclude with our recommendations we just have some conforming changes needed to implement the new standard and that includes establishing information requirements to support the findings required by the new standard so we'd be like i said i think at the beginning of this requiring a general description of wildfire risk in the noi and then requiring that risk analysis uh which is described in the standard uh as part of the application as well as oh sorry and i guess i will need to go and edit this um as well as the draft wildfire mitigation plan um and i want to point out that sometimes when we have these draft mitigation plans their submittal is deferred uh later in the process and and i would actually recommend for this issue that the rules specifically require the draft to be submitted as part of the application unless you want to delegate that review to to staff in some way so um okay before we make our final decision then i will uh i need to make a change to the red line about the draft plan because it has that conditional language in it too so i'll just uh go back and do that um while maybe you're discussing how you want to proceed on the other issues um but similar to how we discussed the timeline for the protected areas rule making i just want to point out that we have a a draft",

for anyone who's to make comments during this open public comment period those days we will consider the public comment period closed at 11 56. that gets us up to venture yes so we are running early on the agenda lunch is not here yet so if you take a break now we want you to come for um we could uh start and see if we can get through the next agenda and prior to lunch that is what is your preference period foreign Department of energy senior policy advisor and Sarah esterson make a presentation at this time thank you we still take a transcript of the being um I mean that's really I don't know Howard so I know Google hired the so whether you want to continue that or not that's your choice so thank you thank you I'll Take Care thank you so we're just going to take a moment and uh do some transition here we've got um uh Idaho Power departing and our report reporter is going to believe so if you give us a few minutes those on the phone take your time we sprung up a big gap on all right good afternoon I believe it's good afternoon to your ground I share how and members of the council again for the record my name is Sarah esterson I'm a senior policy advisor Oregon Department of energy citing division and I'll be walking you through agenda item D which includes two procedural requirements applicable to the site certificate termination requests for perennial language exercise station the first requirement is council's review and approval or modification of the certificate holders proposed retirement plan and then the second subsequent request is for council's termination of the psych certificate uh we have had several site certificates terminated in Council history but this is actually I believe the person has had facility components constructed oftentimes if a site certificate is it's terminated it's because it didn't go and this is UB um in your Council packets and made available to the public we have a staff report a draft final order that it again includes a presentation of the proposed retirement plan and closer to internally with a state certificate as well as comments received on Riverwest for uh we will go over uh an overview of the facility facility location uh certificate holder inside certificate history we'll review the proposed retirement plan and then will have an opportunity to approver modify that internally and the same certificate in group Chiefs okay so just a little bit of an overview so the perennial one Chaser station is an approved 415 megawatt natural gas it has an approved site boundary uh encompassing 60 Acres and Umatilla County near Hermiston the certificate holder is perennial and teacher LLC which is a Liam's subsidiary of pseudogent Corporation of America construction of facility components including a road segment and Bridge commenced in 2020. and this is the certificate holders I also wanted to acknowledge that we have a certificate over representative in the audience today Mr J.J Jameson so if you can see my cursor just a little bit more context of exactly where the facility and components constructed or located so again this is in Umatilla County right off of the energy facility site is here see my first search it is off of kind of sandwiched between I-84 and i-82 I think I wanted to point out also so the location or facility components were constructed was here but the facility also included a Four Mile approved four-mile natural gas pipeline that extended to the South and then a transmission line that would have extended more to interconnect to a 500 KB substation and then ultimately to McNairy Association those facility components were not constructed again what was constructed was a real estate in the end on bridge over the Westland a quick overview of the site certificate history Council originally uh granted issuance of the state certificate in they authorized you authorized an amendment of the site certificate in 2019 that included an extension of the construction deadline in 2020 as I've mentioned when construction commenced including a birth segment in the bridge and then in July of 2022 the University of day requests to terminate the sex certificate based on our view post retirement upon receipt of that termination request we issued a public notice and a a 30-day comment period that comment period closed on September 6th and then in preparation Focus accounts only being we prepared council meeting materials the staff reporting draft final order that was made available on the 13th and then you have those materials for reviewing approval today um and we'll go over this in a little bit more details I just wanted to know during that comment period we received two comments one from the Columbia River Keepers and one from the friends of the Columbia Gorge uh and then in response to those comments the certificate holder requested additional time passed the comment deadline to respond to those comments which we granted an extension of one week every week okay so um the certificate holders proposed retirement plan applies to the components that have been constructed again this road segment and Bridge Crossing the Westland canal uh construction commenced in September of 2020 and concluded within 12 weeks um during that 12 weeks after construction was completed restoration commenced restoration included site stabilization mulching and hydroseeding and then ultimately movable of erosion control materials in this application certificate holder documentation from the Department of Environmental Quality indicating that their 1200 C permit have been terminated one of the requirements to terminate at 1200 seniors to demonstrate that you have 70 site stabilization so we are relying a bit on that for restoration after Construction in 201 okay so the proposed retirement plan does not propose any subsequent action at this time so if you can recall the original figure I showed you of the site down underneath so if you see my cursor this hatched line is the site boundary of where the energy facility was approved to be located and they'll locate this hash line again right here and then the Ronin bridge that was constructed is right here so it provides access to the site essential this is a photo of the bridge and a road Canada up their stabilization measures and just to note that like predisturbance condition is what this side of the train tracks looks like seven times yes yes is that the only access to the side over that bridge yes okay so in a proposed retirement plan a detailed cost estimate must be provided again this is a little unique because of the scale of what was constructed and then the proposal to entertain those structures in place so the detailed cost estimate is essentially zero dollars we do have a bond so your scope of review of important to approve this proposed retirement plan is whether it will whether it demonstrates restoring the site to a useful non-hazardous condition so some of the considerations that you can apply to this question are what is the underlying Zone what are the surrounding uses are the structures that are proposed to remain in place allowable within the and as we presented in the draft final that the proposed retirement plan does meet uh does demonstrate restoration to the useful monk hazardous condition because the zone is exclusive Farm use although it's not used for current agriculture it's surrounded by uh on three quarters of the side of my industrial Zone to land and then I believe we have one other zone is Riverfront whereas commercial a little bit on the northwest um so this is consistent with the uses in the surrounding area and then as included in the termination robust and referenced in the draft final order that it is the Road and Bridge in place in this Zone as viewed as an accessory use to the zone and supported by Umatilla so we have a letter something that took Umatilla County serving this okay so this the next step after considering whether the proposed retirement plan would restore the site to useful non-hazardous condition is to review all comments received on that again we received two comments from Columbia River Keepers and Friends of the Columbia Gorge we've received copies of those these comments mirror arguments made when the certificate holder initiated instruction on September of 2020 um where they alleged um that the site certificate should be terminated at that time for failure to comply with all pre-construction um and for failure to obtain the 1200 C permit prior to Construction we brought those issues to you in September August and September of 2020 we evaluated those issues we did not agree with those allegations and then that issue has been basically circling in Circuit Court ever so I'm just just so so River Keepers but the rodent that Council should require that the rodent Bridge be removed because the facility was constructed illegally in the first place and then friends offer the council does not need to approve this retirement they under terminate the site certificate because the site certificate has already as we noted in the draft final order as your proposed reasoning for dismissing these comments as those really aren't related to whether the full post retirement plan restores of the site to a usable on hazardous condition um also want to point out that the certificate holder did respond to these uh comments and also um note that the issue about whether they had a 1200 C per member to construction was fully resolved they uh executed a settlement agreement in addition to EQ would not be able to terminate the state certificate if there's any any pending violations that the water um so certificate holder beliefs and issues have been resolved they also described that removing the Virgin Road at this point would be more impactful than just sleeping okay so now is your first step of two if we get to step two you have two options you can either approve the retirement plan as proposed by the certificate holder or you can improve the plan with thank you Sarah are there questions for Sarah at this time seeing their questions is anyone prepared to make the motion Madam chair for the record top comment so if you agree uh that essentially the final retirement plan should be the final retirement plan as proposed then the order is actually a student so we'll be two votes would be one vote to both prove that in Germany we only you",

        "text": ", Marion county has to adhere to the conditions that are installed specifically for this use at this location. Thank you. Thank you, Ken. Okay, we're going to bring it back to the board and bring it for discussion. It makes sense to me right now. They're on three acres and it's a special use permit. So that layer of protection is there? Absolutely. If they don't hold up to it, then they'll lose it. So I think you're making a motion then, yes, I am. I knew you were. Yeah. I, Jerry Lorenko, agree with staff's finding and recommendation. And hereby recommend approval of the special use permit based on the following findings of foundation. Is consistent with the LDC section 282 D and is consistent with Marion county comprehensive plan. Mister Lorenko. And that's the special use permit with the conditions as outlined by staff? Yes, ma'am. Thank you. I have a motion. Do I have a set any honor? Second. The motion for approval. And I have a second. All in. Favorite? Anyone opposed? None. Motion will carry. Remember, everyone, this goes to the county commissioners. They're the ones to make the decision. So make sure you attend the meeting. Also, meeting with the applicant is something that you're more than welcome to do. If the applicant would like to talk to you outside the room. One more 1.7. He's the only one who pulled it. Yeah. Why don't we wait for everyone to clear out first? Yeah. And we can ask. There's a few more people back. I thought everybody's gone. I'm just going to ask this question. Other than William asked for this one to be pulled. Is there anyone else here in opposition to this applicant? Item number one. So then. Then, William, what is the concerns that you have? The concern I have with this particular item is that it proposes to allow commercial and professional offices in residential buildings in these developments. And to give you one example of why I oppose this. I used to have properties in Oak Run. It come before the board. I didn't have any properties there, of course, so I voted in opposition. What the county commission did is approved two residential houses to be used commercially over there. The owner at that time was misrepresenting the facts because they had an office of their real estate office out on the highway and their cable company out on the highway. Their cable company expands not only Oak run, but Pine run. And there was another one, too. So they have businesses that's coming in and out of there to this office building, their real estate office. Also, they sell properties all over the place, not just Oak run. And you're allowing these businesses in buildings that don't conform to public use and handicap. For one, there was three parking lots in Oak Run that was affected by this. They were all maintained with amenity fees. And the owner didn't allow anyone to use the one parking lot any further that accessed the shuffleboard. And that. I mean, Oak run is a gated over 55 community. So you got some elderly people. Now they have to walk long distance to use that facility. The other two parking lots. They took over a portion of each one of them. One of them was for parking for their cable office. The other one was commercial. They have commercial vehicles there. And there was no stipulation as to what they could and couldn't put on there. They have a fleet of trucks and vans there. But also there was nothing said they couldn't put trenching machines, end loaders, all kinds of excavators, everything else on that property. So do you really want this text to read that they can take use residential buildings for commercial and professional use? I mean, it seems like you're opening up a can of worms here, Mister Heller. I remember that situation that you're talking about, and I'll tell you, it's a matter. In my opinion, it was a matter of opinion what you want to say. Both of those structures were right there off of the one of the main roads. It made a lot of sense, unless you were just in the community and you had hard feelings about it. The parking lots were kind of the same thing. That parking lot across the street. I sat and listened to the arguments and I said, you gotta be kidding me that you're complaining about this in your. And I'm gonna be quite frank. Cause there's not a lot of people here, and you're on our board. I thought it was out of line that anybody would even. I mean, it's not out of line. You have the right to complain. But it was like, my goodness, what are you all complaining about? It made no sense to complain about what? The war? They had been there a long period of time, especially the real estate office, to say, hey, you can only have an office here in Sal Oak run. How much I own and off a real estate company. You don't have a lot of traffic coming in. You have very little traffic coming in and out. You have your people that work there. So, you know, with that one in particular, I voted against Oak run and on that. And I think, if I'm not mistaken, this board voted to allow them to stay there. I don't know if you guys remember that or not, but no, the board voted to not. This board voted not to allow it. And it went to the county commission. If the rest of them didn't, I voted to allow it to stay there. It wasn't like. And you're coming in and kind of, to me, representing in the neighborhood that wasn't in the neighborhood. I mean, it was in the neighborhood, but it wasn't deep into the neighborhood where we were coming in. It was right there on the main street just one block in. Sure, they might have used that to come in and just come in one block and turn it into those two facilities that had been there for an awful long time, as I remember, and been there. So I don't know that we have. And to bring that back up to. There are a lot of times that it's important. And that real estate company, that was a perfect spot for it, and the people that lived right next to it didn't oppose it. If I remember correctly, there was some signage issue that certainly you could argue that fact, you know, the signage of it, but the buildings, they took the signs down, but that was, you know, but. But even the next door later neighbor, she didn't really care for them, but she wasn't going to force them to take it down. So you had the people that are living right there that didn't seem to be affected. That is what most of them. And the county's been pretty darn good staff about. You know, if you're four blocks in and you want to do something like that, that's not my wrong. Did Marion county enter into a settlement agreement that would allow this so I can answer a bunch of those questions? Yeah, because that would be one of those. Currently in the comprehensive plan, there's a policy that allows for neighborhood commercial, which allows for professional offices or anything within our b one type zoning classification, which is restaurants and some retail and stuff like that. So I don't know if you remember, there was a special use permit some years ago that allowed for a real estate office inside a one on low density residential. And that policy was used as part of the justification for the approval. County was sued and part of the settlement was that we would, we, as the county, would clean up that policy. And this is the text to clean up that policy where we're saying part a, professional offices that are on residential land, uses that are attached to or that connect to, that are located along collector roads or arterials, not inside the subdivisions, but they're more on the outskirts because they got a collector or an arterial road that those would be eligible to convert their homes into professional offices. And if by special use permit and if approved, they would have to get site plans and do a commercial development, but it would still have to look residentially. It's much like what you'll see right back here on Fort King street where the homes have converted. And then in part B, is simply taking the commercial allowances within a residential plan unit development and putting that in a comprehensive plan. So that's so there's a connection between the comp plan and the land development code. So does that help? Yes, very much so. Did that help you a little bit? No. Okay. My objection, like I said, is there's nothing to address parking. I don't care if you want to make a building a commercial or professional office and make it look like a house. I don't care. That's not my concern. My concern is the county has allowed, like Oak run to use a residential unit house as a business. No problem there. But then they took over a parking lot. Now you got 80 some year old people that want to walk across the street to attend something at the orchid club auditorium and that. And all their trucks are parked right up front. And like I said, who's going to stop that? There's nothing in here that's saying that. Where are these people going to park this? Visiting these commercial and professional offices. Oak run. I think we really dropped the ball there. I think the county dropped the ball because, I mean, they've taken over part of the main parking lot that's right there by the auditorium, and they practically have taken over the whole parking lot across the street. So these elderly people, I don't know how they're going to get there, but I think that's not good planning, in my estimation. Well, wasn't that parking lot,",

        "text": "so our I started the recording and uh thus begins our rack number two uh I'm kind of anticipating that we'll have one more rack after this which will essentially be a discussion of the outcome of these first two discussions um I'm going to be working with staff over the next week or two to kind of put together a red line reflecting our own concerns and and issues uh along with uh you know what's been raised by the rack so we're going to try to reflect all of that to the best that we can and then we will circulate it to the rack the rack will have a chance to look at that red line provide comments and feedback and then uh the our our next rack will be a discussion of that red line so um the let's see all right so let's let's get start does anybody have any question questions before we get started about how this is going to go or any thoughts or concerns if not I'm going to dive into here still don't see Irene okay all right so can everybody see okay let me make the text a little bit larger is that looks good okay all right I I can't see what you can see okay so the we're just gonna go I just figured we just go through this line by line and then um once we get to the end it depending on how much time we have if people have additional concerns that they had that were that uh or or thoughts uh about how we can improve the contested case rules that are not in this list um then we'll get to those and then once that's done we'll switch to the uh overview of the proposed switch to the uh oah model rules so this first rule uh concern uh was raised both by aren and Jim uh and it deal deals with the kind of clarity around the sufficient specificity uh concept so I think that's commit potentially IR joining us um and the idea here is or the concern as best as I can get it is that it's kind of confusing to participants about what they need to do to kind of Meet the standard and actually you know proceed in a contested case as a uh limited uh or full member so uh I'm curious I didn't really I I don't to characterize the proposal so I was hoping that either Jim or Irene who had ideas about what we could do could kind of share their thoughts about how we could improve the situation so that participants were better equipped to present their case and kind of um meet the standard you know should the facts Merit it um Jim did you want to go first or anybody else who has any thoughts Elaine go ahead um yeah I I I do but um I'm just text U sorry for interrupting I'm just texting Irene she has lost the contact information so I'm texting that to her that's why I'm a little bit absent minded right now okay we'll let we'll let elen go she raised her hand go for it elen hi good morning sorry my camera's not working for some reason but I also think this is of an interest to the applicants or the certificate holder too um because one of the things that I think is is frustrating for all parties involved is that um from an applicant or certificate holder side is that it seems like the bar is really low um that someone can just mention something on the record and then they can argue it fully during a contested case when it hasn't been argued with any level of specificity um and I think you know Irene and Jim may have kind of the opposite view of like not needing to be that robust but from an africant standpoint and I think it the DPO is hearing process is supposed to narrow the issues rather than have the issues explode when you get to a contested case at least that's just my perspective thanks yeah thank you Lane um so it might be helpful for me to kind of before we kind of get through these uh I kind of had a little bit of a Preamble here of kind of the direction and kind of the the kind of the frame of mind that I'm in as I'm approaching each of these issues uh and one of those and the kind of the primary one that I think is important to remember um is that fsac is set up to in a way that if an applicant kind of meets the standards and meets the criteria and jumps through all the Hoops we we have to give out a side certificate I mean it's in the statute so uh I think I think that can be a bit of a a challenging kind of concept for for people to uh grasp you know especially if they're deeply impacted maybe a project is going right near their property or through their property even um perhaps and you know it it's sort of uh can be difficult and I I totally get that but at the end of the day the you know kind of the mode for addressing what projects should be allowed and should not be allowed is was done by the legislature when they set up the standards that we have to kind of abide by uh so FC is not designed to kind of make decisions about what projects should go forward we are a kind of um an a regulatory body that's that's kind of we're supposed to be like a well oiled machine and that machine is supposed to look at data uh uh m match that data to the against the criteria that we've been given and then make a recommendation about about whether or not the data meets the criteria so so in this particular case um yeah I I I would agree with you Elane that uh we should be focusing you know the whole point of this sufficient specificity standard is that we want uh applicants to be able to address the issue uh in the proper time frame and you know I can't I'm not the authoritative person on this but my kind of my feeling on this is that and you know I'd be interested to see if there's any other perspectives the contested case process is is you know no the council's not perfect staff's not perfect and so obviously there can be disagreements about whether or not proper decisions were made but to the extent that someone is concerned about a given standard not being met uh it's optimal to get that addressed at the DPO phase rather than kind of use the the litigious side of things to kind of battle it out if we really want projects to go forward that meet the standards let's let's do that and let's figure out how to resolve that in the most efficient economic way that we can go ahead Jim H thanks um yeah um I have a little bit of a different perspective um sure one is that by the time we get to this point the applicant and staff have gone from the notice of intent through a compl complete application so therefore there's a huge knowledge base that's built up between those parties and the public does not have the advantage of that when it comes time to the public meetings and commenting with sufficient spiiv a lot of the times that information is relatively new and fresh and the people haven't been able to go through and read it to understand all the implications that there could be as you move down the road in the C case now a proposal that I would have is that when a notice of intent is filed um staff do a series of rais requests for additional information of the applicant it would be nice if when a public person files um a contested case request that a similar ra AI is done between staff and the public petitioner this way staff is helping to get that comment in as clean and as clear a form as possible so that we can move forward without the dancing that occurs afterwards trying to include things um one last thought is have some conrete comments to show people um I know in our stop B2 case there was one clear incident where staff and Council refused um an issue but the council upon meeting knew what it was and felt that the individual commented in sufficient spiv so kind of a couple of things to un unwrap there is the footing is not equal moving into a contested case staff helps the applicants sort out their issues so it's clear staff should do similar for the public that are filing for a contested case and that there should be you know adequate time for people to that thanks so um there there was a lot there um and sorry there was somebody else who raised hand I didn't catch that was that was me but yeah that was me goad but if you got more to say I can I can wait no no no go go no I you know I I would support Elaine's comments and then um as a as a would just add to that that you know anytime that an applicant has to go through a contested case there's additional cost in time that all all ends up costing everybody money and those just add to the cost of whatever the rate base is going to be paying for that particular facility and so you know I think keeping that in mind as well and understanding what you said Tom about how this is you know you guys are there to help facilitate us to get a application and final order in a way that minimizes impacts to whether it's environmental for for the community all at the same time while supporting energy infrastructure is very critical okay uh sorry uh Jim did you raise your hand again um I did but I also see Sarah's got her hand up so um let her kind of add to the discussion before yeah it's really it's not it's kind of hard to see who's got their hand up go ahead Sarah thanks Tom um this is Sarah esterson with the Department of energy um I just wanted to tee off of your idea Jim about staff kind of evaluating comments received on the DPO um I mean I view that as a a fairly formal uh process to take forward but what about opportunities where you know like people feel comfortable of calling the department and talking to staff about concerns they have and help you know like that's what the analysts that's what our team is there to do to help the public navigate information know where to go to look to find certain technical details or better understand conditions or like is is um efforts by Department staff to make it clear that we are there during that DPO comment period or at a completeness information meeting to answer questions about how to comment effectively I mean does that those exist now so I guess the question would be what are the barriers from your perspective of achieving your idea through those that existing um well a a lot of it is I think the initial lack of understanding of the process fear of um asking a",

        "text": "70 and so from a financial perspective it strikes me that we by conditioning this project as we have suggested here we are putting oregon taxpayers as the should something happen it might not be likely but it could happen and certainly given the changes in energy per generation um just everything that's going on in in energy and what i would like to see here right now the added language what in red in the document is the department shall review the five year idaho power would be obligated to do a five-year report and i would like the report to be annual or i'd like to see it as an annual report and in addition that um or at any time required by the council should something happen bankruptcy some event that would um cause us concern in terms of the the conditions we put on that thing they obligate taxpayers of the state to be that backstop i'm uncomfortable so i i would like us to retain the ability to always um come back and say we need a bond to speak to the wrist risk cindy i'm i'm not clear on what you're asking are you asking that the five year be changed to one year that's what i'd like to see an annual report i'm pretty sure that a public company has to do an annual financial report and i don't think that would be a burden to the organization but additionally that we would have the right at any time to require information and should that information suggest more risk than we had intention of here that we could additional security at any time a chair this is perry chocto and for the record um a one dollar bond it just doesn't seem practical to me something on this level of cost and this year level of of making profit uh a dollar is kind of strange i hope i'm able to talk about it sorry if i'm not any other council discussion where's the rest of the council on can can i ask a clarification this calendar whether can i ask a clarification question so making it annual and then or at any time counsel requests was that specific to the information that is specified in this report are you saying that you want a different information the examples you gave of fire or risk so that may increase the bond amount that those are kind of out of the scope of what was covered in this five-year report when council reviewed when we discussed this at the review of the dpo like you on your onset of your comments of just like well technology changes we want to know what's happening out like it with the grid and with technology and that's where this came from with the five years being a reasonable time that maybe something would change but i i just if with what you were asking with those examples that you gave to me those are not this is like technology and those are like risk things yeah those weren't examples for me of information it's financial information what what we're doing is saying you don't have to provide um security this is councilmember condon for the we're willing to take that risk ourselves and i'm uncomfortable with our doing that it's not us it's the taxpayers of the state of oregon and it's a financial report that would tell us i mean i quite frankly i'm not really sure what's intended here by a five-year report if financial like i thought that to be a financial report and maybe you were thinking just very differently i mean as i read it i was thinking financial report well it's like a i well this is the physical condition of the facility evolving transmission or electrical technologies the facility's performance in the context of the larger power grid certificate holders oh general financial condition including the certificate holders credit rating at that time it's the financial report i'm focused on right in the end it's their financial ability to do what we want them to do for retirement and giving us the financial assurance and i i don't see financial assurance here so other than that regulated utility and have been in business for 100 years there are risks that we may not have any idea what those will be so this is hanley and the burden really here is i mean the information is being provided by the idaho power but the burden is on the department to evaluate that five-year plan and include any other additional information as it's listed here in order to do that i'm not uncomfortable with the information that's being provided because i you know i think it does the certificate holders general financial condition and the department is evaluating that as a part of that report that they receive from idaho power i'm not sure that it's necessary every year that's i guess is my concern everyone's muted again so i can see this the edition thanks todd yeah there's just a little bit of a lag here so i'm just trying to pull it up do you mean this right here right there okay so i guess my my concern is we are talking about a transmission line we're not talking about the solar facility or we have no examples our testimony is there no transmission lines that have been taken down at least from what i'm seeing here i think what is being required in the report and by the department's evaluation every five years is going to is adequate the record todd cornette and the reason i want to scroll through so you can see the full condition on the screen is it does come to council so it's not just the count the staff's review it's the staff's review and then the council will consider whether the bond is required at that point in time so it's not just us it is council you know ultimately we're making our recommendation to you but you make the decision at that point in time whether it's every five years or if you want to change it to some other frequency yeah right and just in response to that this is council member condon five years is a long time when things go wrong and so i five years if we want to keep the five years that's fine as long as i would like to see something that says we have the opportunity at any time to ask for financial for for this information and make decisions accordingly not really asking for anything up front for a pretty large project and i would like to see us as having to analyze the situation as situation changes so it's proposed at five years now councilman condon's suggesting that stay the same i guess at five years or any time if the council were to deem necessary to other than at the five-year interval where's the council on that so you do it after that first underline the end or any time requested by the department i don't i don't have a problem with that that's this is handling i don't have a problem with that other counselors uh this is jordan cindy are you asking for the complete report at any time or just the financial report upon request financial condition well i would say the complete report because we're trying to make we'd be trying to make a decision based on a changing set of circumstances top foremost in my mind is the financial would there be an event that would trigger that or just at random upon request which i were smart enough to project what all of the instances are but there certainly are instances we've seen in the last five years that have transmission lines power generators other council members wanna let us know your support or not of this proposal sure how this is anne byer for the record um i'm torn on this because i i think it's reasonable to have the big bond during and then to have a lesser bond uh during initial operation i like that there's the kick in at 50 years it is a changing world and having the ability to adjust the bonding and i i understand um idaho power's position and they need some certainty because they have to go in and ask for raids making sure that they maintain their financial health and and it doesn't strike me that this council is going to ask for information just for the sake of having another report to review it would be some changing circumstance that would would trigger that request so i'm supportive of that additional that the department or the council can request that the specific information as necessary or when needed counselor truett i'm i'm torn as well i i'm i'm comfortable with five years i i don't want to necessarily counselor mcconnell and i understand completely where you're coming from but i also don't want to arbitrarily maybe it's not arbitrary but on unforeseen events open the door to what could turn into annual reports upon request it's a burden on both sides of the i think there should be some sort of qualifier potentially in there but again i'm pouring on counselor top tech i'm also torn on it too but um we have we have no way of knowing what the future brings it might be enough just to put in the wording that uh upon request we get the report upon request vice chair how if i yeah i don't want to overstep here but i may have a suggestion that uh from contract language that because i think i've heard the concern expressed that we don't want a future council to act arbitrarily um now ordinarily you know um there are protections against doing that in you know your kind of administrative this is the way that the statutes that govern citing work there's this concept that the site certificate is a contract and so it binds the council just as much as it binds the you know if there is a concern about a future uh council acting arbitrarily well you know because you've put in kind of carte blanche to rest request report wherever uh whenever um you know a typical thing that you'll see in contract language is just as you know the council may reasonably require you know that there's some kind of concept that you you can't just ask for this just because um you need to you need to have a stated basis for it and that would you know put things more in line with the notion of how the council has to conduct itself in you know its regular decision making that she even when you have discretion you don't have discretion to be arbitrary you you have to provide reasons for what you're doing so i you know because you're right you predict all potential future circumstances in which um you with hindsight you might want to see a piece of information and so that's a tool that we'll sometimes use to try to hedge against that as is you know provide some comfort to the other party that we're not just going to ask for it for fun which i can't imagine imagine anyone doing anyway but you know but that you still have the ability to get the information if you thank you um with that i think i'm on board too so i think there's a consensus there",

        "text": " for two years five years is there a permanency related to to this right it's a it's a one time 5,000 square feet on that site so you know presumably if the applic know somebody potentially would not have to take all their full 5,000 I suppose on their first request um they could identify a smaller area and come back in for additional like expanding that area later um but the intention is that it's it's it's a one-time as if it were an exemption but it's got the type one approval um Again by way of a a means of tracking that decision and then does that follow through to a second owner of the property yeah it the approvals follow the land um would you go to slide 39 39 that's it thank you um I wasn't understanding how this um first you identify a certain area and then within that area the tree canopy covers okay I I had one other question um could you talk a little bit about es and where that came from and does it have a history of working well and I know it's in Oregon law so but I'd like to know more about it you're absolutely correct that that is a requirement of um goal five and the U organ administrative Rule and so it is a requirement and it's a it's a process it doesn't dictate a specific outcome it asks local governments when going through that process to balance those considerations um to look it's a very multifaceted and complicated question because it asked you to look at the choices to allow limit or prohibit a conflicting use within the natural resource um in light of the consequences to the you know Economic Consequences the social consequences excuse me social consequences the environmental consequences the energy consequences right so we have multiple consequences to consider we have multiple conflicting uses we have uh various possible outcomes so that multivariate an Anis is um dictated by the O but it does not say what that outcome will be it doesn't say there is this specific outcome that you a local government must reach and so uh it talks about you know one can group conflicting uses which you notice we have done that to try and simplify the analysis grouped like uses conflicting uses um you can look at groups or types of um resources which we've also done um and so those things are all allowed under the process um it goes five does tell us it doesn't have to be long and complicated well I'm sorry to interrupt but I'm wondering when was this process created you know oh that's a great question I think probably in 96 when when the O so it's specific to Oregon is it or oh we had oh well guess original the division at that time so maybe um with with the with the framework of the great question yeah so we are you know it's I would say it is distinct although it is not entirely dissimilar from a NEPA process at the federal level or if you were in Washington you California so there are other processes out there not exactly framed like rece but they do ask local governments to consider those kind of things so entirely disimilar okay does it work well it is a challenging uh process but very thorough and it's meant to be very thorough thank you commissioner Rosenberry thank you chair um can you give an example I'm I'm kind of struggling with we have option one that's the expected path can you give me an example of when this discretionary path would be utilized and how often we think we're going to deviate from option one well that that is a really good question um so we obviously the um County needs to provide a clear and objective path and we feel we've done that our Hope was that that would work for the majority of situations that Mo you know again it's hard to know but uh we were hoping that we wrote something that would work for the majority of situations so say 56% at least uh option two is a what I would call a limited discretionary path in that it could still potentially be something that could be done as part of a type two decision um but does because it does involve discretion it involves notice it has other requirements we go with the discretionary decision um I think that might be usable in some circumstances especially where an applicant has already is intending to set some land aside for example as a part of their development and that it it makes sense for them to do that and it may be they find that less honorous than doing the treat inventory recognizing that we did hear from the development community that the tree inventory could be an expensive item and so this is gives them an option to not have to do the tree inventory it delivers a result that's a little bit more similar to what you have today by way of protecting area and that you know like it protects a and area versus protecting trees with in an area um option three is um out is there where these other two options don't work it doesn't make this isn't a a good C this type of project is not a good or this type of um regulation is not one that makes sense for a variance so if somebody can't meet the clear objective standards can't for whatever reason option two does not work on their site we wanted an option that would provide kind of the alternative to going through some sort of variant because it's tailored to Natural Resources it's looking at specifically resour so it is if you think of option three think of that as the safety valve that is there if the other two don't Cher Lockwood if I could interject we're hearing from U members in our Zoom audience that they're having a hard time hearing our speakers so if you could move the microphone much closer to your face thank you commissioner Monte Blanco and I'm sorry I um missed your hand earlier oh you're good um uh stay on slide 39 please uh really appreciate all the visuals that helps my brain this probably seems silly to some to do this but I I really appreciate it um for these percentages that you're talking about the 25 to 30 the 55 to 60 is one of those required by title 13 I I think the the background of my question is like how do we come up with these exact percentages um so uh the 25 to 30 so it's 30% of the significant habitat in the um pre the older ugb expand uh pre-2006 ugb areas right so um if you think of that as kind of the original area um and if the reduction to 25% is there to encourage applicants to select sites um tree canopy preservation areas that are um adjacent AB budding a um repair in area so they there is a a a reduction to encourage or incentivize that selection so in order to keep that connectivity so that that reduction so that's also the case with the 55 to 60% the percentage were based on a a looking back at what the county had done previously what was uh considered in kind of like what's kind of been a typical practice also looking at again these need to be at least as protective as the clear and objective path so we were balancing that factor as well um the selection of 55 to 60% in the post 2005 ugb expansion areas was based on looking at the levels of protection that are provided by title 13 the county needs to be substantially compliant the measure of substantially compant is based on looking at things like the title 13 model ordinance what level of protection does that provide and then how does this compare and so that's what we were looking at when we were trying to identify the percentages okay I think it's connecting to the dots I might have some followup questions in an email but I appreciate that very much commissioner Kaiser to commissioner Mont Blanco's Point uh or or at least to add to this question I think the second part of that is the question about how is 25 to 30% 55 to 60% 75% uh determined uh it's not so much determined by the county that's the standard that's set by the county it's actually going to be determined more than likely by a development applications uh consulting firm that goes out and looks at what the tree canopy is and determines whether or not that percentage is correct or not right would that typically be what would would occur well I think that in this case the applicant will be submitting a report saying we've identified this area where qu where it is demonstrating that they've met the criteria to be a let's say they're going to go for the 25% they're in the uh pre2 2006 ugb area they say okay we're going for the 25% here's the dis we there's a requirement of of the distance that they must abut a repairing area in order to qualify so they demonstrate that they've met that they uh identify the area showing that it's mathematically 30% or excuse me 25% of the total um habitat on the site excluding the reparan habitats with the um its Upland excluding that reparan that's in the Clean Water Services boundary um and then within that you're you're correct I mean they'll be demonstrating that they have either 75% of the canopy that's already present or they will be showing that they have a planting plan they'll be submitting a landscape plan that shows the plantings and the um time frame in which they will be achieving that 75% canopy coverage and I used the wrong term I said just because of my job I said development application but if somebody was just trying to show this whether it was a development application or not in the type one application they would need to have uh something more than them just saying it satisfies it I mean they've got to have some sort of consultant or somebody who says oh yeah that works that's the right amount it's there right I mean that's kind of how we do that am I am I am I accurate in saying that this would be a part of a type two application so this is this is not the yeah so this would be coming in with a development application in most cases I think you are correct and and to my to commissioner mon Blanco St U question and I I don't directly know what her concern was but from my perspective it does add a layer of more expense in the future on each in particular or in each development application that might occur it's probably not avoidable but nevertheless it does add another expense that you'll need to get another consultant or it'll be part of the Consulting Group you're working with will charge you",

        "text": " and the public are informed and supported and that they're able to participate in federal funding opportunities where possible and where internal resources allow we hope to provide technical assistance to build community capacity and support Grant recipients there's actually a position and a program funded in the governor's budget to help us do this we're working across agencies to leverage expertise and support historically underinvested work to further energy and climate goals and to provide other community benefits and we're also trying to take advantage of high priority funding opportunities while ensuring quality work that puts every available dollar to its best use and with that we'd like to pause and ask you does this ring true What's missing do you have a reaction to you're welcome to put any thoughts you have in the chat or raise your hand and we will call on you to share your and I will give it some awkward silence while we're waiting for folks to either type or raise their hands um Janine now just could fit in the chat a reminder that you can just type right in there if you have thoughts and these really are helpful for us to go back to with each new funding opportunity that comes out as we're putting together our application or we're thinking you know there are so many opportunities and we know that we're not going to be able to take advantage of every single one um it's a bit overwhelming but this these guiding principles and then the the sort of feedback and comments from the public and interested parties that we've heard throughout our engagement is really helping us determine you know how we're going to use this money okay so thank you comments in the chat here and a question one is um an idea that should be uh always including goals of leveraging other dollars or enable some sort of rating of funds to get those outcomes and then there's a question about number the fourth bullet and whether Odo is partnering with state agencies only or if non-profit um Partnerships could be explored as great questions um yes and yes and I think those two are related because we know there's so much great work happening within other state agencies and from non-profit and and other partners in the state and we want to make sure that we're building on that and we're leveraging that work to get even more federal dollars our way so actually in a few slides towards the end I'm going to talk about a specific area of collaboration that we have been doing with Oregon Housing and Community Services and Energy Trust of Oregon looking at the federal funding coming for uh home Energy Efficiency upgrades and Electric Appliance rebates and that is an area where as we put together the application and design the program we're going to be relying heavily on advice and guidance from other entities in the state public and private who work on those things already great there's one other um comment in the chat about wondering about Community benefit and targeting highest risk reductions another good question that we are working on specifically as it applies to the grid resilience funding so Rob Del Mar is on the line introduced himself as being odo's Point person putting together an application for funding that will come through Odo that we would then distribute to utilities and others to work on grid resilience making the grid more resilient against Natural and and man-made disasters and one of the things that we have to do in that application is really to articulate how are we determining the greatest Community benefit and how are we targeting um risk reduction and so that's uh something that we've asked and have been working with our Utility Partners on and we'll be having a public hearing on our potential approach I think next month so that's information on that will come at the end of the um end of the presentation then I see from Kathy about um approach using to coordinate with tribal governments hi Kathy so glad you're here from Warm Springs um one of the things that we do and I'll let Janine and Jen weigh into is that we try to use both formal and informal channels to work with both um the the tribal councils the elected tribal councils that may be interested in sending sort of formal notification and opportunities to coordinate as well as more informal reaching out to staff through the legislative Commission on Indian Services as well as sort of you um just sharing information as we have it out from a staff to stop level but we're really open to whatever approach works best for each individual tribe so if um there's suggestions Kathy we would love to hear what would work best for Warm Springs Jenner or Janina welcome to add to that um I think that was great Ruchi I would just add with some of the funds that are coming to Odo there's similar funds coming directly to tribal governments and we'd like to um both play an informed role and also technical assistance roll on that because I know tribes have varying levels of resources available to put together applications and really research these opportunities so that's an area that gets to that point about providing technical assistance where we okay uh one more question about plans to collaborate with local governments if um and then kind of uh a more specific one about um uh households looking for Consumer rate later um yeah Ruchi maybe I'd turn the tribal government uh question back to you but maybe I'll I'll start by saying we definitely have plans especially on some of the specific funding opportunities that Jen will talk about in a minute Energy Efficiency and conservation block grants some will be going directly to local governments some will be coming through Oto for the smaller governments I think there will be an opportunity with some of the climate change funding coming through EPA which is available to both the state and local communities and we know that a lot of local governments have climate action plans of their own um so there are definitely plans and we have just brought in a new staff person to help us with this and we're hoping to bring in an additional person um in the near future really to focus on getting the word out there and facilitating work done by local um I think that there's a couple of points about particular funding streams like Holmes and Hera um about Administration maybe we can get to that at that stage I think there's a slide on homes in Hera um unless you want to talk a little bit about Administration um and then some suggestions around for technical assistance also including clear guidance and communication to Oregon households you know even if it's uh information about other state agencies or non-ira resources or incentives yeah great I think uh if it's all right maybe we'll hold those until we get to this specific programs that will address those uh and so thank you for those questions and that um we'll move to the next slide which is uh with all of that context you are probably wondering so what are all of these opportunities and how is Odo tracking and applying for those so the next part of the presentation is specifically focused on opportunities that are related to State energy offices like Odo and for that I will turn it back over to Jen oh nope not yet first I'm going to um this amazing uh chart that uh Jen produced that identifies some of the individual Grant programs that we're tracking at this time so as you can see on the right of the slide of the hundreds of millions of dollars potentially coming to Oregon so far what we've received is two hundred thousand dollars and that is specifically through the state energy program to support the development of an energy security plan um that's I I say that in part to give you a sense that this money even though the bills passed um with Iha over a year ago it takes time to get the money through the federal process and then it will take time to get the money through the state process so I think a lot of folks are working as hard and fast as they can but so far what we've received is two hundred thousand dollars um we also have a pending application submitted for the remaining balance of the state energy program funds that's what SCP stands for under the infrastructure investment jobs Act and there are currently a handful of open opportunities and then many more opportunities to the left-hand side of that slide that are still in planning phases with federal agencies and now I'm going to hand it over to Jen to talk through what those other opportunities are and the timing that we are aware of so far well as Janine shared we have prepared and submitted an application for 5.6 million and funding from the state energy program and the funds from this program will be used to support the Department's energy security planning work it will increase our ability to provide technical assistance to Consumers and communities as well as to facilitate research analysis and programs on Energy Efficiency renewable energy sustainable transportation and resilient Energy Systems following the the time that we receive that final award agreement and so we are hopeful that we will actually receive that award agreement within the next couple of months for that one another opportunity that we are pursuing is seeking funding through the grid resilience formula grants overall we anticipate that Oregon will receive approximately 50 million dollars over the next five years to help make Oregon's electric grid more resilient our application is due to usdoe on March 31st of 2023 for the first two years worth of funding under that program so for this program we will be asking the state legislature for General funds to meet the state match requirement utilities will be receiving this fund through um Odo and potentially others and they will be subject to matching fund requirements as well and so um with this just a note we will also be having a public meeting on this in uh in approximately a month I believe on March 15th but we'll get the date and time shown um on a later slide here all right we are also in the early planning stages for two different rebate programs known as the homes and Hera programs and these can provide rebates for residential upgrades while there's a lot we still don't know about these funds we anticipate we will be submitting an application for them either in the summer or the fall and that the funds will be available in either late 2023 or early 2024 to support these residential upgrades related to to homes we also know that Workforce Development is an important topic right now and we are actively planning to apply for two different grants in support of this need one opportunity to support is related to supporting the training of energy Auditors and the other could support the training of contractors who will be assisting with the implementation of the residential Energy Efficiency upgrades through the homes and Hera programs that I just mentioned Beyond those specific opportunities there may be ways to foster Workforce Development in the course of other projects",

sets and you know in there far the frontier and remote area codes um usda it's kind of how rural are you and it's a they include a map of oregon and um for oregon especially eastern oregon a lot of eastern oregon is um is designated as a extremely remote so it is a good tool for demonstrating if your community fits within one of the the far regions especially those that are very remote that that one's potentially enterprise zones oregon business development department has established these enterprise zones um which are you know these economic development regions um oem office of emergency management has resources and again the idea is just to throw all these out there and try to come up with a list of materials that are truly the cdc social vulnerability index this is one that i think might fit in the category of something that's useful for all of us to think about but maybe isn't something we would include as a resource for oregon communities and that's the california ej great for our internal considerations for where we might get to but maybe not a good resource for an oregon community to submit an fema to consider their resources portland clean energy fund they've kind of placed a trail in a lot of the equity work oregon housing and community services especially their energy burden data that gets to the community level from looking at energy burden utility service area maps may be useful and then odo has a resilience guidebook so that's our list and if you think anything should be stricken or added to that list please let us know thoughts want to share that stan has another item to add to the list that he'll send to us it's uh oem's hazard mitigation dashboard so um sounds like he can provide the handbook and we can share a link to that as well perhaps yeah we did actually just recently develop a handbook on a kind of a how-to guide to simplify the the application process maybe something similar to that for these resources any thought of maybe organizing it in a for easy access for folks to have and that's a great idea and another one of those items that we can develop over time as the project as the program we'll have to have a fairly simple approach for for march of this first release but yeah having them well organized is it seems just as important as the resources themselves so that people can know how to use them hey this is alessandra um i was doing just a quick brainstorm so i'm not sure how helpful these resources would be but for instance the university of oregon is working on developing a wildfire risk assessment map and that should be done this year so that might be helpful to add as a and i was also thinking how the the big investor owned utilities have their wildfire protection plans out and in those plans it indicates um the locations that are most at risk for power shut offs and that might also be an indicator um for the need of these community-based renewable energy projects and to be more energy independent and resilient um and not sure if cous have some sort of like worthy data um on that as well but those were just a couple things that i was thinking about that might be helpful great ideas and yeah please continue to share as um as we this is another one of those items that we need to have in place um for the the march release so please share your thoughts by february 11th and we'll make sure we have a list of resources on the program web with the idea that we can maybe somehow dashboard them in the future to help categorize them and i know so sorry that's alessandra again no go i did submit comments on this part but just thinking about for community resources in general and thinking about maintaining these projects long term is perhaps also providing other funding resources that are available like technical assistance just other opportunities that they could already and know that they are able to have that instead of trying to kind of find it themselves being able to do that for instance the clean energy group has technical assistance grant so like being able to have that as a resource and any other federal or state um grant funding that they'd be able to to look into to sustain these projects in the long term yeah another another great idea that's i think that one is it's almost it's a whole nother category that maybe we missed on here and that is additional resources of funding so great idea all right well we are quickly nearing the end of our meeting and i know that this is this is of course also a public meeting where we allow for some public comment and so we can keep it open past noon for public comment to come in i'll just quickly note i popped it into the chat a little higher up but for those who wanted to give feedback on the or i assume anything we've talked about today to just email you and gave your email address so most of our committee members have that email address it's also available on the rule making page right now for this and i think we asked if folks could get back to us by the 11th because we want to get everything ready to launch the program on time so i just thought i'd verbally share that i'll keep an eye out for hands raised from those that are attendees and might have something they'd like to say and alma pinto has her hand up and when you are unmuted i'll let you know am i gonna get okay why don't we handle the question in the chat and then i'll work on getting alma unmuted is there a way to join the advisory committee um this might be almost question she's trying to ask this is alma from the community energy um the advisory committee membership is described in in house bill 2021 and so we had a essentially a prescriptive list of members that we recruited according to the bill however we have considered having we have considered having you know ex-officio members or other folks that come to meetings when have you know special information that they can share with the group so we are certainly open to all the help we can get and even if we aren't um expanding the advisory committee we certainly want to hear from everyone possible and i don't know do we get alma we're working on it i'm not sure oh there we go now alma's off mute was that your question or did you have anything else to offer alma oh that was your question great okay all right um we'll also one thing we can do is follow up with you too and just make sure that you're getting the emails and then can kathy moy be brought off from you kathy you're nice okay i i just wanted to second elma's uh thing to maybe have associate members or something who get the same mailings and notices that the committee members get as against having to go check keep checking the website to see if things have been posted yeah great and there you can sign up for the email of um kind of project updates and we always do an email blast out to anyone who selects to be you know receive those emails i'm not sure if i've seen that that link i'm keeping it right now kathy i'll put it in the link and it's a lot like i am i imagine you also track the legislature it's a lot like the legislative committee sign ups where you kind of get to pick and choose what you want to sign up for so you might actually have a great time going through there and figuring out what emails you want from us and which ones you don't okay i've done that well you can add so i you might want to look at it and see if you have the community renewable energy project ticks you do okay great then you're getting what these folks are it's nice to have some more uh folks jumping in to help so yeah it's nice to nice to see the anyone else i don't see any other hands coming up or any other questions in the chat and pandy and i i saw that you came on screen did you have any thoughts that you wanted to share this stuff came on screen all right well thank you all for another very productive meeting that one um i think we got to a lot of really important material in that meeting and you gave some really great feedback so we will take all of this into consideration and we're getting really excited you know we're just a little more than a month to the to the program launch and so get us your thoughts by february 11th and uh thanks again for for helping us thanks rob all righty thanks all thanks everyone",

        "text": "okay to welcome you to our meeting sure thanks michael i wanted to kick off the meeting this afternoon by saying thank you to everybody that's here uh we really appreciate you spending some time with us this afternoon talk about the department of energy and how we can help wildfire survivors with energy efficiency improvements to their we hope that you'll be willing to share your thoughts with us and how we can design a program that works well for the and so with that i wanted to let you know that a number of my colleagues here at the department of energy are online with me uh michael friels michael are going to wave put yourself on camera he's leading our efforts to design and launch the program christy splits here she leads our government relations and uh that's christy and andy cameron who heads up our energy efficiency and conservation team and is working with michael to stand up to program and we've got some other people online also take notes answer questions and make make the process run smoothly so thanks to all of them as well so we're hoping to have a pretty interactive meeting with lots of questions and feedback from attendees a dialogue if you will and but before i turn over michael to walk through how we're going to do all that i wanted to make sure you're all aware that we are being recorded and uh before do that on the next slide wanted to uh especially for those of you that aren't really familiar with oregon department energy i'm going to walk through a what we do at the oregon department energy what you see on the screen is our our vision our mission and how we achieve that mission or the what we do at odo we help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain resilient and affordable energy system we advanced energy solutions to shape an equitable clean energy transition and protect the environment and public health and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for our current and future generation that's our mission so providing support for wildlife to rebuild in a way that saves energy and them money will contribute towards our vision of a safe equitable clean and sustainable energy future it's our hope that this program can help make their lives a little bit easier for the survivors in terms of energy efficiency and paying the bills in the future so i'm glad the energy department can play a small role in that recovery so with that intro i'll turn it over to michael and he'll go over today's agenda and how we can engage and how you can engage in this conversation with us thank you alan i appreciate it so as allen said we're going over our meeting agenda to start so we've got a lot of things we want to cover today and i just want to reinforce what alan says we would like this to be a dialogue so ask questions along the way and we'll talk about ways to do that in just a moment so first we'll talk about the webex platform and how to use it how you can ask your questions we'll talk about the wildfire recovery legislation uh walk you through kind of our process we've had a variety of different community meetings leading to this uh the start of our rule making process and the start this start of our our drafting of rules for this program and our ideas for how we're going to to build this program and and the incentives and how they'll be and along the way we'd love for people to ask questions and provide feedback but at the end we do want to reserve some time to have an open forum and and uh have you know pause for a moment to really listen and give you everyone an opportunity to provide some feedback or ask some questions have a good so using the webex platform so uh right now we're doing a webex event and so what that means is everybody's muted but you can raise your hand so if you see the upper right that you can actually raise your hand if you do so uh christy will will pause me or whoever's speaking and let us know that we have a question or some feedback that we need to get and we will unmute you and then you can provide your question or uh or feedback at that time there's also a q a function to the right where you can type in questions please send it to the entire group so everybody can see it but you can put questions in there or some feedback or your thoughts yeah and if you're calling in i believe it's star three to raise your hand and then we can unmute you that way as well if you're calling it if you're not on the actual webex platform christy can you go over the legislation that's brought us here today of course i can um thank you so much so the legislative session ended uh in june of this year and for pretty much the entire session for obvious reasons discussing how to best help oregonians recover from the wildfires last labor day was a hot topic and house bill 2289 was the outcome of a lot of conversation about how to make it easier for people to rebuild and the places where they had lost homes and the the real goal here was to rebuild uh communities and to help individuals both and house bill 2289 included a provision regarding um energy codes rebuilding to building codes and in oregon we have a rich tradition of every few years developing a more energy efficient building code so the building code from a few years ago was less efficient than a building go topic than a building within a building would be going forward and so as part of this bill there was a decision made to allow people to rebuild to a previous building code which ostensibly might be less expensive for people versus rebuilding to the current code and so as part of that conversation there was a decision made to offer up an incentive potentially to allow to give people some funding to rebuild to the current code even if it cost a little bit more and so at the end of session house bill 5006 passed and that bill had 10 million dollars for the oregon department of energy to develop an incentive program to promote more energy efficient rebuilding of all structures lost during the labor day fires and given the guidance from house bill 2289 we have in part interpreted that to mean that we will help people build to the current uh building code as with the more energy efficient standards that we have in place today than we did in 2008 which is the building code that people could rebuild to under 22.89 hopefully that makes sense thanks okay hey christy uh looking at our program timeline or how do we get from the point of as christy said we got that legislation and actually needing to create a program that we can implement next year so we've had a variety of community meetings focused on a variety of areas around the state impacted by the 2020 wildfires we completed those meetings we heard a lot of great feedback which we'll talk about in just a couple minutes and now we're launching our rulemaking part so this first meeting is the kickoff of our rulemaking we've listened to uh utilities counties advocates community members and we had a very variety of community meetings where we got to listen to a lot of people give some great feedback and now it's time for us to draft some rules and come up with a framework for our program uh and certainly we'll have as you can see in the bottom right we have a public comment portal and certainly you know this isn't the end of the the time for feedback so you can provide feedback now you can provide feedback along the way i certainly recommend signing up for the email updates and we've got a link for that i'll show that as we go later in the we also have a website a variety of different ways that you can uh engage with us and provide feedback uh we would love to hear it and help craft our rules and help us make sure what we create is going to be helpful for a while for our all survivors so to get an idea of kind of the rule-making schedule or process so first we draft rules uh and we submit with the secretary of state so on our end it takes a little bit of work of actually creating the framework for our program and all the rules that go into it um and then we we submit those and and department justice takes a look at and make sure uh they're they make sense legally and they don't create any problems for anybody and then they actually are published and we will have a public hearing uh it looks like in january where we'll have another opportunity for people to provide feedback on those those draft and a comment period to do that and then we'll have final rules that will will lock in and hopefully we're real confident at that point of what they look like and we'll be able to operationalize in february and so our goal is to get this out as quick as we can so that we can start helping people and start cutting checks to people and uh and hopefully a little bit before that we can actually start speaking about the program and doing a lot of the outreach we'll talk about our implementation later in the presentation but it's going to be critical for us to do that as early as possible to try to get the word out and we would certainly appreciate your help to do that overall program objective so just as christie was saying we got some funding and we certainly recognize that a good portion of funding is just getting people to build to our current code so people when people are rebuilding residential and commercial uh how can we help them utilize the energy efficiency of just to get to our current code and how can we incentivize some people to build a little bit beyond that so we are focused on that economic recovery how can we help people offset those costs of building decoder building above code and taking advantage of the budget we have to allocate to where the needs are of survivors so we're trying to focus the budget on on where the greatest needs are and we've heard from a lot of communities certainly single-family residential there's a lot of need there and manufactured homes that were destroyed and so we want to make sure we're focused on those different building types and recognizing that we need to treat them a little the owners are different and they're in a variety of different situations so we treat residential structures commercial structures manufactured homes differently and make sure we're coming up with custom solutions that can work for everybody as much as we can and how can we use existing systems at the county level with local jurisdictions or utilities or within our other state state agencies like housing",

        "text": " me on the other side of that in implementation phase um and just would love to think about you know future opportunities whether it's at that scale of the the task force level or you know right sizing it for a given need um but to replicate that I think um it's it's just it was very uh exciting to be a part of and uh all the more exciting to be uh seeing those policies uh become realized um I also wanted to maybe build on um uh the previous comment that I think the policy outcomes from the task force are very much a shining example of um how the state and can think about both climate mitigation and Emissions reductions and resilience at the same time um you know buildings are be a perfect example of um that that Nexus in terms of both their contribution to our emissions but also the role that they serve in protecting people and families from climate impacts and climate pollution um but I think that really you know applies kind of across sectors so really thinking about um as the state moves forward with you know implementing the policies in the the road map to 2030 and and Beyond um how we can uh think creatively about policy Solutions that both support Oregon in achieving our climate targets but also um be proactive and thoughtful about protecting communities from the impacts we're already experiencing it that we will continue to woren so um the last thing and I think get to uh our later agenda item around agency budgets but um definitely curious um to have and interested to have conversation around um cheero R how implementation is going but also what else um is needed to make sure that we stay on track I think um the One-Stop shop and Community Navigator um for Odo to help you know make sure that these incentives for households and consumers are as accessible as possible is a really incredible start um and you know hopefully we'll have more funding coming down the pike from cprg and um there was just a big announcement around the Ira's greenhous gas reduction fund that includes incentives for building efficiency electrification so I think also say the need in terms of making these incentives um accessible um by the folks who we hope will benefit from them will be only continue to grow so just thinking about what those how we can best support our agencies um in continuing to do the great work they're doing and expand on it um through providing the the resources and Staffing that will help them um excited to dig in thank you commissioner after any other comments that or questions well thank you again for uh presenting to us thank you for all the incredible work you do for the for your constituents in the state of Oregon um it's uh really great to hear more about um all the incredible things that are being accomplished through those through your efforts so thank you well thank you it's delightful to be here with all of you I'm just I just keep looking around this room at all the um the experts and the people that I email on a weekly basis and I want to thank you for your contributions all over the place thank you okay let's see where are we going um well uh we are now going to uh hear from some of the um agencies that are involved in this kind of work um director staly and director Bell uh are joining us from the Department of Consumer and business services and director of or excuse me Department of Housing and Community Services so welcome you are uh two of our newer agency additions to the commission and we um wanted to try and get to know some of the new agencies that are working on CL action in Oregon so with that I am happy to turn things o over to director stolie if you want to get us started and then over to director Bell be happy to uh good afternoon uh commission thank you very much for the invitation to be here uh my name is Andrew suie I'm the director of the State's Department of Consumer business consumer and business services dcbs I'm also the state insurance commissioner uh I've got a a short uh presentation I've got some slides um uh which I will kind of help guide it through um but really just going to talk a little bit about who we are and what we do kind of introduce our large multifaceted agency to this group and really hone in on three areas uh our insurance related work our building codes work which you've already heard a lot about so I'll be really short on that uh as well as the worker safety and health uh rules and enforcement activities that that we do so if you go to the next slide please uh so this is just an overview of who we are so you could see there's a lot of different parts to our agency we are the state's largest consumer and worker Protection Agency have about a thousand staff members and offices around the state uh responsible for a lot of things uh from compensation uh to insurance supervision uh and again I'm really just going to focus on on three areas so Oregon OSHA so that's our the state's workplace safety and health uh division uh we're one of about 22 states that have a state OSHA program uh Washington and California have state programs as well so we put out rules and regulations around worker safety and I'll talk about two of them in in a few minutes here uh we also have our building codes division I'm really happy to be joined by Alana Cox she's here today to answer any questions that any of you have it's a a very technical complex area that she does an amazing job leading but that that work is uh pretty complex as I said uh we've got seven different codes that we're responsible for so we are unique Oregon in a lot of ways we do have a single Statewide code uh seven codes actually each code has its own Governor appointed Senate confirmed board uh we do have a specific energy board uh that's responsible for evaluating and approving State building code standards and rules relating to Energy Efficiency and other related areas all of those codes are updated every three years have to be agreed to by the board and by us uh and we are unique in that we not we're one of the only states that has a single Statewide code cities and counties then are responsible for helping to implement that review plans Etc uh but uh we call it a mini Maxi code because the code can't be changed and by any city or county across the state so it helps really promote uniformity and consistency predictability across the state uh and last our our division of financial regulation that's the state's financial sector supervisor uh specifically where the insurance supervisory uh function sits and if you turn to the next page that's where I'll start and just share a couple things about the work we do uh as insurance Regulators uh the first is we work very closely with all of our state partners and specific I think this group would be interested in the the Wildfire activities uh you know so we I got to travel the state last year I'm going to do it again this year with our friends at the Department of Forestry and the State Fire Marshall's office talking about the state Wildfire risk map uh and insurance implications of that um uh we uh also uh been pretty active on the legislative front and uh representative Marsh has been an amazing partner and Advocate when it comes to Wildfire related insurance issues uh last year we we did introduce uh Senate Bill 82 which had some consumer protections and reforms um just I'll mention it had a couple elements too I I i' just point out to this group uh ones around consumer disclosure so probably seen in in Wildfire High wildfire areas people get a notice that their insurance policy is not being renewed their premiums are going up uh and uh unfortunately there's not usually a lot of information and explanation around that so starting this year because of our bill insurance companies uh have to give property specific reasons for those decisions and and the purpose there is to let that property owner know exactly why an insurance company might not be renewing might be raising rates due to Wildfire issues and then give them some information about things they can do to mitigate and respond to those risks and make their property more insurable uh and the second thing is you know Property Owners the state are is are investing a lot of money time and resources into property and Community level mitigation activities we think those should be uh given credit by insurance companies so this Law requires uh those companies uh in their underwriting and rating plans so they're you know the things that govern the decisions they make whether it's to issue renew and about rates so they have to reflect how that urer addresses or considers Wildfire risk mitigation actions such as home hardening defensible space and Community risk reduction uh and the last thing on that is commun consumer education we we we spent a lot of time educating and empowering consumers on what they can do to help make maybe make their property more insurable or if they get a notice from their insurance company uh respond to that the next is uh around insur solvency and Market participation um we one of our primary responsibilities is to make sure that insurance companies remain solvent so that they can pay claims when they come due uh one I think interesting new thing that we're doing around that uh we uh participated along with California and Washington conducting a first ever climate risk stress test of insure Investments so stress testing is a common thing that financial institutions around have been doing for decades this is the first time that uh there was a climate related stress test uh there's a report uh online it's called The Hidden cost of delaying climate action for West Coast Insurance markets uh we we found that uh companies that do not have effective long-term plans in face in place would faed higher costs if there was a transition shock uh from uh you know quick move move away from fossil fuel related assets and we placed uh the potential losses in the 7 to 40 billion dollar range just in corporate bonds just in our three states so significant potential impacts and we're going to use that information in those discussions we have and our review of financial solvency with our companies to make sure that they're uh evaluating and planning and taking that into account and the last thing I'll mention on this uh you know I'm really proud of the work we on as a state in really leading the nation uh when it comes to climate resiliency uh the the NC is the National Association of insurance Commissioners it's a a group composed of all the insurance Commissioners across the country we get together to form uh groups and come develop",

Department of energy and I'm here today to moderate our conversation today we're going to discuss the Oregon solar and storage rebate program this program offers rebates to residential customers and low-income service providers who install solar or solar and paired energy storage systems this webinar will be recorded and the slides in the recording will be posted to odo's website after we talk today we'll start with introducing some of the other staff who work at Odo specifically who work on this program and I'll start with James who will lead today's conversation turning it over to you thanks Christine my name is James kogel and I'm a policy analyst here at the Oregon Department of energy I work across several of the agencies incentive programs aimed at increasing Energy Efficiency or the installation of renewable energy thanks thanks James next I'll turn it over to pandian and then to Dale and Katie pandian do you want to say hello yes um hello my name is pandian Krishna Swami I'm energy incentives manager at Oregon Department of energy uh thanks for joining us thanks pandian and then Dale and then Katie and Dale and Katie are the two folks that are sort of the front lines of this program with our contractors and hi my name is Dale veering I am a solar rebate assistant you're muted sorry folks hi I'm Katie with this solar and storage rebate program and I'm also the assistant thanks so much for the work that you two do and being kind of customer the the customer uh customer service experience that I know you both provide really appreciate it all right so moving on to slide two um in case you weren't familiar with our agency I wanted to start with just some brief information about what we do our agency helps oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a reliable resilience and affordable Energy System we advance solutions to shape an equitable clean energy transition protect the environments public health and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for current and future Generations you'll see on this Slide the five broad focused areas of our work and that includes energy programs and activities like the Oregon solar and storage rebate program next slide please today we'll start with some logistics for the webinar before James provides an outline of the program and an update on changes to the program from the recent legislative session James will then give a quick overview of the administrative rulemaking process before before presenting the proposed administrative rule Concepts that we'll be discussing today and hopefully moving forward in the near future with your input and changes according to what we hear from all of you there will be time for questions and for comments at the end though we're fitting I'll grab raised hands or questions and comments from the chat so we'll go on to the next slide a quick note on expectations today um many of most of the people that are on this call are attendees that's you that are here to give your input thanks so much for being here and then the panelists are all Department of energy staff in case you're wondering how that works and if you're an attendee it means you need to raise your hand to participate in on talk or um uh participate via the chat and I'll share how to do that in in just a minute we also just provide some basic Community agreements because we want to make sure that we Foster an inclusive and respectful meeting so um mostly I guess just kind of the bottom line on this is just being flexible and patient if there's any technology issues being respectful of others and I'll also just flag that Patricia Phillips in the chat will be the person that can help with any Logistics issues um Patricia really appreciate all of your behind the scenes work in making this webinar and lots more at our agency happen with that we'll go to the next slide please we know WebEx is sometimes unfamiliar to folks if you're new to the platform I just wanted to make sure you take a minute to familiar yourself with familiarize yourself with how to raise your hand and interestingly interestingly we found that sometimes people what people see in WebEx is different for each person so we put forward a slide here that's what it look we think it might look like for you mine's a little different for example there's a little sort of raised fist that is meant to be like the raised hand button that's down next to a little smiley face for me some people have to click the smiley face to get the little raised fist hand to learn how to raise your hand and then you might also want to open up the chat so that you can see how that works for me the chat is like a um this on this one the chat's already visible for me I have to open it it's like a little quote box or a little quote like call out on a comic strip so take a second and make sure that you understand how to engage via WebEx as an attendee then you'll have to raise your hand or use the chat to participate and if you'd be willing to just take a second I'll wait 10 seconds to give people a chance to let us know if they're having any issues and then we'll move on to the next slide and before I turn it over to James just really quickly I didn't see any um about how would you let us know if you can't raise your hand or chat and now it stick her to me as a serious fallacy in my plan um but but um but I did just want to quickly say that um we encourage you to put in your questions or comments as we go into the chat and I can come back and share those during the conversation or also grab any raised hands so just know that just feel free to go ahead and participate throughout this webinar and with that I'll turn things over to James thanks Christy um so Authority provide uh beginning of the brief outline of the program um the Oregon solar and storage rebate program provides rebates in order to reduce The Upfront costs to the customer for the purchase and installation of solar electric systems and paired solar and storage systems the program requires evidence that the full amount of the rebate is passed on to the customer and only approved contractors are able to access the reservation system and submit rebate reservation requests for residences the system must be installed on real property in Oregon and for residential customers the customer must be owner the own occupant of the low-income service providers are also eligible these are non-residential customers and include specific affordable housing the owners of systems that benefit affordable housing community service organizations who serve low or moderate income individuals or tribal or local government entities providing services to low or moderate individuals or who provide emergency shelter or Communications in disaster situations examples of organizations that have been received funding include Habitat for Humanity chapters Boys and Girls Club chapters Federal housing House Bill 3409 extended the sunset of the Oregon solar Plus Storage rebate program to January 2nd 2029 uh that's the end of the end of the session Bill also included an additional investment of 10 million dollars in the program existing language in the urban laws required that a contractor purchase construct and install a paired solar and storage system together has both 3409 amended the language and requires that only the purchase need occur at the same time while installation may occur separately the solar electric system and mg storage system still be paired once fully installed this change will go into effect at the start of 2024 and we're doing some rulemaking process right now to kind of update our rules following this change so that um we can be prepared in the new year are there any questions um we do have a question in the chat perfect timing as we head into talking about the proposed rules Angela Crowley cook from the Oregon solar and storage Industries Association is wondering if there's been any changes to the proposed rules since the last webinar uh so no there's been no changes to the proposed rule amendments from the first webinar um we will kind of just provide some additional uh background information um we've had questions so for instance we'll provide an outline of the program and well but um yeah there's no actual changes to that what we're proposing to uh changing the rules from the first I don't see any other hands raised with questions about the program that's designed or with the legislation changed okay okay thanks so a quick uh high-level summary of the rulemaking process so we did we start off with stakeholder consultation and after considering all the feedback and drafting the rules based on that feedback we can we file them with the Secretary of State uh this kicks off another comment period during which we seek additional feedback on these uh draft rule language and its impacts we review and consider all this information and then finalize the rules and then file those final rules with the secretary of state only then uh will the rules become effective this process can take a varying length of time and for this rulemaking we anticipated taking approximately four to six months but that may change so we're proposing changing the definition of paired solar and storage system to align with the recent legislative changes this will just reflects what the the legislation says um this will require only the purchase of a paired solar and storage system to occur at the same time via installation may be done separately the requirement that the solar electric system and energy storage system be purchased together is a requirement established in the legislation the legislation does not allow for a storage only rebate for people interested in adding stories to existing we had heard that there were delays associated with the the shipping and installation of storage and want to hear whether they are still occurring and which of the options would be most effective at reducing the impact of those delays the options being considered include permitting the solar incentive portion of the rebate to be claimed separately from the storage portion following installation of the solar system and proof of its completion this would include passing inspections from The Authority having jurisdiction this should also mean tweaks to how the rebates are processed in power collect the software contractors used to place reservation requests the reservation would continue to count as one of the contractors reserved projects and put until completion of the storage portion of the the reservation another option would be to extend the time that the reservation for paired solar and storage is valid for uh this would allow time for the storage to be a third option could be to increase the number of reservations a contractor can have at a time for systems for residential customers who are not low on moderate income this could allow",

topics that jump out to you that should certainly be on our list and i think we'll give folks about a minute and a half to enter your responses here and as a reminder if you are feeling pressed for time or you want to think about it more you can feel free to respond to these same questions on our portal on our website okay let's keep it open for about 30 more seconds so people can enter their short responses okay you've got about 10 more seconds to finish your response and press send and stacy go ahead and close the bowl all right thank you we've got some really good responses here aligning and combining with existing promoting these wins for oregon as we finish the projects maximizing climate and environmental justice benefits large building systems maintenance and replacement program concerned about permitting assessment work that will delay projects um encouraging us to advocate for expedited timelines great yep thanks so much really appreciate this feedback okay and with that we actually have a secondary question which is what is the most important thing that odo could invest in to support your energy needs and interests so once again just looking for a short answer that can give us some real time feedback and we'll have this open for about a minute and a half as well but renat is saying the pull didn't open um maybe try popping it out the little square with an arrow coming out of it to the right i think that worked for tim last time and if you can't get it to open renata you're welcome to put in the chat what you think is the most important thing that odo could invest in okay jen should we give them a 10 second okay wrap up what you're writing and we're going to close out the okay we've got some good priorities in there multimodal transportation to support communities investments that our win-win helping companies accelerate their internal decarbonization efforts apprenticeship programs augment the community renewable energy program funding with an eye towards combining resilience and disaster preparedness from a clean energy battery storage efficiency all really for this federal funding thank you for all right so some of you might be wondering why we're having this conversation now why not wait until we have all of the specific details about each federal funding opportunity when they well it's mostly about helping us be ready we anticipate that with most federal grant opportunities we won't know the exact date when the announcement will be made but once it does we anticipate that we'll likely have 60 calendar days to respond with a full application even then it's possible that some technical details about the fund could be modified even within that short application period we are also anticipating that some of our most flexible funds the ones where your input can help shape our plans the within the confines of the federal rules might be among the first opportunities that are released and so we want to be able to respond with the opportunities we believe will um benefit most oregonians in in the biggest way and so that's why we're we're seeking your input today now while 60 days may sound like a long time in the scope of preparing a federal grant it can go by in a blink each grant application basically has three phases one phase where we need to review all the technical requirements and documents to apply to determine if we should move forward on an application the second phase is where the planning scoping budgeting and writing all occurs and um the drafting happens all at once and in the final phase is where we need to run it through and make sure that the documents are all in their final form with proofreading and final executive but this is also where our approval process through the legislative process occurs by notifying the joint ways and means committee or the e-board and if they happen to be in session presenting before then if they aren't in session it has happens through a retroactive letter where we later go and seek approval before the you might be wondering how this also fits into our agency's larger budget which we at odo have been working on within the last few months because the funds uh these funds are difficult to accurately predict and they are not yet awarded or they are um because of that reason they're not yet accounted for in our next agency budget for the next budget biennium that that starts on july 1st 2023 the approval for receiving and expending funds will most likely be granted through those e-board meetings and all of this typically happens in just 40 to 60 calendar days after taking out weekends and holidays you can see how quickly the entire process needs to needs to move and so it's that scheduling challenge of why we're asking for your input today to help us build these guiding priorities we want to hear your thoughts early and broadly so we can plan accordingly for the needs of the state now here we have a chart that describes the different opportunities and odo's ability to direct the scope of work based on our estimation some funds allow for broader flexibility and require very specific and others require very specific types of investments for example the state energy program allows for broad activities such as energy education and planning energy efficiency programs renewable energy programs and transportation initiatives in contrast the energy efficiency revolving loan fund will only permit funds to be used for specific types of energy audits and the subsequent upgrades to buildings recommended by those audits as you can see there's many unknowns uh that we're watching closely as more information becomes available we also have in this chart uh quick little ideas of where we estimate these funds to be and the scale of their flexibility as well as their potential size we are certainly watching all of those unknown boxes as the information continues to be released from the u.s department of so with that um i will pause to see if there are any additional questions jen there is a question in the chat is there a role for businesses or business groups to review opportunities and encourage oregon or oregon communities to apply for them and i would i can start with that which yes we plan to promote these opportunities and make businesses and consumers and other interested parties aware of them and and seek feedback on them as much as possible but as jen said some of them may come up very quickly it may not be super transparent to us from the federal level so that's why we're trying to get a better sense of in case we do have to do some quick turnaround decisions but i think the short answer to your question is yes we want to hear very much want to hear what folks think about the opportunities perhaps my colleague stacy excuse me casey can put a link to the website that the governor's office has put together that includes all of the opportunities and has a great chart of um not just energy but also broadband and health and transportation we link to it from our website but we can put a direct link that should give you a better sense of the all the types of opportunities that are out there feel free to jump in with more jen if you like i i think that's great the chart that is managed by the state is an adaptation by oregon based on a guidebook that has been published by the white house to help communities plan for and anticipate the different funding opportunities under the infrastructure investment and jobs act overall it represents 380 more than 380 programs across the federal government okay well if there's no further questions move on to the next slide all right so back to me for a few minutes as i mentioned at the beginning our goal today is to seek input so we can draft guiding priorities based on what we've heard and these guiding priorities will help us decide whether odo should put staff time into preparing applications for specific funding opportunities particularly those competitive ones and also how we should shape our program designs to best meet oregon's needs where we do have the flexibility and discretion to do so within the federal funding requirements so as we think about how to spend and prioritize this funding we're not starting with a blank slate there will be a lot of sideboards on the funding already when it comes to us from the federal government and the administration has shared their priorities with the state which are on this slide so these will ground us and i won't read all of these but you can see that they're focused on avoiding waste buying american high labor standards equity resilience and climate change and governor brown has also made it clear in standing up an infrastructure cabinet at the state level that she wants agencies to demonstrate how they will meet these national priorities in a way that addresses oregon's values of climate equity and racial justice she also wants us to make sure that we're including the voices of marginalized communities that have been left out of these decisions in the past so layered on top of the federal and state priorities in terms of where odo has some discretion we will also be looking to our mission so what are the priorities in our priorities are informing oregonians making sure we have a resilient and affordable energy system transitioning to a clean energy future in an equitable protecting public health and the environment and balancing needs and when putting together priorities we can also look to our authorizing statutes which show up in ors 4690 for those of you state code junkies the priorities that we glean from that language are renewable and sustainable diverse energy form efficiency state leadership prioritizing human needs preserving environmental quality energy efficient transportation cost effectiveness and providing impartial and objective information and then finally the oregon department of energy has a new strategic plan which i'm hoping casey can put a link to in the chat our plan has five areas of focus which you see on the right column of this slide so as we're looking at this federal funding and where to invest it we're keeping in mind our priorities to expand and improve stakeholder to build practices and processes that achieve more inclusive and equitable to enhance organizational data modernize our programs and optimize efficiency at the agency so luckily all of these priorities seem pretty consistent with what's coming out of usdoe in the guidance documents around iija including justice 40 and climate change now before we ask you a bunch of questions i will pause to see what questions we have from you oh interesting question in the chat what are the attributes or strengths that you see for oregon that will make us likely to win certain grants and thus become a lens for what we should apply for uh i think we have so",

        "text": " turn out to be the favorable choice okay and then related again um so why was bieberton prioritized over other the question here is that there seems like there are higher risk in higher need areas i'm sorry i was looking at the question so why were they prioritized for a microgrid seems like there are higher risk and higher need areas i guess i have to go back to the the the matrix that we did and you can see it's not just risk it's not higher need um it it has to check all the boxes in that matrix so you might have a higher risk area that doesn't have that solar resource and as i pointed out they might be a great candidate for a micro grid but if all we're going to do is set a battery there it's not going to make a very functional micro grid and it's just not going to be you know the value is not going to be there so i i guess i don't it it's not as simple as one or two criteria there are many criteria that get matrix to him and then last question in the chat and i'll see if we have any hands up um how is the resilience system scaled did pge assess how long the public safety center could reduce loads during a grid outage thereby reducing scale and battery battery and i'm guessing that should be ancillary equipment yeah that's a good question so i i actually like that question very much so there's sort of two aspects to this aspect one is um i think what uh what dave is getting at here is there's a very elegant way of doing this and yes dave the micro grid control system it's a fairly intelligent system it looks at what is your solar performance right now what time of day is it what day of the year is it what's the weather doing um how much solar are you likely to have um of course you always have this diesel sitting there and the micro grid controller works really hard not to start that diesel generator that's one of the goals is do not start the diesel unless it's absolutely um you know your last resource but the micro gig controller does tie in to the city's building management system so it is essentially telling the building management system hey the state of charge is getting kind of low and it's seven o'clock at night and the sun's going to go down and it sends a signal to the building management system that requires a request rather because the city can override the request but it requests changing settings on the water chillers and other large loads to try to maintain that state of charge for a longer period of time thank you so much um so just to note that roseanne dropped her contact info right here i'm sorry that i've got an echo i'll just talk quick stephanie's gonna want to go ahead and introduce our second to last speaker sorry couldn't get to mute and control powerpoint quick enough um so next we have um eric anderson talking about some of the small-scale projects that pacificorp has been working on yeah great thank you um so my my information will be a little bit more more practical based on some of what we have learned um trying to work with customers on behind the meter resiliency sites um and so we've done some well let's let's advance to the next slide so first we're going to talk about what we've learned from some programs that we've had at bge related to sort of single meter single facility micro grid opportunities then i am going to touch a little bit that's too bad roseanne dropped off but touched just a little bit on the airport project i was lucky enough to be on their technical advisory committee so i'll give a little bit of the public information on that mostly for just grounding pricing so people can understand what these types of projects cost um then i was going to go into a little bit on how we're changing changing some of our planning to understand the pricing of small-scale assets for utility planning and i thought i would have some more information from the 2023 irp but it's not done so i've got some more generic information so we'll just go really quick through some of those things and uh and just get some more practical sort of and ground us more on what the pricing and cost of these systems really next slide please um just super high level we've had uh what we call community resiliency programs in both oregon and california for the last couple of years they're back they're basically two-pronged programs one is to uh provide a consultants to do a high level scoping review of the site to determine what options there might be for leveraging solar or some other generating technology and storage to increase the facilities resiliency and decrease their reliance on sort of fossil fuel backup we then in each state have had some funding to try and get projects um actually constructed um in fact in oregon we do have a grant window with some money available at the end of the summer trying to get a few projects actually built uh it's a little different than pge's program where it's pge owned uh projects uh it's more of a rebate or some incentive funds to pay for the project but they would be customer owned so next slide please um we do limit the participation to uh critical facilities and we're actually leveraging a california definition of critical facilities um which are ones that can be more directly tied to sort of community benefits you know there it's a pretty expansive list of what's eligible but it's not everybody that can participate in these next slide please so this is a ton of stuff and this will be in your packet um basically this is our oregon results and we we've done we did five technical studies over the couple of years of the program we basically leveraged uh oregon directive that resiliency planning should be focused on um the facility should plan on being off line for two weeks so um if possible you know what would it take to to allow that facility to continue operations with um for two weeks assuming the grid is out for that long so basically we use that as our gold standard and trying to figure out what it would take to allow those facilities to to stay online for two weeks um standard resiliency um that was just sort of our baseline either leveraging existing equipment on site but not pre-judging sort of uh fossil fuel type generators so you can see with a lot of these facilities maybe they already had existing solar or existing generators on sites but it's just adding facilities to provide that backup power if the grid goes out you know what would it cost to get to be able to sustain that two-week outage enhanced resiliency which is the next category down is adding primarily adding storage to the existing site which allows the diesel generator to operate more efficient or to operate more efficiently basically you get one run through with the storage and then the generator actually runs to power the storage and the storage actually follows follows the load so the burns less fuel because it's not actually following the load the storage is following the load um so you can get further with even the existing generator on site and then the comprehensive resiliency down at the bottom uh is what happens or what would it take to add solar to even increase that ability and limit the amount of fossil fuels to the existing storage on site so you would never during that two of an outage have to rely on the delivery of fossil fuels to the site to keep the generator running so um you can see there's a bunch of capital costs you know the big issue the big issue i guess i'll it's circled is when you talk with you know facility managers they the first thing they want to talk about is you know the capital costs for example the water treatment plant that we've recently studied the capital costs for just installing a diesel generator is 110 000 um if there's a two-week outage they'll need they'll burn you know this is older numbers because it's probably twenty thousand dollars worth of fuel at this point but it's it was a ten thousand dollars a year ago you know to do a project you rely on solar and storage primarily the capital cost goes up to 2.8 million dollars the savings for fuel is is lower it's down to about you know it's five thousand dollars worth of fuel to get through a two-week outage so there are some savings um but when you're a practical sort of what we found is sort of practical facility managers see those two and um and are unwilling to uh want to understand more the long-term benefits of it to move forward with that type of we did you can see we worked with a number of different project facilities we looked at community centers which much smaller and the pro and the capital projects are costs are much more um manageable from a facility manager perspective um you know fire districts you know relatively low load even when they're operating you know those projects and they typically already have fossil generators um installed so the capital costs are significantly lower for those types of we had collected this data just thought for this group it might be helpful to just sort of understand those sort of nuts and bolts of what it means to do an individual facility microgrid that relies on solar and st and storage rat typically in conjunction i guess with fossil fuel generators but in some cases um without a fossil generator next slide please more information i just thought it was there so we provided the interesting thing is that in california the metrics are a little different um our sort of base case is being able to survive 24 hours without uh power the mid case is 72 hours without power and the uh long term is one week without power and it's um you know pretty much the same sort of metrics lower costs up for just getting through 24 hours um larger costs the longer you want to stay off grid or your assumption for how long to stay off grid the you know the primary driver of the additional cost is the kilowatt hours or megawatt hours of storage necessary to make it through that outage um super practical information thought might be useful to to move the to understand um what resiliency might mean i'll do i'll go through the redwood coast because that is a multi-customer and then i'll cut the other stuff out um so next slide redwood coast it was talked about that is a multi-customer uh microgrid at the end of a circuit which is really nice it serves 18 or so customers one of them is a small airport and a coast guard helicopter station it's got a",

        "text": " reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation and promote Equity these are goals and priorities are in line with the work that we did in our Salem projects as well as the climate action plan as we're looking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation and promote equity the proposed code Amendment responds to these rules by proposing to eliminate all minimum parking requirements Citywide for all uses and before I get into that I'm going to provide a little context but the proposed code Amendment does not say that you cannot provide parking parking can still be provided on people's properties it just takes the city out of mandating the minimum amount required on each property so like many cities in Oregon across the country Salem regulates parking largely the minimum amount based on specific uses so for example if you have an eating or drinking establishment or a restaurant our requirement today is one space per 250 square feet of that building so if you have like an 8 000 square foot fast food restaurant you need eight spaces in recent years however we have been eliminating parking requirements for specific uses and in specific locations this is largely because the city has been looking to promote infill and Redevelopment promote different types of Housing and really reduce barriers to so there are some uses where regardless of where it's located there's no parking requirement today such as accessory dwelling units middle housing which is townhouses duplexes triplexes Etc late last year we passed a code Amendment here to add to that list based again on these same state rules that expanded the list to include like affordable housing and shelters there are also specific locations in Salem where no parking is required by the city regardless of the use such as our Downtown parking District which was established back in 76 as well as half a mile within a half a mile of our 15-minute Transit routes this was again a code amendment that we did late last year to respond to these same state there are also some locations and specific uses that we've targeted as a city to promote that type of development and removed parking requirements so as an example multi-family housing if it's located in the greater downtown area the central Salem development program parking is not required and with the r Salem project we removed all minimum parking requirements for any uses within a quarter mile of transit's core Network as long as there was multi-family housing this was done to incentivize properties to add housing to their so we've done a rough analysis to see what the impact of this proposed code Amendment would be and roughly 40 percent of the land within City Limits today we do not have a parking requirement for the areas that you see in yellow on this map are the areas that are generally would be impacted much of these areas in west and south Salem are single-family residential areas and in those single-family zones today we only require parking for all uh for a single family home so we require two spaces but if you do an Adu a duplex Triplex Scottish cluster those don't require any parking so the change would really be to the single family home in other areas that would be impacted they're largely employment areas and again the market would determine how much parking would be necessary in these areas if this proposed coconut is we have taken a look back to see what the impact of our recent changes to parking have been we've looked at multi-family housing in particular we removed parking requirements for multi-family housing within the core Network transits core Network back in 2020 and since then we've approved 15 multi-family projects of those 15 only two did not provide parking the rest did provide parking the amount was again based on the market and other considerations so while this again code Amendment would remove the requirement for parking parking could still be um provided and this shows that a majority of the multi-family projects are still providing parking so this code Amendment again allows the market and other considerations to determine the parking amounts that would be provided on on each site by each use it also aligns with the climate action plan that does have a specific strategy that looks asks the city to really prioritize removing parking minimums throughout the city but particularly along the core Network and we did take this proposal to The Climate action plan committee back in November and they voted to recommend that that vote however did come after a lengthy discussion about the other options that the state is providing the city in terms of mandated parking reforms so I'm going to briefly go over a couple of those so the state provided the city three the first option is the code Amendment before you tonight if the city does eliminate all minimum parking requirements Citywide the city would not have to make any other parking reforms but we could if the city decided hey we like some of these other options we want to tailor them to the city the city could go forward and do that but would not be a requirement of the state the other options have many other things that are required I'm not going to walk through them all but I'll highlight a couple of the examples so if the city does not remove minimum parking requirements Citywide if it chooses either option 2 or option 3 we would have to price 10 percent of our on-street parking essentially paid parking by September 2025. so we've done a preliminary analysis to see what this looks like and today we charge for parking on less than one percent of our on-street parking spaces it's largely in and around the downtown it's the red areas you can't see very well on this we also have residential parking districts here in the city but we do not charge enough for the residential parking permits to count towards the state requirement so today if you have a parking permit it's 15 per month we would a year thank you but if we if we wanted to count it would have to be 15 a month if we did make that increase to the parking permit cost we would get close to four percent of our 10 if we were to charge for parking in the downtown area we would get close to 5.5 percent so while the city can move forward with paid parking on its own um going for just downtown would not be enough to meet this 10 requirement another one of the options is to pick three of these options you see on this screen I'm not going to dive deep into all of them but all of them except for the fifth one which is a parking production would require additional Resources Staffing or programs we do not have existing staffer programs to implement these as they're currently I'm bundling parking is a relatively new term in Salem so I'm just going to explain it really quick so essentially it means the city would have to require a building owner or a landlord to separate the cost of parking in a lease from the cost of the tenant space or the apartment so someone who goes to rent an apartment would have to be able to rent that space that unit separately from the cost of parking we don't have staff we don't have the program today to really get into examining or enforcing private leases so this would be something new to the city there are some temporary rules that the state is considering that would roll back some of these parking requirements so instead of picking three this would be a pick two situation if those pass of the three options the postcode Amendment would be the easiest to implement within our existing staff resources capacity it would also allow the city to continue forward with things like paid parking or other options but really tailor them to the city instead of having to meet strict state so the code makes several other changes it revises our parking maximums in line with the new state rules our bicycle parking requirements for multi-family in line with State rules and then it makes it easier to install electric vehicle charging stations without triggering a bunch of pedestrian connections so there's a few other things in the code amendment that I just wanted to touch on we have received some public comments you hopefully you saw those in your packet there are four comments in support and seven comments in opposition so staff recommends advancing ordinance 423 to Second reading that concludes my presentation thank you thank you Eunice and we do have three people signed up so we'll go to that and then we'll go to those comments and then we'll come back for a staff questions first step we have uh Marissa thieve reminder you have three minutes please introduce yourself with your award or your address hey hi am I you're on you're good good hello uh my name is Marissa teve uh tev I'm so sorry that's okay it's a it's French it's a little tricky um I'm in Ward one um so I'm just going to reiterate some of my written comments so if you've read those feel free to zone out for three minutes um so I'm I'm speaking today in support of ordinance Bill uh number 4-2-3 and I believe abolishing parking mandates is right for Salem because it would complement the work like Eunice was just highlighting that uh Council and staff have already begun um on the r Salem code changes and the climate action plan um which specifically calls out parking reform as low hanging fruit Salem has already removed parking minimums again as Eunice kind of redundant within the quarter mile of Core Transit so this ordinance would simply be an upward adjustment from my neighborhood which is Grant in particular is nearly a quarter is nearly entirely within a quarter mile of Transit of Core Transit so where I live there would be no change virtually I believe a lot of folks in town um I read some of the testimony that was against this change um or against passing this ordinance are concerned and I believe that they're confused about what exactly this means hopefully they're watching um and reading through the packet um and uh and also confused about that this is a state law so it is required one of those options I also believe that it's slowly it would slowly accumulatively benefit Salem and uh so as a professional I'm a soil scientist and I see the value in keeping our cities dense and walkable we have amazingly fertile soils in Oregon and diverse soils in Oregon and our Urban growth boundaries have protected many acres of prime Farmland from being scraped compacted and paved over let me remind you that soils are our largest terrestrial sink for carbon as our population steadily increases removing parking mandates would help us keep building up and not out and let the market decide exactly how much parking we need thank you for this opportunity and for your work thank you for your testimony are there any questions thank you so much for",

        "text": " or started in 2021 it is now this year paying those taxes so it is now on the tax rols for that expansion for that project um we did get a letter from um knowing that we were coming before you today um from Tom Wimer of mar nag U just wanted to read a little bit of this um the the um we were able to staff the warehouse and with five additional full-time hires as well as augmenting employment for additional team members of the bag Mar and egg service team who are involved with the product that moves through the warehouse the building allowed Mar and egg service to create efficiencies in streamlining product flow and increased storage capacity that helped improve its profitability ility Marin egg service would not be in this position as a fertilizer packaging and distribution industry leader without the help of the Oregon rural industrial tax exemption program that provided um to allow us to have the scope of the facility provides and the ability to hire Quality Personnel to operate in an efficient and pro profitable manner um and they you wrote a letter to the Commissioners um thanking you for your support in the past and hoping that this gets recertified again for them and Eric just a really quick question was the thir 31 per year or was that 31 over 3 years uh 31 per year for 3 years and that's just the pro the property tax on an incremental project so anything that was existing beforehand was would continue to pay tax right um H hot Mir Cold Storage was also one of the original ones that had been um you know one of the earlier ones to have been approved this project allowed a 28,000 ft energy effic icient um hop cold storage facility which allows the company to add value to what they're what they're harvesting in in Maran County um as that exemption also started in 20 21 um this uh this $2.2 million investment that was awarded the incentive is now on the property tax roles for this coming for this year um they created five jobs five additional jobs um sidebuster farms uh new machinery and equipment um and related construction for hop processing near Wheatland at their facilities there um this exemption started in 20 uh 2022 2023 so it'll be coming off the books next year this was a $6.5 million investment um the exemption amounted to $70,000 per year for three years and 25 jobs were created um when we toured that project at the time um I believe commissioner Willis you've been through that as well um each subsequent um expansion that they have done has been more efficient and they've been the the types of jobs are creating involve a lot more um computer operation and things like that as well one of the latest ones that have been approved everfab uh they're building a 48,000 foot building um basically doubling their production capacity near mville um they are currently um they assessor's office just sent someone out to to take a look at the project earlier in the year it is uh not completed yet the equipment is not going so they actually will be playing paying property tax this year on the construction in process and then next year um they will get three beginning of three years that the completed project will be um the property tax and Center for them it's a $3 million investment um that we're aware of to date um the exemption would be for $30,000 per year for those three years when it's completed and are adding at least 28 new jobs then finally GK machine um this was the one that was before you when we uh realized we required the up the uh reauthorization from the county um they are building aund a new 140,000 foot facility um it's actually in Hover um it's a Stones Throw from their existing facility in Donald but it's a hover address um um the the exemption if if approved will begin in 2526 um it's a $25 million investment uh that exemption would amount to 300,000 per year for three years and uh at least 25 to 30 jobs will be created um Kip and I had the opportunity to spend a couple hours there yesterday and and tour the facility and sit down with um Gary and Connie and get an update on what they've been doing and um we what we heard was um the is really one of the few incentives that a company like that and where their locate is able to take advantage of and um we heard some somewhat startling but not I guess not totally surprising information from them that uh they we know theyve been corded and considered investment in other places but to uh um they've actually had the Texas Economic Development folks come out to their facility um fly them back um buy them some pretty good dinners from what it sounds like Texas is super aggressive yeah yeah and um this is a company that uh you know deals with a bunch of different suppliers and customers along the west coast and they really can be anywhere um takes a lot to move a company like that but um takes a lot to move them across town also so once you're loaded up um so we're you know they were very clear that this incentive and thanks to the County Commission and having this program this is uh something that helps them make what is becoming an increasingly tough decision to stay in Oregon um given some of the other tax issues that they that they and other businesses are dealing with so um and just some kind of General ideas on this General thoughts as our top industry is agriculture you see a lot of these projects are in the agriculture industry um this exemption is one of the few Economic Development programs available to agricultural producers here to add value or to increase their productivity um it does support a tech and value added projects U which that which provide opportunities to diversify farm incomes which we all know is key um this encourages investments in Automation and other new technologies it allows a project to start generating incremental income um in incremental Revenue before having to pay property tax on on incremental investment and um really the Oregon Enterprise Zone Program is only available to projects within designated City Limits where there is an econ where there is an Enterprise Zone so this really provides a a heads up to uh companies that are not in city limits and not in an Enterprise Zone in in County happy to answer questions or your comments Eric thank you for your presentation it perfect K glad you're here um obviously we think this we think this is a great tool for especially for our a people and uh you said outside City Limits I think it's just only outside City of Salem based on the way can't can't we be inside City limits as long as the city is a certain size it's not an Enterprise Zone yeah it's the Enterprise Zone that's that's inside city limits or or uh Urban growth boundaries and this is a program that allows for if you don't have an Enterprise Zone to be able to take advantage of it right but if it was inside the city limits of say of Jervis or Woodburn because they're smaller they could still take advantage of this if they're not in an Enterprise they're an Enterprise okay great yeah thank you for that clarification well I think it's important it's it's uh we've talked about this before if I was a business and it's a 10-minute drive to the nearest Enterprise Zone why would I invest in rural Marian County if I could invest in a city so I think one of the things that I I like about this is it incentivizes investment in rural parts of the county um and um you know that gets you know the the full Improvement goes on the tax roll after 3 years so um it really does provide increased Revenue tax tax revenue for for our services here in Maran County so it's one of these it's kind of one of these win-wins that don't happen very often yeah that's that's good and it has to be an existing business MH so this is this is one of those incentives to say we appreciate you here we want to keep you here and help you grow so um yeah it's good I was just adding up the numbers just off from the top of my head $455,000 a year on on just the projects that you just mentioned in property taxes every year based on those Investments so of course if you look at your property tax statement you know what percentage of that goes to the schools what goes to you know us and all those things but it's it's a it's what we wanted to see so thank you yeah also want to thank Sarah mckeny and the assessor's office folks too they're a really good partner for this with with the County Economic Development Community Development staff too right on a motion Mr chair we will if you want to make it under emergency procedure and I'll read it by title once okay let's see if I can find it I'm going to make a motion Mr chair that you read the ordinance by title once okay I will read oh and I'll second motion uh any discussion nope all right all those in favor signify by saying I I well you're just so excited about getting this done okay an ordinance authorizing

        "text": " Wendy makes sure she keeps it Broad and matching up with your work overall so I can go to the next slide if that works thanks so I usually like to do a little bit of level setting around a legislative session before we get started um and um but given the time I'm not going to do my usual sort of Deep dive that I like to do but I do just want to make sure that folks know we had a couple of major themes and issues that I think fed into the overall energy themes and issues um one is that we kind of started session with um sort of a a general Vibe at least in the state senate that partisanship was going to be a big factor in how the session unfolded and while there were certainly lots of examples of everybody working across the aisle to get things done for the state of Oregon there also was a walkout that did inform sort of how the session ended up and then I'll also just flag that there were a lot of new legislators there were 22 new members 21 in the house and one in the Senate which I think is just funny how just how new the house was versus the Senate which had some new leadership but had a lot of long-standing members there so those were factors and I think how session unfolded and I'll just sort of flag those as a little bit of context before we dive in on energy I think the number one factor that made a difference on climate and energy legislation this session was that the state budget was much higher than expected we went through the beginning part of the legislative session expecting a flat budget or maybe even a slight Cuts budget so there was really a lot of talk about well how do we um you know figure out how to do this within available resources and then all of a sudden it's turned into kind of the opposite there was plenty of money to fund good work on climate and energy and so that was a big deal and certainly had a major in a major uh major role in the outcome of session on these topics the other thing that I want to make sure folks understand is that and I know a lot of the like in the building and the capital folks already know this but essentially 20 pieces of legislation got pulled into two bills and that became a 90 million our climate package along with a little bit of money in the end of session Bill and so these packages are kind of new to me at least where all of a sudden we have all these really different disparate Concepts in these packages and the in in one bill or two bills and so um our both end of session our end of session report really reflects that I have a link in here that you all can find or you can just Google probably find our our legislative session report but I kind of had to figure out how do you make it so someone can click and find the legislative history when the entire legislative history is in a bill that didn't pass whereas the everything about the bill did pass you know in this final final package or Omnibus vehicle so I just think it's important for folks to understand if they want to look back find out more about what happened on a particular piece of legislation you'll need to find that original that original Bill to find that legislative history and also not to think oh my gosh this passed with almost no testimony I don't understand when you look at these huge bills that have tons going on and then finally the major topics and at least in my opinion on energy specifically but also climate related Energy Efficiency facility citing I kind of I think like well if you would have asked people as planning a major topic they might not have said so but I actually think when you look at all that happened a ton of it is around sort of planning accountability like how do we get ready for the clean energy transition uh and then finally resilience and on that we can go ahead and turn the page I'll go through what's in the climate package and then I'm going to kind of go through by theme some of the different concepts that pass so I'm going to just take a couple of bills to really dig in on that are not necessarily the ones um related to the the commission because I know Zach's going to be talking about that quite a bit today so um I just popped together sort of a summary list that does not include include every piece of what was in the climate package most important to this group of course is that global warming commission update and a new scope of work for the commission and then finally and then also the natural and climate Solutions legislation that passed and that has a major role for the new ocac and then we also have additional and frankly somewhat unexpected dollars like I said the budget environment just we ended up with additional dollars for some of our existing energy and incentive programs that includes our solar rebate program at the department of energy it also includes the community renewable energy grant program that was one where we passed it two years ago as a state it had a 50 pot and now that pot for the four years that it has been funded so far will be 70 million dollars to support community-led clean energy and energy resilience projects so that was a pretty cool result of that extra money that or that unexpected money that was able to be spent this year on climate and energy one thing I worked really hard on this session with a whole lot of other people is how we get the state ready for a bunch of new federal funding funding coming in and I think some folks were focused on how do we like Leverage that or how do we sort of position the state on how we want to get that money spent for me personally it was like how do we make sure we have the staff to adequately put together these really intense grants applications and make sure that we're connecting with oregonians as we put those together which is really hard to do when you don't have capacity so um there's specifically some dollars toward home Energy Efficiency programs and grid resilience programs and then I'll just add quickly because the grants application materials came out and now that's a big deal for me in our agency but I'm a Workforce training or industry training program on home Energy Efficiency as well the entire building efficiency package that came forward out of the resilient efficient buildings task force and I know this group has thought a lot about and heard a lot about over the last couple of years and that all passed into law the state energy strategy you just heard about bill passed then dollars for resilience hubs and resilience planning and then you talked about the solar citing rulemaking at dlcd already today and then finally some fees to help with the community climate investment program at DEQ passed as part of the package like I said not a holistic list you're welcome to put in the chat something that you're like how dare you have missed my thing um non harmful algae blooms for example has a study it could go on and on but this is a nice high level list and then we can go on um um sort of each to the First theme I wanted to talk about I've taken to calling Energy Efficiency a trifecta when it comes to climate change it not only reduces emissions but it also sort of resilience benefits like for example a heat pump can provide cooling as Summers get hotter and then it also can allow for lower rates so really it's a it's a win-win at the department of energy we did a lot of work in the last biennial Energy report talking about how the Energy Efficiency can be such a boon for the state Beyond just um Energy savings and so it seems like the legislature agreed this session uh because this was sort of I think the hottest topic or biggest ticket package of legislation that passed in the bigger um with the climate package I'm going to talk about ability the building performance standard in a second but did just want to flag um and I already mentioned the home Energy Efficiency piece this is just helping us get ready for federal programs and implementing those programs so that they can reach the most oregonians and the people who need those benefits the most there's also a fair amount of direction to state agency on agencies on how to how to both run their buildings but then also how to consider Energy Efficiency in applying for federal funds and then uh finally there's some energy code pieces that um the building uh I'm sorry I'm having a moment dcbs building codes division will be working to implement um just around making sure that we have the most energy efficient code that we can to make sure that that department is considering greenhouse gas emissions and their decision making they have a robust advisory boards so they have a whole process over there so it's just making sure that those considerations are on the list for those advisory groups and with that we can go to the next um I feel like I'm talking to some people that know more about the building performance standard legislation than I do that are on the commission so I totally welcome um anybody to weigh in here but to me this this was on paper the biggest um that passed into law this session for our agency in the end in the end about I think three years from now we'll have seven staff we'll have six staff by the end of the next two-year budget cycle to run this program to actually stand up this program the idea with a building performance standard is that it's a way of getting existing buildings which as many of you know were built a long time ago in many cases might not have either the ventilation or insulation that are needed to both keep people safe and reduce energy uh usage so this is actually a way of saying to those existing buildings so where are you on Energy Efficiency and how much improvement do we expect you to get and then how can we provide some carrots to help you get there get there sooner so the idea with a standard is to really Drive energy consumption down in the uh commercial buildings in this state but doing so in a way that gives folks plenty of time to prepare and helps them take advantage of what tools are out there to um make upfront Investments Energy Efficiency is really interesting because in most cases it'll save money in the long run but you have to spend money to get there so how can we help make that happen for building owners throughout the state one thing I'll say about this bill that the two tiers model is really interesting we actually are following a lot of other states and local",

welcome really appreciate having you board let us know how we can help you I know the commission uh knows this but uh just as a reminder of what we do we aage public and private Partnerships to successfully grow retain and attract high value jobs and capital investment in Marian pul and yamill counties um we've been at this for 42 years now um we tend to get a lot of attention for recruitment but I think everybody knows that the the U jobs that are created in a community usually come from the businesses that are already here so business retention expansion is a key part of our our work plan also feeds into other things that we get into as we learn from businesses what their issues are might be um the past is work it could be Workforce it could be uh even getting into you know daycare and Workforce housing issues what we've been doing lately in some in some areas um couple of kind of key things we've been working on um we got together and actually were're able to have Kelly's team as well and uh Tony shacker from Salem electric come and do a tour with the the folks at fr's Lumber um fr's engineered wood I should say um to get a feel for what they're doing and as as we all know um that's not your grandfather Sawmill I mean the the work that they're doing the robotics that is involved with the mass Timber Products is so uh is so intricate so the conversations about Workforce and even Workforce housing up there has been something I'll talk a little bit more about that later but literally there is still part of that Mill grandfather's Mill exactly in fact my grandfather put the lathe in Mill one that still operates today so you see those and you realize how broad that industry is and and as we've talked about you've probably heard me say before when when we hear the the state talk about Innovation Industries and Tech and like no we have Tech in all of our Industries and and Tech opportunities and um I think even the folks at FS are recognizing that uh in many respects they've become a high-tech business um U I was just telling Kip we're um going into tour and meet with GK machine on Tuesday um we know that's a big part of maring County's economic opportunities right now then kind of the work that they've been doing up there um we're excited to see that move forward also with the um um the rural um machiner and Equipment property tax um program too um in the coming weeks and um I talked about oops talked about um agility robotics before but um since we were last here I had the chance to actually go down to paloalto and see the robot army in action um so freaky I'm very supportive I know you are I'm so not like if you've seen I Robot the good guys win in the end they look nothing like Rosie on the Jetson that was you my my frame of reference um but the thing that um was really I guess interesting to me is that they're being designed and built to work with humans you know they're not necessarily replacing humans on the work floor they're going to be augmenting um and the fact that it ends up being part of our warehouse and distribution supply chain um they're working uh with Amazon right now to uh test their um they call it the digit robot um but it was a really interesting way to get to know the company and also meet their leadership so we'll be working with them on I know the ctec folks and uh the Career Academy folks are all interested in talking about what skills that their Workforce is going to be requiring um towards the end of last year one of the things we talked about what we had worked with um um yamasa soy sauce in the past and connecting them with local farmers to to supply them we see that as a model to um really try to encourage other food processors to to by local and to develop long-term relationships with the growers in the region so we hosted what we called the locally grown supply chain and we had uh seven or eight businesses uh food processors um from the region and a couple um from outside we actually had Bob's Redmill come down they want to talk more with Growers directly",

        "text": " as possible to start moving forward addition two is a standard language for development and the flood plane similarly addition three allows the applicant plenty of Le time to obtain State permitting lastly trip cap is essentially just to ensure that the trips did not exceed what the current zoning allows for you did not receive any um comments from the neighborhood of Association or public there are attached your sta report comments from agencies and if they're addressed in the staff report staff recommends um approval as identified in the supplemental report dated February 27 I am available for any questions if you have any I also have a team of subject Manor experts that can answer questions thank you very much let me turn to the Commissioners and if you have any questions vice president erard could you explain to me about the road how wide it is it's a class two or something the driveway that comes in I'm just curious about that the um the applicant will have to apply for a class two driveway approach permit at the time of development okay um so they would have to you know again they would have to develop to the minimum necessary to preserve the repairing area I there's not a whole lot of room there I think there's maybe 80 F feet um there so I would guess that 4050 feet of that's going to be a driveway leading to the property thank you if I could I'd like to ask a question about the trip count you said it's based on the current zoning so is that for the community service government is the trip count what's what does the trip count look like once you change the Zone um it is based on the existing Zone I will let Tony Martin engineer hi Tony Martin assistant City traffic engineer so yes under the the comp comp change zone change there's an evaluation of the reasonable use that could go on under the existing zoning and then they compare it to what they want and uh they they submitted study and what they proposed was actually than so that's the trip cap is what could have happened at full building okay so just to be clear the 18,000 or so daily is higher than full build out of the questions I will have a question then I'd like to understand a little bit more um the city's thought process and selecting reparan quarter sizes can someone speak to that um I would defer j i Jennifer mlo Senior natural resources planner in the public works department um so we initially looked at raring Corridor sizes from the standpoint of um if we were to use the I'm forgetting the official name of it the urban riparian inventory assessment guide REI guide that was created by the Department of State lands uh to evaluate raran corridors in cities and the maximum raring Corridor under that type of assessment would be 100 20 foot Corridor uh so our initial assessment not having really been able to do a full assessment of the property but knowing there's trees along portions of the repairing Corridor we went with the assumed maximum setback and then in the initial um staff report we conditioned the condition include the option of doing the full assessment and potentially having a reduced stepb back if the assessment showed that that was appropriate um after discussions um with the applicant we did determine what so the city also has our standard setback is a 50 foot red haing Corridor um under our current code with and that's also consistent with the state's um Safe Harbor alternative under go five repairing corridors uh so it it's kind of I guess I could of explain the repairing Port options the way go five works you have the option of doing a full inventory or you have the option of going with Safe Harbor inventory a safe harbor inventory is a standard 50 foot setback um the standard inventory is uh whatever you come up with through that methodology so we were really working within that framework as much as possible and trying to determine what an appropriate reparing Corridor for the site would be that answer your question yes and you're satisfied where you landed I think it's a very reasonable Corridor um given the conditions of the site and the restrictions that the are existing has all right thank you any other questions no then I think we're going to move to the applicant right so the applicant or their representative has 15 minutes to present can you please state your name and um your address or your should share it through zo okay good evening my name is Britney Randall and I'm just going to be introducing our team on our project and then let wheny do the heavy tonight um so there's two main uh people that I'd like to introduce to you versus Clutch industri so we're here here we have this opportunity to look at this project that can really enhance stem thanks to clutch um and then the second person I wanted to introduce to you is Wendy Kellington so Wendy is helping us through the technical matters because there are a lot on this project um and so we wanted to make sure that we presenting uh information factually to you tonight our team only has 15 minutes to share with two years of effort to get to this point so that's why I'm talking asked um if there's any time left at the end of when presentation I'd be glad to discuss with you all the Outreach that we've done um and the efforts that we've made to collaborate with a variety of stakeholders on this project just can't do the technical thing working on this project and I thought it was important to kind of help you crawl in our had to understand how we came to the place that we did and in order to do that you have to understand why there are all these continuances of things and so you kind of have to start the basics and that reflects some of the good questions having to do with what what were the standards that we' all chasing because the standards and criteria that are qualified in the city's code are the ones that were required to abide by and we're required to apply but developers Property Owners can agree to do more and this is a case where the develop group has agreed to do more I just want you to understand that because it's kind of in a delicate dance where we've come to So the plan Amendment standards they're up here on your screen they require one of two things you don't have to show two both you show one of two one is an alteration in circumstances social economic demographic patterns in the vicinity have so altered that the current current designations are no longer appropriate I believe that staff agrees that that standard is met by The Proposal if you meet that standard you don't go to the equal to or better than standard it's one or the other the code says one or the other the next one is the zone change standards which are very similar the zone change is Justified in based on one or more of the following demonstration that there's been a change in the economic demographic physical character of the vicinity such that the pro Zone would be compatible with the vicinity development that one you don't have to worry about the equal to better better than which to me makes my head slow trying to understand how that how that applies so the the first one is what we looked at and that one applies and is met I want to share with you what that is so with regard to the plan criteria Ia about alteration in circumstances there's been a very big change as you know and that is that the property has gone from a public ownership where basically BL it can happen things that public entities can pursue versus being owned Now by a holy company the zone change criteria regarding alterations in circumstances are a little different they look to the changes in the economic and physical character and compatibility between the vicinity development pattern and the The Proposal of course I think his staff agrees that the proposed zone is entirely consistent with the vicini's development pattern it's developing like crazy as you know out there with Industrial and Commercial uses this is kind of the vicinity that we use you can you can see kind of the area the areas in Black are new in the last years so it's changed a lot as you can see and some of putting names proba I don't need to tell you you know better than I but some of the new businesses that are there are Amazon's Distribution Costco P TR industrial Flex site mixed use site with food lodging H Manufacturing and a Dollar General Distribution Center and all other things so really really big changes in the demographic and economic patterns social patterns too I suppose of the vicinity and you can't see the fine print but you'll have to trust us as to what it says and that is that the economic change in the vicinity has been pretty F profound in the past say 10 years the historic assessment the assessed value of property in the vicinity versus now is about 41 million of assess value differ so it's a big big economic change in the pafic and then just in tax assessment you know what the City of Salem State of Oregon and others would get in tax revenue from these changes is about $2.3 million every year so again big economic changes and for the subject site you for you know all the public bodies the site historically yielded zero tax revenue for everybody and now the taxes collected for 2023 and we expect them to do nothing but go up based on the private ownership is about $1 138,000 a year that's undeveloped right so it's a big change it's a positive change for the community now why did we pick the the industrial commercial where we did and why didn't we pick the industrial where where we did just know that your comprehensive plan says that industrial commercial is a design ation that's supposed to serve as a transition between heavier industrial areas and residential areas it's kind of transition and Industrial makes sense because where we put the industrialist staff showed in their great PowerPoint presentation is right next other IG areas you know there's metal fabricators construction folks storage yards pgp Transformers and so on and so forth so to make sure you you understand that there's no igig area that buts any residential areas that's the red it's kind of pink here but the redish is the only indust IG zound area than that but other industrial know residentially designated areas this is a Salem vicinity zoning map you couldn't really make the case in the City of Salem in fact they think anywhere in the state of Oregon that industrial uses would be per se bad for residential areas or you know natural areas because in fact throughout Oregon you see many of those uses put next to one another in fact that's kind of how Oregon",

        "text": " provides information analysis and technical assistance on Energy Efficiency Clean Energy Technologies and climate change this division has been restructured to account for the additional work assigned by in the legislator by HB 349 uh the division is made up of four sections energy efficiency and conservation technology Pol technology and policy and the two new sections uh in this B in the bium will be codes and standards and clim climate change both of these new sections and the staff that support them are uh mostly paid for with fund planning innovation has had a busy bium this group was instrumental in orgon getting the recently announced climate pollution reduction Grant uh for $197 million pni is also leading the coordination and development of the Oregon energy strategy which will which will be released next year and the division is also supporting the revamped Oregon climate action commission and developing the new building performance standards program right so uh this is another chart we'll see for each division and the agency request budget for planning and Innovation includes 40 staff and 40 full-time equivalent uh positions or FTE uh please note that these counts uh when we see these for each division will be inclusive of positions listed in the policy option packages we'll discuss the two members of the Oregon Northwest power Council and conser Northwest power and conservation Council are funded by the bonerville administration as a pass through in odo's budget which is why they show up here so this slide shows a breakdown of the budget by program and the activities of the division on the right side you'll see the revenue sources for that support these activities SC graph on the left is uh estimate based is an estimate based on expenditures in these areas in previous years and a projection of what will be spent in the bium you can see that a majority of the funding for this division which traditionally has come from the energy supplier assessment now comes from general fund and federal fund makes up a making up a close third uh for support demonstrating odo's efforts to diversify our funding stream other funding includes public purpose charge funds for the school program and the large electric consumer program which is also known as self-direct the self-direct program here's a multianal look at planning inovation expenditures and on the right hand side it's Esa support one thing you may notice on this slide is an increase in ag fees which is due to an increase uh in the agent what the agency is being charged in doj which is part of the inflation factor that is built into the uh budget and this would be uh there's two parts of the budget which we talk about too which is there's a part where we have state government service charges and those are also up and that's what every agency pays into support the overall department of justice but then there's also a services and uh services and supplies part of um our budget and that has an inflationary factor for doj as well so here's the information broken down into each section of p&amp; uh just wanted to highlight again if you looked at this uh slide on Friday or earlier today uh please not that it's been updated to reflect a more granular detail on where the esa is being spent in this division you'll see that e andc uh energy technology and planning sections are funded with 23% and 49% of Esa respectively and energy codes and standards at just um and can fit all of those sections in one chart so here is uh the next chart which goes over the climate policy which is 12% funded with the esa and the Northwest power Council which again um uh is not funded with Esa and I will stop there for any questions all right so then we'll talk about the policy option packages for this division uh and the first one is to a climate uh research pop and it extends an LD position that the legislature provided in 349 uh to align the position with the ongoing work that was also assigned in HB 349 and this position is general fund supported we're also excited about uh a pop for the rural uh efficiency projects and it complements our federal Rita grant program with general fund dollars to support energy project s identified by audits completed under the r Oregon Rural and agricultural energy assistance program uh note that when we showed this pop earlier in April it was uh entitled the rural energy projects fund uh but we got some good feedback and uh the name was changed to reflect this so energy development services is our next Division and it's the division that's probably seen the most change from in the last few Bia uh going from being primarily tasked with administrating inactive Sun inactive or sun setting programs to standing up and administering new programs to beginning to incorporate uh a lot of the federal funding that we're talking about and now uh looking at phasing out some of these State programs in our agency request budget this slide shows the current work of the energy development services division and the grade out section represent programs that are being phased out in our agency request budget because they were onei one-time funded programs uh and that's the SAR third rebate uh program the Wildfire energy efficient Wildfire rebuilding and our two heat pump programs this division is where most of the federally funded programs live and will live including grid resilience and solar for all and again uh as saw in the budget this division has the the inactive self program and here you can see some of the great support our incentive programs have been providing for oregonians this includes providing incentives for over 70 megawatts of generation uh to single family and to single family homes and providers of services to low and moderate income individuals we are on track to install almost three provide incentives to install almost 3,000 heat pumps in rental units and are launching our grid resilience program which will improve Oregon's electric grid infrastructure and provide Community benefits the Eds division has 17 staff and 17 FTE and I'll note here there is a new section uh for those are following our budget which is the federal incentive programs and this again is a section that we anticipate will grow in the spum as we begin to receive federal funds and those get incorporated into our budget you'll see on the next slide that this division will be significantly smaller than it is in the current division but we are still we will still be operating the community renewable energy grant program and we also expect Federal incentive uh programs in this section to increase as more Federal funding is received note that the community renewable investment fund is an example of the intra agency transfers as it shows up as other funds but it actually comes from uh it was originally sourced from general fund here you can see the onetime reduction in investments in the total uh in that se that second row From The Bottom the inter agency General uh sorry third from the bottom uh the total Less in agency general fund transfers uh and you can see the reduction in special payments also that um reflects the kind of nature of the program in the agency request budget uh as those some of these incentive programs are being phased out this information is again a breakdown by section uh Energy Efficiency financing is uh relates you can see is minor and relates to our self some of our self Debt Service all right and here are the federal incentive and self sections uh the federal incentive section will include any general fund matches given match that is given to support the federal grants such as in resilience uh and you'll see there's no Esa supporting the energy development programs we do have a policy option package for the energy incentive programs uh we have noted that there are efficiencies to be gained from having permanent program staff that provide continuity and institutional knowledge and who can support uh emerging incentive discussions preparing help or prepare for any new incentive programs before dedicated staff can be onboarded uh who can help provide SE Staffing for existing programs or administer A Tail of programs that have uh s set or don't have dedicated staff and so this pop is to um to establish those positions you'll note that uh while we don't have a pop to uh extend all the programs uh given the 1% guidance uh it's because those programs would be much more than 1% of CSL but we do think it's important to have uh permanent Staffing to provide all of that coverage and in April uh when we first talked about this pop uh and and Inspire we talked about funding it with general fund for these permanent positions but again with that not fitting within our 1% CSL we will instead plan to work to fund the positions with any available funding uh that comes through our federal grants or incentive uh any incentive programs that remain I'm Michael Yes um we have a hand up and it's Brad re from the building Coalition hi Brad you go hello I think I'm unmuted thanks so much um appreciate the explanation on uh the various incentive programs um many folks from our more than 50 organization Coalition have keyed in on the heat pump programs um first of all congratulations to Odo for um getting that money out to help people as well as um the really successful applications to the federal uh PR uh C cprg grants um that's all very exciting news um the fact that uh the funds from this year were reserved in one day for the rental home heat pump program um just shows the incredible need um and so what I'm what it sounds like is that you all won't be able to put uh a pop forward for those incentive programs but I guess I just wanted to be on the record um for the incredible support that our Coalition has for those programs and that we will be advocating with the Govern and the legislature to get as much funding in those as possible especially as we deal with the hottest year in human history and the incredible need that Odo itself uncovered um for cooling across Oregon so I just wanted to say on the I guess my question is we won't be see any pops coming forward for those programs it's something that um legislators will have to put forward themselves thank you uh thanks yes the those Pops to extend those programs would not be included you won't see those in our agency request budget again the budget process is iterative so that's not to say that it you know uh given changes in uh revenue for forecast or other things that it won't appear in the governor's recommended budget or in the legislature that is um at this point we've will put forward our agency request budget and provide uh information on the great work that it's been doing uh but it's going to be in um you know if if it shows up now",

a question about improving Lander guard as it is whether it's going to be improved to public to City standards or not it isn't unknown for us what's going to happen in the future we just don't know I was really thrilled to hear Mr ekas Mr Bernie and the group from Salem Heights talking about the collaboration they've had with City staff we would like to have similar collaboration so we could get some knowns about that right now it's just an unknown about critical issues that haven't been discussed with us about what's going to happen to our street if this is approved so I would urge Council right now to tonight or when you make this decision either to deny the application or defer it some of these questions are answered because we just don't know we haven't had those conversations and we've been doing this for about two years now two years ago we met with one of our neighbors in the backyard with the West Salem neighborhood association to talk about this we would like to have more conversations about this in terms of what's going to happen next because honestly the donkeys don't know what's going to happen to their free I don't know what's going to happen to my property in terms of whether I'm going to have to pay for a new sewer connection and I feel like I should know going forward what that's going to mean so again Mr Mayor counselors I thank you for your attention but I agree with the comments that have been come before in terms of this simply is not a fully thought out plan at this point even though I know a lot of work has happened thus far I thank you very much for the time thank you for your testimony Penny kids adopted because everything I would have said is all right thank you Ron rodahanel if you'd introduce yourself for the record please good evening hi I'm Ronald rodhamel 2488 Emerald Drive Northwest and with my wife Mary Gaines own a Polk Tree Farm where we have resided for over 30 years but we share a common boundary with a proposed development over 600 linear feet are South Boundary or the development's North Boundary and we understand the need of the city for provide additional rental housing units completely and want to be good neighbors I am a civil engineer in Oregon and own a Consulting business the issue of appeal really concerns the preservation of large oak trees more than a dozen along our common boundary line several over 30 inches in diameter and all of them should be preserved not just some planning staff report to council tonight States on page five that no other design alternatives are found that will save trees I disagree there are these may be accomplished by my revision to the setback of grading limits and construction of small segmented concrete block retaining walls very common to protect the oak trees many have since we're growing before Europeans ever lived nearby additional efforts are feasible and must be made to preserve these oak trees as required by section 808 the code Titans development can proceed with minor adjustments and resolution of this issue is a win-win situation for both the Titan Hill development and dash and a date adjacent neighbors and within the ability of council to require additional thank you for my comments Brief Review of my comments I appreciate that and Jamie uh did a very good job and thorough and very responsive I want to tell you that she's done a lot of work too so thank you for your testimony thank you Mike Freitas mayor Hawaiian City councilors hello for those who do not know me I am Michael Freitas I'm the West Salem neighborhood and I'm here tonight to discuss the Titan Hill development plan there has been written testimonies on both sides and people discussing the issues tonight it is my opinion there has been enough questions raised on the legality of the issues that we cannot just move this plan forward at this time without further discussion and review I respectfully ask that all of you act as jurors and send this back to the planning department and instruct them to meet with all parties and discuss each of these issues before returning to this I would recommend a formal meeting with all parties to discuss each issue and allow a constructive approach in resolving these issues as I close I would like to remind all of you that your tasked tonight is not to judge whether this project is good or bad or the appropriate project for West your duty tonight is to judge whether the applicant fully met the burden of proof outlined in Oregon land use laws required by Council rule 19. thank you for taking time to listening to my neighbors and myself and I'm glad you're all open to all conversations thank you again for listening thank you for your testimony Ken Bailey thank you very much counselors uh Council mayor Hoy my name is Ken beerley I'm chair of the Glenn Gibson Creek Watershed Council reside at 2308 tarmigan Street Northwest in ward 8. I have a master's degree in botany and I've been practicing ecologists for 45 years but I've heard from an engineer I've heard from a veteran who've basically made my case The Watershed Council has participated with the West Salem neighborhood in providing comments on the proposed project on doakes Ferry Road we focused on the aspects of the project that affect the functions of the Watershed our the staff has considered our comments and have reduced the impact by a small amount through the city applied conditions and we focused our most recent comments in a letter dated June 30th or June 20th sorry we haven't gotten to June 30th yet 2023 so it should be in your packet The Watershed Council recognizes the right of the developer and the landowner to develop under the comprehensive plan zoning designation and development codes within the City of Salem we also recognize that there is a balance of competing goals for housing for the environment Environmental Conservation and for neighborhood livability and it's kind of your job to balance those are competing goals that the City of Salem has adopted as policy the zoning of the 24 and a half acre property allows for construction of between 15 and 31 dwelling units per acre that's 368 to 761 units The Proposal before you is to approve 436 dwelling units on the 24 and a half in a way the Watershed council is playing The Lorax we're speaking for the trees the proposal to remove 42 significant trees includes at least three Oregon White Oaks with diameters between 50 and 66 inches these trees were here before Europeans were here our argument with the proposal is the lack of balance between development interest and environmental and neighborhood interests there is a clear scientific effort evidence that mature trees have a significantly greater effect than carbon sequestration water quality protection heat island reduction and diverse wildlife habitat values than any plantings to replace them by allowing the removal of 42 significant trees from the cities the city is demonstrating that the developers housing goals take precedence over other goals that the city has so as I have 14 seconds left I think it's important specifically for this project that the council recognizes that their is balancing among the competing goals that the city has and we would urge thank you Mr Bailey here I apologize thank you for your time thank you em easterly good evening mayor council members em easterly Ward 8. I ask that the approval of the Titan Hill project be denied or suspended until the application contains the complete and required SRC 205.030a boundary information specifically subsections of the Salem revised code require the applicant to identify and submit quote the boundaries dimensions and area of each proposed lot or parcel and the location in width the names of all existing streets of budding the perimeter of the subject property the applicants submissions do not include all the above cited information and contrary to the planning administrators May 10th approval decision the Titan Hill project does not meet the requirements of SRC 205.030a 4 and 5. missing information and conflicting data undermine the application distant measurements can change without explanation between the council approved 2021 zone change map and the subdivision development application map submitted in the submitted Graphics show no survey monuments accurate roadway center lines and widths are absent last Friday I submitted 24 pages in five documents detailing the applicant's failure to comply with Salem subdivision application requirements please I ask you no I ask you to think yourselves to the applicant comply with all the city submission requirements did City staff in an effort to support a complex application skip over the requirements of SRC 205030a these questions are neither nor trivial they focus on the Titan Hill applicants legal obligation to conform to the Salem revised code standards and criteria I welcome your questions and ask that the hearing be held open so both the applicant and council members can review all of the evidence submitted thank you thank you for your testimony that concludes the list of folks who have signed up is there anybody who didn't get a chance to sign up did you want to testify yes come on up to the microphone please introduce yourself for the record and your address push the green button green button's on you're good to go yes I didn't mean to do this but please I'm Robert Chandler I live in Ward 8 which I found out tonight um I I live about a half a mile from this intersection from Orchard Heights and doakes Ferry and I see dozens of young people walking on doakes ferry headed north on the west side of the street and I have not personally seen any of them hit by a car yet but I am worried is that what happened between bicycles and pedestrians it's pretty tricky and if I understand what's going on they're going to be probably thousands of additional people in that area with the number of units we're looking at and the household so one of the things for the council to make sure is that the plan has enough um Road adaptation and change to make it safe for those young people please thank you for your testimony is there anybody else who wanted to testify all right counselor Stapleton I'm just wondering if we can take a little break before we go into questions we can't we actually have uh applicant rebuttal first can we do that and then do the break it sounds great thanks you bet we'll go to applicant rebuttal they have five minutes and then we'll go to a break and then we'll go to questions be sure and hit that button for me and introduce yourself again for",

        "text": " i just want you're gonna get this afterwards i'm just going to give you a high level of what's going on here so this first one is talking about um the fact that a lot of cous that are getting their power from bpa are already getting low carbon low cost energy and so they just want to think about the value proposition there next one is basically the same idea um of those low costs yeah they're not grouped they're just literally in the order in which things or at least that i copied and pasted and so project funding taking into account retail rate impacts this is kind of along the same lines of what we've been talking about in the guidelines um someone suggested re-capitalizing the small-scale energy loan program and targeting public entities so this one is dealing with the fact that a lot of uh the uh bpa territory they have limits on what they can put on the grid so just some paths forward and the want of a lot of these communities to produce more there we go and then this one it came um actually we got a couple suggestions for this about um inserting generation for capacity in um this uh legislation um and then also uh looking to revise the dual use and agriculture on all um soil classes um and work for sorry i'm having my notes are blocked by face um pilot projects for utilities to work with communities um to have small scale projects and contribute to um past hb 2520 from the 2021 session um fund dlcd to create rules for goal 14 13 in order to implement um plan here um i'm sorry i'm just going to read this one because it's hard to paraphrase plans directed towards energy conservation within the planning area should consider as a major determinant the existing and potential capacity of the renewable energy sources to yield useful energy output and then um full property tax exemptions for tribal energy projects um or guide to revenue share agreements with local prohibiting double taxation on tribal energy infrastructure get instant incentives for expedited tnd interconnection for tribal energy additional state funding incorporating more small scale renewable projects instead of requiring utility customers to support small-scale projects through utility rates making sure that small projects do meet performance metrics to help with reliability on the grid and a clearer picture of what the state's long-term goals are regarding small-scale energy projects and again this slide presentation will posted so you can read through the um text of all of these later but just in an effort to be concise i am just giving the top level here all right so these are the data and information gaps that were identified by you all um on the form so this is the next question on the form that christy sent out um so this first one is looking for greater transparency into the existing projects in the state um and so is the second one and then wanting to see more um levelized cost of energy figures in the discussion um in a similar vein um checking to see if avoided cost schedules have actually tracked with actual costs over time and then making sure we adequately describe the additional benefits of small-scale projects beyond their power benefits um and this one is requesting a economic analysis that compares the costs and benefits from larger scale and smaller scale renewable projects and again give me the data love to do it uh this one is looking at the different models of ownership wanting to explore that more and i know it's been mentioned already today as well um examples of financially successful agrovoltaic projects in other that's um how does someone who wants to develop a larger solar ray connect with developers and also utilities willing to purchase um want more information on tribal perspectives on distribution level demand side management small skill generation aggregation and formation of managed vpps it is this is the last page so that is that's what you guys submitted um anything that came in this morning i did not have time to add in so i apologize for that but let's move it to getting this going so what we're playing what our plan here is sorry chrissy did you have i just like well i just wanted to acknowledge a comment that came in just that there were a lot of comments focused on costs and not benefits to communities or resilience and this is just a reminder as we move into these breakouts if things are missing from that list and from the list that you'll also see we've gathered from previous meetings where people have brought things up we want to hear that other perspective so please help us solve that imbalance and then i'll i'll stop interrupting next yeah yeah no and also um i i think the question was phrased um recommendations what recommendations do you have that haven't been brought up um so maybe people were just seeing that those were things that had not yet been brought up and that's why they brought them up there um but yes please do take this opportunity in the breakout session to bring up anything that has not already been brought up um discuss pros and cons of these different recommendations that you develop in the breakout group remember that this is the spaghetti we're throwing it all at the wall and we're going to talk about pros and cons around each of these um in general what we noticed is we were putting together the outline that the recommendations that you guys had thrown out in um earlier workshops they kind of fell into these um four categories obviously this is not anything that we're gonna we're married to but this is just how logically we were kind of approaching it so for the purposes of this and organization please break out your recommendations into contracting and land use interconnection and transmission and other you're going to have an odo rep in your room who's going to take notes and they're going to feed them into the presentation at the end of the breakout and then we're gonna discuss as a group um and talk about these different pros and cons and different recommendations that we discuss in this breakout session so the breakout session is gonna go for 45 um and we will come back and discuss at the end of that so linda if you want to go ahead and start the breakout groups that would be wonderful so hi everyone that i'm seeing in this group wondering if this is our final group i see mike mcarthur um make sure i say your name correctly is that is it zephora zapoor it's the pure it's a pure great because you can call me z i think i'm easier well i am wendy simons i work at odo and uh please uh give me a little bit of patience with this i have not been part of this uh particular uh work group or haven't followed it up to this time but i i have worked on several different projects that so that touch these issues so i'm i'm not completely unfamiliar with the issues but i may need to ask for a little bit of help here and there and i'm also i'm in my daughter's room which is the coolest room in our house that's why i have this really lovely seafoam green background and some funny pictures on the wall um and uh with that let me just note down who we've got in our group i'll be taking notes and um forward that on to some of the others who are working on this as i understand it our assignment i'm just here to hear from from work group members um so i'll be just asking uh this group to share with me what recommendations you see that you think uh should be included in the report and we can talk a little um or share with me what some of the pros and cons are of some of those recommendations and then i'll try to group them under i think we've got some categories of contracting and rates land use so nice to see everybody stephanie i might have done something i shouldn't have done and i used red but i have written into the slides which are that's fine that's great that actually was a very good idea i am having to open up my email real quickly to email my groups over um so i don't know how we want to do this um just my experience in my group you're you're still quiet yeah oh yeah we can't hear you but orianna wants to speak for you anyway so yeah no my cue to tag in here oh yeah he says there's too many notes for the slide deck i think is what he was trying to get out oh okay um so i mean we have multiple pages of on each topic if you want um adam i know you're going to insert those real quick so maybe we just start on contracting and rates and adam in lifetime can start adding in i think each group was emailing him our so we can just start with what's already in there and kind of just start talking about those does that work for everybody and he'll be adding in each group's conversation as we're talking can you hear me a little bit i think orianna's game to present for your group i don't know if you guys are but you're supposed to we were group one but i kind of am thinking that adam goes and enters in each group's thoughts onto one slide so we don't have to have each group present we can just start talking about the overarching theme if that works for you guys to save a little bit of time yeah that sounds good okay so he's gonna be working on these and hopefully they show up on my screen as he's typing them we'll find out we're going to test this in real time so let me share my slides just one second sorry i'm not quite as adept at all of this so i think what we're proposing because i'm getting some a question from another staff or an odo is actually reporting out from each group but just doing it by um no i was just gonna have adam insert everything to the slides and we don't really do it by group we just kind of talk about all the recommendations oh okay i mean if that works yeah just somebody suggested we share out and i saw it on my screen but okay okay if we want to report out we can do that while he thinks so um let me stop sharing my screen so i can access my notes because i was group one and we did not elect somebody else to present because that was we were just too busy okay so my group was ryan davies james valdez and tom mcfartlet and we mostly focused on interconnection and transmission and other so um the first suggestion or recommendation we had was meter aggregation allowing for a single interconnection point for multiple users and other states have done it for example right now in iou territory it's limited to a single owner for an",

        "text": " of these work activities up and down the west coast and some of the benefits of supporting or some of the benefits of that port diversification would be you know they were raised here on the side diversifying risk optimizing costs distribute the economic development benefits too so maybe more jobs in different spots coordination of multiple ports in different states you know if it did get kind of distributed more there would need to be a lot of coordination um that was some of the feedback we heard um we've heard some interest i think communities up in the puget sound area who could potentially do this work oregon communities of course um and there could be existing regional bodies that could take on a coordination the nexus of the location and the grid interconnection which is kind of more of an energy component like where the cables come me meet the onshore grid um you know we just asked if there could be any synergies there and we got a lot of feedback saying that there wouldn't wouldn't expect it to be any um and the interconnection could occur away from ports um where away from where the developments of the o m services could be deployed from so and then when we're looking at sea vessels here's an illustration that kind of shows the scale of some of these designs for floating platforms and how they can be delivered to ports for assembly with turbine structure good good kind of visual just to kind of level set everybody on what we're talking about um so vessels capable of supporting the transportation of these components um they have relatively unique shapes and sizes we would likely require specialized vessels definitely hurt feedback supporting that global supply chain is currently limited with these vessels just as you would expect not a lot of demand for for these specialized vessels and then there's also jones act considerations people are curious about it's a u.s maritime law that requires vessels transporting merchandise between two u.s points to be u.s flag meaning the vessel must be registered under u.s laws and so this requirement could apply to vessels transporting wind turbine blades for example or or floating platforms um and from what i've gathered there's a relatively limited number of these that said there was feedback from a few folks on the development pipeline for these specialized vessels and the orders have been placed you know to kind of keep up with the demand seen in europe and other parts of the country out on the east coast shipping routes and port access floating offshore wind could cause port congestion that was flagged as a potential area of arizona potential it was an area of concern that was flagged for potential study there's a us coast guard studying the west coast vessel traffic and port so that could help get a better understanding of that and then there was also feedback that kind of talked about how that could be worked around you know different schedules for different vessel traffic the us coast guard study was interesting i looked into that a little bit more it is not solely related to offshore wind but it's it's on the list of motivations for the study and some of the other motivations were just increases in shipping traffic generally and larger vessels that have accommodation constraints so there's a trend in the shipping industry for larger vessels and then also um that coast guard study cited forecasts for increasing increased development of aquaculture farms marine sanctuaries potential lng export terminals all in addition to the potential for offshore wind developments as well so lots of different motivations that kind of have a nexus with some of the themes we talked about today citing and permitting and marine ecosystems and aquaculture and other energy considerations so that u.s coast guard study i'm not sure when the timing that is but i'm going to keep my eyes out for that that would be helpful and then you know hopefully that wasn't too high level but we got a lot of feedback on this topic and we're hoping to hear a little more i'll turn it to ruchi and i can also um you know we're kind of experimenting here but if it's helpful to stay on this to get the keep the mind on the topic and recap then i'll leave it here maybe i'll i'll turn it back here for a um so here's the time to sort of um think about if you have additional input if you have um other information or perspectives that might differ from the themes and and kind of the the common feedback that that jason synthesized if you have some elaboration on a certain point that he made or wanted to emphasize a point related to port infrastructure and sea vessels um if you have ideas for future studio engagement on this topic or new thoughts and then you can go to the next slide and i'll paste these um into the chat as well so you can see them and here's the summary of the themes that he went over a reminder for those of you on the phone that you can hit star three to raise your hand and then when we call on you you can hit star six to unmute uh yourself just checking the chat here i see there's a comment from janet that i'll read out loud coos bay has very fine sediments channel deepening and widening would adversely impact the estuary the state has already said that the coos bay estuary management plan needs to be updated to comply with the coastal zone management act but coos county has dropped the ball on that is what janet will these projects comply with the czma also the state has already made it clear they don't support channel modification projects and has pulled funding the permitting process has been paused for a long time thanks for that um comment and question i welcome any of the um partners and other organizations that we have on the line to respond if you'd like otherwise we'll definitely note this um comment down yeah richie this is andy i'll just respond to that by saying that this is not a topic that i'm a specialist on so i would need to confer with my colleagues within dlcd who have been working with coos bay and following the estuary management plan update so it's something i'm happy to investigate and get back to you on thanks andy janet if you are comfortable putting your contact information in the chat or emailing andy directly it sounds like he might have some follow-up that could be helpful for your question richie this is representative brock go ahead i didn't hear all of the all of the question or comment and i apologize but uh as far as the channel deepening um i might i believe that we were in securing the 15 million in this last session and in the last friday to go towards that project and in the matching federal to match the federal um i'll just add uh representative rocksmith um the question was from janet it's in the chat if you want to look at it but the um specifics were uh talking about coos bay having very fine sediments and channel deepening and widening would adversely attack the um and then the real question was around sort of whether projects would need to comply with czma and um so you can you can kind of see those other details in there if you'd like thank you jason i think another screen just popped up unfortunately um okay there's another question here from kathy can turbines be assembled along the columbia willamette like in portland and barged or shipped um jason has your literature review um suggested an answer to that otherwise i'd open it up to any of the other state um or other organizations on the line that we're consulting with on this too yeah i can take a a quick shot at that from what i understand um there's bridges and and those have height and i'm not sure you know how far back they come i think i think they start out pretty much down by astoria um and so those are kind of a limiting factor there but other pieces could um get built and transported just that assembly once you were to attach like the tower um that kind of restricts your ability to move it move it from that point to get underneath the bridges all right thanks jason thanks kathy check to see if there's any hand raised while questions or comments continue to come in from the chat um not seeing any hand raised yet but i do see a question from mike in the chat the process of environmental review for citing and leasing without first conducting a programmatic eis is contrary to all other agencies um his first comment it leaves open the question of environmental and economic impacts until the final stage of the process by which point developers may have invested millions further for fishermen and ngos it creates a black hole of knowledge about what to expect for protected or esa species and continuing viability for a large portion of the seafood industry thanks for that comment mike see another um comment in the chat from david brings up a good question at what point in the i think construction is the tower placed on the platform at a moored location or before i think i think there could be very variations to that um and that's just just from what i know i don't know if we have any developers on the phone that might be able to answer that um but as i understand it you know it's just kind of where does it make sense to do that most economically and efficiently well i just if i can add jason it also um it's one of the economic benefits to the region and the in the construction and the jobs associated with the construction of the of the uh the turbines down here that's a great point thank you for that um andy just in case you didn't see it it looks like janet put her um contact information in there about the planning department and dlcd grant deadline i'm not sure if anyone from um the ports or any of the ports are on the line but you're welcome to sort of raise your hand or add to the chat if you have some more specific knowledge about some of these themes from the comments based on your experience working um with a port in oregon checking to see if we have any raised so a bit of a pause here i'm not seeing any raised hands any more questions or comments in the chat that are of interest to share out um just a reminder on some of the prompts that we have on these themes if there's information or perspectives that differ from the the themes that we've seen from comments so far if there's elaboration or emphasis on a different aspect of one of these comments or if you have ideas for future study or engagement based on some of these or you know just some new thoughts that aren't here oh i do see",

something different is that any better no you might have to go oh go ahead oh no as i said it's still the same if you in slideshow oh there you go so i'm still not seeing tom he just said that he is not in yet so my email and phone and tom's email and phone should be on the oto website for this program so i think if anybody tries to connect and can't get in most likely will hear from them so i'll i'll be trying to watch my email closely great thank you well it's 902 stacy should we officially get started um yeah go ahead i i'll check on tom and see if he's able to get on i'm not sure if he's having trouble okay great are our audience members here uh looks like we have 11 a 10 13 attendees so far great thank you i will get started then uh welcome everybody to our hb 3141 self-direct rule making stakeholder my name is andy cameron i'm the energy efficiency and conservation manager here at odo and i'll be joined by a few that as we get going can introduce themselves before we do that let me do a brief overview of our agenda as i mentioned before we'll introduce ourselves and a little bit about our role in this program and then we'll cover some background information on the public purpose charge and hb 3141 we'll then examine the changes and impacts on self-direction and then dive a little bit into the rule making process as it unfolds over this current fall and we'll be sure to save some time at the end for discussion and opportunities for us to gather input and answer questions as well as generate a follow-up list before we get into the overview i'll let my colleagues introduce themselves we'll start with wendy simons our rulemaking good morning everybody uh my name is andy simons i am as andy said the rulemaking coordinator who is working on this which means i will be helping to run the rulemaking process which i'll talk about a little bit later in the agenda as well as helping to write the the rules the um some of the changes to the rules for this program and i've i've worked on a previous rulemaking for this for this program so i have some familiarity with with the program as great thank you wendy we're also joined by christy split kristy would you like to introduce sure hi there i'm the oregon department of energy government relations coordinator and i also am here just to listen and hear if there's concerns and make sure that we follow up and just know that we're here to talk offline too if there's anything that comes up today and you want to chat about it not here thank you christy we'll also be joined by tom elliott he's our program lead for the self-direct program tom's having a little bit of technical difficulty so when he arrives i'll be sure to pause and let tom introduce himself also before we begin i do want to say that this meeting is being recorded and will be above available for viewing at a later time on odo's website perhaps when we get to the rule making aspects wendy can offer a little more clarity on how to access this presentation so to start us off we'll talk a little bit about the the background of house bill 3141 this slide depicts some of the the core aspects of the bill first of all it extends the public purpose charge for another 10 years with a sunset date of january 1st 2036. it also reduces the public purpose charge from 3 of revenues to 1.5 percent collected from the ratepayers of both pge and pacific power the bill moves cost effective energy efficiency work from the public purpose charge and those funds paid within the rates of pg and pacific power customers the bill also adds language in the renewable section to allow the funds to be used for what's being called distribution system connected technology and you'll often hear that referred to as diskit the definition of diskit will come from the oregon puc they'll provisionally define it for 2022 with some permanent definitions to follow these technologies support reliability resilience and integration of renewable energy within the distribution system here we have a summary table of the the current state of things under sb 1149 and some of the changes brought by house bill 3141 first of all the collected amounts go from 3 of customer revenue to 1.5 percent and as we go through this table in subsequent discussions it's important to keep in mind that many of these programs largely remain whole even though the change and can often look a little confusing in the current system school districts receive the first 10 percent of the collected revenues changes brought about by the bill will have them receive 0.3 percent of revenues of the 1.5 percent collected customer amounts and really uh they do remain whole 20 of the 1.5 does mathematically equal out to 10 of the original three low income weatherization uh under the 11.7 percent uh goes to those programs under 31.41 that's 0.55 percent uh low-income housing received some percentage changes as well going from 4.5 percent to 0.14 it looks like tom is still having some difficulties so i'll do my best to go through the the self-direct changes is really why we're here to have this uh currently under sb 1149 the self-direct program conservation portion 56.7 percent one of the biggest changes from this bill is cost-effective energy efficiency largely goes away from the public purpose charge and is collected in rates from all retail electricity customers on the renewable side of things we're going from 17.1 percent to 75 percent of the percent renewable energy and distribution system technology amounts uh before we get into a deeper discussion we thought it would be useful to go over some of the the definitions and supporting documents this presentation will be posted on oda's website and again wendy can walk through how to access that during the rulemaking portion but there are some important links here offering additional information so first of all you'll often hear self-direct referred to as lekpet and that's an acronym for a large electric consumer public purpose program and self directors billy the the terminology for purchases of renewable energy and energy conservation for own sites rather than remitting the portion of public purpose charge that is designated for those purposes we have a link to the 3141 enrolled bill on the ola's website and the nod that the sections one and two contain changes to the ppc other links that offer helpful background are odo's own let pep page the administrative rules and the rule making process specifically for this bill an excellent overview of the public purpose charge and the dollar allocations can be found in our 1719 legislative report here we have a process overview of the the the current way that the self-direct program works sites with an average annual one average megawatt usage can register with odo the agency will then review and approve the registration projects can be submitted to odo which will again go through a review and approval process and the site implements the project and applies for credit with odo the follow-up work at the utility end those folks enter monthly data in the public purpose charge obligation into the database the green tag process or rex combines some of those middle steps a little bit more on the the process side and a more text heavy slide that i'll leave up for additional clarification uh offers a little bit more detail on those so here's a bit of a recap of some of the the key takeaways from house bill offering a bit of urgency to our process is an operative date of january 1st 2022 on the renewable side of things we have again the distribution system connected with a definition pending from puc puc and oto are working with the energy trust of oregon to maintain a consistent definition for the sites in all stakeholders and then we have self-direct limited to 75 percent with 25 percent carve out for low and moderate income on the conservation side of things the public purpose charge conservation aspect is essentially gone and that's again recovered through rates so the sites will have the same registration process and it is odo's intent to offer the greatest continuity and between the old and the new on the renewable side of things the distribution system connected offer a new eligible category for renewable portion of the ppc the process to submit and review is again the same as the current way of doing things sites may self-direct only 75 percent with 25 going to low and moderate income there's no change to the green tag process though the burn rate may be slower due to the low and moderate on the conservation side of things the public purpose charge is essentially but site credit balances roll to energy efficiency on january 1st cost effective energy efficiency is recovered through rates and the same submit and review process with a continual one to ten year simple payback method in the approval process you know that remains the same and with that i'll turn it over to wendy simons to walk us through the rule making process that's unfolding over this current fall hi again uh so as the role making coordinator i will be working to kind of um take care of the various steps in this process just looking at the attending list it looks like many of you are very familiar with state agency rules and the rulemaking process uh some of you may not be um but basically uh state agency rules are the way that state agencies fill in the details from uh from statute and bills that are passed by the and often set up guidelines and processes for four agencies to follow and participants and programs to follow so in this case uh as andy mentioned we are doing our best to preserve continuity for participants in the program so we do have a number of changes that will be need to need to be made to the rules but in many cases it will be kind of adding some of the eligible uses for uh diskid or distribution system connected technologies and just making sure um that we're very clear about uh kind of the definitions and then the names of the different uh portions of the public purpose charge and",

        "text": " okay please come come up have a seat speak into it good evening I'm Phil Brady and live in the Dallas Oregon and I am a wasow county commissioner so y got a couple question questions first uh as a comment I find it interesting and a good thing actually that the applicant kind of drops out of the process or takes a backseat to the process in that latter half and why I would say that as a good thing is um from the public understanding it's you know the it's now the uh OD representing the applicant to the FSC and so it's not like the applicants can't push in there am I is that the way it's designed am I over interpreting this take okay all right I'm going to do my best and if I am wrong Todd will quickly correct me but we are we are support staff for the council so our role is not to represent the applicant it's really to give an objective review of the application and whether or not it meets Council standards and that is our role from Once the application is submitted the compl application is submitted then our role is to do that evaluation and prepare that information for Council I guess what I would want to clarify is we're not there to represent the applicant from that process on they have their role as well would they have a role in in later during like the proposed order and the contested case when we go to the public hearing on the draft proposed order There's an opportunity for the app to make comments at that public hearing after the public has commented and they can also respond to comments that are made in that public hearing and then if it goes to contested case there's also a role okay got a couple more questions I'm not Jing here but um so so as Wasco County Commissioner we will be part of this special Advisory Group yes is it our turn to participate stay with that slide this is it our turn to participate in the public hearing there in the middle block you can but also as a as a special Advisory Group you're in those little kind of blue green boxes at the bottom you have we have a responsibility and a role to coordinate with you through out that process and you can provide us comments as you see fit it is important though if you have an issue that you might want to pursue through a contested case that you make those comments on the record of the draft proposed order in that order in noticing that we did get notice today so we're we're on that okay and following up and this was can I can I respond a little bit to that one as well just because it's I think it's important so you know at the notice of intent stage which is where we're at right now is we're seeking public comment you know and that includes agencies um so the the one slide which had kind of the Bull's eyes with the study area and Analysis area this is also something that you know the county um can be very valuable at because you have you know a good geographic information system you know the maps you know the issues out there you could say look your sort of predetermined area for this resource is a half a mile we think you should go beyond that or you know as Kate said can either increase those or Shrink those based upon information that we get on the record but that's what's helpful for us to know what else is out there is there anything that we're not aware of that we could be missing so so sort of at the notice of intend stage you know we're going to be like okay what's what are your land use requirements what are we what do we need to include in the project order from the county then when we're reviewing the preliminary application we want to know from the county they submitted all this information about the local land use ordinances did they get it right is it complete is it not complete and then when we get to the point where we're writing the draft proposed order which is functionally like a staff report it's you know we're looking at the the the project against the standards we want your input as well particularly on the the the L the local land use ordinances to say not only did we have the right list of them but are we evaluating it properly how would you evaluate it if you were doing the review we want your input to make sure that we're getting that right are we putting the right conditions on are we interpreting things correctly that's where we want the County's input you can certainly participate you know kind of Beyond if you don't like what we did if you don't agree with what we did you can provide comments on the draft proposed order you can participate in the contested case but prior to that where we really really need you to help us so let me clarify I and clarify for the sake of the public too so when you say the county I'm thinking of two kinds of things one is are very capable planning department and codes enforcement department and so that they and and for example if this was located a little some slightly different land that would include all the scenic area codes that the county would would be applying because that's what they do but another meaning of the county is the public the people in the County so I could imagine people would come to county commissioner and say hey this is what I think and is that also a route that you invite people to make participate you know the you know a citizen's input being drawn through come through the county or would you pre prefer that to happen at the public hearing or both uh we certainly don't have any preference so if the if the citizens of the county want to Lobby you know you as County Commissioners to provide comment on the record they are you know more than willing to do that or more than able to do that and you you can pursue those as well they can also submit comments through our public comment time frame okay so that's really kind of a local how how the local process is going to work good um does in order to have standings at a contested case does the issue to be contested have to be an issue that is raised previously or can you raise one issue and then learn something and contest something else sure yeah I didn't expect it yeah I mean the the short answer is it has to be raised at the draft proposed order stage so we will um provide a notice um that the draft proposed order has been issued and that time frame which will include an open public comment time frame and a public hearing you know could be here could be in the Dallas but in the vicinity of the project um you know whether it's a oral comment or a written comment that would have to be made within that comment time frame and it's raise it or wave it so you can't then later on um try to participate in the contest a case on an issue you didn't raise it has to be raised during that time frame and it has to be related to a council standard so the standards that we included and it has to be sufficiently specific enough that between the draft proposed order stage and the proposed order stage we can evaluate it you know it can't just be a placeholder you know we don't think you met this it has to be why and that then gives us the staff the opportunity to make changes between the draft proposed order and the proposed order it gives the applicant an opportunity to respond and provide new information in the record and it also allows the council to evaluate that when they're reviewing the draft proposed order and providing feedback to staff so thank you raise it or wave it at the draft proposed order stage I have two more questions but this is for the team here okay thank you very much um first question is so the tie ends the genti will be at 270 uh 230 kilol line what does that look like is that a wooden Pole or is that a bigger power bigger Tower uh they'll either be wooden poles or steel poles okay but it's not it's not the big ones it's the typical ones we have no you're not to see like the big lattice types tow is what you're referring to right that's what I want to clarify since you and then this is kind of a personal question if I can U since you're working in Texas how does Oregon's permitting process compare to Texas which I understand is kind of like Anarchy I guess I wouldn't characterize as Texas's permitting um as Anarchy I would characterize it as sort of ultimate local control for example the project that we're um under construction on now it just achieved mechanical completion meaning it it looks like it's going to look uh we're just sort of tightening bolts and and getting ready to energize um that one was a letter from the judge that said go forth and prosper um so uh you know there's there's a reason folks tend to start their developments in Texas um when when they a new independent power producer you tend to be able to move faster the interconnection process with the utilities is still challenging and and and slow U but permitting is is usually not the the largest hurdle operating there and I mean I think with the organ FC um being a standards based highly procedural process with you know a a a known course of action and responsibilities um yes it's lengthy um and and expensive but ultimately I think it you know provides a ton of opportuni for public input um for the developers to uh respond to that that input and work with the approving agencies and ultimately the the the council um to hopefully get to a successful outcome so um advantages to each um I think that uh those are definitely bookends though yeah wow so we have a lot of good protections here thank you thank you is there anyone else in the room that wants to ask a question or make a comment and if not we'll move on to the webinar and while Nancy's doing that I'll just say we're happy you know once we're kind of concluded and we're starting to wrap up if anybody wants to stick around and ask any individual questions to to Kate or or myself or or the applicant team we'll be around as well to answer any questions you have all right well at this time I don't see any hands raised but let me just remind everyone who is participating online how they would go about raising a question or making a comment so um if you are on the webinar you're going to go ahead and look at the bottom of the main window on the right and there's a set of icons click on the participants and that will raise your hand there's a little hand icon so that",

        "text": " fish and wildlife habitat impacts extends from the site boundary out to a half a mile so this means that the applicant and the notice of intent needs to evaluate fish and wildlife habitat and species out to a half mile from that site boundary similarly for Wildfire risk they need to evaluate vegetation and risk out to a half mile and so forth so this is It's something we think is quite important for the notice of intent and it's a part of our Outreach with the reviewing agencies and the special advisory groups as they have the local knowledge of the resources so we're working very closely to see are these study areas adequate to capture the impacts very importantly are Jackson County and City of Medford where we're really wanting to make sure that the land use and public services evaluation and the study areas is adequate for members of the public are welcomed weigh in and comment on resources in the same way that we ask reviewing agencies and special advisory groups any resources that you're aware of that you feel should be protected or that you have knowledge of you are welcome to provide that in your comments um there are many topics that our permitting process doesn't cover doesn't require an evaluation of um so this is why you really need to understand the applicable requirements and this process and whether your issue or your concern is connected to a regulatory requirement that then allows it to be incorporated and under the council under the jurisdiction of the council and considered in this permitting process as Kate mentioned we're accepting public comments on the notice of intent through July 7th and the intent of that comment period is to seek input on your concerns of the impacts that you believe might be occurring or could occur from the sighting the construction and operation of this proposed project both options please do try to be as detailed as possible with your comments if you have concerns try to identify the standard or the requirement you believe that issue is connected to for example if you're concerned that one of the routes might impact your farming operation or your farming practices if you could explain how you believe that the project the sighting the construction or operation would impact your farming practice please provide enough information to support that so we can figure out how we can incorporate that in and all comments are provided to the applicant they're made publicly on the comment portal but it's as the the more clear and detailed you can be the better ability we enough can have in evaluating those concerns and considering scoping of an environmental impact assessment or even okay and then the next slide please I'll just briefly cover our complicated land use standard and process as Kate had mentioned there are 16 standards or regulatory requirements that are those of the energy facility citing Council and that every developer seeking a site certificate has to evaluate and demonstrate compliance in order to get approval of the site one of those standards is the land use standard and this is the standard where we're in what we incorporate all of the applicable requirements from the affected local jurisdictions or from the city of Medford and Jackson County we would incorporate that applicable local criteria into the process and Duty evaluation so in our process it's a little unique where our rules allow a developer to say I'd rather go to the county for this land use review they can choose to do that and then bring that review and potentially approval through our process we haven't yet had a developer choose that option to date and for this project the applicant has maintained the land use review through the state process although they have until the time they submit the application to change their minds should they choose to do that um of Interest this facility is proposed to cross numerous zones Zone districts and overly districts you have two jurisdictions City of Medford Jackson um with all of these different zones districts overlays there's numerous requirements that will have to be evaluated which is why we're really intending to work closely with the city and county to make sure that evaluation adequate accurate and consistent with how they might do things here and with that I will hand it back over to Kate to give some details about the proposed facility thank you very much so I have a couple more slides and then I am going to turn it over to the project work moment so okay we're on the right side so as you all know if you're here in the meeting we did as we noted received the notice of intent on April 27th there are two proposed drought Alternatives in that notice of intent proponent specific power has indicated while they have two identified routes in their notice of intent their intent is to construct one of those rounds so we have the West alternative which is approximately 10 miles long and an East alternative which is approximately 12.1 miles long next slide and you may be familiar with this map and we do realize that uh due to the size of the format and also trying to incorporate 12 miles in in a graphic is difficult on the detail level but the orange line is the West alternative route and the purple line is the East alternative route as you can see one is closer to the City of Medford the other one is closer to what is the community of White City and the intent is to connect the line between the existing substation in Lone Pine to the existing substation in and it's a 230 KV proposed line which again is part of the reason why it falls into our review and jurisdiction by our Council next slide so we have two identified routes those proposed corridors are subject to change part of the public comment process and the scoping that the applicant is doing is to inform their final decision and determination of what those corridors might be if they decide to move forward and submit an application they can submit a modified and the applicant must consider public comments and selecting that Corridor and justifying it in their application an applicant for a site certificate for what is a jurisdictional transmission line must provide a corridor assessment as part of their application and as I noted they do have the ability to to make some tweaks and changes in that proposed route so if you're interested in this project and the potential for its design and final groups route proposal it would be imperative to to pay attention and provide input and and sign up for our update so you can find out when we get an application and when the Project's information comes up and I will lead at this point I am going to stop and I am going to introduce John let him talk a little bit about specific power in their proposal and their notice of intent and then when he's done I'll give a little bit more background on on how to provide comment we're going to open it up for public comment and questions and then we'll we'll take it from there and there's some more information I'll provide but welcome John thanks am I close enough can everybody hear me yeah my name is John anello I work for Pacific War we have from Pacific Court here tonight Cooper who is our regional business manager and uh the construction project manager who um where the line ends up being located he'll be out actually on the ground during construction a lot of the time and his name's Dave schober he's sitting over there we also have an army of support from Power Engineers there are Consultants on the project they are helping us gather all the information that what you just were presented on that F6 is going to require for us to justify the existence of the line as far as the impacts that it has on the um go ahead next slide we're a public utility so as a public utility we're required to serve the public we're required to serve the grid and deliver electricity safely and consistently throughout our service and because of the requirements we have planning guidance that are called transmission planning requirements and they come from uh Weck the Western Energy coordinating Council they give us issues and say if this substation were to be brought offline for whatever reason could you continue could you consistently serve power to your community if this transmission line were accidentally knocked off service could you consistently serve power if the answer to those questions is no we are required to come up with some way to serve power in the event of loss of whatever it is that they have asked us uh about the losses of again substations Transformers transmission lines so this project is a requirement because the current system down here if we lost one of our two substations or try Transformers in the substations or the lines that are go between those substations we could not serve the community and so in order to make sure that we can consistently serve the community this is a requirement we have to do something and the project that we've developed is this development of a new 230 line between these two Souls thanks you guys have already seen that there are two routes uh the East and the West um we've done tabletop studies to try to find the least impactful routes that we could offer to the f-sec process as you can imagine there is no route we can come up with that doesn't have impacts there's no routes that don't impact some property or owner or other but we do the best we can to try our best to minimize them and then through the f-sec process we're required to show that we've minimized or met mitigation requirements for the impacts that we still have um this is just a quick slide in case uh people are interested again our power is from the generator through the transmission lines it'll come through transmission substations and get dropped down in voltages that goes down to the community you'll have substations that are in your neighborhoods they drop the power further down and they run on distribution lines to your arm for this project both routes are going to have a variety of different structure types the most common structure type will be what we call the h-frame you can see it's kind of a letter H that's the two wooden holes with the X brace in between them um those are going to range up to about 80 or 90 feet high we have monopole structures and what we have a representation of is a monopole that has only one set of lines on it there is a section on the Eastern route that is called a double circuit the double circuit is going to be a Recon so there's an existing 115 kV line out there that line will be removed and replaced with a line that has 115 KV on one side of the structure and 230 KV on the other side so that structure will be a single pole but there'll be six wires on it instead of three um we've already she's already kind of touched",

brought up through email today so maybe you could um touch on that in your project update well thank you I'm Nicole Utes I'm the housing administrator for Salem housing authority and I did receive some great uh questions regarding our revisions to our um Section 8 plan and our a continued occupancy plan in regards to these waivers that we have continually progressed with being a moving to work agency and we um actually submitted for these waivers um back when we submitted our application and Housing and Urban Development said that they could take up to a year to decide if they would accept those waivers so as soon as we came forth just less than a month ago here to to have these plans reviewed so that we could start our new year into the moving to work agency they came back with an approval of these waivers they were so well written that they went ahead and approved them um that that says a lot but we also put up the case and I wanted to bring this up because there was fear that there could be potential fraud in anything that our agency does there can be potential fraud and we have to be alert all the time to different scenarios that could go on but our goal in mind is to be um Progressive to our tenants and our residents especially those trying to get into our program and how difficult these two can be a a barrier to getting in I'm not sure if you've ever had to put FMLA paperwork in at the doctor's office or various locations many of them are now charging for document production um and so this has become a hurdle for us to actually get the proper documentation and verification to get a minimal what we call a minimal deduction um for the client to to move forward in the process sometimes it's held him up from six to8 weeks waiting on uh pharmacies or doctor's office to get the this verification in um so we felt this was an important waiver to ask for the load also on our staff and our staffing capacity um this alleviates another step for this minimal deduction and of course um I had provided you with some documentation that our average households claiming child care's expenses uh in a total of 2351 in child care annually um that that would only reduce their rent by $59 a month um we would also take note that if a household had previous deductions or didn't have previous deductions and are now asking for the max allowable deduction then then we would request verification of those new um increase in those deductions so we do have some barriers and stop gaps to try to help eliminate fraud um but we also realize that this is going to that we're we're basically piloting this moving to work program and so when we report annually to Housing and Urban Development this is something we'll review of whether this is working for the agency or it's not working for the agency but it's supposed to be a benefit to both our clients and our staff in this situation thank you for that and um just to make clear to um the other counselors what I had asked uh was was if there was um what there might be potential abuse of self-reporting the amounts and that if that had any impact um would have significant impact and so as um Miss Utes explained um they have ways to to oversee that and not be concerned about that potential risk or at least they would be R it would be red flagged and they'd be able to see that and I should also add in other programs low-income housing tax credits allow for um asset ver assets up to 5,000 verification for self-certification so this isn't new new necessarily to our agency in monitoring for self- certifications thank you yeah thanks for bringing up that that question and I thought it was important to share with everybody else misss do you want to uh talk about the project report management report that you have yes thank you um first and foremost I want to say that we have successfully closed yina Hall into a permanent finance loan as of this morning the actual closing of that is completed so many people don't know and realize but we go from construction and we go into what we call a stabilization period and our goal is to get those uh stabilized within the project stabilized within a 3-month period of time and we've successfully completed stabilization into Yin Hall so for the first time in eight years of my life I do not have a yakin hall meeting on my calendar for that project and it it kind of feels unreal but we're very excited to get that into full operational status and into permanent financing uh for the agency and the members that live there I also wanted to highlight that on Wednesday into the evening from about 11:15 into the early morning hours we had a water incident of a tenant that left on unfortunately water in their sink running and I have to say that that Community has come together because there were 12 residents out there with their mops their towels everything helping to keep that water from going into other areas and and cleaning it up with before our mechanics could even arrive we even had one to bring a shop back out from their unit and hold it over our final fire panel system which saved us from a fire $5,000 expense so they've really come together and they're really a community that wants to keep that building in good condition and and help our agency out so would could have been a much larger expense for us to repair that and thankfully they were there to help us out um beyond that I want to say that Sequoia Crossings is well on track for grand opening on uh January 30th we do have about a 3-day delay due to weather um but that will just be the courtyard equipment that won't be installed for the grand opening event but we hope that everybody joins us on the 30th at 1M to help celebrate that beautiful project coming online and with that many people don't realize but we are actually our referrals are all coming from micr shelter transitional shelters or Sheltering locations so with Sequoia Crossing coming online we're going to be freeing up approximately 20 shelter Ling locations for the next three months until we hit full occupancy at 60 units so that'll um definitely help with uh movement in our Continuum of Care and we're very excited about probably the most excited about that um I also wanted to highlight that we are thrilled to report that as of November 30th 2023 sha has exceeded our housing placement goals for our rapid rehousing program through the uh Governor cotex executive order we have um not only exceeded our placement goals but we have only expended 68% of the budget what that was for that program the governor has extended the spin down date for these funds through June 30th of 2024 and we look forward to helping more individuals we're presently at 82 that we've housed so we've even housed more since this report date and time so that's uh great news and we look forward to continuing that work um we also have uh we intend to have in the next uh program management report a community outreach section so that that you all can understand all the different various community outreach events that Salem housing authority staff have been attending I wanted to highlight that Highland neighborhood association was one of them that we attended um recently they were so well received of our agency and sequa crossings and they have been sending us numerous resources for that project and we're so happy to be a part of that neighborhood along lines with that we also attended Northgate um neighborhood association they also were uh warm welcoming of Sequoia Crossings is a new project",

        "text": "okay the recording real quick sorry sorry right this meeting you want to try again call order this meeting the city time comp committee for Monday January 8 2024 presid Slater welcome uh and uh we have also staff present so um don't have any are youing to address yeah all right do we have a motion on the minutes we do I move approval of the minutes I'll second any discussion all those in favor say I I I I okay are approved and I will then turn it over to Heather and Robert for strategy 12 scope work for municipal energy master okay so it's my pleasure to be here again Robert Chandler assistant director uh Public Works I'm presenting U about um en12 energy planning and are Way Forward on developing an energy master plan uh Heather and I have been working on this and um what uh the presentation is is um a quick review of ian2 the strategy um talk about our work with the uh National renewable energies lab and then uh page through energy master plan is kind of our template and then what we want to do uh for us specifically so uh energy planning en12 because that's difficult to read I did this um en12 is basically developing comprehensive approach to looking at the way that we manage our energy and improve the efficiency for energy um again the code on top if you look at the cost we estimated when we put out the climate action plan last year two years now uh the cost be2 200 to $500,000 uh pretty much every strategy has one or more co- beneficiaries this one has benefits public health and Environmental Quality and the time frame was short the Cs to to begin within two years so we looked at this and thought a comprehensive approach that really means an energy master plan plan um and then uh commissioner Slater got linked up with a national renewable energies lab they have a program that fit nicely with this and the handoff from commissioner Slater to Heather and to me we began working with a national renewable energies lab um they have an interesting history that's kind of inst instructive of what we do um they began in the mid 70s specifically for solar energy uh that was during the uh Middle East oil crisis and sun power was was popular uh over time they got into wind energy they got into more disciplines became quite widespread in their efforts and were renamed reclassified elevated is the word uh to a National Laboratory status and they're all have always been part of the US Department of energy that the pro in my terminology inel is what I call capacity M multiplier uh they help us they fill up what we can do Heather and I could not write a scope report uh or rather a scope of work um on our own but they gave us we work together to develop one um and uh we're part of the clean energy to communities program which uh provides us with their expertise free of charge um to achieve CLE various clean energy goals and our goal was to develop the solar our energy master plan um very briefly we started meeting with them in July of last year with the kickoff began scoping with them and then check checkins at 60 and 90% when we started working with them we were contending whether do we do U A CommunityWide energy master plan or should we just focus on uh a city s Municipal master plan in the end we decided to focus that our Focus was on the municipal level uh in large measure because we can't control uh we have on on the broader scale we're not a full service City that provides both power um and other services so although early uh programs with in rail had phase one Municipal phase two Citywide our focus is now Municipal uh in time and and in money dependent we might go into what is now phase two at the 90% check in just last Friday we wrapped wrapped up their C scope of work and the next step for us is to craft a scope of work for uh using the city's format and our deliverables and then uh oh wait back up and then um possibly go out with the request for information before we go out with the request for proposal I'll talk about that briefly coming up so we found a really good template done by Tampa uh they just finished it last year um and Tampa's population uh couple hundred thousand dollar couple hundred thousand people more than us um their Council set a goal of 100% renewable in 2035 uh it's a fine goal but as a report said the way to get there was not particularly well defined so they commissioned a study uh done last year to see how can they get to that goal um just as a bit of a sight note uh and this is a quote they call it a state preemption disclaimer but Florida's state legislature basically put a Prohibition on local governments dictating certain types of energy uses buildings um so what Tampa did the first part of their uh work is a an assessment of their power usage Wastewater is a big one I looked at their system it's it's SAR to hours primary secondary treatment um they discharge into a river as I recall uh the Second Use is basically everything else uh includes they they operate a Convention Center um as well as other Public Works Parks and Recreation was a big uh Power use uh source and then third in this pie chart is water um they have a more power hungry water system we looked at it uh gravity is our friend slow sound they do more very flat there very flat a lot of pumping costs um then they did scenario planning uh a lot of intriguing modeling they looked at three different scenarios first scenario they called a business as usual that looked at it assumed historical uh usage historical consumption and Trends um currently on the books uh looking at their goal of 2035 um in the the the second of three scenarios is this moderate scenario uh they looked at specific different initiatives some installations some upgrades and some retrobits they ran their modeling and they came up interestingly that if you did the moderate scenario it created a little over 200 new jobs good news it cost $185 million between um I think this year and 2042 and their analysis that by 2042 they would hit 50% of the clean renewable energy and remember they were looking for 100% by 2035 so they said let's check out the ambitious scenario so they did everything they again the Consultants doing the modeling uh everything moderate and then what they call the harder to realize targets and initiatives in this case they did all the installations all the retrofits all the upgrades they added a 20 megawatt off-site solar farm and this energy efficient uh rooftops I didn't recognize the name of it something called uh Sim blast but it's a covering that goes on reduces as efficiency system this scenario added almost 500 jobs uh it was expensive and even with this they hit 85 clean renewable energy by 2042 so um in less than 20 years spend somewhere between a quarter and a third of a billion dollars and you're still falling short of their goal so they said uh basically you want to reach your goal of 100% by 2035 you need to buy uh renewable energy credits and the conclusion from the report was that the city is well positioned to reach its goals and do all those good things so again Tampa which is the closest template to what we're thinking of doing uh they had the council has set a goal try to find a way forward to get that goal did the analysis and found that to do it was expensive and they had do renewable energy credits but that's good to know on how to get to what their goal is so so basically if I'm understanding correctly they decided to not make any changes and just buy their like buy the Feelgood renewable credits I mean that seem it seems like I don't know I mean the report was just completed this year I don't know if they' okay yeah the the way the report was that you can do this I don't think a decision has been made you can do business as usual and make up the difference a lot of renewable energy credits you can do various scenarios if you do a little bit you fall short this much if you do everything you fall short that much and make up the difference with renewable energy credits but you could not do it without renewable energy credits is one of the okay so what our proposed I do have a question but I think it's off Bas so I will wait till the end of this presentation and then I will ask my question you make a note all right well I have a way cool question slide coming up so um what the energy Master energy plan that we're uh intending to pursue follows along the model of of the um Tampa study as well as the mentoring you got from the national renewable energies lab do a baseline uh we'll model future demand and we'll look at different initiatives identify potential projects programs and policies I think we'll try to do the same scenario-based analysis the stud will recommend goals and then develop metrics for tracking Reporting um although the city has goals for greenhouse gas reduction we don't have goals specific to Energy Efficiency and whether the results of the study will lead us to recommend goals or not I know uh Tampa did not have the benefit of a study before they set arguably unattainable goals and counselor oh next start next step late winter uh we're hoping to get the scope of work crafted by our uh template um I think we'll go out for request for information I've done one before recently uh back when I was operating the amphitheater getting request for information how to operate the amphitheater it was very instructive very helpful and informed the scope of work that went out with the request four proposals um and then uh ideal to get the issue the RFP firm uh late spring into the summer uh back the announ is and do the master planning fall winter currently spring 2025 we get as specific as seasons in our schedule is as far as we got right now and there's it came with a template not mine it okay that concludes my presentation remind me of our goal with this metric again are we trying to get to neutral are we trying to get to zero we don't have a goal specific Energy Efficiency or use of renewable energies okay um and then my question is I've heard a lot about buying credits and then I've also heard a lot that there's a lot going",

        "text": " to say that facility citing procedures for renewable energy facilities can be confusing you get local jurisdictions involved the state gets involved at times federal government can be involved the military even so that was really the purpose of putting together this procedures report is to try to provide an overview of of those procedures at the different levels really what are the processes what are the requirements um and and to help Point people in the right direction to get more information so kind of leave a breadcrumb trail so if you are developing a project you can get some information from this procedures report you can get more and more detailed information from those jurisdictions directly um and the use cases that we had in mind for this the primary use case is really for a developer someone who's looking to develop a renewable energy project but you know it could also be useful for a member of the public who's trying to figure out how to navigate this world maybe they have a project that's in their area that they're interested in even for people who work at agencies um you know if you're not in the renewable energy field but somehow you get connected to one of these projects you know this information may be helpful for you to understand better what some of the the citing procedures are so with that um overview I'm going to then move to jump into the report itself and show you how it's structured and how to use this report hopefully to your advantage so just the cover page here so make sure we're talking about the same so the way that the report is organized is in sections based on different jurisdictions so again there's a section for local which is basically County there's also a section for State procedures for federal procedures and then last but not least for military and within each of these sections we start by providing an overview of the information in here and and kind of a text description of the processes there will also be references within here to the applicable statutes or rules again that breadcrumb idea that you know if you're trying to figure out how to cite a renewable energy facility where would you look for more information and the specific rules that that would govern that for that we also within here provide process Maps so these are by and large citing processes there's a there's a flow and a sequence to these so with that in mind we've developed process Maps just a second trying to make this a little bit bigger to illustrate what these processes are these have been set up as most people would call these swim Lane process Maps so you know we have lanes for the different people who are involved in these processes and and then what the steps are that they're involved in so there's one of these basically for each of the major jurisdictional authorities and you find these throughout the report stepping back for a moment too um one of the things that you may find useful is on page 10 table one this table gives you the jurisdictional thresholds for different types of projects and whether they fall under County jurisdiction or state energy facility citing Council jurisdiction or there's also this County HP 2329 process which are these projects fall within County jurisdiction but they have some additional requirements that are specified in statute for what counties have to do when they review these kind of intermediate size projects that just a couple of other things I wanted to point out about this So within the report there are call outs in different sections just to give a little more information on different other elements that are related to renewable energy so for example this one that I just brought up has to do with battery storage and what requirements may or may not apply here um there is also uh information in here about offshore processes uh kind of just pulling up one of the process maps that we have in here for the Department of State lands their permitting process for freeing hydrokinetic projects in state waters we don't do a deep dive on offshore within this uh within this report and and not really within the aggressive project in general but again we do give you some information here and kind of provide those breadcrumbs again where you can go for additional information um I think the last thing I want to mention and I'll stop sharing here as I do this is that you know we cover a lot of different processes a lot of different jurisdictions within the citing procedures report we're not trying to be an authoritative Source on all of these things um you know if again you you'll get enough information to get an overview and hopefully figure out who you have to go to in order to get permits and to get more information we really encourage people to go directly to those sources for more information directly especially if they are pursuing a project in those so I think that's it and uh hopefully you find that overview useful regarding the citing procedures report",

        "text": " thinking about it in a similar way that I would think about because I have some background in that area citing Road facilities and highways where you go through a process where you select a possible Corridor you study that Corridor it might be relatively large actually and corridors tend to upset a lot of people because they have relatively large impact then probably when you get close to selecting preferred Corridor you start probably start preliminary engineering and then when you actually get closer and closer to approval of everything and you're actually going to actually start uh putting in a timeline for actual construction you get to the final final design and Engineering basis is it similar in this case or could you describe it yeah I I do have some public comment that will um kind of walk through what Our intention of the expanded site boundry is um but yes it is we've gone through final engineering we've worked with individual land owners on on some of those changes which is why we had had changes to where those access roads are um but I do have kind of an explanation of what the reason I make the comment is because my experience has been is parties don't go into the final engineering design until they're assured of what route they're going to have because that can very much impact what what engineering has to be done absolutely that is true okay that was my question on hold on just a minute before you give your uh comments um any other council members um councelor IMS so also Mr chair I have a question thank you chair um I just wanted to make the comment that I noticed tonight there were several um comments about the public period comment period and how um people didn't seem to think they had sufficient time for that and it's my understanding that we're giving 45 days from the time that those materials are released till this evening correct and so I'm just kind of curious how how long you know what is the expectation because um how long does it take to review the materials um you know I mean I'm as a council member being new on this committee um I have two weeks to review everything so it's a very short period of time for the council um but as far as comment period I mean the materials are being released and then you have 45 days to comment on those so if anybody in the future wants to submit further comment about the comment period time frame that would be helpful for I think the council and the department um because we keep hearing that over and over again thank you so Mr chair for the record Todd cornette um two things first we do have two outstanding requests for time extension so uh miss crder and miss King have requested time extension so that will have to be eval valuated and responded to and determined by Council I think probably before we get into the responses by the certificate holder um and then um also um um council member Grail would like to make a statement so if you can councelor Grail hi thank you chair how Vice chair cotton and members of the council um to members of the public I just want to apologize for not making it uh in person I was not able to Traverse the state of Oregon quickly enough today um I've been listening and I just wanted you all to know that due to my previous employment at Pacific Corp I am refused from participating in any activities related to the Borman to Hemingway project however I am able to participate and listen but I will not be taking any action so I just wanted to put that on the record everyone of such thank you thank you councelor gril um I have one other item as well let's see um Council row there was the um Mr Meyers uh brought up um he wanted to cite some statutes and rules in order to make a case for a contested case process is it appropriate for me to ask before we close the hearing if he was able to come up with the statutes and Rule citations that he wants for the basis of this contested case yes you can ask him that okay Mr Meyers were you a you're you're okay perfect so we don't need to go down that path anymore we're done with that one sounds like we don't no good um and then back to the extension of uh time where's the council as far as adding time to the turn to the deadline for turning in comments I'll just quickly remind you that the standards you apply on on requests for extensions of time or a good cause standard so is there good cause yeah have the have the people requesting the extension explained a good cause for providing such an extension Vice chair Condon thank you chair how um Cindy cond for the record and this is um more a statement it's not a statement of good cause or anything but at our last hearings um there wasn't a time limit and I'm wondering if there's some confusion about I'll be able to speak my piece not having it written down if that gets confusing to people and could be a confusing factor for providing written versus um oral comment and just something that I think could affect people who are coming to give oral comment don't have time to finish and want to hear the hearing so they can't do things at once so just a complicating Factor yeah yeah so what let's have a little discussion of good cause 45 days has been the time um councelor Byer so this is just an observation that sometimes when we get to the public um an individual will raise an issue and another individual will say gee I wish I had thought of that or that also leads me to think of this issue so much like we are processing all this new information and getting people's ideas there may be some of that feedback from different members of the public I don't know if that rises to the level of good cause I do um agree with Vice chair condon's observation that um you come to a meeting expecting to be heard and all of a sudden you have five minutes and perhaps that something we as a council can do when we put out our agendas is remind people that time may be limited um just for those members of the public who came here um written comments are really helpful because then we can review them again I can be busy taking notes about what you're saying but I may not accurately um capture all of your intent so just just for me I'd encourage written comments um because this is such a complex case I don't know again if this Rises to good cause and I know that if we even Grant 24 hours extension it bumps into other timelines so you know looking at staff to see what that does to your timeline we know the applicant also gets a chance to respond we don't want to bump the timeline that far out but just interested in what others think Vice chair cond Cindy cond again and and correct me if I'm wrong our next meeting is on in pretty short order two weeks so you know I realize that's an issue too particularly for this issue or this um hearing Mr J councilor Devin on this issue of setting time limits um I think at some of our previous meetings we've had like two people that wanted to testify there's another side to this also and that is when you have about an hour hour and a half set aside for Testimony if you don't put in time limits and you end up with 40 people wanting to testify you've got a lot of people that are are very disappointed that you never never they never had the opportunity to testify I don't know um the secretary if we've got anything in writing that says that um subject to time constraints the Council can limit the time for Testimony we don't have to have it but I mean I've seen some organizations that actually have that in in their directions for meetings or in their or in their materials that go out to the public I'm not aware that we have that in our rules I agree with councelor byer's suggestion that in future agendas we should let folks know that you depending upon how many people show to testify that you may be Tim limited yeah yeah that that's what I've seen in other organizations I'd still like to hear from the applicant Mr chair well we plan to that's we're coming up to that but we got to get through this first um because the applicant has a time limit in responding to tonight okay any other discussion where are we as far as coming up with good cause after 45 days yeah councelor I'm chair do we um so I didn't get any um explanation from the commenters tonight about any good cause so I feel like I'm for me to make a decision it's like you have to go off of what's already been commented on um and that hasn't been presented I believe Miss King said that she didn't she just wanted more time to better understand the conditions but if you would like the folks who have asked for more time to further explain why why they need more time and why the 45 days wasn't sufficient you can you can ask them to do that Miss Gilbert come forward we'll give you one I think I did State the reason that I needed more I needed more time either here uh verbally or or in writing because I um as far as reviewing there was over 800 pages of material plus we had to go back to the original site certificates in those conditions because a lot of what happened with RFA 2 referred to RFA 1 and and the original so it is very complicated trying to sort through this stuff but just in terms of of the public hearing here your noce said that the public has an opportunity to provide their comments in writing or at the public hearing and so without telling us that we were going to be limited to a certain amount of time obviously I did not do a good job of presenting the issues that were not in writing I would really like to have the time to send those to you in writing so that you could understand the scope of why you heard those comments in particular the ones that I didn't send in the one the comments that I made here vertually with the exception of one area I talked B about so that's my reason why I think yeah so you did submit comments I sub comment you're saying now you want to sub submit more comments I'm saying I submitted comments on some issues I did not submit comments on the com I didn't send written comments that were consistent with what I planned on saying tonight here

        "text": " solely for the production of of energy crops um within with an eye on our agricultural um i suppose i i just have a little bit of a question maybe a concern or not a concern that that these are not goblin up high-value farmland that is otherwise used for um food crops that would then be reallocated for energy production uh reducing our agricultural ability for uh human consumption so and i don't know if they're coming from farms that are producing these crops solely for energy or if it will have an impact on local agri local agricultural production for non-energy producing crops thank you councilmember truitt um we don't discuss that in the proposed order simply because it doesn't appear to be part of the considerations in the statute but it's it's an interesting question for like i said i'm probably veering away from the statute itself so i'll leave it at that thank you thank you i think it's i might just say this is a chair grill for the record i think these are the type of things that are important for uh everyone involved in the process to hear that we are asking questions from various perspectives and their things that can be considered and i just wanted to pause for a second and ask secretary cornett or patrick bro our counsel if there's any comments to cindy's comment about the statute and the environment um if there's anything to address there chair girl can you restate that please um when she was just commenting about the environment um being so different around natural gas i mean we have all sorts of statutes from the past where things were issued at any given time and so from my perspective you know those things happen we are aware of it we're discussing it but if there's just anything that uh either of you wanted to comment on someone not overlook that yeah i mean i think my my response to that is it's always important for us to look at the rules and the statutes and the legislative history and the case law fresh every time because you know not everybody gets it right every time and there could be different interpretations and that's fine so just because we've done something in the past doesn't mean we have to continue to do that in the future so i think from that perspective that's correct but i don't know you also need to look at what the rules the statutes the legislative history said at the time and not simply put a filter on today you know based upon changes from what the actual language was created back then so we can't look at you know what is our thought process about things today versus what our thought process was about things before we have to look at the language we have to look at the rules the statute again the case law the legislative history that's what informs it so that goes back 1999 and 2005 it has not been updated then so that's that's what we need to look at so whatever you know as wally said council's evaluation interpretation ultimate decision but you really just need to look at what the rules and statutes say and then figure out you know based upon what that is how you interpret it i think not based upon changes into sort of societal ideas about you know these types of facilities or types of uses it's the legislators responsibility to change the statutes it's council's responsibility to change the rules you can do that but lacking that you really need to look at what's on paper right now thank you secretary cornett and at one point i think he wanted to thank you marcy this is henley um i guess in response to todd's comments i was planning on going there also i think patrick has told us a number of times that when we're reviewing statutes we need to look at the clear language that's in the statute we need to look at the case law from the courts and we need to look at past practice and at least from my perspective i don't believe that it's our responsibility to try and add to that legislation in fact i'm probably certain it's not our responsibility to do that and i think what what folks are asking us to do is to look at the reactant that's used for processing and the heat energy that's going into that and maybe even going as far as looking at the life cycle of the natural gas that's not in this statute the statute i think is is clear in that what we're looking at is this feed source stock and so that's why i support the staff's thank you marcy thank you any other comments or questions one one more question sure girl real oh sure uh can the same process for extraction of methanol ethanol be used out of a renewable natural gas i'm mostly just kind of curious thank you councilmember truitt i'm not sure if i entirely understand the i i suppose a natural gas that itself also is produced through um a similar process that is um a a renewable type that is produced from the similar processes that would would otherwise a fossil fuel type of natural gas i may be way off base here so maybe i'll just reserve my questions here for a later time this is wally adams again for the record i think i know where you're going and i probably have confused things a little by talking about both renewable diesel which is the applicant's process today and biodiesel which was from the past exemptions you know so i've gone back to the slide where we show the inputs and outputs and on the on the left with the renewable diesel and natural gas as an input to make hydrogen i think you could use renewable natural gas to make hydrogen that's that's theoretically possible how practical that is you know i'm i'm not an expert in that these days but it's it's possible that you could do that does that answer your question just making sure you earn it this morning wally yeah i'm good thanks all right thank you well then i'll turn it back over to wally to continue thank you chair girl too far here okay so we'll move on to the second criterion criterion b which is the local land use approval and basically i i've highlighted this in two different parts so the first part is has received local land use approval under the applicable acknowledged comprehensive plan and land use regulations the affected local so basically they have received next has received two separate permits one for their and one for the rail spur these were issued by the columbia county board of um on march 23rd and um those final orders were attached to the proposed order those orders constitute final local land use decisions and they could be appealed but that that risk basically belongs to the applicant not considered to be relevant for the council at this point given that it is again considered to be a final land use decision so the second part it talks about the facility complying with any statewide planning goals or rules of the land conservation development commission that are directly applicable to the facility can be construed i'll say too is a little odd that it calls that out because if a county is issuing a decision a local land use decision under their comprehensive plan and that comprehensive plan has been acknowledged lcdc then you know it basically is saying they must be complying with any statewide planning goals but i i did think it was worth talking about here separately because the rail spur a portion of this rail branch line does fall on land that's designated as pa 80. there's an lcdc rule which basically rail spurs in some cases without a goal exception and and that is what the county referenced in their order granting that conditional use permit for the for the rail spur they said they can the criteria and conditions necessary to meet that lcdc rule were met so i thought it was worth mentioning here it's the only relevant statewide planning goal that came into play for this so madam chair that's haley um well i think i can shed some light on this comment for you there are a number of administrative rules that have been adopted by lcdc that haven't been implemented by local and so local governments are obligated to directly apply those rules if they have not amended their comprehensive land use plans and land use regulations so i think that's why you see this language here um and i see some heads nodding on the other side of the room so i think that's probably why you see this council member jenkins thank you for that explanation i appreciate that um unless there are other questions on that one we'll move on to the next before i do that actually i did have one other thing i wanted to mention here it's um we don't believe it comes into play but i think it's worth noting so the port port area has been going through or attempting to go through an expansion process and they approved an application to rezone 837 acres from primary agriculture to resource industrial planned development and then earlier this month luba remanded that decision back to the county and i think that's actually the third time that they've remanded this back to the county on this issue the next facility itself falls within the existing ripd zone so it's not impacted by this expansion the rail spur though does overlap with the port expansion the conditional use permit that was issued by the county is not dependent on that rezoning so it's independent of that so our conclusion is the final land use decisions issued by the county are not impacted by the libya decision but i wanted to at least raise this because it's you know it's somewhat related and could cause some confusion unless we discussed it okay so we'll move on to criterion c this one i think is pretty easy this just states requires no new electric transmission lines or gas or petroleum product pipelines that would require a site certificate and then we talk about what is fsec so the the plan electrical load is 40 megawatts a day and um that would be served by a proposed on-site substation and an additional 1100 foot service line that would not constitute an energy facility by the council's definition similarly for their natural gas supply we cite the council's definition here and then we note that their boilers heaters and other process equipment would operate using natural gas and that would be delivered by a new 8-inch natural gas interconnecting pipeline and it would be approximately 3 800 feet long would tie into that main northwest natural gas pipeline that we showed on the map previously so in in this case it also would not be an fsec jurisdictional pipeline so the fourth criteria d produces synthetic fuel at least 90 percent of which is used in industrial refueling facility located within one mile of the facility or is transported",

        "text": " right Council remember con just as a reminder and and not just you but I keep seeing people do this when they're speaking and they're blocking the microphone when they're speaking I know it's not purposeful but I'm just worried that people will have a hard time hearing Us online okay hold my hands um are are you concerned about an increase in contamination to groundwater you know it's relative increase from the current use I I'm not I I don't know much about groundwater but I'm interested in what your concern is is uh the the current use is is pretty much all Agland around um I've lived directly on the valley floor now I'm on the Foothills so the wall consump the water usage from the down is a lot sorry didn't mean to block that it it's much different now from where I was to where I'm currently at but I'm only three miles away from where I used to be but the the water table and the water saturation is much higher now where I'm at compared to just a m three miles away so the water flow is different the the current current use is is a and so they use a lot of nitrogen to get their uh their grass seed was the majority of the the process there um that is pretty much been the way it's been for years the new stuff coming in is uh solar has a lot of um if you read some of the studies that's been done has a very high contaminant rate compared to some of the other other processes out there like uh wind farming is is different it it doesn't have the contaminants of the solar panels have so that's going to be a new concern is how do we measure those new contaminants uh the batteries that they're now going to they're proposing to put in place and they have in other climates they drier climates I don't think they've worry about the groundwater as much as what we will because they don't have that much water like if you go AC across the the mountain to the east side it's a much drier climate they're not going to be really that much concerned I don't believe um unless they're in a high irrigation area uh but we we get irrigated on a regular basis so those new contaminants are going to be what's going to get into our groundwater and our food supply now if it's just grass seed I don't know what it's going to do to grass seed but the water and the food suppli is what my main concern is for what is a daily uh consumption value for a lot of residents and because of the one proposed uh just knowing the difference in in nitrogen levels in our groundwater that varies from year to year on how that water table moves what direction does it move I don't know those answers so that water can can e and Flow I would assume just like any other water source if if you ever have a house that has a water uh a water leak you may not find that leak where it's dropping from it's completely at a different location you didn't suspect so that's kind of the where we're sitting at now is where are those water sources going to come from we know where the food source is going to be because everything's on top and it's not just sheep Wildlife is going to get into that also and so it's going to contaminate a a quite a range of animals versus just the water table thank you thank you for your question thank you for that that's a great analogy I actually appreciate that for myself because I did have a leak and I did have to bring somebody and spend a fortune to find out where it was so thank you for joining us and and being willing to make comments thank you so much thank you uh our next um our next speaker would be um Shannon good morning thank you for joining us hello let me know if I'm speaking loud enough I've been told I have one of those voices you can't hear so um so um I'm Shannon Hamilton um in reading the department of Energy's mission statement pertaining to protecting the environment public health and impacts for current and future Generations my question's a little bit along the line of of my husband's Terry Hamilton but um are there any studies or data that you can site that are related to environmental impacts with um solar projects that also ensure protection of the efu lands as well as any end of life policy of the decommissioning of the Hazardous Materials related with that thank you for your question the comment and I'll reiterate a little bit what we said we that's not we do at this time but as Todd said we do have standards there are numerous things that developers have to provide data for to show that and that those we end up getting them back and we evaluate based on those standards um and in terms of you know involvement you obviously have expert knowledge that we don't have and we would strongly encourage you to continue participating in terms of odo's mission it all gets wrapped in there and sometimes it may feel more inclusive than others but we are very strict in what we as Council are evaluating to and I'm gonna look across the table all right well he says okay so yes okay um and this is a new process so I'm apologize I'm trying to learn all of the ins and out of this but I appreciate your time and all of your service to this please do not apologize because we are all in the same boat we are all trying to learn and that's why I keep looking across the table at Tod and Patrick so okay all right thank you next we have Troy Jones good morning good morning we are still on morning I keep looking at my watch we are we are we're getting close though so thank you uh Madame chair and council members appreciate this opportunity it's a privilege to be able to speak to you and I'm one of those those folks that uh Mr cornette referred to earlier I'm being educated as as goes along so full disclosure live in the Harrisburg Area ly County as well uh of course the Muddy Creek energy Park is one of those large solar projects that's coming before us all and uh so there's some concerns that we have as a group uh I'm a neighbor I live right there uh you know it's all efu all efu Farmland it's uh considered farmed Wetlands as well as Mr Hamilton referred to earlier um it's uh extremely wet and we've we've provided a lot of documentation in that in that regard two different departments within the state one of the things and the the main purpose that I'm here for today is I wanted and I want to make sure that I do a good job of communicating this so if if if I need to I may have to slow down but I don't want to get too far into the weeds also so one of the things that uh is concerning to me is as I became educated in this process I started doing more research obviously and the thing that struck me is odd in especially in this time of equity within departments and our state organizations is the efsc is not required to follow the same requirements as the lcdc in regard to um whether or not there is a alternate site that can be considered um I got the specific uh statutes if you want to if you want me to bore you with those but uh it seems odd that that emission uh to look at alternative sites doesn't exist for the EFC uh it is required for the land conserv conservation development commission for their statutes so that that that's one that I'm looking into legislatively if there's some need to make a make some sort of of a change there one thing that's refreshing as I watched this process is this is a living breathing animal so to speak and it and it was refreshing to see that these rules can be modified or adapted as required as we go along so it gives me hope that this can be considered as well because you know there was a recent uh Oregon public broadcasting article put out about a week and a half ago um it referred to 660,000 Acres as of 2022 660,000 Acres of efu Farmland has gone away to for what an asundry of reasons and that's concerning to me uh there's not a lot of a few properties left and Oregon took a lot of pride in establishing in the 197s and 1973 to be more exact of developing and protecting our farmlands and so I see that as a very important aspect of this and I hope that the council will take that into consideration as they move forward thank you very much for your comments we certainly look forward to learning from you and and hearing more throughout the process and we are fortunate to have folks on Council who have a strong land use backgrounds and continue to educate those of us who do not so thank you for joining us okay thank you there's a great movie out there a documentary uh Mr Jim Gilbert produced it it's called an Oregon story I would uh I would suggest everybody take a look at that if they have an opportunity thank you and thank you again it was a privilege to be able to address you all thank you our next member uh our next person here in the room to speak would be Miss Gilbert Miss good morning good morning Irene Gilbert 2310 Adams Avenue thanks for allowing me to comment um first I wanted to say that I did appreciate the time that was spent with Jim krider and myself uh discussing our concerns with the changes to the uh contested case rules and um I did did appreciate the fact that he made some changes or some changes were made as a result of that um I gave you an outline of the issues that I was going to discuss before I knew what changes had been made but um there still are some just comments that I wanted to make to the council regarding this whole process the first one being um I'm questioning whether or not uh fsac and Odo really want to make very many changes to the uh Oregon administrative procedures rules the main reason being that those rules have been um evaluated there has been Court uh decisions regarding what the interpretation is of the terms and when you start creating changes in rules that have been vetted um what ends up is if you're not paying really careful attention to what the statutes say but also what the Court decisions say there are many pitfalls you can fall into uh that would end up creating um future litigation regarding the changes so um one another concern just in terms of making changes is when you base your your basic rules on the Oregon administrative procedures but then",

        "text": " you'd go to low and as space permits within within the modeling you know we might be able to do 50 out of 120 that we get we understand that some of these are really important and they want to show up in the plans because they potentially have really high co benefits uh either equity or environmental issues or other kinds of co-benefits you think are important and so an appropriate comment might be this might be low but we think it's really important for xyz reasons and therefore you should make sure it gets in the modeling uh but be judicious in doing that if you say that about everything your comments are going to be kind of meaningless because we're not going to do anything with that so that's a really appropriate type of comment we're going to hear from thanks alan um so as naomi mentioned we're not going to be parameterizing the actions right now so that's kind of the next step is taking this action list and how do you translate that into inputs into the model but just to kind of you know understand the process so we do need to take you know some of these quantitative descriptions of things and we need to translate them into qual qualitative so for example if we're looking at residential retrofits you know the action might be to increase the energy efficiency of existing buildings through retrofits which is which is awesome but then we need to understand you know how much how much energy are we gonna or do we think those retrofits can can reduce when are we gonna start when what size you know how much of the stock of existing buildings do we want to retrofit by when so an example of a parameterization would be target you know 75 percent of residential buildings built before 2019 um our retrofit to decrease you know we're going to reduce our space conditioning by 50 and our non-space conditioning energy is by 10 for example and we're going to do this all by 2040. so that's an example and obviously as we go we can play around with with these these parameterizations and and see what the impacts that would be on our on our carbon decarbonization pathway going so another example you know looking at the clean fuel standard you know that's uh that has some parameter parameters already uh built into the description so we're looking at you know a 10 reduction in carbon intensity from 2015 levels by 2050 and then the more stringent one here is like 25 by 2035 so these will be you know some of the things we'll be we'll be thinking about or including um and just kind of skipping one more so zero emission vehicles we could look at hydrogen fuel cell vehicles so for heavy or medium duty we could look at you know what is some of the different uh zero emission options uh to be included in the modeling so these this is kind of the the next step or the next phase that we'll be looking through so when you guys are are providing us with uh these list of actions the process would be to try how do we parameterize them and some of the actions might be bundled together into like one modelable action but they'll be include an exclusion or uh an integration of a number of different actions that that will be in this list and then defining scenarios so then from this list of actions we'll be able to take you know pick the actions that that we want um that we think will be most impactful and most have the most uh co-benefits and we model them together and we and as i mentioned earlier these are the integrated actions so one in one in one action may or can influence another action so we can pick you know these are just these are examples just made up so you know we could look at the rapid decarbonization so what if we do a lot of things really quickly uh what if we you know do things maybe a little bit more slowly but there'll be some technologies that that we know are kind of on the cusp that we can introduce to to look at what those what the difference is to being within those pathways and again just remind you know going back to this so those those those integra those scenarios are build up of all of the different actions so starting all the way up from the business as usual including the things that we've included in the business as planned and then the new actions that we'll be looking at together will all so all of these things will have to be done in order to get to this decarbonization pathway that we're looking at so it's not going to be just one or two things that happen it's all the things that we'll be modeling are essential for for getting us there uh and then um last but not least before code benefits always gets thrown in at the end but an important part of this project is as we mentioned looking at co-benefits and i noticed in the chat there was a mention of co-harms and that was actually an important important aspect though that we've considered as well um so not only co-benefit but reducing the the co-harms so an example you know if you know vehicle travel there's particulates there's uh you know emissions in the air uh which is you know harmful for people leading to the thing you know lung disease asthma and things like that so not only benefiting things like you know reducing the amount of fuel that you're using or or things like that but also reducing the amount of uh harm that's in the in the environment as well so you know having healthier happier residents because there's less particulates you know less small less things like that in our air that we're breathing uh on a day-to-day basis so excellent point i didn't remember i didn't remember who who brought that up but uh so that's uh in general the process that we're going through um i don't know christie we have a maybe a couple minutes here before we want to actually jump in and and get to the to the get to the list of actions because we only have about a half hour left so maybe a couple minutes for any any major questions that might that uh that i missed oh there are so many questions um i'm trying to answer some of them later but i told them let's see from the top here uh there was some chatter about where do we get the forestry data alan just know that kathy mcdonald put in the chat where we were where where's the best place to get that data um so you can look at that uh we have an idea that we the high impact action would be banning the sailor registration of new internal combustion engine vehicles after 2030 like the oregon washington legislature has done so just a point there um we just talked about co-benefits so we have a question on co-benefits being included with with a long comment we'll be keeping all of these chats and comments um but just know we are going to be considering co-benefits for sure so totally agree then a question about from angus duncan who used to be the long-time chair of the oregon global warming commission ideally the model will incorporate probability of action near mid long-term effects and time between investment and outcome understanding that there are limits to what any model can deliver to what extent will this modeling exercise incorporate these i'll answer that one more directly so the way we're looking at this is that actions in our businesses plan that have a legislative target or a rule target or have uh funding appropriated or already are definitely going to be in the plan and then you kind of go down to the next level of actions that are highly likely to be implemented and funded and those will like those will be in the plan as well and then you kind of get gradients below that right so what the oracle global warming commission's job is to weigh the probability and the co-benefits of these actions as they formulate the roadmap to 2035. so the tigger project is actually the data and analysis part of this to get the global warming commission the information they need to incorporate all of those things into a plan and again that's going to happen in the summer and fall 2022 with the end product being at the beginning of 2023. and then from there we had a question about are we looking at the opposite of co benefits by the way there was another point about banning internal combustion engines earlier and then if we're looking at co-benefits are you also looking at the opposite trade-offs burdens risks and if so does that help prioritize i would say yes we are looking at that the whole picture around that co-benefits is obviously and they pack away the packages but there is kind of the co-harms as well and then michael minton who i know nice to you michael has brought up methane and i i believe that this is something that could come up in the next part of the conversation as a list of possible actions michael but we are tracking that i know he's wondering how methane will be or methane um cleaning up methane leaks how about that would be incorporated into the model but i think we can have him make sure that we cover methane where it ought to be covered in his opinion in the exercise to come and then um more about forestry kind of a back and forth is happening in the chat um okay will we be incorporating on because he won't comment on the co-benefits so this isn't the only shot at co-benefits there'll be a whole set of meetings like this one for stakeholders in public around the co-benefits analysis and what those benefits should be how they should be treated and what they're going to do the ultimate decider on that is the global warming commission but we'll have a whole set of of uh straw proposal co-benefits that we'll be able to look at and then people will be able to comment on just like we're going to do today so that's upcoming what we're interested right now is that question i asked earlier is are there co benefits on these low or medium ones that pop them up into a higher criteria for making sure that they get into the the modeling part great does not every model great okay great and then um let's see um upstream effects of fuels such as extraction leakage i think that we can potentially make sure those get covered in the list of possible actions that we're getting ready to present or do some activity on

        "text": " can't move forward without both blessings and so there might be a project delay or something to that effect if one or the other entity cannot approve okay yeah it's a collaboration yeah perfect no other questions for staff and I'll wait until after the presentation okay and then I I I just want to piggyback on that because pull out my big book here um the distribution warehousing greater than 150,000 square fet is the conditional part of this they could not do distribution or warehousing it's because they have designated that building as distribution and or warehousing or and yeah so so the one of the primary uses identified for this particular site was warehousing and distribution and because of the sheer size of of the project um that's kind of what kicked it into a cup process right but if they had um the buildings so if right it's 400,000 square feet I'm using round numers for B purpose is not reality so if so if in the EI Zone this use would be allowed and the only reason why this conditional use permit is triggered is because the building itself is greater than 150,000 Square F feet right I'm yeah I'm reading that right here it says less than 150,000 square feet it's permitted outright my question was going to be if they 149,90 as distribution and the 250,000 plus one or whatever it is to manufacturing processing and assembly it would have been an outright permit but because they're leaving the building as a more of a flex space they're going to the hard call which is going to get a conditional use permit for distribution and warehousing but if they do assembly packaging treatment fabrication or manufacturing within that building it's permitted and they would not need to come back before us to do anything except tenant Improvement building permit right they don't come before us but they'd come to the city for a building permit for tenant improvements yeah yes that's correct right so if this building had been manufacturing compounding we wouldn't have seen the conditional use permit we would have only seen a site plan because the building is in excess of um the threshold for a site plan for type four correct yeah yeah that's correct and that's what I'm struggling with is this is the EI Zone that we have been working with for years to try and get manufacturing and compounding and high wage jobs and this is a very large footprint building that is um not because it's distribution and warehousing I'm I'm just weighing it in my mind that it's Flex space they can do a lot in it but maybe initially it might be distribution and warehousing yeah I I think you're spot on there Gina we appreciate you picking up on the council goals related to you know Economic um what we have seen you've guys you've done a few of these we've done TS Corporate Park uh we've done the shood Commerce Center and this is the sort of third large project in the talken employment area um interestingly the previous two took the same approach although they had a little bit different building format um so you know um don't want to speak for the applicants but the applicants generally going to want to get as much flexibility as they can and so if there's a chance that there's going to be a warehouse and distribution user you know staff would even recommend that they actually get the cup upfront so they don't have to come back after site plan approval um what we've seen with the other two developments is we did see one of those large buildings uh occupied by lamb research um it was about a 3 300,000 foot roughly building um warehousing um but still within our targeted industry um and so that sort of walks the line between yes it was warehousing but it's a wind for Sherwood still so there's some Nuance um to that um you know the other thing I'd say is you know if we continue to get large um um you know only buildings of this size and the next one that comes in is is the same and the next one that comes in is the same you know eventually we might it's not necessarily a conversation for tonight but eventually we might get to a point where staff is saying hey in the EI Zone we have you know a lot of warehousing and it's not really the intent and then so we might really start taking a close look at the conditional use permits um within the Zone um if we start to get away from you know the targeted industries that we're going for and that's where the condition use permit comes in and compliance with our comprehensive plan would be required and that's where your findings would come in and that's where I was having a struggle with compliance to our comprehensive plan the EI the intent of the EI Zone and a card blanch conditional use permit I mean in my mind it's like can you limit the size to say half the building is distribution and warehousing or a percentage of it or its sunsets in seven to 10 years so that we anyway that is that is that is up to Planning Commission I think that's within your um discre staff can weigh in on that if you'd like um and and elaborate on that more um at the end of the day you have to um adopt findings that address the criteria and so that's the key right and and and whether it meets the that's the criteria that I was looking at was the um my pages was tracking you but I had made a note about um um the employment industrial restrictions and what our goal with the EI Zone was so anyway I was just throwing it out in my thought process okay um I have a question staff questions of staff so and and I can't remember but for Ice Age Road um or Court whatever is that's coming down the pike what's our timing do we have idea on timing is land need to come into the urban growth before that could be developed because with a big traffic impact here you know it's all going to be routing out to 12 and Sherwood Road and then right back down 124 do we have any ideas on uh Ice Age road coming in uh currently scheduled to start construction at the end of this year 2024 we're in 2024 right and then uh uh opening in 2026 and um that is contingent on you know everything going as planned we have to acquire right of way fund the property Etc so there's a lot that needs to fall into place for that to happen but that's the current schedule thank you and I was encouraged to see the traffic impact analysis I don't think it's the same Traffic Engineers we used before but they made the same recommendation that we were looking at on the previous applications that the light is not warranted on Oregon Street based on what's going on right now so I felt pretty good that we've got a third traffic consultant coming in looking at our numbers and and kind of supporting where we're going with this and that the I AG Drive will then warrant the right in right out and we're going on a path that visioned out to where we want to be with that ice drive so um commissioner Capco do you have any questions for staff before we call on the applicant no I do not all right excellent um so I'll have the applicant come up up and if you have a presentation does staff have that for or all right so I have Mike Snider and Brenda fge all right and if you could just press the button about two or three seconds until it turns green and really hard there we go is that working yeah and I noticed that we didn't we did not use the microphones well at our last meeting and so just make sure it's pretty close to so that the uh uh secretary can hear us right all right if you just start with your name and address for the record once staff gets your um yep okay uh Michael Snider um address is 121 uh 3rd Avenue 22nd floor uh Seattle I'm the architect on the project Brenda fodge paneton development address is 1821 doc Street site 101 Washington uh I'd like to say we don't have a formal uh presentation it's uh basically our plans that we submitted for the cup and sign site development permit um we can certainly walk through uh the plans for you or we can go straight to questions if you'd like I would like to do a brief introduction and we also do have online um in the zoom call we have bjn burnstead and Bart burnstead as our um Bart is our engineer a record and Bjorn is my co-manager of the project um panat Tony is based in the Seattle Tacoma market we've been developing in the Pacific Northwest for 15 years um we currently have over 2 million square feet of industrial developments either planned or under construction in the Vancouver Portland market we've done some work in Hillsboro Beaverton um in Wilsonville and we've kind of been dancing around Sherwood trying to find our way in um because we really feel that Sherwood is the core of the I5 South Industrial market so it's it's kind of been the Unicorn we've been pursuing and we were very fortunate to be able to make a deal and um be engaged on this property so we're very excited to be here for the opportunity to kind of get where we've been trying to get to um and we feel like our project aligns well with the city's goals and objectives and I do want to speak briefly to the size and your questions about that and we really did pursue the CPU to make sure we had the maximum flexibility be because we felt like a lot of the current projects especially the snitcher one just up the hill from us they're subduing that up into smaller parcels and smaller sizes and we really feel like doing a bigger box is going to be more opportunity for companies like lamb research and others to come into the market where they that availability doesn't really exist right now so that's kind of where we went that direction we don't have a tenant um identified but we have equity and we have interested parties who believe in this market and this project and in this city and feel like it's a good investment so we're speculatively um which is not something a lot of people are doing right now so that just lets you know our confidence and our excitement to be in this market so I just wanted to share that with you um any questions on that before I uh no I'll just ask my question because we have the option for conditional use for support services to go along with",

        "text": "all right well we've had 20 more people join in the last two minutes so i'm going to get us started here hi everyone my name is ruti sevier i'm associate director for strategic engagement at oregon department of energy to get us started this morning i'm going to pass it over to janine benner the director of our agency and then also have jason start sharing his screen on the powerpoint go ahead janine thank you ruchi and welcome everyone as ruchi said my name is janine benner and i'm the director of the oregon department of energy and really appreciate folks tuning in this morning to learn more about the floating offshore wind study um and while jason's bringing up the slides for those of you who aren't familiar with the oregon department of energy um just wanted to share a little bit about our mission um and an articulation of what we do to help you understand our role in this study the mission of the oregon department of energy is to help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable energy system we advance solutions to shape an equitable clean energy transition protect the environment and public health and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for current and future and this study that you're going to hear about this morning focuses on a technology that can really play an important part in that equitable clean energy transition if we can figure out how to balance the needs and impacts the study is also an example of that odo works on every day which is bringing together energy data information and analysis to support a conversation about problem-solving oregon's energy challenges and to use this information to support energy education and this study as uh ruchi and jason will explain was requested by the legislature so i will pass it back to ruchi oh there you go so there's our when i just went through our um our mission and uh what we do there on that slide if you want a quick reminder and now i'll pass it back to ruchi thanks so much thanks janine um next slide please all right so i'm just going to provide a quick review of our agenda we're currently in this first agenda item about welcome and logistics and then we'll spend about 10 minutes on why we're all here which is hb 3375 and how odo is implementing that bill through this study process then my colleague jason will be providing background information on floating offshore wins so that you have more consistent information and technology about the technology and energy markets generally we're really excited that there's people on the line with various expertise and backgrounds and we want to make sure that you have all of this energy information as well jason will then describe the literature review and the key topics and themes that emerged from it we'll also take any clarifying questions about the literature review and questions at that we'll take a short break just a stretch break five minutes or so and come back for the bulk of this meeting which is to spend time on the key topics in more detail and talk about the prompting questions that we've prepared for all of you to respond through our online comment portal this is a great opportunity at this point in the agenda to ask clarifying questions so you're well equipped to provide those written comments on the portal and then finally we'll talk about next steps and walk you through our online comment portal and take any final questions next slide please so here's a um just a summary of how our meeting today will be facilitated we have two kinds of lists that you'll see in webex here one is panelists and one is attendees the panelists are oregon department of energy staff who are on the line to sort of support the presentation today and then attendees um you'll be the participants in the meeting today and there's an opportunity for you to use the chat box and raise your hand which i'll walk through in a moment we'll be pausing throughout the webinar this morning and at each agenda item so that you have an opportunity to ask questions or or raise your hand and i'll sort of facilitate that for uh for our meeting we also have here a list of community our staff attended a diversity equity and inclusion conference a few months ago and they used some of these community agreements in a way that was really helpful so we brought it forward to some of our meetings that we've been having over the past few months to help foster an inclusive and respectful so the the bullets here are things that we just like to remind folks when they're participating to just be present and ready to learn and that sometimes learning happens outside of our comfort zones and that can be um a time to sort of pause and just think about how we're responding or not responding and in general just really want to thank you for being flexible and patient around any technology needs or changes it's been almost two years of doing remote work and still things come up so i appreciate your patience with that if you do have a technical issue that comes up we have some odo staff on the line uh sheila alakar in particular from our rtit team and she'll be able to help you resolve that i.t issue so that you can better participate in this meeting next slide please here's a sort of handy screenshot if you're not familiar with webex i just wanted to point out a couple of functionalities so that you can i mentioned the raise hand function and i mentioned the chat box so i just want to make sure that you see where that is on your screen so you can click on that when the time comes there's two places where you can raise your hand one is in the reactions spot which is that sort of little smiley face at the bottom and then the other one is within the attendees list itself if you find your name there's sort of a little gray hand that you can click on it'll show case for us that your hand is raised and then we like i mentioned we have a bunch of people on odo staff on the line to sort of look out for that and i'll help to moderate and um probably repeat back the questions that i see in the chat or or that come up through raise hand so uh that's a quick snapshot of webex next slide please so we won't have time to do round table discussions or sorry introductions right now we have a looks like 119 people on the line now you all know how to use webex and i invite all of the participants on the line and any oto staff that's on the line to use the chat box to introduce yourself with your name your organizational affiliation if you have that or if you're an interested member of the public that's great too any brief sharing on why you're here and interested in offshore wind feel free to use the chat box to to say hello to all of us and to each other moving on to a quick recap of why we're all here which hb 3375 um are there any questions on the agenda today or how the meeting will be just pause for a second to see if um there's anything in the chat box or any raised hands on agenda items all right i see some introductions here in the in the chat which i really appreciate thanks for all those introductions really helpful all right i'm going to move us forward hb 3375 in the study process next slide so what is hb3375 well the bill starts out with whereas statements that provide information about the legislature's interest in this topic it then describes oregon's goal to plan for up to three gigawatts of floating offshore wind by 2030 note that this is a goal to plan without specifics on how to plan also important to note is that the bill does not commit oregon to a deployment or procurement targets a few other states like new york and california have had floating offshore bills as well they go further or they take a slightly different approach so oregon's bill is really focused on this planning around three gigawatts next slide please there's four core elements for this study a literature review that we'll discuss today and there's a draft literature review report on our website for your reference there's a link at the bottom of this slide stakeholder feedback through odo's online comment portal which is up now and available for you to submit comments over the next four weeks with a deadline of february 18th that date will come up as a reminder several times today and two meetings uh to share information and discuss any additional stakeholder feedback and then finally a report to the legislature by september 15 2022 next slide please so you've heard about what the bill asks odo to do i wanted to share our own sort of objective in this process which is to gather and synthesize a range of perspectives on the effects including benefits and challenges of integrating up to three gigawatts of floating offshore wind into oregon's electric grid by 2030 the bill lists a few specific areas that odo should be prompting for those perspectives which are renewable energy goals equity jobs infrastructure transmission imports resilience reliability and important potential effects like impacts to ocean users and land users impacts to the environment public beaches scenic byways and that sort of thing and we would like the end product to be a final report to the legislature that provides mutual reporting on the literature and the range of perspectives that we heard throughout this study process next slide please here is our timeline for bill implementation we are currently in the data gathering and engagement phase which is that top row that you see here um you'll see some important dates and i'll mention those now the prompting questions that we'll discuss today are posted on odo's comment portal and please provide that feedback by february 18th we plan to have a public meeting on march 10th to summarize perspectives so far and then there'll be another opportunity for feedback by march 25th we plan to have another public meeting on april 7th to share out perspectives and themes that we've heard so far and then there'll be another opportunity for feedback by april 22nd in may we'll turn to drafting the report and in mid-summer we'll share out some of the draft findings that we've um synthesized and then the report is due on november 15th 2022 next slide please all right so uh before we move forward on the background on floating offshore wind and q a from all of you um i wanted to pause and just see if there were any questions about the process or the bill or oto's plans",

        "text": "right and then Sarah or max if you one of you could keep admitting folks that would be excellent thank you so much no problem all right well um good morning again uh we are here today to talk about the county energy resilience grant program um thanks so much for joining us my name is Hannah satin I am the county energy resilience program coordinator and my co-presenter today is Maxwell Woods max if you want to hi everybody yeah um thanks Hannah Max Woods I'm an assistant director at the Oregon Department of energy yes um and we're also joined um with some other Odo colleagues and I want to um introduce you to Sarah murky she's our community Navigator you might have had the opportunity to chat with Sarah about this program or other Odo programs or if not um you might see her face and name in the future so just want to make that introduction for you here um so our meeting today will the structure will be we'll do about 20 minutes of a presentation uh give some overview on the program uh key information for you and then we'll save most of our time for question and answer we really want to engage with you all see what your questions are and make sure that you leave um having the information that you need um so with that said if you have clarifying questions while we're presenting um please drop them in the chat Sarah and Max will be monitoring that or use the raised hand function um but if there are more substantive question we'll just ask that you hold those until the question and answer session at the end um something else to flag we do have another webinar scheduled for June 25th um that's a Tuesday from 1 to two and our main intention with having two webinars was to offer folks with busy schedules different date and time we will cover the same presentation but um you know of course different question and answer may arise so you're certainly welcome to join both if you would like to um that would be you know fully up to you whatever you want and um they'll also be the recordings will be available on our website as I mentioned um something that I forgot to do that I would love to do now is ask you all to drop your name and organization organizational affiliation in the chat if you're comfortable it would be wonderful to see um who we have this meeting today um we're so grateful you're here um and also if um you're comfortable if you could add your organizational affiliation to your name in your in your teams window or if you come off mute to ask a question um share it then as well it just helps us have some context for um who we're able to chat with today awesome thank you so much everybody um without further do Sarah and Max unless I forgot a housekeeping item I'm going to turn it over to Max to give a little context um before we get into the nitty-gritty of the county energy resilience grant program yeah that sounds great thanks Hannah uh and thanks my colleagues um for joining us Sarah and Lauren thanks for being here as well and thanks to everybody else for joining uh we have a lot of information to present to you but I think we have plenty of time for Q&amp;A uh which is really the intention to make sure that you have a good understanding of the program and then open up for questions um Hannah's full-time job I should say is to administer this program and so after this presentation if you go away and think ah I got a lot of questions I still want to talk Hannah is here ready to talk ready to be a resource um so before we kind of dive in I will uh give us a little bit of grounding on on who Odo is and just a little bit of a highlevel discussion about energy resilience and uh sort of connections to other programs that we have ongoing so our title slide here who's Odo who's Oregon Department of energy if you haven't worked with us before haven't run across our work here we are this is sort of the one PowerPoint slide that we show about all the things that we do uh at a very high level uh and so I won't read it to you but you can you can see that we have a lot of programs a lot of focus areas uh energy programs and activities broadly speaking but a lot of other issues there are sort of listed on the bulleted list um we're about 120 uh employees at our at our agency now now um growing and focusing on all the important issues to oregonians uh energy related Han go to the next slide please so setting the stage uh so when we talk about energy resilience thought it might be helpful to have some definitions just some basic working definitions Hannah will get to some of the details in a bit and uh she'll discuss sort of the origin of this program uh it's funded by the Oregon legislature from House Bill 3630 uh and we'll get to that in the detail uh details a little bit later the the definition and statute doesn't there isn't a definition and statute for energy resilience and so we thought it would be helpful to share a definition a working definition that we use at Odo what is energy resilience and here it is the ability of energy systems to withstand and respond to what we might call shocks uh major impacts Energy Systems and when we talk about energy systems for us and as the grant program uh it includes all energy systems electricity natural gas liquid fuels propane if that's important for your County uh and perhaps other sources of energy we haven't thought about but really the big electricity natural gas liquid fuels and then propane are the big um energy sources in our state uh and then sort of the resilience aspect the ability to either withstand a shock uh and not cause an impact or to bounce back from that impact the typically in our state we look at natural disasters as sort of the bigger shocks uh winter storms any anybody in Western Oregon in January was probably affected by the major winter snow and ice storm I was I had no power at my house for about four days um other things you might consider major wildfires uh which um C impacts Energy Systems across the state um certainly increasing in frequency uh in current years but we also might consider other shocks such as cyber security um or even physical security physical threats to Energy System um there's sort of an increasing trend of uh attacks on electrical infrastructure uh like physical infrastructure attacks or through cyber means so any types of a shock to the energy system and how the Energy System responds bounces back deflects that impact could be energy resilience all right uh you don't and a and a county when you sort of dive into your county program you don't necessarily have to use this definition you don't really have to have a definition if you don't want to but I think it's a good idea to sort of give yourself a guiding sort of framework for how you're sort of focusing on energy resilience um in your uh in your program all right next slide Hannah all right here's a definition that's a little more specific adding the word County Comm sorry Community I should say uh into the that definition of energy resilience so this is an acknowledgement that in communities in counties in our state really no County that I'm aware of is an autonomous you know island of energy systems all of our energy electricity natural gas liquid fuels on Statewide or Regional uh scales across the Pacific Northwest uh and so you know even in state government and certainly in in County government we are reliant upon utility providers that probably don't operate in our community as like their headquarters aren't in communities we're crossed we're provided Services uh we have sort of transmission that might go through our communities to another Community um and so we are reliant upon working with uh sector energy providers or Public Utilities uh in certain circumstances to provide us with the energy we need but what we do control in government uh whether it's the county or even in State uh government is our community community services Community response functions and what we can do to prepare for uh A disruption to our Energy Systems um on the public service side and so we have a little graphic here of a micro grid um it's a common concept for how to increase resilience in a community the micro grid is is really as simple as the ability to provide energy typically electricity the ability to provide electricity to critical Services uh when the grid power might be down there's a little uh break in that graphic between the utility grid and the micro grid controller and simply it's as simple it could be as simple as a backup generator and think about a hospital or a fire station that might have a backup generator typically uh diesel fueled um behind the building and then it's ability to turn on and provide uh critical functions to that facility if grid power goes down a common example of a micro grid bigger examples might be in a neighborhood scale or sort of Beyond just one building but as it's most basic it's simply the ability to provide services uh energy to services that are critical there's other examples of resilience functions um that you might sort of come through here we thought it might be a good idea just to give some examples but counties will have uh the ability to certainly go off and think and come up with your own concepts for resilience you may think about working with your uh local electric company on improving resilience in Distribution Systems maybe there's a neighborhood that frequently loses power uh in a storm or a windy day you may work on trying to increase the resilience of those electricity systems with your electric provider uh you may even think about um helping with training on I mentioned cyber security maybe it's training County staff or energy companies with increased Advanced uh training on cyber security risk uh so that could be a res I uh effort as well so um that's kind of the opening setting the stage I wanted to give I'm going to pass it back now to Hannah and she will dive into some of the program details thanks thanks so much Max I had to get myself back off mute there um yeah I really appreciate that so um now we have some context for Community energy resilience what that can look like connections to larger State work in terms of um Oregon's overall energy security and resilience so we're going to dive into the nitty-gritty of the county energy resilience grant program so I think as probably most of you are aware at this point this program provides up to $50,000 per Oregon County to develop an energy resilience plan um as Max mentioned this program um was part of House Bill 3630",

        "text": " be there to help make good decisions what I'm what I really want to communicate though is that um if Salem OR Portland OR Milwaukee or any other community chooses to do this it's the community choosing to do this PGE will absolutely support you as you make decisions you know even like in the Tariff that we've drafted um we say very clearly that there will be a PGE Steve what's the word we use representative I think um somebody that can sort of serve as a consultant to help you um understand the issues that you're facing um we will be there the whole time my message is just that like you know this is a decision that only a local community to make um and we will support the communities that we serve regardless of the decision that we make you know if if you say no then we will continue to be the partner that we have been for very for many many years and if you say yes then we will absolutely be partners to um make this program successful thank you are there other questions about five or six questions but I can wait till the end if questions I don't need to interrupt it now all right I think we're ready to continue okay um I believe that's um the presentation um so uh I guess next steps um Steve you want to go to nine we have um internally a very close to final draft of this um Community green tariff um we will be getting it out to stakeholders including Juliana in the next couple of weeks um and we hope to file it with the Commission in the next few months um that's where you know we can really use help from our communities to show up at the commission and say that this is a structure that you know you can support um because again we're doing this because of interest from our communities um and that's going to be very important to the Pu um to see that this is a concept that our communities can support and would like to participate in or at the very least have the option to participate in um you know we expect to have this approved by the commission by sometime before the end of the year if things go well and once that happens you know we can really start having conversations um about what a particular program would look like for a community um we can begin those conversations before the commission approves it um but you know once we get that um that approval from the commission then we will really have total Clarity on you know how the program will and will not work okay I think are we ready for questions then at this point yeah great right hi Riley my name is Mike Slater I hope you're well um I'm not an expert in this area but I've been following it for maybe the past year or so so I do have some specific questions if I can go ahead yeah of course okay so my first question is you said once the money is committed and that money is for the infrastructure to build a green facility is that correct um that's certainly an option we can do a lot of things with this money the the other option that comes up other options that come up pretty frequently are um additional Energy Efficiency um or like tree planting those are some things that cities have talked about using with using um or funding with this program okay so it could be like carbon offsets not necessarily emission reduction uh yes um and the re well well like the reason we've talked about tree planting is because we do know that over time as trees grow and create more shade it does reduce energy demand in a community I don't think we would um want to do carbon offsets in the sense of like you know going to the market and purchasing carbon offsets um but there could be things that the community could do that would reduce carbon emissions without going out and building a new Wind Farm or something like that so if we do need to add capacity by building a wind farm or something who owns that facility um that would likely be well there's two options either it will be a power purchase agreement where we go out and we contract with um a developer I'll use aveng grid as an example because I used to work there um where you know we we we say hey aving grid will you please go build a new Wind Farm or solar farm somewhere and then they just sell the energy to PGE at a fixed cost and we pass that money on we just pass that bill on to you um or it could be a resource that's owned by PGE I think it's more likely that it would be something that's owned by a developer and there's a power purchase agreement but if it's owned by PGE it would be sort of a similar um circumstance where um you know we figure out what that resource costs and we just charge you monthly for it okay that's or I guess I want to say there's a third option too um which is that for smaller things for Community Based renewable energy it could absolutely be owned by this the City of Salem um or by a nonprofit in Salem or something like that um I don't think that um resources of that size are probably big enough to meet you know the city's demand overall um but we do want to make sure that we have options that allow um for a delivery of a community benefit very directly so my understanding is that PGE has um a mandate at some point to purchase 20% of its energy from Community solar is that correct for 20 energy we have a um the what we we have we call it the small scale resource um or SSR um purchase obligation which is 10% of our overall capacity have to come from resources that are smaller than 20 megawatts by 2030 and how did that play into this program if at all that's a great question and that touches on sort of what this program is we um will not count resources that are used for this program towards any of our compliance obligations which means that if Salem chooses to just contract you theoretically only with resources that are under that 20 20 megawatt um threshold um we will not count them towards pge's overall requirement same with emissions you know like theoretically we want to be at we're required to be at 80% % by 2030 um if Salem does this or M County does this or you know anybody we want to be at 81% or 82% or 83% or you know whatever it is we are not going to count the actions that a particular city or county is paying for towards pge's overall compliance obligations whether that's the small scale resource or the h221 emissions targets or a renewable standard so so in this example you typed about 10% and it would be contracted with systems under 20 megawatts that right correct so if Salem were to create a system that generated 20 megawatts how would that play into the green tariff proposal uh well there could be a bunch of options you know if if there's a if if Salem does have a community green tariff and chooses to be purchasing from that let's say 19 megaw resource right um then we simply do that incremental cost calculation we showed earlier where we say how much does that resource cost on a megawatt hour basis what are pge's costs otherwise and you will be paying the incremental cost there so we would be if we if we created a 19 megawatt facility we would sell that power to you and then buy it back yeah that's basically right and then there are there would be a rate that we would establish for how much that we we would be paid for that electricity correct gotcha thank you that those are my questions thank you other yeah from Juliana or Robert how you see this working into our climate action plan so um at that scale of what it can be and the cost I see it being a smaller program where we could do a community um benefit agreement with it and get a smaller scale renewable projects funded through this type of a mechanism and what does that look like what's the smaller scale renewable energy project wonderful question um we actually have a couple that we're looking into right now um the municipal airport was doing a solar feasibility study and um our uh water folks are looking into in pipe in in pipe power generation got gravity feing water down we Fe it through a small turb engine now it's cool it's cool but um as far as these things go they won't be hugely offsetting the total um greenhouse gas emissions um unless we do a really big project but if you're doing a really big project you're going to have really big cost so I I agree with uh one of Riley's statements from earlier that going into it and trying to be like we can do 100% renewable probably isn't a good starting point uh if if we want to look into starting it I think doing a this much reduction might be a better point to mitigate those risks for the city as well so we could do a project like say the the in line whatever generation the turb and which would be I would think relatively small cost so this could be like maybe 3 million okay so I'm just going to pull numbers out of the a like 50 cents on somebody's bill or something like really a relatively small impact something like that could be possible correct as opposed to something it would be like 25 bucks or something yeah okay well there's and the other part to answer the question is how it fits in the climate action plan in many ways this is one of the early opportunities for everybody in but most everybody in Salem to say I'm involved in the climate action plan because I'm contributing this amount becomes an individual participation opportunity less so than what are they doing else which would be an interesting exercise to see how many people do partipate and if I could add one one note on that you know it's it's think about this both in terms of the things that you can do to just sort of Simply reduce the city's emissions on a you know metric tons basis and then also things you can do to benefit your community overall like you know this is there's a combination like does a project where you put solar panels on top of a fire station and also batteries in the basement um reduce emissions absolutely it also provides really significant resiliency benefits uh for your community in the event of a major outage whether it's caused by um a big earthquake or an ice storm or whatever else um you know",

        "text": " we certainly want to honor our recipient for the Agriculture hall of Fame as well. Okay, we want to thank everybody for being here today, and we most especially want to recognize Bill Phillips. He was a county employee at one time. He was the county extension director. We have a great partnership with the board of county Commissioners and the University of Florida, where we extend the University of Florida's research based information to our farmers in the community to help make them more efficient and better productive, productively, rather. Bill was very instrumental, and I know y'all have heard a lot about volunteers and things like that in the past when we've recognized volunteers, but he was very instrumental in starting our master gardener program here in Marion county. We're gonna have a celebration on the 16th, which is next Thursday, to honor him and all of the people in the community that he supported, and all will be there to help us share how much we appreciate his efforts and how much difference he made in our community. Agriculture is extremely important. It's a very big economic driver here in Marion county, as you all are very aware and most importantly is that, you know, before, and we talk about history, and unfortunately, I wasn't the best history student because I was a little bit of a slow reader, but I loved history. But as long as you were telling me about it, and I have really enjoyed Commissioner Curry and all of his information. But as far as history is concerned, you used to develop your calendars around the farming industry, and that was because it took so many farmers to make the food that was available to us. Now, an average farmer can serve or feed about 165 people with a lot less land, and all that because of the educational and research backgrounds in what they're doing. So here I am, talking way too long. I'm going to turn it over to Caitlin, who is our livestock agent here in Marion county. And then I'm going to let Bill just say hello to you and share anything he might have. Thank you, Lynn. Good morning. So I want to highlight that Farm City Week is a national event that we are fortunate to celebrate here locally, and it really does highlight the partnership between our rural and urban interfaces and the fact that each depends on the other. Agriculture is a huge economic driver, not only for the state of Florida, but nearly 25% of our workforce in Marion county is involved some way in agriculture. A lot of that is due to our large equine industry, and we rank first in the number of horses in the world. Here in Marion county, we also ranked 10th in the number of beef cattle, and we ranked first for the number of sheep and goats. So those are some fun facts, trivia statistics for you. The state of Florida is a specialty crop state, meaning we have over 300 crops statewide. We don't have all of those here in Marion county, but we do have quite a few. Marion county agriculture is quite diverse because unlike other areas, you know, the days of owning super large tracts of land are going away. But we have a lot of people moving here, buying 510 1520 acre pieces, and getting really involved in specialty crops, aside from just our livestock producers. So we definitely rely on our agriculturalists here, and we are super excited to celebrate all of them every day. That's our job. But we're excited to bring some of our best before you during Farm city week. And this year, it is Bill Phillips. I just want to say a few words. My history doesn't go back to 1840. In fact, I was born in Virginia, but I have lived here for 55 years and I've seen a lot of changes in the county. Marion county is a beautiful county for agriculture also. It's a beautiful county for growth and that's why so many people have come here. And I thought during the week what comment I would make to the commission and to you folks that are also here. It's an awesome responsibility to manage the growth and leaving land for agriculture. It's not an easy job. People want to come here. The county planners and the commission have to deal with the issue of growth and then leaving farmland to make our county what it is to be a great place to live. We don't want it to be all growth. We don't want it to be all our farms. We want to welcome growth, but to manage how that growth comes about and still leave land for farming is a tough job. And I hope and pray that you folks can be able to do that. So thank you very much for the honor and thank you much for being here. Well, thank you, Mister Phillips. We do certainly celebrate you and all of your contributions through the years and we're proud for you and we appreciate what you've done on behalf of Marion County. I think I can speak on behalf of this board. We have shown commitment to be committed to our farmland and balancing growth. You know another interesting fact, I looked it up when I was in junior high, high school back in the sixties, 1960s, population was around 60,000 in Marin county. So now we're through 400,000. It's pretty impactful. Well, we've got a couple of other presenters I'd like to bring. Ron Mosby, who is president of the Fort King Heritage foundation board. Forward. Ron, thanks for everything this morning. Let's see. Okay, well, to kind of piggyback off of something commissioner Curry said about sites here in Florida, there's only two sites in all of Florida that have a structure left over from the Seminole indian war, and that's Fort King and Fort Foster, the only two left. So there was over 300 in the state fortifications during that time. So this is a very special place. Without the Fort King foundation commitment to create a world class campus and fully recreate Fort King, we wouldn't have this site. We wouldn't have this fort visitor center. Cannon wouldn't have had that archaeology building and the largest Seminole war book collection in the world, artifacts and the blacksmith shop. Working with our partners in the city of Ocala and the county of Marion and the Seminole tribe to make this story completely inclusive to all so we can welcome visitors from across the state, the country and even outside the country. This is our vision for the future. So you'll probably be seeing some things. This November and December marks our annual fund drive for the Fort King Heritage foundation. This year, we have a very specific, targeted goal to raise a minimum of $50,000 to take the foundation to the next level by funding the positions of an executive director and director of development. This year's slogan is, first, preserve the past. Guarantee the history of the Seminole wars is presented in a manner that's respectful to all that were involved. Second, build the future. They have the world's most important interpretive heritage tourism site dedicated to the Seminole war. And third, support the fort by becoming a member of Fort King foundation, you'll play a part in bringing the Fort King vision to fruition. Remember, preserve the past, build the future. Support the fort. And with support the fort, I'd like to ask Commissioner Curry to come up front. I'd like to call up Mary Jane Hunt and Charlie Stone out front. We have a special presentation here. Not yet. Good morning. On behalf of the St. Bernard foundation, we are so impassioned by Commissioner Curry's dedication to preserving this special space and making it a part of what makes Marion County a treasure for all of us. And in recognition of your service as chair, we'd like to make a down payment today on the goal you have for the $50,000 that you want to raise. So, Commissioner Curry, this check that I'm going to present to the found to the Fort King foundation is made in your honor. You don't have fun for the Curry retirement fund, do you? Doesn't hurt to ask. Okay. Well, that was really special. Thank you all. That means a lot, particularly coming from folks like you, that. What is it? Beautiful places and special and beautiful places. Yeah, I love that comment. But what y'all are doing with horse farms forever is very special and helping the commission a lot to plan. And that is a way that the community, a lot of times wants to know how they can help and help guide to growth and so forth. Horse farms forever is a great example. We don't always agree on everything. My own family and I don't always agree on everything. But on the other side, they really keep us grounded and they do extra work that our people can't do sometimes. And we appreciate what you give us. Thank you, Barney. Okay, well, I wasn't expecting that one. So, item 1.5. I've asked Captain Robbie Creech with the game and fish to bring a biologist with us today. I've been getting. I have district one, and of course, we have the greenway that goes through Marion county. And we have the forest. We still have a lot of open lands, but we, as we grow with more population. We are coming in touch with the animals that we live next to, particularly the larger ones, bears. So there was one lady in particular that sent me a couple of emails. I read them, I looked at the research and felt like that this is something that is only going to become more increasingly a problem for the bears and for the population. And Captain Karish, if you'd take it from there, I'd appreciate it. Good morning, Chairman Kermit. Y'all bear with me this morning. I'm battling a head cold. It's trying to whip up on me. But to discuss the bear activity in Marin County, I want to",

        "text": " extraordinarily dangerous and the safety is something that we hope you look at really seriously. This is not a standard pud. This is an air community, and there's a lot to be considered and it should be considered. And nothing pushed through planning and development without addressing so many different issues. I don't know about them, but hopefully you guys will. Thank you. Thank you. And we'll ask to see if we can get your questions answered this evening as well, if possible. Long day. I don't know how you do this since 09:00 this morning, but I'm barely awake for this anyway. Brian Donnelley, 7337 West Anthony wrote, I love a comprehensive plan. I always think it's totally comprehensive but in this case it isn't. Let me explain why. In our comp plan both of our municipal airports are under an airport overlay district. Great, not a problem. It sets forth our airport protection, it sets forth compatibility, it sets forth many, many things. There's 20 private airports in this county that fall under nothing. See this commission have a responsible conversation about putting in another overlay district for these private airports or incorporating the private ones into the existing airport overlay district. One of the things that I find really fascinating about this particular proposal and airport proposals in general is that there's only notification for 300ft. These airports are operating in a five mile radius. Hardly anybody knows about a lot of the things that we're discussing with this particular proposal. So I was hoping that maybe when you start talking about where is the holding pattern, where is the emergency fuel dump area that we could really open up the notification process so that the people who are truly affected can be brought to this room and be given an opportunity to express their views. I think a moratorium or an overlay district on private airports is essential to give you guys the tools so that when you are approving or denying you'll have something to go by in a legal standard to back you up. Thank you Mister Romley. Thank you. Is there anyone else in the audience that would like to address the commission on this? I'll welcome you down now if you'd like to. If not, I'll ask the applicant. Perhaps you might could address some of these concerns. Yes ma'am. Just to limit it to things that we heard tonight and then we'll get into the larger project in January. Yes, this is a private airport. There's a major distinction between public airports and private airports. That is actually we went into PNZ with a staff recommendation of approval and over the weekend and then on Monday there was some concern among staff about whether they were due to some of these questions. Valid question following PNZ. And so at PNZ they recommended denial, contradicting the staff report. But I get it, you know, they were concerned about the airport zoning. Since PNZ we have had a joint discussion with FAA and FDOT about the regulation of airports. And suffice it to say I think we're going to be on the same page here. We've gone above and beyond. There's really not a county role in this except to say that we have incorporated some of the concerns into the plan that you will now see in January. But bottom line, to answer the question, this is absolutely a private airport will remain a private airport, will not be a public airport. Only other thing I'll address. Well, two quick things. Utility extension. We are going to need to bring. This will all be central water and sewer. So that will be coming up West Anthony or Jacksonville Road. And that's yet to be known, but we are obligated to make that happen. So that's, that's our part of our project. Finally. Appreciate, I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves on changes. Yes, ma'am. Well, so, Mister Batzel, the question was who's going to pay for those extensions? And so maybe just state for the record, the developer would. Yes, we'll be obligated to run those extensions to serve our project. Yes, ma'am. And then finally, I heard the right. Now that the project in your packet contemplates a mix of low density and medium density residential, I don't want to get too into the detail, but I can say that it's going to only be low density when we come back to you. The entire project. Yeah, well, yes, although we have portions of the project that are still rural lands within the farmland preservation area, we are not proposing anything, any changes to that north portion or anything within the farmland preservation area. So the entire project, we're not going to propose low density in certain areas up top on the north side. You're not going to propose low density in areas that are within the farmland preservation area, but areas without areas that are not within the farmland preservation area. What you're going to bring back is low density, which is one unit per acre. Yeah. So what I think that the answer is absolutely yes, because the number of units that we're talking about right now is significantly less than the number in your packet. And when you contemplate gross density, we're going to be able to eliminate some of the portions of the property on the north side that we're now proposing for low density. We may be able to limit that footprint and still have plenty of density on a gross basis. But we're still talking about changes. I mean, we're still working on. That's the reason we asked for the extension is we haven't finalized a plan. So I don't want to, I don't want us to make a statement about finalization, which I just. But we listened when we had our community meeting. That's why we had the community meeting, was to find out what are the most egregious portions of the plan. What do you disagree with the most? What do you dislike the most? And so the multifamily was what we heard over and over and over again. And so we're looking at modifications to the plan overall to see what we can do to soften that impact in those regions. So we did. That's why we had the community meeting. It's not an obligation of you all for us to do that. We did it because we do want to try to be more compatible in the region. But we haven't finalized it and we don't want to. We don't know what the owner's final decision is going to be, so we. We can't make a full statement about it tonight. Okay. Yeah. Anything else? Yes, commissioner. Based on what I'm hearing, is January 10 an adequate date to come back with all the changes you want to make and staff to review? You're going to review a whole new application we've made? Yeah, as long as staff. This is just transmitted, but we know you want a fully baked plan. But we have an almost complete plan. Mister Bull is meeting for round two of final revisions tomorrow with his staff, and we should have a pud plan by the end of next week. Back to staff. The question should be to staff, are they going to have time to do, to review, to have it on that January 10, or do we need to push it to the February meeting? But also, commissioner, we want to avoid here in front of you and start giving us plans. We need to. No, we're not going to do that. We are giving it to you very soon. And the thing is, staff already reviewed the region. They looked at all the comprehensive plan components, they've looked at the transportation. The number of trips is just being reduced. We've seen our traffic study. So, I mean, they've reviewed everything, but that is a question directed to them. I shouldn't be interjecting that, but I did want to make the point that it's all been reviewed, and all we're doing now is reducing the numbers. Thank you. We have one meeting in January. I'll just remind the board. So there's going to be a lot on that agenda, and I'm sure we're going to see a lot of red shirts, which might be another reason why it would be better to move it to the first meeting in February. In the end, I mean, think about time and think about making sure I put it out there. Yeah, but it may play in your favor if you all guarantee us a yes. We're fine with February. You guarantee if you're going to come back with a plan that's only going to be one unit per acre, then, you know, you might have a better shot. That wasn't a guess. I wrote that down. So are we on for January 10, or are we moving it to February? If there's any concern up here, then we'll will be happy with either option. Well, I think. Let's see. From. Staff would prefer moving it to February because that would give us less than a week to review it before we have to start uploading. But that would give us to February 6. No, no. The second meeting is February 2. Meeting in February is when we do so. Well, I didn't know. We said we would be doing if we chose. So, I mean, we do have that option of taking this one, unless you want to put it all on one. That option is only if we have a huge workload of applications. Well, what does your applications look like for February? Because I can tell you, based on the audience participation, we are going to have a full agenda with this one item. Typically, the first meeting is an overflow from the previous month, our January application set. While there's a few things that are continued to January, it's fairly. A fairly small agenda. So I don't foresee any overflow that would take us to February 20. Okay. So we want to make sure we get that notice out to everyone as best we can. And I have a long list of people who had",

        "text": " because they have money and Teslas and everything else and I fear that everything that is beautiful about North Plains like breathing in the the air when you're driving through the farmlands in the morning all of that's going to disappear um I know that they say that there's no plans for specific warehouses and things like that but you all know what's happened with the construction um all around Washington County as soon as that land is made available those things are going to happen and somewhere along the line our voices are going to be lost in the process and there will be a 500 acre Warehouse or or data center or whatever else they're going to build there and what are we going to going to lose what are we going to replace that uh we're going to replace Farmland that is unique with data centers and warehouses and commercial land um you know I'm not against growth I understand that growth has to happen but the growth that is happening isn't happening for our community it's happening for the sake of growth so that we can have more tax revenue so that we can build what a Talton Valley type Recreation Center we live in North PL me we walk you know we go outside and we walk we don't have sidewalks we don't really have street lights either when we walk in the area that I'm at it's dark we have to wear vests there was a person that was run over um because it's so dark there on one of they still have that little Memorial on one of the stop signs Old North Plains is getting left behind for all this new construction and all these new people that are moving here from Portland and um I believe that we can do better I'm not necessarily against the expansion I don't think it has to be the largest expansion in the history of Oregon I don't think it has to be there um I know that um some of the Meers I'm sorry to interrupt but you you're sorry you're out of time time can I just one more thing um I had all this written down but I didn't even touch it um one of the uh people on on the council were indicated that um that it takes five years six years down the line to build all these things with all the expansion all the boundaries that we're doing right well five six 10 years from now when they're starting to build all these things so what are we going to start doing we're going to start planning for the next 20e expansion how much of this Farmland how much of North Plains is going to be left after the next expansion sorry I have to have to stop there thank you for your testimony thank you is Debbie vanan and Don Malon here okay thank you next will be Nelly McAdams and Roy van Raiden oh are you Don yes thank you go ahead go first hi I'm Debbie vanam and I live at 29900 Northwest West Union Road and uh I'm here speaking on behalf of our family my husband has lived here his whole life my husband uh Mike was a volunteer firefighter in North plains for 32 years the family's land is 102 years old at one time it was a thriving Dairy until 2008 we also farmed oat hay for the cows and wheat we are however in support of the growth of North plains as we understand growth happens and it is inevitable we have seen this growth happen surrounding our property as we are right in the middle of it in regards to our land we'd like to see affordable housing uh walking trails a dog park to accommodate the families that are living within this community growth would provide uh affordable housing local employment further support current bu for current businesses we have seen people in businesses come and go due to the lack of affordable rooftops I have also heard many people wanting a grocery store and more restaurants but currently that is not feasible it is easy to focus on the negatives we believe there is a lot more positives in growing North Plains to a thriving town that would benefit everyone I want to thank the city of North Plains for doing a thorough job with studies for the continuation of the ugb and I would like to thank you all here at the Planning Commission hi my name is Don males uh 2669 po Box 2669 Vancouver um my family has owned approximately 100 acres uh in North plains for 30 years uh bought the property from John Jackson and I can remember 40 years ago sitting in John's living room he lived up in Tacoma at the time and uh talking to him and he said well you know Don someday you're going to be in the city and he wasn't talking ugb we didn't have that kind of language then he said but you're between the city of North Plains and Portland and it will grow and he said it needs to but you're okay for a while so he was right it's been a while it's been 30 some years uh our farm is uh is dry farmed we grow a tall fescue uh we have never sought to be excluded uh from future growth for a number of sound reasons many of which were echoed by the city leaders tonight but uh the utilities that are out there are stubbed to our property stubbed to the properties to the east uh the roads are stubbed in our property is walking distance to Downtown North Plains but there aren't people living on the property right now that can walk to it um we're about an eighth of a mile from the intersection of Highway 26 which hopefully not as many people will leave the city if there's jobs out there it was mentioned earlier why young people leave cities uh leave cities and I think certainly not the main reason but certainly one of the inte integral reasons is they leave for jobs there's no jobs in the city I think the mayor mentioned that earlier the future decision the city of the city uh comments were made earlier to people from the city is that it'll save money to grow and it it's hard to believe but it will actually save money for the citizens the taxes are off the charts in that City uh we talked about are there going to be walking trails and things for the city out there we've talked about creating an Amphitheater actually on some of Van domin's property so there's a lot of perks that can come with growth it isn't all negative are there downsides to it certainly we'd all like to live in a a quintessential little area where we've got 100 acres around around us and horses galloping across there but it's not practical if you want that you just you can't have it when you're right next to you know a corridor that has all the jobs produced that we could possibly hope for uh we've been working with the city a year around for 30 some years and now certainly in the last 10 years I don't think anybody can capsulize any better than your staff did as far as all the steps they went through and all the money that was spent all the grants that were given it's not tens of thousands it's hundreds of thousands of dollars and manh hours that went into bringing this to parition clean water services upsized a line to come through our property and anticipation of growth the city or Hillsboro School District built a school there in anticipation of growth so this doesn't come as a surprise uh to those of us who been actively involved in the process so thank you for your time was in the Planning Commission a long time ago it's not a fun thing to do I know all the time not as much as it is tonight so again thank you so much for your time thank you both for your testimony thank you um Nelly McAdams and Roy van Raiden following Nelly and Roy we have James Fay and Jackie Dyke Jones chair Lockwood commission my name is Nelly McAdams 9724 Southwest Lancaster Road Portland I testify in opposition to ordinance 899 which would be the largest ugb expansion in the Tri Counties outside Metro and almost 10 times larger than the median ugb expansion in this area while the EA is acknowledged in the city May grow up to that amount the city is not legally required to incorporate all of that acreage and must still prove need in order to expand by any amount North Plains has failed to do so the city based its need for industrial land on Industries inside Metro but it boasts its location outside Metro as a competitive Advantage for cheap land and fewer land use requirements if North Plains was in Metro it would have given you an plan for infrastructure instead it punts until after it's too late to vote no right now the city can't afford to fix its sidewalks or secure a grocery store so it would need outside funding that would siphon resources and growth from inside Metro and is contrary to Metro's 2040 plan from North Plains to minimize the impact of growth on surrounding agriculture and natural resource lands the city's EA mentions the semiconductor task force 16 times to justify its industrial land request this report said there was no land for semiconductors but after it was published 10,000 acres of industrial land inside ugbs were identified that the task force overlooked none of the 14 semiconductor funding applications have requested land inside or outside ugb and the city said in a recent article that it doesn't see a semiconductor plant as a possibility so this land is not needed similarly the city didn't look inside for housing or demonstrate a need need for this amount of residential land it failed to identify vacant and low density land for infill or permit zoning like mixed use uh commercial and residential the housing needs analysis that the city passed at the same time as the ugb proposal and is not yet approved by lcdc expressed concern that North Plains has an existing lack of affordable housing homes in the city's newest development start at 45,000 and single family detached housing increased from 84% in 2000 to 8 8% the plan would reduce this by only 4% this housing type is the least affordable most expensive to service and most wasteful of land the city's justification for growth is to increase tax revenue but that is not a land use criteria for your decision and it's unclear how industries that receive tax breaks and expensive disservice homes will add net revenue poorly planned development got North Plains into a deficit and will not get it out lastly the city obstructed public comment after improper for notice and validated their first vote the city claimed the first decision was",

        "text": "round of the um Oregon Department of energy grid resilience grant program let's go ahead and get started I'm clay Deckard and I'm an incentives Analyst at the Oregon Department of energy I'm here with Lauren Rosenstein and some other teammates from the um Department of energy who are here to help me answer questions or um join the discussion um we've opened up this first round of funding on March 15 this year making almost $19 million available of federal funding for organs Electric utilities to um execute some good resilience projects if you are with an electric utility hopefully you've had time to review the information and documents and have started an application if you are a utility customer interested in following this program we're glad you're here and encourage you to engage with your utility directly to become part of the process the main purpose of today is quickly to get your questions um help moderate um any discussions um that's going to be Lauren's role and she's also um our expert on justice 40 and is here specifically to address questions around justice 40 and Community benefits and and things like that um I'm going to run through a short summary of the program and dive into some application updates and some website updates and then we'll get right to your questions so thank you very much for being here do a little housekeeping with our WebEx um and some of the guides the attendees are off camera and muted at the moment but our host Patricia will be able to unmute you uh for questions on the right hand side of your screen in the participants panel you can click near your name to raise your hand there's also a hand icon at the bottom of the WebEx window in the reactions bar and click that hand to indicate you would like to ask a question and feel free to use the chat function at any time to to ask questions and um Lauren will keep an eye out for hands raised and be U monitoring the chat function too to line up the questions um when we get to that when we'll get to that part um the and please when you send in a chat make sure you send it to everybody or to the panelist so that we can all uh take a look and and the appropriate person can respond um if you're joined from a phone um press star three or Aster 3 to raise your hand and Then star six will mute and unmute you um I think we also have to unmute you on our end too but we'll get that figured out um when the time comes but SAR three is to raise your hand and then a reminder that we are recording today's webinar and we will post the recording and the slide presentation to our website um sometime after the presentation that already covered raising your hand um and the chat window so please also take a moment to um if your full name isn't in the in the um or I'm sorry please introduce yourself give us your full name and your affiliation your organization inside the chat um that way we get a better better idea of who all is attending thank you for that all right now we'll just Dive Right In This is a federally funded program from the infrastructure investment and jobs act also known as the bipartisan infrastructure law and it will include five years of funding following the federal fiscal year calendar this $18.9 is the first two years of funding from fiscal years 22 and 23 and we expect about $50 million from the federal government over the life of the program um and then the the total funding will be much higher based upon the matching funds that the state has to provide and that each awardee has to provide and we'll get into those details as well or they actually on the screen the small utilities have to match onethird of their Grant amount and the large utilities have to match 100% of their Grant amount um but so this first round application is coming up on June 14th and so if that won't work for you um rest assured there'll be plenty more opportunities and more money available for these projects so please thank you for attending first of all and please continue to project to plan your project and your application um and getting ready never too early to get ready for a future round we've set aside over7 A5 million doar from projects for projects from small utilities defined as those selling 4 million or less megawatt hours annually um and then I already covered the match so we'll keep going on and that that amount of money that you know represents for the small utilities the 7 and a half million that's on the screen it's 40% of the overall funding even though small utilities make up only 25% of of organ or serving 25% of organ electric utility customers um and that 40% was um to recognize the higher expenses and the more difficulty that that some smaller utilities will have in developing and and putting out projects just because of a land area mostly that that's covered by our small and Rural utilities okay here's our schedule um the required application documents have been posted on our website since March 15th so hopefully you've had time to get started and are here today with questions about those documents or other aspects of the process our application submitt portal is still being developed um but it is not needed to start your application or to do any of the application documents um the portal will simply be a place to upload and submit a completed application and all the documents that go along with that will also have a place for you to make some certifications or attestations about the federal requirements and things like that and then there'll be a digital signature um and a final submission um and so that portal will be open soon um but it definitely should be up um by the beginning of June we're hoping so that at least up two weeks to submit applications uh before the deadline but again nothing about the portal should stop you from completing and working on your applications right now with all the other documents posted on the website um after the deadline on June 14th we'll start the application review and selection process and we plan to notify uh selected Utilities in early October and the Gap there between June and October is because we also have to include a cushion of time for the Department of energy to approve the applications we've selected and that's a new process that they're still sorting out and they don't even have their set timeline for how long it takes them to review the submissions that we're going to send to them and so that's why there's quite a bit of cushion in there before announcements will come out um starting this Friday oh so here's some some um support and application updates uh starting this Friday and every Friday for through June 7th will'll be online for an hour of um open Office hours if you will from 10:00 a.m. to 11: a.m. and that's a place that anybody can drop in at any time we'll just be we'll be live on teams to answer questions um Lauren will also attend those so that she can address specific questions around project Community benefits her community engagement uh justice 40 or any of those aspects of the program uh she'll be there to to to help with those questions um and then I just want to highlight quickly two changes to the application documents that have come up already from the Department of energy um they have eliminated the need for the SF 424a that was like a budget Information Form they eliminated it that completely and that's why you'll see the vet no longer on the website um and then they made an update to the budget justification workbook they've added one more tab to that and so please um make sure that you've downloaded the latest version off the website and are using that for your application um and we'll cover some of that as we go through the go through the website right which I'll run through now real quickly so here's the homepage for the Oregon Department of energy in the first column on the left there lists our incentives and efficiency programs and here you'll find a link to get directly to the grid resilience grant program page right down there on the homepage one other website navigation tip is the blue Banner at the top stays with every page As you move around the website so if something else catches your eye and you get off the homepage but you're not on the grid resilience page you should always see these menu choices at the top including the incentives menu that produces a pull down menu like this and you'll see where you can find the grid resilience grant program link there so just a couple of quick little places where you can get to our program and here's what our program page looks like um on the left are um all sorts of incentive programs just like in that pull down menu I showed previously in the center are um the program schedule and other basic information including the announcement for the Friday office hours and including a link to join that um that link will work at any time but nobody will be there until Friday at 10: between 10: and 11: um so that's where you get to that and then it also has instructions if you need to call in from a phone um on the right column of our web page are all of the specific documents uh needed for this round of the program and I'm going to go to another slide that um Zooms in on that but here are the application resources up at the top is the opportunity announcement that's an important document because you should have that open as you're working on your application because it has the selection criteria if we get enough applications and requests for more money than we're than we have available in this round we will have a competitive review or competitive selection process and so you should be familiar and make sure that your application in the um projects details form covers the items that are listed in the selection criteria then the second document listed there is the instructions for the application documents so that just is exactly what it says and below that are all of the application documents the project details form the cost match letter and there's two templates there you only need to use the proper one for your size utility and then there's the justification um workbook which I just mentioned was updated recently on May 7th and so you want to make sure that you're using the new version of that um and then also listed there as the environmental questionnaire one document that's listed in the instructions that is doesn't have a template is if you're a utility that is participating in a grip",

good jobs there is a job very well done and well we can answer your questions in this area of results that is a lot of rubbish you know Where does the trash is a person personal question this this initiative well we have luk made a presentation and said that a lot of the garbage owes it to people who don't have a roof to live on and they throw their garbage in partially is the answer and It would be What are we going to do? do to mitigate the amount of garbage that enters our rivers and streams question and I don't know if you were going to reply I don't think I'm that person indicated to talk about this answer me I referred someone from Public Works who have more experience in this area Works Public are ready and director of Public Works no I have a good answer the problem of homeless people in our city is a lot of problem greater than simply removing trash of the flows there are always some problems because there can be floods when diverted Then there is no good answer we have to keep trash out of those places It is an initiative, it is something in which the whole city has to get involved I agree I think what was said last week and I think the director of finance said it that the county did helps us when it comes to collecting the rubbish That's right I'm listening I heard well and I don't think I have done it wrong said but I think it is It's true the garbage they collect they do up to a certain limit is a good question it is difficult answer it's not just us watching where it goes there are other parts interested parties involved but let's see member Ho thanks it's not a question It's more of a comment for member coen's intervention that yesterday morning uh I was in the river seeing the staff there there with officer Ram\u00edrez and the amount garbage is impressive where the Ribera is and I am very surprised to see the amount of waste that is right on the shore and the river bank then during flood moments obviously arrive until the covered the trees just last night they had a good time We agreed to find a subsidy to resolve the situation in willet and you know what happens for those streams for those flows then",

        "text": " it but then we would place something that would satisfy the national meaning and and where do you submerge that that's him that's what i do that's a that's like the million dollar question yeah i think that a lot of um states utilities are um trying to think about that exact thing and utilities in general have requirements for planning into the future and they must they have requirements for balancing the demand for electricity with resources to meet that demand constrained by policy requirements so the policy requirements could be environmental in danger in terms of pollution or low carbon those those types of things each state is different with that but in oregon we have um the public utility commission that regulates the three industrial utilities and then there's 30 something public utilities that have their own boards and they they do planning out five years ten years to try to figure out what the current mix is now to meet demand and what they might have in the future to meet demand and their customer needs so the unfortunate answer that i have to your question is it depends and it's complicated but that's part of what our finding is is that more coordination and collaboration like we needed i um i think we might need to move on i'm not seeing any more uh questions on the chat and i wanted to invite our colleague from bureau of ocean energy management up whitney and i'll um have janine move over and you can take your spot here and while i'm doing that i'm gonna advance the slide all right good evening well thank you i want to say um thank you so much nice to see some folks in person and also want to thank my colleagues at the oregon department of energy for for inviting home as a part of this presentation to provide you all my name is whitney howard i am the mayor of ocean energy management specialist in focus for activities in oregon and in the audience i'm joined by the national director doug's boring and we're just delighted to be here this evening um we have the opportunity to provide um well first i just want to say that it's a a wonderful overview of the opportunity the challenges of floating onshore wind in oregon um but it was a terrific overview and i think you know it summed up well in terms of where where loan fits in in the puzzle in terms of citing um and leasing and we provided an overview of our authorization process of the earlier virtual public meeting and here tonight to provide an update in terms of our authorization process with the call for information and nomination that was recently issued by our agency look forward to providing you that update and share with you how to provide public comment which which is not in this actual forum tonight so just understanding your two public comment so as a quick reminder the bureau of ocean energy management we're a federal agency within the u.s department of the and our mission as an agency is to manage mineral and energy resources and we're here today in terms of offshore wind or floating offshore when you as jason pointed out in the pacific and our jurisdiction you know i sit in the regional office um which covers the state of california oregon and um there's also beyond the west coast with with uh hawaii as well and our jurisdiction is from three nautical miles up to 200 nautical miles which makes them a big disney explicit economic zone our jurisdiction is excluded from from national marine sanctuaries okay kind of point it here oh okay thank you thank you so i've already provided an overview of our authorization thoughts of the multi-stage of a 10-year process and the starting data that we're in these early stages of planning and um we're here tonight in terms of our announcement about two weeks ago the call for information and nominations or the call was issued in the federal register and this is sort of the formal start of our of our authorization process uh so listening both public comment in the area that are described in the call and also thinking nominations of interest for those who are interested in commercial and commercial leasing so this is a 60-day comment period um and this will inform after the end the conclusion of that public comment going analyzes those comments continuous consultations continues to coordinate with this data in the area identification process in order to delineate with energy areas which will be the next stage and undergo this environment overview so that is a quick summary of that training and analysis today isn't that the far right of the stream so um another way to show in terms of the work that we've done today um in the i have three maps here on the screen so both in coordination with the state began offering energy planning in june of 2020 and that was with a data gathering and an engagement plan that was a part of the boehm intergovernmental renewable energy task force in which we determined this area in terms of where the vulture wind was techno-economically viable offshore so you all know that there's a strong wind energy resource that spans the entire coast and um both in coordination with the task force they expanded that um area from three nautical mile out to the 1300 meters of imagery in february of this year or i should say uh a year and a half of data gathering um an engagement with bone in coordination with this date percentage at the task force meeting in february three proposed call areas of south central and southern oregon and as a result of that meeting in terms of additional meetings with the fishery pacific industry management council and other stakeholders we heard the concern of the the ending call area that was proposed and then as of um april 29 phone issued this is the formal start of our authorization to call the area the coons bay call area and the brookings call area so that proposed spinning club area was removed from so in terms of what the call for informational denominations is or the call it invites a public comment for areas in and around the call areas which are those areas identified for potential leasing and also so is this interest in terms of any potential commercial wind energy leasing as we described in the path these call areas are large and there is sufficient size to allow for a windowing process as we are aligned to consider three gigawatts or floating offshore win for this near term commercial development we're seeking that the areas for personal development are approximately one-fourth of these uh these two call areas that are that are included the full call notice is available on our on our oregon and which details the entire the entire notice the two called areas the cougar bay and brooklyn call areas in total area represents roughly 14 gigawatts of offshore remaining capacity and so we're seeking in play in terms of trying to determine where potential leasing could occur for that three gigawatts of development i don't have the time tonight to go through all of the parameters that were used in the development of the call um it's outlined as a part of our task force meeting we have materials available online and in the call notice itself it details all of the parameters that we use starting with the demand for energy the suitability for offshore event uh are known and you know existing ocean users in terms of in addition to wildlife and habitat similar to defense consideration so this is a quick summary slide of the call areas themselves in terms of their distance from shore in their areas their westward boundaries of 1300 meters and about how large they are north to south and east to west and within the the call itself there's section five there's the um soliciting public input and section six is soliciting nominations for commercial interest so this is a slide that covers section five where we're requesting from interested in affected parties and we're seeking feedback on these two quality areas we're asking for input in and around the call areas to help us and eliminate the wind energy areas for environmental review for potential so we're seeking specific comments um from uh affirmative issues um or considerations from anything from the socioeconomic cultural biological environmental anything on the seaboard geological view of physical information and someone that you'd like to hear from existing uses visual resources environmental justice and we're also seeking input from from the industry in terms of understanding floating welfare wind and its techno-economic viability with respect to slow death and distance from shore as well as feedback now bone is jurisdiction is is in the ocean on the outer continental shelf but we're seeking input in terms of what will be required for coastal or on shore activities in order to support that offshore development so we were interested in providing public comment mark your calendar june 28th is our public comment period it's a total of a 60-day common period we have 48 days left and um you can provide if you would like in the narrative of your public comment i'd like to provide a map of any of the data and information that we've gathered and is available on the offshore with energy mapping tool or oral wingman you can you can identify layers that are of interest to you or that you don't agree with or you do agree with you can create your own annotations online a drawing or a polygon and civic that is a part of your public comment uh there's a hyperlink there that that gives you a two-page instructions on how to how to use a map to supplement the narrative of your content and if you'd like to provide public comment there's two ways to do that you can go to riggs.gov and search um the docket which is going the year 2022-0009 where you can mail your public comment to to me at my office address so in summary here in terms of where we are and planning um again that's all for information and nominations is the formal start of our authorization process and we're at the beginning seeking public comment from you to help us inform wind energy area deliveration in terms of the net death coming toward once the wind energy area is identified it undergoes this environmental review and boneworks to provide a proposed they'll notice public comment period without because final sales prior to any option because of our current timelines we're seeking to have the wind energy area so we need elimination this fall and function next follow with a funny 23rd so with that i want to thank you all for your time and i think i'm giving it over to you spiritually yeah that's exactly right um so we're going to hold questions for whitney until andy presents his slides and then we'll have any clarifying questions for whitney and andy and then um if",

        "text": " we talk about them if they are public meetings and the finance committee is recommending that we approve them councilor thank you councilor steton Yes thank you very much I also wanted to tell you that even though I do not support the motion to delay it I think it is important that we continue doing so the work and that we move forward and that the staff has done a lot of work in and is really trying to bring what is happening into the council policy and into the alignment and I greatly appreciate that and when this was mentioned above I am not on the committee of finances and I had a ton of questions about what that was all about and the mayor and I had a meeting with the staff and we spent a lot of time talking about it to understand it and I feel very comfortable moving forward at this point So I don't I support that I know the emotion of delaying it some other comment counselor Nordik If I don't see that there is enough information for me to make a decision tonight what would have helped me was if I had an assumption that we know Eh What What does each relate to? one of the policies if we know What is the budget and funds for each of these funds, for example when we are talking about numbers such as a budgeted contingency of 2000 or 0000,000 for lighting What is the total budget to give me a context for that? It would have been more useful if we didn't have a basic description of what each fund does What it is used for How much money is in it or some data points by policy It would have been Helpful to me because just seeing the numbers without context doesn't mean much to me then I would be in favor of having that information the next time these types of policies of this nature are brought to the table any other comments councilor Philip Yes thank you very much mayor Thank you colleagues I do not support the position the motion how it is because I am concerned about the possibility of mapping things out in CP And that in itself I think is one of those things that is a great challenge is another example of we go into the detail of the finance committee you already know all of this you have the option of working with the staff to learn these things but the potential impact on the cip is enormous So I can't support it how it is worded at the moment counselor does anyone else have another comment counselor Today there is a lot of information a lot of different things and that is the kind of thing that breaks into the public and it also makes us feel including myself It's just that I did my math and uh I didn't ask this question offline and if it's 2 million dollars and I pay in my home pay $3 a year in this fund And then if everyone or all entities pay $3 there are eh Very few eh payers how much money Ed in the fund is being used or eh And really eh the like the lighting in the parks can be maintained Yes Some years the electricity is paid for from the lighting fund that helps define what can be used AND what cannot be used and it is something that we review in the finance committee if they want to take one for them one by one we can do it we can take one by one and one by one maybe it is not necessary but yes we had a little bit like a person who is not on the finance committee or has not been on the finance committee all of this is new to me in March on March 25 I think you were fired I know we ended And that happened in that meeting And I think that has two or three more things that were added to it So I don't have any problems with the CP changes from 50 to 100000 but it's the other details that I haven't had time to and I don't know how much time I had also the public to process them the same Thank you a question to what What time are you considering what would it take to get to a point where you feel comfortable approving the changes to the policy I suppose first of someone can make a correction to the motion to include IP and to vote on cip but postpone others. I think that in a couple of months we could be more comfortable and make sure that everyone in the public understands what these policies are about. As you know, I am in favor of approving the CP if it were a single motion but I do feel that we should move forward with the resolution as it is presented right now because we have presented this in front of the public and with the councilors in different ways on occasions and the staff is always there taking meetings trying to take us a point where we understand everything well I don't know what we would achieve with a couple more months I don't see public comments today I haven't received emails from my District members I don't see uh problems I don't see public comments at the public finance meeting either so what do we have very limited personnel, it is asking a lot of the personnel and this is something that we have had to delay so if I wanted to, well, I don't know how to present it again, I don't know if the time is going to be used well, there are many changes to what was presented today, it's just another question about the intention I don't have the numbers But this stop in particular no and ensure that there are sufficient funds for these expectation is a reasonable amount that has to be eh in case of a deficit etc. of income in the movement is can move Or not general are business funds cannot be moved to another place and another question has not been updated true and what can the Public expect with this increase this would ask Public Works if the policy recommendations for cpi increase each year then what be the cpi index would be similar to all the rates that are approved there is a cpi a price index 2% rises 2% each year d is now not a significant increase greater no where is it now any please counselor Joy a please nord no no noor gonzz no no pass the step the recommendations of the staff emotion talked a lot about this about it So I don't know how much But I recognize that there is a lot here and there are many different policies that can seem very annoying but I took the time to read each one laugh with the staff get answers to my questions I feel comfortable with the resolutions I know this is an alignment of practice and policy I appreciate the work yes I have an amendment so I raise my well I can't support the because it is very difficult for me to accept increases in rates in a consent calendar it does not transparent to me and I know that I voted in favor last year and I am still ston I have an amendment a correction I ask that the following be added as a subsection under the three of the policy equity or must be considered as part of the capital improvement program of the capital program development process better capital using equity as a scoring criterion must be evaluated based on ensuring that all residents have equitable access equitable opportunities and e in capital projects second the motion about your motion yes this arises from my meeting with staff and the mayor a few months ago we were talking about our capital improvement plan and o cpi where we use the equity lens for the bond projects and I want to make sure that the greatest amount of public money that is injected into the community that is used for improvements such as water transportation roads and roads is used so that we can use ity to know what priorities In what area I worked with the staff to create this new section 3 policy and I hope that everyone will help me support this correction to clarify what I understand would take the previously approved process regarding bond projects would take the tool of equity and IP would be applied simpler words comments counselor Philips Thank you the emotion I plan to support it no I don't understand if I don't know if the analogy is appropriate but it feels similar I in an intergovernmental agency to obtain federal state funds for the urban area and It was a year or two ago that we updated the rubric that we used for the scoring system, one of the two things we changed, one was to ensure fairness, I think there is a certain advantage and that people sometimes don't see it, no Tom. The equity part counts Because they do n't see that equity has a bearing on security and thus the lack of injustice is also mitigated by climate change. So these are some of the levers that we can take advantage of as members of this body to try to make a difference in our future so I am very supportive of the emotion I think it is very useful because it will improve the infrastructure make it safer more resilient over time I guess my my question to the staff would be if there is any need to add language about security specifically from My question is because I think we've already done enough through Stapleton's Leadership to codify our positions on security and I think this increases the number of grants we can apply for so I ask the question And if there's no answer today it's not your personal problem they want to answer no one wants to answer my Well my assumption is that we have already done a lot of hemions at that level so I feel good I feel that station Thank you come on our finance director is going to try it in terms of the IP score security has a great part a portion the equity included in the score is added but the com security stays questions or comments thank you there is no written motion right no sorry I only have a copy because I prefer written motions as a general rule because that way it does n't feel like a surprise during the meeting Thank you and I also support that equity be considered in programs but that does not mean in this context And how it impacts cip projects is what I would be more inclined to support if we had the opportunity to see what says the city staff how to see what it would look like in reality So if the staff can come back with a draft for us to discuss I think that would make it more attractive because how the score is given is important and and when talking about equity now It is a term that is used a lot that has a lot",

        "text": " which which program I'm sorry I was distracted for a moment yeah go ahead CL no it's the um Community the community renewable energy program the exactely program yeah we're looking at that as well a question for in that regard and I know that's way off topic so just waved me off but um the expectation in this district is that it will be built out over a series of years and as vertical um facilities or infrastructure are built with that would come rooftop solar carport solar so um the the the the the PV generation will come online over time um and um you know so I think that uh being able to demonstrate the expected full PV um generation upfront isn't realizable because of the incremental nature of the buildout of the district but you you know you got to start somewhere and you need a micro grid you need a large B which could be in the near term um substantially fed in the evening with clean power and then be able to used by PGE under a PPA to do load shifting you know during the daytime to reduce fossil fuel peer requirements um and then um but under a black Skies event it Islands whatever powers in the batteries available to feed um the critical infrastructure within the uh the the uh the resilience district and then over time I'm talking about within a 3 to fiveyear period as um projects within the district are built like like the Public Works facility the police facility a market rate Department building retrofitting an affordable housing project sure with solar that we would incrementally be adding up to three and a half megawatts of solar PV that could also be feeding the battery and could could could Supply it with power in an island mode but but that but the the solar generation will come on overtime incrementally and won't be able to be there upfront day one when you one thing you could consider and I'm sorry for for interrupting but one thing you could consider is the planning grant part of C to sort of flesh out the things that you've just talked about here today and get some funding to to to apply toward the planning of this project that you you seem to have a a really good idea of now and then also consider you know altering the project around the requirements of disr because you know again it could be up to a free million dollar and if you had different projects you know different buildings can be different projects even though in your mind they're phases of a project for the life of c those could be separate projects because they're probably going to be behind separate meters on different buildings and so the other thing I was going to recommend is that you know in the beginning maybe you can do one public building gets through top solar then you do have your generation going with the battery backup in the micro grid right from the beginning um that could be something maybe you could consider to have um you know one building one public building get rooftop solar so you do meet the the generation requirement so I'm gonna we're talking you know John you should really be talking to our Comm our staff for the C program probably um about it it sounds like maybe um currently have that application open it closes on May 10th I know and we are and we're we're working on a planning Grant application under cup now but I couldn't resist the temptation response to um you know um one of Clay's comments to um to wander into cup territory so I I beg your Indulgence in that regard and I'm happy to stop stop now and there are open hours available for with C staff um so we probably got your email address but maybe if you pop it in the chat we can make sure you get those and then you could talk about this with Jason canalon team over there yeah I've I've attended one of those open house open hours and um on my calendar to do so going forward so so yeah I can continue this conversation with them so thanks thanks again for um I really I really was trying to focus on the grid resilience question but it it does have some overlap as as I think we discovered in this conversation yeah yeah and I I have well I don't know I mean I would guess that PG might already have ideas of what they're planning to do with this funding for this round so definitely get talking to them we we have been I just wanted just wanted to assess whether or not they are advantaged through this collaboration in terms of being more competitive in their application um as or not that that was really a critical question I had great well thanks so much for the time we really appreciate you sticking around and getting deep on a project with us fun sounds really I live near I live enough tiger that it would probably benefit me too great all right thanks guys see you have a have a good John well Jennifer Jolly is the only one left on I don't know if Jennifer has anything to say she can raise her hand if she wants otherwise we could probably get out of here for a second looks like she's on a phone so all right well Jennifer if you need anything you let me know all right well let's shut this down maybe think Jennifer Jolly just put in how so I don't know if that means to come off of mute um because she's on you're off mute now Jennifer okay thank you um yeah I'm sorry I am on my phone I I had missed um one of the things you said in the beginning and I was wondering if you wouldn't mind um repeating I know we're at the end of the hour but um you were talking about if someone had applied for a grip Grant I know a number of our smaller C had um collaborated on some applications there and what is what what did they need to do and um are they able to apply in this category for the same thing or or what what was the um advice or or Direction on that um it's supposed to be a a different project or different scope um there is some question that I I don't have the answer for on if they are the same scope but they're in different um periods um I don't have the clarification on that yet so there is some indication that they could even be the same scope if they were in different periods of between grip and grid resilience and I don't quite understand that to be honest I've got to go back to the Department of energy to get clarification on that part but if they are of different Scopes or different projects then you can have grip and grid resilience at the same time is my understanding um but then any time that that we can get details around that and get questions to doe and get clarification from them um we're definitely willing to do that so for example if they had only done a portion of an undergrounding project through the grip Grant presumably they could continue to go more underground or longer length um through this program or or I guess when you're saying a different project I guess I'm questioning what what does that mean I mean that that sounds to me too like that makes passes the common sense to to my thinking that okay you know grip covered a certain amount and we want to continue with the under grounding in it you know even if it's on the same line it's a different project because it's addition you know it's okay further down the line okay um I have I again I have to clarify that with doe but that passes my my Common Sense test today okay so just it doesn't necessarily have to be a different um different type of project different type of hard project it could be the same um types of projects just maybe in a different location or something like that that's my understanding yeah okay yep okay great well thank you so much appreciate it you're very welcome thanks for calling in okay bye-bye bye all right thank you all so much I appreciate your time and we will end it there",

to provide that breakdown for you and they they do track all that information so we'll get back to you on the next report wonderful and if I may m'am chair uh I'm scrolling down to the next section of

those are 20 households 20 households um the head of household is the actual physical graduate in Huds terminology but it's the 20 households met their their escrow needs okay and on average what are

and um can really get behind that so I am very excited to see that completed and um full of people and thriving for sure yes thank you any other questions seeing none I think we are good evening I'll call to order this meeting of the City of Salem urban renewal Agency for Monday November 27th 2023 if the recorder will please call the rooll board member Stapleton here board member Nish yoka here board member Phillips here board member Gwen here board member Gonzalez here board member Hoy here board member nordik here board member Varney here chair Hoy here councelor Stapleton do we have any additions or deletions to the agenda not tonight all right we do have one person signed up for public comment online Ian luallen please turn your Cameron you have 3 minutes introduce yourself uh for the record please uh with your address or your yeah good evening I apologize I can't get my camera to work hopefully it'll pop on here that's all right um apologies yeah but good evening thank you for having me I understand you guys have a busy evening so I'll be um brief I'm with Deacon development 901 Northeast gleon Street in Portland Oregon we're a real estate development company we've submitted a request for a program exception to the maximum Grant amount allowed under the urban renewal area Capital Grant Improvement grant program and I understand you'll uh be considering that request this evening so I just wanted to briefly highlight um the proposed project that we have in um the existing site of the proposed project has been used as a parking lot for many years um it's at 277 High Street in Downtown Salem and then before it was used as a parking lot it was actually the Old Salem City Hall and was demolished in 19 72 so it kind of has an interesting history and we're hoping to tap into that history as we kind of develop and refine um the development plan moving forward um we spent several months meeting with our consultants and local experts in Salem to make sure we were really bringing to Market what the demand and what the need is for downtown housing um so the current plan is to replace the existing parking lot with the new six-story mixed use building the building would include 98 residential living units and then it would include an additional seven commercial live work units that would have a Street Front access along the public sidewalks at High Street and shm Street and then although it's not a requirement as I understand it for this exception request our plan is to um set aside 16 of the residential living units as affordable um home units at the 80% median family income rate for the Salem area the current building design features um a wide variety of unit types and sizes and layouts they range from a 450q foot Studio to two-bedroom units that are around 950 square feet in size so it's really a great coverage in unit types and this was intentionally done um to attract a broad range of demographics and help kind of cultivate diversity within the living community at the building itself and the surrounding properties as well um the building and living community itself will have wonderful amenities it'll have a resident community room with a connected outdoor deck for Community Gatherings there'll be a parcel delivery uh and storage system we're planning to have a fitness center a dog wash and a Petway station and I wanted to note too there's also will be a strong emphasis on alternative modes of transportation uh we're including bike storage a bike was washing station um and then we'll we have EV charging stations within the surface parking lot well um so that's a quick summary of what we have planned we genuinely um believe this project will be a tremendous benefit um to Downtown Salem we appreciate your consideration we're excited about the opportunity and um I'm happy to answer any questions you guys might have thank you Mr Lan appreciate it councelor nordik has a question for you thank you Mr Mayor and thank you for for being with us virtually this evening I'm a little bit hard of hearing and I'm hoping you could drill down a little bit more I believe you said and our materials indicate 16 units will be affordable I think you said 80% of the Ami do you mean household Ami I assume individual um yeah I mean the way we have traditionally done it is based on the type of unit so I'm not sure I can technically answer that question but like the Ami rate for a studio in Salem as I understand it is $1,172 so that would be the rate for a studio it's a great question I I'm not sure I have the technical answer but that's how I I understand it at my level least go ahead coun sure anded do you know what this point early on in this process uh the units are going to be affordable do you intend all 16 to be Studio or is that to be determined no no we would allocate that based on the different unit mix so um this Project's proposed to have around 20% Studios 55% one bedrooms and 25% two bedrooms so you could use those percentages for how many of the units would be those um you know those Pro affordable unit types if that makes sense thank you councelor Stapleton thank you and thank you councelor Nik you asked a lot of my questions that I had as well um I did have a question about the live work um situation is that the way I understand it having not seen plans for this is that there would be some storefront in in the front of the uh space and then living in the back um and am I correct on that you are yep that's 100% correct great um I don't think I don't know if we have any of these in Salem right now or downtown that would be really interesting to hear but this is very exciting this portion of it um and I would just encourage you to include um at least one of these um as also affordable when you're looking at um at the different uh units that are going to be considered for affordability um because I I think that would be um an interesting and important part to to include um but I other than that I don't have any questions and I'm I'm excited about this project thank you counselor are there any other additional questions for the uh for Mr lelan all right thank you for your testimony thank you appreciate it councelor Stapleton do we have any additions or deletions to the agenda no but you already asked me that I did sorry I went backwards on the uh above public comment sorry consent calendar counselor I move approval of the consent calendar second motion by Stapleton second by Phillips councelor to your motion thank you tonight we have item 3.1a the October 23rd 2023 draft urban renewal agency minutes and item 3.3a the riverfront downtown urban renewal Capital Improvement grant program exception for Deacon Development LLC and that concludes the consent calendar thank you is there further discussion will the recorder please call rooll board member nordik I board member verney I board member Stapleton board member nishioka I board member Phillips I board member Gwyn I board member Gonzalez hi board member Hoy I chair Hoy I motion passes really excited about that project I think it's going to be a really great addition to our downtown it meets lot of our Council goals so that's exciting we have no public hearings we have no special orders of business we do have an information report does anybody have any questions on item 6A I see Miss rer has joined us did you have anything for us I can answer the Ami question if you would like yes um so Ami when it comes to affordable rent is typically based on household size so if you're a household of one then the rents are based on the Ami for a household of one if it's household of two then it it that continues so it varies depending on size thank you is councelor nishioka thank you I have a question um it's about affordability as well okay um so the um can you tell me how long the um affordable units would be in effect so in this situation because affordability is not a requirement of the grant exception there is no timeline associated with that however um I I think it's a reasonable expectation that this developer may come forward with a request for the mtip tax exemption program that 10-year tax exemption and in that case or if they seek um SDC waivers you know the affordability period would be you know pro-rated or tied to the MU tip timeline um so it's likely if they if they pursue the MU tip exemption that we're looking at a 10-year period longer thank you any additional questions all right thank you we are adjourned and I will call to order the meeting of the Salem City Council for Monday November 27th",

        "text": " questions from the thank you again okay so with that i will once again recess the uh hearing on the 2022 uh carbon standards update and implementation of 2020 hp 2021 and i will move to the protected area scenic resources and recreation standards rulemaking hearing um before i open the florida commons once again i have just a quick background on procedural history and an overview of the proposed rules so as the council knows uh the council must adopt standards for the sighting of energy facilities including standards to address areas designated protection by the state or federal impacts of the facility on recreation scenic and aesthetic values and the council has done so under the protected areas standard the recreation standard and the uh scenic resources standard um the protected areas and scenic resources standards were last updated in 2007 the recreation standard was last updated in 2002 we began this rule making project in i believe 2018 to address issues related to the three standards and the associated information requirements and other rules that are associated with the standards the objectives were to ensure that the standards clearly identify the resources and values they're intended to protect to ensure that the standards are consistent with os 469 310 which sets the citing policy for the state of oregon and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the council's review processes and procedures by resolving ambiguity lack of clarity and inconsistency in the rules so as i mentioned council initiated the informal section of this rule making in october of 2020 we solicited early written comments in november of 2020 uh and received a number of comments from uh various stakeholders council reviewed those early comments on april 23 2021 and directed count staff to go out and get more feedback through a series of rule making workshops which we conducted in the summer and fall of last we brought our a preliminary preliminary analysis and recommendations to the council in got some feedback from council and revised the draft rules and recirculated them for an additional round of comments in march the council considered proposed rules at two meetings earlier this year one in april and one in may and then approved proposed rules in may of 2022. um staff issued the notice of proposed rulemaking on june 1st and today is of course the rulemaking hearing associated with this rulemaking um the last day for public comment on this rulemaking is july 21st to 2022 at 5 pm going to go through uh the summary of the proposed rules relatively quickly and i've kind of organized the changes by the standard so for the for the protected area standard the proposed rules would require an applicant to identify the managing agency of any protected area within the applicable study or analysis area for the project as well as a mailing address and other reasonably available contact information that protected area manager this is kind of coinciding with a policy change that the council has proposed to start providing public notice to the protected areas managers along with any public notice that goes out on the notice of intent or an we do expect that to be formalizing rules and awaiter rule making the proposed rules also amend the protected area standard to remove the effective date for designations allowing the council to consider impacts of protected areas that are designated um after a notice of intent is filed but prior to the filing of a complete the proposed rules would update and simplify the list of designations that are considered to be protected areas under the standard and would remove specific examples to reduce the need for future rulemaking and the rules would clarify the exception for when a linear facility may be located within the boundaries of a protected area for the scenic resources standard this uh the proposed rules would amend the standard to require an assessment of visual impacts to state scenic resources in addition to the current requirements to assess impacts to local tribal and federal scenic and we would also make clarifying changes to exhibit our requirements for visual impact assessments with the potential that that issue would be revisited in future rule making as specific to both the scenic resources and recreation standards the proposed rules would amend those two standards to allow the council to consider evidence introduced into the record related to impacts to scenic resources or recreational opportunities that are located outside of the analysis areas for those without going through the process of amending the project order to amend the boundaries of the analysis and then would also contain a number of administrative organizational changes such as moving the definition of what is a protected area out of the standard itself to division one and specifying um that the applicability that the standards are only applicable to uh the review of a request for amendment or a application that's filed on or after the effective date of the rules so i'm going to go ahead and open the hearing on the protected area scenic resources and recreation standards if there is anybody on the uh webex webinar or on phone that would like to participate raise your hand now if you're on the phone you can raise your hand by pressing star 3 as a reminder just like last time the council may ask any clarifying questions that you wish to during the hearing but the council will not respond to questions or comments during this hearing written comments will be accepted until 5 pm on july 21st so i'm going to put the instruction up here but um we actually do have one person in the room that would like to provide comments so uh angela crowley cook if you would like to come up and you do have a if you want to go first thank you steph and council members my name is angela crowley cook i'm the executive director of ocea the oregon solar plus storage industries and there's a reason why i'm the only person here in the room this is a really important topic and so i wanted to not take the easy way out and zoom in but come and be here in front of you because it's really critical and not just for our not just for my members and for the solar industry but really for all as you know very well we're in the middle of a climate crisis in oregon in our world we see it this year this wet spring increased precipitation is directly because of climate change and even though we had that wet spring 70 percent of our state is still in drought we've seen increased wildfires ocean acidification i don't have to go through them all for you but you know um the place that we're at here um and the effects that oregon is feeling because of climate change and that's the reason i believe that governor brown put forward her executive order 2004 on climate change and at that time the council took action to implement that executive order and in particular the council approved moving forward with a project too and i'm reading directly from the department's plan here a project to better align standards and application requirements and the objective of that of the rulemaking would be to conduct a comprehensive review of the standards and application requirements to create a clear separation of procedural and substantive substantive provisions and rules and to simplify procedures for review where practicable to review application requirements to clarify specific information needed to demonstrate compliance and finally on the one that i'm most concerned about is that to evaluate standards and application requirements to determine if the requirements should be adjusted for different types of energy facilities including facilities which generate energy from renewable sources and so you all have acted and the department has recognized that renewable energy is important to meet our climate change goals and should be looked at and reviewed and so the department i'm happy that the department has finally found someone to do that review of the standards and so for us it makes sense to wait until that review is concluded before moving forward with rulemaking on this topic i understand that there is one i guess issue that some of the areas are out of there are dates in the current rules and i understand that that is something that needs to be addressed if it can't wait until the review is concluded we would suggest that the council move forward on rulemaking only for that particular issue of changing removing the effective dates and making the dates certain of when there would be new protected areas included that makes sense to us we worked with staff over the past year to kind of improve that part and make sure that it would provide clarity and consistency for applicants however the rest of the rules we have great concern with unfortunately they create uncertainty and leave things not clear when the applicant is trying to move through the process as you all know very well it's a long process it's a complicated process an expensive one and part of the governor's executive order and and the department's plan was to reduce costs and reduce delays and so as we see most of these rules although there have been improvements which we appreciate but they do create uncertainty and increase delays and costs and so we're very concerned that these rules might move forward before that comprehensive review has happened and so i'm here to ask you today to delay this rule making until that review is completed in addition we one thing has come to our concern unfortunately late in the that the draft will say that there are no small business concerns unfortunately that is blatantly false there are many small business concerns and it looks like they weren't really and fully investigated in the proposal of this draft rules member oca members that have site certificates are small businesses they have way less than 50 employees and in my communication with staff there was some discussion about how maybe they didn't technically qualify because they have other subsidiaries that for each particular project however that's the it's the same company it's not as if a large company like pacific core then formed a smaller company it's the same folks that run these companies it's one small business that has individual corporations for particular projects and many small businesses are actually impacted by these rules and unfortunately it looks like no small business concerns where you know that that formal review about small business concerns wasn't completed before coming to you today so um again while we appreciate that there were slight improvements to the rule over the past year um because of the big issues that we're facing as a state as a as a globe we ask that you delay this so that we can reduce that uncertainty those delays and costs and make sure the review happens first before we expand other rules at the at the through the aspect process thank you that's members have any clarifying okay hearing none thank you miss carly um next we have uh mr brian kelly uh mr kelly if you'd like to provide",

        "text": "er quick comment just um I appreciate staff's uh recommendation to engage the county weed control people to really help understand what might work on these really big land areas um because once the land's Disturbed weeds come in so just um engaging them a bit more but but this seems like a logical way to move forward thank you madam chair yes just I don't know that we've said it during the presentation or the prior presentation but for conditions of approval that relate to other reviewing agencies such as this there is the ability to compensate them for their time as well so that is built into the the statutes whether whether we know that and build that into the annual assessment or you know if you know we have a reimbursement agreement with them you know and they have you know a requirement responsibility or expertise to you know either help or take over that condition of approval we can compensate them for that meaning we compensate them and then the certificate holder compensates us so certainly we make that available to them as well if that helps them but but we certainly rely when we can on the expertise you know of others and this is an example where you know the weed master in Moro County certainly has you know far and above you know any expertise that we would have um on on issues related to weeds in that county thank you thank you for that clarification secretary cornette all right we had a motion we have a second Mr secretary please call the role Perry Cho toot yes Ken how yes an berer yes Marcy Grail yes Jordan trit yes Cindy Condon yes motion carries Madam chair thank you and our final uh facility is the whe Wheat Ridge renewable energy facility 2 if we could get a motion please okay this 10 uh Madam chair I move that the council approve the proposed changes to the Wheat Ridge renewable energy facility 2 mitigation plan as presented and recommended by staff thank you Vice chair Hal this Jordan Al second thank you council trit any comments Harry anything you want to say throughout this ordeal no it all sounds good to me all right just checking on you thank you uh then there are no further comments Mr secretary please call the role Marcy Grill yes Cindy Conan yes Kent Hal yes Jordan Truitt yes Perry chak yes Ann buer yes motion carries Madam chair thank you and I would just like to acknowledge council member cut for uh grinding through I know uh it is hard sometimes doing these uh virtually and you have been a trooper today so thank you sir uh Sarah and Dwayne thank you for your efforts today we appreciate everything you're doing to represent the department and making sure these projects go as intended anyone have any other make sure I'm not forgetting anything else I've been bad today okay I just have one comment yes so we were pretty wildly off on the particular agenda items but we had the anticipated adjournment at 1 pm and it is 10:1 p.m all right CH gr yes ma'am I don't want to delay adjournment but I would like to request just with um you know there's a lot of chatter that we've heard a lot of press about the interconnection um availability to BPA Transit transmission and I am wondering if sometime this year we might have BPA or somebody come and talk to us about that and how it delays projects that we get uh somewhat uh criticized for and um just wondering if that's possible yeah yes uh for the record talk cornette um absolutely council member Condon we um we don't frequently have interconnections excuse the pun um with the Bondville power Administration but we do occasionally uh and so there are people that we can talk to um and coordinate that with so I think we could probably get somebody from the Bonville power Administration um if not if that presents a problem there are certainly expertise within the department of energy um outside of the sighting um that could probably provide a good presentation as well so we will look into that and find out at an upcoming meeting um our preference obviously will be to get somebody from the Bonville power Administration but but we can absolutely do that and I I mentioned BPA I I and I probably shouldn't have it's just whoever you think would be most appropriate I mean it's not exclusively BPA but it's mostly BPA in terms of the substation so I I think getting them it won't cover everything but it'll cover much of it thank you thank you council member Byer and um yeah go ahead we go ahead hey did I interrupt somebody um council member buer was gonna but she's given the floor to you and she's willing to wait so you've been wonderful today so go ahead um I just wanted to say there's been a lot of interest in the 11% raising of our power and by uh Pacific Corp I guess um it's going to be a big subject you know um here in southern Oregon people realize that um a lot of this energy is used by California and we're wondering why um our bills went up 11% when the actual entity that's using the electricity needs to see the raise in prices and so I just wanted to mention that you know um i' I've been getting a lot of um concern over that issue and I I haven't really fed into it I've just listened to it but uh 11% is quite a bit for a power bill so I just want to say that thank you for tolerating me I appreciate it we appreciate you too and uh without stepping out of line I'm going to suggest that uh you direct folks over to the Oregon Public Utility Commission they deal with the investor owned utilities and their rates that's not really our space in place but um concerns about that and they can always participate in the integrated resource plan hearings that occur as well as the rate cases um and as they study along and see what's happening with the storms and the Wildfire mitigation uh don't be surprised to see more of that so I'll anyway that's my opinion on there council member by um just to add on to councelor condon's request um if we could get an update from somebody probably in the department or the industry kind of telling us where the council is perceived as a barrier to development of renewable energy but we all know that there are other barriers out there whether it's supply chain the connect um labor issues you know what are some of the other issues facing the industry and what are some of the improvements I mean I know panels have improved 20f old in the last 10 years um battery storage what the options are there because I think we'll see those as part of facilities so just a somebody who could help us be a little more technologically savvy um and and I know I have my big department of energy annual report um but my sense is that the world has changed even since then so again just a briefing probably from somebody within doe about you know what the world looks like um so for the record Tod cornet I I'll ask this question we could have somebody there are people within the department of energy who have that certainly that kind of expertise and can provide something along those lines so we could do that sooner rather than later the the department is also currently uh by by directive from the legislature doing a uh energy strategy um and that's you know that's going to be ongoing for a little while um so I don't think we would want to wait till the end of that but I'm wondering if you would rather wait till some midpoint of that because there may be good information that gets gleaned you know the department at least the the sort of the point person point people for the Department working on that are going to reach out to a bunch of just different stakeholders to figure out you know what's our sort of strategy but in trying to determine the strategy is also pulling a lot of those elements to figure out you know what are the different scenarios if we go you know more offshore wind more onore wind and solar um you know other types of things and then getting into those sort of barriers limitations opportunities you know that's really what that report I think is going to ultimately conclude you know and sort of recommend where our future is going so again it's really a question sooner or more like three six months okay I will put it on um we have a listing of future potential agenda items so I've already included the BPA one um I'm going to add that one and then we can begin having conversations you know with our our counterparts within the department to figure out what would be a good time to provide some of that information just a briefing council member trit yeah uh just wanted to leave us with a brief story uh Feelgood maybe practical application of what we do here um and how it um kind of um I don't know I've taken what I've learned here and put it in real practice and it involves myself a cross country road trip and my 10-year-old daughter and uh we drove to Louisiana over Christmas we went through 11 states there and back and we talked at length about wind turbin because as soon as you get down the gorge you start seeing wind turbines and it would be moments of Silence followed by I'm dad and I thought a very serious a fatherdaughter conversation was coming on and it was always a question about wind turbin and going down 84 and seeing the blades and the and the tower sections and she would ask well why is that blade bent back at the end it's kind of boded and I my assumption was that what I've learned in FC and from Dwayne and everybody on staff that's probably a repowering that's probably probably a new longer blade and it's probably heading for somewhere in Morrow County uh well how do they make Power how much powerder they make anyway it captured the fascination of a 10-year-old my daughter uh and when I got on to this Council I had no idea what I was in store for but it has been a fascinatingly educational process every step of the way and I've got friends and colleagues and different different lines of work some of them overlap in natural gas some overlap in electricity and from those all the way down to a bigey 10-year-old on a 5,776 milei roundtrip road trip she's very interested in how wind turbines and the grid and the system all works so there's my relation practical application of what we learn and do here and how it affects us in the real world professionally",

agenda not okay and we have nobody signed up for a public comment councelor Stapleton the consent calendar thank you I move approval of the consent calendar with the exception of item 3.3a pulled by nordik second motion by councelor Stapleton second by councelor Phillips counselor to your motion thank you tonight's consent calendar is very lengthy so I'm going to kind of well actually I was wondering um Kristen would you mind um sorry director Rutherford would you mind giving everybody a little precursor on dour loans before I go into this just maybe 30 seconds I'm very happy too thank you so um what you'll see on your agenda tonight on the consent agenda are a series of different Jour bonds um for each urban renewal area and this is a requirement uh because State Statute does not allow the direct spending of urban renew dollars so we can't receive the tax increment and then spend it directly we have to have a debt instrument and that could be long-term bonds um in most organizations it's done through dour bonds so which is sort of an overnight borrowing thank you that's perfectly clear as mud right um other than that we have um item 3.1a which is the uh January 22nd 2024 draft urban renewal minutes um and then all the way each of them have um actually 3.2a is amendment to the UR board rules to conform to the recent changes with the city council rules and then from then on out we just have each of the different um urban renewal districts um and their um kind of I guess how do you put that their how do I say that exactly so you're talking about the the borrowing for each urban renewal area is that yes thank you um so for each area all the way through um to the end and then we just have the item that has been pulled by councelor Nordic sorry for the crazy rambling no worries and is there any further discussion will the recorder please call role board member Phillips I board member gwy I board Gonzalez I board member Hoy I board member nordik I board member vanney is absent board member Stapleton I board member nishioka I chair Hoy I motion passes all right we have no public hearings we on to special orders of business councelor nordik item 3.3a uh thank you Mr Mayor and thank you director retherford for bringing forth this project we've all been hearing about block 50 in the news councel I apologize we need a motion first oh do you okay I move approval of 3.3a execution memorandum of understanding with edelyn and Co and to chase mixis for redevelopment of the agency owned site known as block 50 second motion by nordik second by Stapleton counselor to your motion thank you so um the staff report is pretty short and sweet and I know that I'm getting a lot of questions from Community residents what exactly is block 5050 so uh director can you just explain to us in a nutshell what are what are we looking at I know that there are up to 230 units of afford uh not all affordable housing but partially affordable housing and I know that we're very early in the process but people have got to have questions about this massive uh section of town right in the heart of Salem's living room so Wonder of You just give us an overview of what the the D rough draft of this project looks like at this time happy too so the property that we're talking about is flanked by Commercial Street cha front and then the bridge on the other side okay so um starting around 2019 we began negotiating and acquiring properties that consisted of the former Union Gospel Mission saffron Building Supply and ABC Music um those Acquisitions were completed in the 2021 time frame in 22 we moved forward to demolition of the property site Readiness doing some land use work um doing you know environmental remediation historic work all all of these things to make the site's development ready and then beginning last summer early last summer um went out for a solicitation to request letters of interest and proposals so Concepts um development interest in redeveloping this site so over the the course of the Fall um we received the applications reviewed and scored applications that was followed by interviewing the top three candidates in December and then uh that was followed in January with a presentation um to the mayor and our council president and city manager um where the finalists came in and shared their Concepts and I'll get to the fun part the concepts so their proposal consists of uh two phases of development with the first phase being the um strip of land along commercial between cha and the bridge and their concept includes um housing units so about 140 units in that first phase 21 units would be affordable so that' be 15% of that phase about 22,000 square feet of retail space uh it includes a plaza area on the corner it activation um and a market concept for um kind of business incubator spaces um for smaller retail uh operations um and they want to pursue a grocery store they don't have a lease in place at this point in time but they have designed um the property to include space if they cannot enter into a lease with a grocer then they will um demise that larger space for retail footage then the Front Street side of the property um would be the second phase and that is a n another 90 units of housing no retail on that side um and 14 units or another 15% would be affordable um there's also um on-site parking okay uh thank you I do have some follow-up space on that thank you for that overview I think that everyone wants to see that force from the trees kind of 10,000 foot view so that's helpful um when we bought the funds and again some of my questions are for my interest and also for folks watching at home when we bought these properties how did we pay for them what kind of money do we use to buy these properties these were all acquired using Riverfront downtown urban renewal funds so it was not general fund acquisition it was all Ur right and Ur funds are funds that are set aside specifically for development projects of this kind is that fair to say correct or for Grant so urban renewal funds can only be used within the urban renewal boundary um they can only be used for bricks and mortar type work um planning work that's related to Future bricks and mortar kind of work and so our grant programs you know are limited to building improvements they can't be used to subsidize business operations so um same here we could not use those funds for um for example maintenance of the parking garages they could be used used for a big Capital project on a parking garage but it all has to be tied to a capital Improvement great and then my next question of course has to do with affordability my concs are always I mean when I started on Council in 2019 I was starting to hear a little bit about affordable housing and now it comes up all the time and I know you as our director know that better than anyone that there is a huge unmet need for affordable housing so I hear that about 15% of these units will be designated affordable um I'm one I have two questions about that uh first of all everyone always wants to know what does affordable mean but the second question is because we are in this urra and because we have a pretty sizable pot of money is it possible that we could direct additional Ur funds to this project to increase it from 15% affordable to say 30% % would that be possible at this time so we could certainly have that conversation with the development team um some of the challenges that we would have to work through is there is a cap on what we can contribute to a project without triggering prevailing wage okay so if we um provided more than $750,000 in urban renewal grants um to try to incentivize additional affordable that would cause the project to become a prevailing wage project which is going to drive up the construction cost which will then drive up their loan cost their Debt Service which then makes it harder for the project to pencil so uh we arrived at the 15% um going back oh probably four to five years ago when we started having conversations about doing the single property urban renewal areas to provide an incentive and working with developers and getting their input on that where that sweet spot is between um affordability and financial feasibility and so that feedback was that 15% is kind of right in there um and then we carried that over as a policy into the mtip property tax abatement program which is set at 15% so both of those program pro programs are at that 15% affordability level at 80% or less L of the area median income so that's how we're just defining affordability um no that that doesn't mean that we couldn't go to a higher level a higher requirement um it it does",

        "text": " those priorities were um sort of Rea if you will from 2022 um they were so good we did them again we continued that focus into 23 uh so here are a couple of highlights um most everything that you asked us to focus on in this last year we're still continuing to do one of the things that I know noticed as I was going through um the last year and updates is that most of these things are really becoming how we operate dayto day they're becoming a part of what the city is really focused on you can see uh on your left most of the major initiatives that have been completed in this past year it really is quite an accomplishment to open uin Hall uh have the navigation Center operating uh adding a third micros shelter Community Village um the operations building also opened you can see that the neighborhood traffic management plan is now informing policy and activities that the city is doing uh commercial air service was also launched this year and then you can see that reflected back in some of the Grant and funding awards that we were able to achieve this year I just want to pause for one second and just really take in that list on the left hand side it's quite a lot it's quite a list I think we're all feeling a feeling that yeah but I mean when you really look at it I I just I don't want to just Breeze by it I want to just pause for a second and really look at that I mean we finally open your qual which was is you know permanent sort of housing which is really it's only the second permanent sort of housing in our area the first one we opened the year prior you know that's that's really remarkable to address all the priorities that we're talking about the navigation Center same thing the young adult uh micros shelter which is huge for that a lot of a lot of the issues we were just talking about in our prior work session this relates to a lot of those things our operations building you know open building and and getting that thing open and our neighborhood traffic management plan which is where some of the work that was referenced earlier about that Council referenced about equity and you know that a lot of the work that we did developing that plan that staff really did some great work on is you know is really has really broad implications and and then of course Commercial Air Service which is huge for our community so I just want to pause for a second and say that's a lot and good job everybody yeah it is a lot and if you ask a strategic planner a strategic planner will tell you well that's because we focused our energies around the Strategic plan and the policy agenda initiatives that you all set on an annual basis and that's just me oh you're exactly right councelor nordex thank you I I appreciate you doing that because thank mayor that was fantastic you are so welcome um that's an inside joke everyone um you could all I mean I think we could all go you know around the table and identify even more bullet points to put on this list one that comes to mind I believe our Urban Forester milin Davis and his intrepid crew are planting 2,000 trees this year it's a huge win for climate action in our community and I think that's alluded to uh Equitable treat canopy there's even more of that coming because my ward is probably arguably the leafiest of that's right leafiest leafiest why not yes I think you're correct uh out of the out of all of them but uh we so desperately need more tree planting and I know councelor vanney and I have participated in tree plantings in West Salem and at Yushi Kai elementary school so there's so much more we can do to make our communities livable uh like councelor Stapleton was alluding to in our last work session you know people take pride in their community and the simple Act of tree plantings and sidewalks can create more livability and more safety as a community so if I were to add just one random bullet point on top of all those that would be the one I would add but I'm sure there are others Bond yeah Bond yeah there you go which kind of inves all of I'm gonna highlight some of the other things that are not shown here but I also just want to make sure this has quite a lot of content in it and it has a lot of photos that prove if these things happened as well um so if you if you have a chance there's a lot more detail in this um Community report um and so I also just want to notice to your point councelor Nordic the Equitable tree canopy refers to a grant award here of about a million dollars um you can see the through threads of the Investments coming out of that policy Direction um in in future years do we need to ask for up uh so um the migil Chris complete complete street is one you know a longtime Vision it achieves all of that it's got a storm water and bicycle infrastructure U pedestrian infrastructure and a better a better Street connection the gear Park State park skate park that is the the Imp of a vision that the community find around the park Master theth connection on the can also see some electric vehicle charging infrastructure PGE and you can see Street these are out of so we do a little tour of um the priorities I intentionally am going to talk about the homelessness and the Sheltering crisis at the end because I'm less clear about that one but I want to talk about what we do know first um so you can see this planning for our future this is the evolution of our Salem which has been a priority for years and you can start to see that same policy Direction showing up in a bunch of really specific areas we had um this conversation in July and you might remember this sort of I think somebody called it a dart board recently um but you can you can see how all of the planning initiatives are going on simultaneously and how they all intersect and are feeding and fueling each other um and again planning is the precursor to funding and building as you could see on the last slide where you can start to see some of the grants now materializing for those of us of a certain age we know that that's the thing that used to come on the TV at night when the Stace went off the air that's what that is not a dark work I know that reference um so again you can see these are um the priorities out of the policy agenda for 2023 you asked us to focus and prioritize on slowing vehicle traffic on neighborhood streets that policy direction is now fund leading to us funding activities you asked us to um continue moving the right pairing inventory raran inventory that is a direct outgrowth from our Salem and it focuses on natural resources when that Outreach is finished you'll start to see it showing up in code after a lot after all the process it will be in Salem Revised Code the um housing production strategy is something that's also starting to move and get legs um you can see some improvements out of the permitting efficiency study you could start to see some movement there and then there will be a whole plan that will start in in Winter probably January um and then the transportation system Plan update we now call it Salem in and that's how it's all starting to come together um climate friendly Equitable Community legislation all of those things intersecting so you can really start to see that these things are shifting from um ideas into more of the concrete policy Direction and activities so that's what I was saying earlier when I said much of this work is sort of flowing into the daytoday you can also see furthering the climate action plan now this work is um happening through a some members of council and some members of our community are guiding that work together um there's a micro Grid at the shops complex we just sort of went right over that but that was huge um and then the grants again are mentioned there and we're advancing some of this work with the University of Oregon through the sustainable cities year program um just Thursday I was listening to One little group of a journalism school um course that was had a great idea for how to start an idling campaign in our community um to try to encourage people to um turn off their cars instead of idling while particularly um parents at schools uh do that a lot as I can tell you from my neighborhood experience um and then the solid waste policy we there was a lot of conversation on Monday night about the work that the council committee is doing on that so you can see these things really starting again move under the heading engaging our we um opened the customer service center that was something that we didn't have on that first slide but that's happened and you can see the other one opening in shops shortly at the shops complex um we had in July when we were last gathered to talk about these things we had our um firm come and talk about the Strategic engagement and Communications plan work and that work is ongoing now and folding in again to day-to-day operations uh we expanded neighbor to neighbor Communications that was a um budget motion uh last cycle I think and now it's part of what we're doing more intensely in uh partnership with neighborhoods you can also see that we started an assessment of equity in our programs and services as was mentioned earlier we've got that pretty well dialed as it relates to Capital Investments but it's in the program and services area that we'd like to see some um improvements and we have an assessment coming to us in January that will help guide that work it includes a toolkit uh for new programs and services and it gives us the assessment tools so that we can continue to explore more of our programs and services uh then again in January we're going to be conducting a review of the city Charter um that work again starts in January um you can this this investment in community engaged policing I wrote more capacity there because um as you see from the conversation that we've just had that's probably something that may be of interest for the council and the community to advance so that might be something that we want to continue to carry forward into the next U policy agenda or the next Council board plan um in with regard to strengthening communities resilience and emergency response this again is an area where planning is really important to advance how we work um we are just completing the Cal Hazard mitigation planning um that is",

And again, that's simply for capturing it for our record. And if you could just give us your comments and your request. My name is Alberto Salern Carrero. My address 317-03-0133 at Lane Road, Ocala, Florida. No, so only for the permittees, for the parking my truck, but I'm the same for the request, for the special permission. Very good. Your request. And you've looked at the conditions? Yeah, I know. Okay. That have been there. And does your sister want to speak as well? Yeah, my interpreter. Oh, okay. Very good. Then please go ahead and give your name. And good afternoon. Thank you for allowing us to be here. My brother, his main job is name and address for the record. My name is Anedes Arden Carrero. I am his sister. I don't live at his property. I live in St. Petersburg, Florida. My home address is 2130 7th street, north St. Petersburg, Florida, 33713. Perfect. Thank you. When we purchased the house, we understood that we can park the truck and the real estate agent say that, yes, there's no problem. And then a few months later we receive a notification by the city in which they let us know that there is some violation. So as soon as we find out, we reach out to her office and we provide all the information. Basically, his job is he live between Monday, Tuesday, he's over the road and he can come back to the home on the weekend, which is Thursday or Friday. And so he parked basically the truck over the weekend. And we've been willing to provide all the information, all the requirement. And also she submit to us an email in which she explained all the requirements. We discussed the requirement. We asked her additional question to make sure that we have a clear understanding of where the requirement was. It needs to be mean that we have all the fence, the apron and everything. And we agree to complain on that on six months. Okay. And the. It's only the cab part. Yes. Okay. Not the trailer ever, of course, which we aware that they say it's not allowed. It's prohibited. Okay, very good. Yes, Commissioner Bryant, go ahead and do public comment. Okay, thank you. If you'd like to just step aside for just a moment, we're going to open it up for public comment. And I do have two people. I have Florence Carabone. Charbonneau. Charbonneau. Thank you, Florence. Florence. I've already pulled it up. If you'll come down to the podium, please give your name and address for the record. And behind Florence is Jim Rafferty. So, Mister Rafferty, I have a second podium. You can go to the second podium. And behind these there may be others that want to speak and I will invite you down after they have given their public comment. Florence and Mister Rafferty, you will have two minutes after you give your name and address for the record. You'll see a set of lights come on in front of you. When you see it turn yellow, please start to wrap up your comments. And when it's red, finish your thought. And please halt at that point in time. Miss Carboneau will. My name is Florence Charbonneau. 49th court. Sorry. Ocala 34473. I'm here behalf on the Marion Oaks deed restrictions community and the Deltona Corporation. The item 15.12 for a special use permit to allow the tractor trailer to be parked on private property. We have tagged this home saying that they were in violation of the deed restrictions. Not only are they in violation of the deed restrictions, but they are also in violation of code enforcement office, county codes and they are also in violation of state statute of 71.23. No tractor trailers may be parked in any residential area in the state and against DoT regulations. Truckers know this as this is the first question asked to them on the truckers exam. We in the deed office had received multiple calls from the neighbors regarding this tractor trailer. We have many of them here in our community. We are trying very hard to displace them. There are two facilities within the area that they can go to. One of them is at the Kmart Plaza. It's run by Mister Newton. And there is a Florida secure storage also has opened up 300 slots for tractor trailer truck parking. I also would like to say that the planning board did not take into consideration any of the upcoming projects that they and this board approved in an area such as the expansion of Southwest 29th, the Ocala South Industrial park, the Marion Oaks Trail improvements and Southwest 20th. The street this vehicle is on is one street over from those proposed projects. It will also adversely affect any home or property sales in the vicinity, causing undue harm to the residents by lowering the value of their homes. We have contacted Miss Bryant in the past for assistance on removal of tractor trailers. She's been very gracious in her. If you allow this permit to go forward, you will be guaranteed that three other hundred, that 300 other truckers in Marion Oaks alone will be in line for those permits and you will be unable to stop it as you have set precedent. Thank you very much, Mister Rafferty. I have some paperwork. You're welcome to give it over here to the clerk. Mister Veridon will take it. Thank you so much, Mister Rafferty. Good afternoon commissioners. My name is Jim Rafferty. 1605 B Killarney Court, Ocala 34472. I started working in Marion Oaks half a century ago. Over a half a century ago. Back then the residents were armadillos and rattlesnakes. I worked on the original models that were put in Marion Oaks. I worked on the crane crew for Deltona Corporation. I worked for Deltona in sales. Shortly after construction, I worked my way up the ladder, the corporate ladder with Deltona. In 1987, I became director of sales for Deltona Corporation for the continental United States and Canada. After starting a family in 1990, I went with Marco Polo builders. You may or may not have been familiar with them. I spent many years with Marco Polo and now I own my own real estate office, Marion Oaks real estate. My biggest concern, we've been fighting this for 50 years about these trucks, boats, campers, buses. It's a never ending battle. Our biggest problem is we have 20, approximately 28 roads that lead in and out of our community that go under 44. It's very difficult to control deed restrictions when you have that many roads leading in and out. It is a battle for our deed restriction committee. It truly is my biggest concern and I will close with this pandora's box. Once we open this door, we are going to have tractor trailers and then semis. I mean, we've seen it with fences so and so, but he put his fence down here. Why can't I so and so has a tractor trailer. Why can't I? We can't open the box. We just can't do it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Mister Rafferty. Is there anyone else in the audience who would like to speak to this item? If so, I invite you to come forward. Now, you've seen a couple before, so you'll know when you get here. Give your name and address for the record, and then you'll see your lights come on. Go ahead, sir. Hi, my name is Jim Moore. Mohrdeh. 34473. I didn't come well prepared, didn't bring a whole bunch of documentation, but 13 years ago I bought in Marion Oaks. Mister Moore, if you'll just look this way and put that microphone a little closer to you. And you're talking to this five board right here. Thank you. Thank you. 13 years ago, I bought my oaks. A reason I bought Mary Noakes is they are deed restricted. When you look at the sign when you drive in, it says deed restricted. Now, if I wanted to park things in my yard and not be deed restricted, I'd go about 4 miles down the road. And there's no deed restriction. There's also when you drive in a storage facility that does allow people to park their vehicles there. So we have a precedence here of all the time Marion Oaks in this area has been around, it's been deed restricted for a reason. Now we're growing, we need your help to grow properly. Properly is not saying, hey, I didn't know, somebody told me. So now what am I going to do? If you want further parking when you're putting in a warehouse, say, hey guys, guess what? You're going to have to give up a little bit of room. That's all I have. Thank you very much. Thank you, mister Moore. Yes, ma'am. Afternoon commissioners. My name is 4745 Southwest 159th Lane Road, Ocala, Florida 34473. I've been a resident of Marion Oaks for 36 years. I also own a business in Marion Oaks. And I do object because as everybody has said before, it is a deer restricted community. And those type of vehicles are prohibited in any residential area. Restricted community. Not even that. I think this is going to. Our roads will not be able to take it. I think it's going to damage our roads, is going to damage our",

        "text": " we were unaware of Permitting requirements to prune trees and assumed that it would be under the property owner's responsibility to maintain we were under this assumption because upon moving into the neighborhood my father spoke to a City of Salem employee who assured him that he could prune the branches because there was some low hanging branches just like you would maintain the grass and that's the expectation for you to maintain the grass as part of the tree removal there were some pipes that were damaged and my father was expected to clean up after the mess that was made by the pipe work further the pruning done to the trees was also not impossible to correct if we had simply been given a notice informing us to stop pruning the trees they would already have been on their way to grow back to the state of the city preferred in the notices they state that we killed the trees these trees were not dead they were very much alive very much and so we are we were all completely baffled when we received these notices and when we when we saw the trees removed we the trees were removed before we got the fines and notices so we were all confused as to why the trees were removed and we were given conflicting information as to why the trees were removed we were told some of us were told that it was due to an ice storm some of us were told it was due to non-native trees pests infestation and furthermore we were informed that an arborist had declared the trees dead in August of 2020. we have photographic evidence showing the trees very much after the arborist declared them dead so we are here in hopes that you will hear us out look into this matter and try to help us out you know it's not easy for all of us to be here there's some in the audience that have uh newborns you know I have a fiance that sick at home with two four-year-olds you know it's not easy and and it's benign eye-opening to see the work that you guys do sitting here listening to everybody this is my first time here and I appreciate the work that you guys do and I really hope that you guys can help us out thank you thank you for your testimony appreciate you coming thank you Victor segola Mr Mayor counselors uh thank you for giving the opportunity to speak up for my neighbors and for myself I'm another neighbor from the tree incident that is getting like directly affected like my neighbor said I have a family of five I'm getting charged almost three thousand dollars for a tree that uh I wasn't aware today was Salem property until I got the male and the fine through the mail so all I'm asking is to please hear us is not only me it's a total of like almost 10 houses that got and one of them is affected for eighteen thousand dollars fine to be honest is is ridiculous amount of money for only a few trees they were and like my neighbor said there's a bunch of contradictions between the workers of the city when I asked the worker from the city they were streaming getting out the tree what was the reason that you guys got it out he told me that it was because of the storm my other neighbor got told that it was because the tree was dying so it's a bunch of contradictions there is happening and all I want is to be you know his we're normal families that we're work day by day to bring food to our tables and I believe in this house for seven years you know and I never had a problem like this so all I'm asking is to remove that fine because one we don't have the money two with a family to provide and three we didn't know about no trimming those trees and like my neighbor said he wasn't those trees were still alive they weren't dead like the way that they noticed says and we have physical evidence physical pictures that can show you that those trees still alive and they were they were simply trim it that's it thank you thank you thank you for coming Jesus Cardenas my father does not speak English if you do not have a translator I can do my best to translate on his behalf also extend the time source of translation thank you sure English is my father says that he wishes that he could speak English so he can articulate this has been in a better fashion he was not doing anything by malice intent he was trying to do something nice for the neighborhood to beautify the neighborhood as a service to the he moved into the area in 2015 and when upon moving in the trees were in a neglected State there were damaged branches branches about to fall the following year in 2016 he saw a passing Salem public works employee who who he asked if it was acceptable to trim the trees to perform maintenance on the trees and that is where this problem arose was this interaction which I thought that he which gave him the understanding that it was acceptable during during the ice storm of 2020 a couple blocks away from his house the ice storm completely closed down a neighborhood street because of the neglected state of the trees that had not been pruned by the city that the when the ice storm I think we all can remember the damage caused by the ice storm you know brought down trees brought down limbs it caused property damage they had to close down the neighboring Street because of the pruning that my father had done and some of the neighbors had done to this trees in our area our area was unaffected it was night and day difference you could drive through our street without being affected by the damage caused by the ice storm that was not the case on this on the streets that were left City management he did not charge any neighbor to a system in trimming the trees he did this as he is retired he had the time he was trying to help they are charging him for damage to 20 trees excuse me 23 trees when in fact there was only 20 trees affected the city chose to plant three additional trees where no tree had been before you know throughout the years City of Salem public employees would drive by he never had anybody stop and tell them that that was not allowed to inform him of any policies and so he continued on thinking that he was on the right side of the law because you know he would have assumed that Public Works would have told him that you know you're doing something that's against the rules um as we've all as myself and some of the other neighbors have mentioned there's have been conflicting reports given as to the reasoning for the tree some were told that it was due to non-native trees some were told that because of the damage is seen during the and uh although we don't have photos in a you know nice format to show up screen we do have photos showing um the difference between trees that were pruned by my father and the versus trees that maintained unpruned by the city and these are recent photos and you can see the the vibrant green that the prune trees have versus the yellowing of the leaves that are already happening out of season on some of the other trees am I allowed to pass any of this out sure you can actually give it to the city recorder and she'll make sure that we get it foreign that that photo there shows the Stark difference between the tree on the uh left um showing the green vibrant prune tree and the non-proon tree on the right showing some signs of stress or what have you here are photos of the trees before removal by the city they are very much still alive very much still green and if he would have been simply informed not to continue pruning the trees these would have gone back to their normal growth pattern they would have started on their way back to becoming just like before he started bringing them thank you thank you for your testimony um and I'll he would he would like to see the rest of the photos yeah just just hand them to see your recorder and she'll make sure we get them thank you thank you for your testimony uh Mr Martin did you have did you want to comment or did we no that's that's our last person signed yeah councilor Phillips I I don't know if they're the persons providing testimony are still available but I just wanted to get a sense of like what time did this happen at and then roughly what street and I can get that afterwards but that that's what I'm interested in is like what did this happen before the ice storm and and what as the representative Awards Maria I'm definitely going to look into this and talk to staff thank you that they we do have a gentleman stepping back to the Michael and answer your question I now Gary I'm gonna have to lean on you a little bit for time frame um could you remind me it was after the ice storm because we were being you're being notified that our trees were trimmed in August of 2020. notification of tree pruning came in August of 2020 um I'm not sure time wise on the ice storm but nonetheless we have photos showing that the trees were we have a photo showing the trees a month after the notice you know very much thriving still and this happened off of um Glacier View and Benham Avenue and Southeast Salem what was the Second Street venom venom thank you thank you counselor did that answer your questions I think it helps um yeah I'd be happy to answer anything else thank you Mr Martin did you have anything on this yeah I could just add a few uh a few comments there was a third street so in addition to Glacier View and Venom there was also also Gifford street was the uh the Third Street and um our Urban Forester looked at these trees which were essentially topped and so you know roughly 15 year old maple trees were topped off and felt that they were not going to grow back or be what they were now some of the conflicting information I had not heard before so we've also gotten responses from some homeowner saying they had no they had no knowledge that this was being done it just happened and they were not aware of it and in those situations if there was not a willingness you know to do it we certainly would pull back the charges and we're not going to penalize some somebody who had something done that they knew nothing about that defies the intent of the code as far as the costs go they were based on on how the code is set up which there's an appraised value so just like you appraise a home you appraise",

is hanley jenkins and i reviewed the minutes and we have a revised set that were provided on the 22nd of this month we've had some discussions about an additional revision to that so i would move that we approve the minutes with the following amendment on page 11 fourth paragraph at the end of the paragraph we would add content express concern about the time it has taken to to satisfactory resolution of this of the issues identified in the complaints submitted by the farmers the time it has taken for a satisfactory resolution there we with that amendment i would recommend i move that we

role mercy grill ken howe jordan fruit henley jenkins yes perry choctew cindy conan yes motion carries man i'm sure thank you mr secretary next on the agenda is the council secretary report mr secretary it's you thank you madam chair i will start with project updates on february 2nd perennial power holdings issued a press release indicating they would terminate their site certificate for bernie win state perennial wind chaser station the 415 megawatt natural gas fire power plant in umatilla county just west of hermiston we have had discussions with perennial power since they've issued their press release but they have yet to submit their proposed retirement plan or their request to terminate their site certificate however we do expect both to come in relatively soon any questions on that before i move on okay seeing um next on my list is the bigelow canyon wind farm in the past two weeks we've received notification from portland general electric the site certificate holder that there were two reportable incidences at the bigelow canyon wind this project is located sherman county the first was a blade liberation event at 2 11 am on february 1st a blade detached from a turbine in the phase one area of the project and was thrown approximately 100 yards into an adjacent wheat field there were no injuries or property damage and the landowners have been engaged and informed the blade does not appear to have struck the tower and the other two blades and the turbine do not appear to be damaged pge has shut down all of the turbines within that phase of the project while they investigate the cause of the after the report was in uh the incident was reported to us the department did have a call with lena cope who's the senior environmental specialist with pge on february 10th who walked us through the incident and just a couple of items of note that came out of that is the pg will be consulting with the turbine manufacturer to see what guidelines they have before returning all of the phase one turbines to operation and then their current plan which is still under development is to torque a represented number of the phase one turbines to see if there is movement on the hub or pitch bearing bolts and additionally pge's metallurgist took a new bolt and 50 of the failed bolts that attached the the blade to the nacelle to run the test to determine if the failure had anything to do with the torque or the material so the bearing the damaged blade will be removed and sent to western machine in portland for testing so this incident is still clearly under investigation in trying to figure out what caused the blade to detach from the wind turbine any questions okay the second event at bigelow canyon another transformer failure i believe that would be the 10th that occurred at 10 pm or around 10 pm on february 15th it's estimated that approximately 166 gallons of non-pcb transformer oil has been released onto the surrounding gravel pg is contracted with u.s ecology to assist with the cleanup and the spill has been reported to deq so if you the council requested pge come present the prior nine incidences of transformer failure at the february january council meeting and so this occurred shortly thereafter okay moving to my next update which is cardi generating station on february 3rd we received amendment number three for the carter generating station this project includes an operational 450 megawatt natural gas fire power plant as well as an approved but not yet constructed 50 megawatt solar component portland general electric is the site certificate holder for this project as well and the project is located in morrow county amendment three requests to extend the beginning and ending construction time frames for the solar component by three there are no other additional no physical changes being proposed to the facility simply a change in the beginning and ending construction timelines for the solar component portland general electric has also requested that the amendment be reviewed under the type d the amendment request is posted to the project website we send a notice of our receipt of the amendment request and the type b review request on february 16th okay next is the nolan hills wind power this proposed project includes 350 megawatts of wind as well as 260 megawatts of solar and 120 megawatts of battery storage and the applicant is capital power projects would be located in umatilla the application was deemed complete on january 31st and kate sloan who a senior sighting analyst with the department who is the project lead held a virtual public information meeting on the evening of february 16th in addition to department staff council member condon and the applicant team there were 17 uh sort of non you know department council or people who participated in the meeting so a decent showing not a lot of comments or questions but uh there was sort of at least we had good participation in terms of watching the presentations and since then we have posted the meeting slides as well as the video recording of the meeting onto the project website so even if somebody did go to the meeting when it was live they can go back and review it if they want all right project update is the golden hills wind so this is a 200 megawatt wind project that is currently in construction and located in sherman county on february 16 2022 compliance officer dwayne killsdonk and escp specialist kevin woodhouse conducted a site inspection where erosion and topsoil management conditions were documented as being substantially improved from prior conditions observed in december following the january fsec meeting the certificate holder contacted the department and proposed additional corrective action measures as part of its corrective action plan including offering soil enhancements to all affected land owner and tenant farmers paying for landowner seating if pacific holder the certificate holder seating was not preferred adding a long-term soil monitoring and evaluation component to the revegetation providing to the department documented completion of reclamation satisfactory to the landowner and if this documentation cannot be obtained and executed settlement agreement to compensate for top soil and crop damage due to failed topsoil management excess disturbance and erosion impacts the department is working with its consultant on review of the proposed measures and will continue to work closely with that consultant the oregon department of agriculture and the certificate holder on the corrective action plan components any questions moving on to future meetings so the next scheduled council meeting is march 17th and 18th but unless something occurs during today's meeting that would necessitate having a march meeting uh we will not be needing to have a march meeting so um if unless that comes out during today's meeting the the march meeting is essentially cancelled and then following that would be april 22nd and uh 21st and 22nd would be the following meeting and we will at least need to have a one-day meeting which would be the 22nd in april so currently i have all council members available for that meeting if that has changed or does change between now and then please let either nancy or myself know so we can make the necessary adjustments todd this is marcy i just wanted to i'm sorry i my brain feels so still just acknowledged dwayne's efforts i know we all had a lot of comments um last time and the fact that he continues to",

        "text": "yeah we're learning a lot this morning but I have to open our meeting good morning everyone and Welcome to our Marion County Board of Commissioners meeting it's Wednesday Wednesday March 8th it's 901 we're here in the center hearing room as always we start with the Pledge of Allegiance so if you please join me I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and

what he was saying and Mr chair we can hear her today yeah that's pretty good I'm working on it yeah good Justin time to stay at the county Mr chair I just want to make a comment I'm thankful that uh item number two first item number one Judy Skinner what a great volunteer at all the things that she's done for swamac and within our community garden services and at the fair and all the things that she does she is just a star and I'm glad that she's willing to continue to serve and then I'm so thankful item number two is going to be out of here um and I hope your thumbs up in the audience I hope I can get the check in my hand within like 24 hours or 48 hours and just take it over there and say here right they did say within 10 days so it's not going to be within two but within 10. uh Jan Fritz said she bird dog that for it perfect um I hope Jeff is listening right now thank you Mr chair for letting me say those things yes we have a motion in a second is there any further further discussion no no seeing none all those in favor signify by saying hi hi all right uh next up we're going to consider approval of an order appointing Jared Howard as the justice of the peace pro pro tempore Jane do you know for the Marion County Justice of the Peace District good morning commissioners I am here uh on a happy occasion but also to to nominate you do actually have to introduce yourself for the record oh my goodness sorry thank you I appreciate that I know he doesn't have the Habit yet all right hey uh my name is Justin Kidd I'm the Justice of the piece for Marion County good morning uh so I've been on the bench now for I don't know 18 months or so and I have not had a pro tem so I've been dealing with um the the events of Life uh by mostly appearing remotely up until now uh but I'm going to be on a ship at the end of this month and so I am asking a little bit more I know right so I'm going to be in a place where it's not feasible for me to have electronic communication so I am asking the board to nominate a pro tem to sit in for me I'm nominating or I'm suggesting uh Jared Howard who is here who I think you'll find to be very well qualified he has a ba in politics and philosophy from Willamette University he's a 2009 graduate of Willamette law school he's the principal owner of uh Howard Law Group here which is kind of an all they do kind of all things but they have a specialization in real estate and the reason I think that's important is a couple of things it the Justice Court we do a lot of traffic and we do a lot of real estate in the form of fed work fvd works a lot harder harder to teach more a more technical area of law traffic's a lot easier for the world oh for sure yeah fed is uh the the fancy name for evictions so we do landlord tenant law okay and so um uh that can run in either way but most cases run from landlord to tenant as an eviction case so uh Jared has done eviction cases so he's uh well versed in understanding the ins and outs of that kind of law it is a hard area of law to teach so I I think he's a good candidate he also has done cases in justice court or he has appeared in Justice Court um and he's from Marion County so you'd be surprised how many of the lawyers who appear in my court are not from Marion County mostly from Suburban Portland metro Portland I know right um so that being part of the job we find I think that he's a real good fit that way is that because we're giving tickets to people from Suburban Portland because I would feel great about it no it's not uh it's because uh the traffic bar is pretty specialized and I think in order to make the um the economics of a traffic centered Law Firm work you have to have a lot of customers so they tend to be from Portland interesting and same with real estate most of the real estate lawyers are also in Portland that's where most of the cases are so uh but I think the most important thing I haven't talked about is he's just got real good Common Sense real good Horse Sense and that is really the the key job of a Justice to the peace is applying the facts to the law but doing it in a fair Equitable and sensible way so I think he's a real good candidate to fill in while I'm out yes I would so um I know you have a little bit of information on me and Justice kid has sort of introduced me I thought I'd tell you a little bit about me I am a local guy my wife and and I live on a farm in Marion County with our kids I was born across the river in Dallas I've always lived here I've always worked here prior to law school I was involved in farming Timber and real estate Jared do you want to introduce your wife she's here oh you might want to say I was my wife Jessica Alexander Maximilian welcome welcome I love the use of the tie by the way um so I I think that perspective like I was a business owner before I went to law school I've worked with my hands and my mind like farming chamber those are hard occupations real estate takes a lot of planning I think that has led me to practice law a little bit differently than a lot of my contemporaries particularly in Marion County the The Mid Valley area in general 2009 I started my own Law Firm Howard Law Group we do kind of a mix of very specialized complex transactional work real estate businesses secured interests Etc we also do Court work we do a lot of real estate I'm known as a real estate lawyer that includes a lot of fed's forcible entry and detainers what we commonly call convict fictions for both residential and Commercial I have appeared in justice court before and I would indicate my experience is the same as what judge kit indicated is most of the attorneys are from the greater Portland area because of the evictions have become very complex particularly since 2019 and some of the follow-up legislation and I think it's a volume-based thing where a lot of it local attorneys don't practice that anymore when they come down from Portland and they and they're they're now practicing law is something I really enjoy it's a great career I'm interested and excited about this opportunity because it would allow me to working in the legal field in a different way and also engaging with the community I mean that's something I teach to my kids you need to be engaged in the community you live in we live in Marion County this would be an opportunity for me to engage in a different level with the community and also to work in the legal field in a different capacity on occasion that's a little bit about me any questions just thank you for doing that I think that's really important and I I was I'm not going to give anything away what you're going to say today but uh commissioner Willis is going to be sharing today at our state of the county and his point is being involved in our and I really appreciate you stepping up to do that in this particular way and and the way you're role modeling that for the Youth that are the Future Leaders of of uh our community so that's great thank you very much appreciate it but yeah I I wanted to say that because you said something I think you said sort of not uh maybe it was essentially a conscious thing but you said you have to engage your community you're from Marion County and uh I love that because because that's true right that's sort of uh instinctive for people around here especially folks who grew up in this area right that sort of natural that's what it means to be from here is that is that you take responsibility for this place and and you give back so I I appreciated that the way you put those two phrases together I I agree it is something I think is especially locally as there are a lot of us who have that appreciation for engagement with the community particularly if we plan on staying here right and our kids will be here is make this it's already good place but make it a better place I think that's important I just think it's our place and I think you're right and",

        "text": " change good to something like reasonable instead the term reasonable is defined um and something that the puc uses um different parts of their regulations and it needs quote an event or circumstance that the grantee at the time the deadline is established could not have reasonably anticipated and was not reasonably within reasonable control of the grantee so that makes it a little more flexible what that extension could be for um the way it reads now kind of sounds i think we're all in like a coveted mindset that this would be like if the governor would shut down this data or something but there are other um i think better ways to to allow folks to get an extension and then the i mean the thing with the the planning grants like ray said that's six months is really short and realize that's in the statute and there's not a lot we can do about that what that means though is that really the only entities that can probably take advantage of that planning grant are projects that have already started the planning process and um so then when it gets to the part about that seemed like a lot of consultations for planning and i think if my memory served me right a lot of those were in the statute itself so i guess the suggestion is that if we can stick when it comes to consulting for a planning grant we can stick to only what was in the statute and not have any extra ones any extra consultations because every consultation you add on makes it unlikely that you can actually finish within that time frame and then i want to make a comment about the i assume that those announcements are um informed by the rules but is there would there be a case where an announcement um would have new information or new criteria that wouldn't be included in the rules i guess i'll just pause there to understand that a little bit more but i do have another question before you meet me again could you say that again angela yeah i'm not sure i completely understand your question okay so um in the let's see what page you're on here i'm having troubles with my pdf file so your question is about opportunity in that sense yeah but about additional components that aren't in the rules right so it's kind of unclear to me um in those opportunity announcements will will they be based solely on the rules that that will be adopted from this public comment period or would there be other um criteria added or other new things added down the road without a rule making just wondering if there's if there's a chance those would be different for some reason we would want the chance have comments i can address this one at one level and wendy may have a more complete answer but with the opportunity announcements we also plan to have the um the scoring matrix for how these projects will be competitively reviewed and that scoring matrix will be based on what we have in the rules but we wanted the flexibility to look at the the weighting of certain from one opportunity announcement to the next to see if we needed to change scoring to enable certain types of projects to in future rounds but but all of the criteria that are going to be scored will be within the within the rules and we'll always publish the scoring matrix with the opportunity announcements so that applicants know how they'll be able to you know compete within the review okay that is exactly what i was wondering about and it would be helpful if there would be a chance provide comment or to have the advisory at the very least review that scoring matrix and have the ability to give stakeholder um because that's obviously going to be a pretty important piece of this you are ahead of your uh ahead of us angela we we actually have this on our agenda for the advisory committee meeting this friday and so the advisory committee will be reviewing our draft um scoring matrix um this week okay but unfortunately it sounds like that's if public comments are due the 28th and there isn't any chance for public comments on that criteria those aren't in rule the scoring is the scoring piece so the comment period is for the rules and this is that's right yeah the scoring matrix is outside of the rules and it'll be associated with the opportunity um well so i guess if there's if there's a possibility for stakeholder feedback that our folks not on the advisory committee that would be appreciated and then before i lose my my my here um i wanted to note that in the planning grant section on page electric utilities are not defined maybe that was intentional um because i believe this grant can be used by any any type of electric utility in the um but just wanted to note that of course since we have different types of electric utilities and i don't know if it would be helpful to define it further or not i think that is all my comments that's a really good point angela and it's actually only open to consumer-owned utilities the investor are not um counted as public bodies or called out specifically in the bill if if we need to clean that up a little bit within the rule language we'll do that so that's very helpful regarding the opportunity to comment on the scoring matrix the advisory committee meetings are also public meetings and we always have a public comment period at the end of those and so if you would like to you know have a look at what we're proposing you're welcome to join the the public meeting this friday from 10 to noon where we'll be going over the scoring matrix and it's very much in its draft form right now we're anxious to get feedback and would certainly welcome any thoughts you have on that i just posted a link to the advisory committee page and the materials are already posted on that site too so you can take a look at them and reach out to me and i'd be happy to make sure the advisory committee and staff see them okay that's good um will their um will there be any any other chance to submit comments since i run a member-based organization i'd like to take the criteria back to my members and have them reflect on it so do i have to kind of only give comments in a moment or will there be an opportunity to send someone after friday that's what i was suggesting by you can email me i'll put my email address in for everybody too but you can email me and it doesn't need to be by friday we're still working it's an early draft and we'll be integrating feedback from friday and um working toward ideally opening the program still over a month away so got it thank you but i have one more question now based on something that rap just a clarification so um so it looks like in the planning the application has to be drafted and called on consultation with but then can a planning grant still be for a project in industrial or in the planetarium yeah just that the utility would not be the applicant in an investor owned utility service territory it would have to be one of those public entities like a you know an irrigation district something like that but the bill actually requires that all projects have consultation with their local whatever utility that is there's just a special call out in the bill that consumer-owned utilities all consumer-owned utilities are eligible applicants and that's meaningful because under the definition of public body munis would have already been eligible and i think puds probably also fit that public body description but this opens it up to the co-ops yeah basically just a dis just a distinction between who's an eligible applicant but utilities will have to be consulted in all applications i see so then in the planning grant see it looks like 1b when it says an application must be drafted in consultation with electric that means any electric utility including an industrial okay so yeah i think it would be good to define electric utilities since it means different things in different sections of the rules thanks good idea yeah i'll jump in here just briefly this is wendy i know that we do have a definition of electric utilities i believe in the definitions for the rules but um but thank you i know that there are a lot of these different definitions so we will double check any kind of craft references and and definitions that we have just to make sure um and as rob mentioned that the bill does require the applicants to consult with the electric utility that serves any customers that would also be and part of the you know served by the the projects that's in the application so we've got these multiple layers of who's eligible to apply and who serves customers um etc so we'll we will um just do another uh check of all of those definitions as they apply to different um aspects of the the rules and the bill so thank you for that great thank you lori hutchinson has her hand raised to make the next comment laura you're on laurie you're off mute if you want to make your comment thank you i just wanted to underscore the very good comments that ray made seeking some feedback from the community solar program on timelines for planning um and i can just sort of given us an example from a typical utility pacific core now has a cluster process so if you have an opportunity announcement in march a project may put in for that cluster announcement in april they might have a result in november and that result may or may not you know the utility will be evaluating that particular project along with many other but it may be even typically up to a couple of years after that until you see who else drops or does not drop out of the queue till you see how feasible your project and so as much flexibility as you can bake into the process under your rules i think will be necessary just given the utility environment that we're in and then um you know it's a it's a bit the wild west you know some pds and co-ops really vary in their involvement in in these sort of projects and so some of them are nimble and ready to go and some of them may be looking at this for the first time something like this for the first time so yeah just underlining and putting an exclamation point next to the these projects are going to need a lot of flexibility in the planning process most everything is feasible if you have persistence but it will take time thanks laurie do we have anyone else it looks like ray might have his hand up again yeah i read in there in the document uh some language regarding um odoe's ability to to recover the grant funds in some circumstances and i wonder if you could explain expand a little bit of what those types of circumstances might be and i can think of an example where a",

        "text": " is causing increased pressures on our working lands and wildlife habitat we are faced with a difficult touchdown we need renewable energy to help mitigate the impacts of a change in climate but many of the best sites for renewable energy projects have already been utilized and there's little to no low-hanging fruit left reintersecting goals of our land use system mean that Oregon values many different ways to use our land and benefit communities but oftentimes these land uses come into conflict not to mention the lack of needed transmission capacity that prevents many projects from being built at the same time our state is rich in historic and cultural resources and first foods important to tribal governments and communities protecting these valuable and irreplaceable assets is imperative our energy citing processes must weigh all of these things and do so in ways that also include meaningful tribal consultation accessible opportunities to engage for the communities impacted by projects and a streamlined process that makes it possible to get things built there are ways in which our current regime does this in ways it does not if we are to meet our goals while also not communicating to tribes and communities that we will do so by any means and all means whether they agree with those goals or not then it is necessary to ask what we can do better in the energy citing and how we can work together across many interests perspectives and uh levels of experience to deploy the right strategies to ensure that the ample benefits of renewable energy and transmission are made possible without adding to the already complicated and lengthy and costly process everything I've articulated is why Verde renewable Northwest and thousand friends of Oregon can be in a conversation to include as many voices as possible with interest and ideas about how our renewable energy and transmission sighting system could be improved we believe that no one organization uh nor only a handful of organizations can do it alone we need many creative perspective insights and most importantly relationships to make it happen the purpose of the conversation is not necessarily to make and pass legislative policy although that has been abled by two placeholder legislative Concepts that may be introduced should it be the right path the purpose is to address the challenges I outlined and to do so in ways that bring together voices who may never have worked together help them build empathy and understanding collaborate and ideate and see where we can get with Collective the group has been meeting since the end of August and it included includes a large number of voices not fully representative of the categories of the slide there are certainly places where we could be better in regards to uh participation from conservation voices in tribal communities although we are working to convene a separate space to get input from tribal governments and working to ensure better representation from conservation voices as well as a broad swath of government voices from local governments in eastern Oregon we began the process by hearing from State agencies about what they do and regulate and brainstorming the challenges and opportunities people see in the current citing system rather than plunge into strategy conversations we've received some wise cautions to spend time learning from one another and better understand only how the system works from an agency perspective but how it is felt On The Ground by developers local governments and communities it's easy to describe how something is supposed to work and much more difficult to understand the realities at present we're narrowing the scope to discuss what we want where we want to go from here and we'll hone and find alignment to potential strategies in the new year to develop potential strategies and identify opportunities to enhance or improve the current system we've divided up into four working groups about whom you'll hear more in a moment and you've already heard about the transmission working group from Lara these working groups are focused on how citing and land use interact and where pressures might be relieved through goal changes or changes to the exception process understanding and addressing transmission capacity needs and alleviating transmission constraints on project development and acknowledging that new transmission is difficult and sometimes contentious to build improving resources and capacity for local governments and how they engage around citing and mitigation and ensuring that value systems related to communities historic and cultural resources and first foods and conservation are all taken into account while still finding ways to streamline the process um I will pass it off to the rest of the work group leaders to share more about what we're learning and forecast some of the ideas that may emerge in the coming weeks I also want to extend great thanks to them for leaning in and helping guide the way and the next person I'll pass it to is Mary Kyle McCurdy who is the deputy director of thousand friends of Oregon uh go ahead Mary Kyle good morning um chair Grail and members of the council my name is Mary Kyle McCurdy I'm the deputy director of 1000 friends of Oregon and my organization agreed to be a co-convener of this large group because the issue of renewable energy in a number of past legislative sessions and while there is a agreement on the need I'm sorry is I'm hearing another voice and while there is agreement on the need to increase renewable energy production the conflicts between different but all legitimate interests have not been however even in those conversations some paths forward do seem possible but they are simply not reachable in the hurry of a legislative session in the context of one type of renewable energy or one geography or just a few stakeholders so this large conversation over the past months has enabled that sharing of needs opportunities and challenges and hopefully a better understanding of the perspectives of different stakeholders the term land use can seem abstract but it is important to recognize that it is shorthand for a variety of economic social and environmental values that are encompassed in the Statewide planning these are lands where people make a living growing food habitat and Wildlife cultural resources Etc as well as lands that can be places for generating renewable energy the land use planning process for the structure to balance and mitigate these different needs but it is only one part of the puzzle here so we believe that in the next few weeks we will be exploring whether there is a process by which to identify areas or characteristics of areas with lower conflicts or where they may be more readily mitigated and provide for a more streamlined process thank you um the next person I'll pass it over to is the executive director of the community renewable energy Association Mike McArthur who we'll talk about the work we're doing as it relates to the interaction of local process and the cycling process thank you chair Grail members of the council Mike MacArthur executive director of the community renewable energy Association and I'm getting that feedback that Mary Kyle heard as well I don't know what I can do to adjust but let me know if there is something technical but anyway Korea um is the public entity organized under ores chapter 190 we represent local governments and renewable energy developers as ex-officio members um Korea's members include most of the counties where renewable energy projects are being cited in Oregon um I've agreed to to lead these of the large group on the local citing process that's the the slide you're seeing here um Hospital 2021 as you've heard and probably know who's going to require a significant build out of a renewable generation Korea wants to see that happen in Oregon some developers say Oregon's the hardest state in the region to decide projects the current BPA interconnection queue indicates regardless to connect to the grid for more than 46 000 megawatts in just four counties in Oregon for instance in Sherman County 15 000 megawatts are proposed and if only 10 percent of those projects go forward it would be more than double the generation from Sherman which is already leading the state in renewable energy generation the rural counties where renewable energy developments happening typically have very small planning staffs like one person at Sherman even so projects they're able to use the local citing process get cited sooner and less expensively but there are limits on the size of projects that are eligible for the county process renewable energy is not currently explicitly explicitly recognized as a land use value Under Oregon Oregon's land use goals and that conflicts with with House Bill 2021 and the governor's climate executive order 20-04 that means other land use values are given more weight in the permitting process which is contributing to some of these difficulties the Oregon land use system needs to be updated to account for renewable energy and I appreciate the self-examination that the council is doing I've filled out the survey and uh be interested to see what where that leads we need to find ways to expedite siding reduce conflicts and develop and that development inevitably creates we don't need to create further obstacles and processes that delay the development of renewable energy if we're going to reach those goals that's why Korea is participating in this work finally um I'd be remiss if I wouldn't compile on to the appreciation of Hanley Jenkins at his service on the council over all these years Hanley has been a great representative for Rural Oregon Eastern Oregon local government and I personally have very much appreciated his expertise and uh congratulate him on his service thank you thank you Mike our final work group is focused on community conservation and historic cultural and Trust resource value systems uh the draft aim of this group is to ensure early and meaningful tribal and Community engagement education and accessibility and citing to better understand and respond to local community cultural and conservation values and to the early discussion has focused on how to engage communities meaning from the start while also finding ways to streamline process a common fear I've heard from developers about what might come out of these conversations is added steps or requirements around Community engagement that would weigh down an already difficult path to getting a project built the goal of this work group is the least to avoid that while still finding ways to help ensure that communities feel the benefits of projects and have a voice in the process one possible idea that has been discussed is better enabling or incentivizing Community benefits agreements and giving projects that utilize them a faster track drop up I'll forecast what the next few weeks look like and also encourage anyone who has not yet gotten involved that there is still time to help generate strategies and help shape any outcomes I'm especially interested um excuse me uh we meet on Fridays from 1 to 3 P.M and today we're throwing a lot of ideas spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks we'll then take a much needed year-end break and return to flesh out the strategy ideas by identifying the agency venue the mechanisms such as rulemaking or legislation the timeline the lift and any key details it's important to note that",

        "text": " will report back on once I have an answer and then what the process would be for that I I don't know yet I don't know if it would be the same process or if folks would be invited to join um so I'll have to I'll have to get back to you and I know more on that great thank you um so for the advisory committee the role of it as it's been envisioned thus far is to really serve as a focused group of experts uh and to provide input to the executive board um specifically on decision making and tactical actions um perhaps also provide input into the mno contractor which I'll get to shortly um which I believe stands for management and organization um but also to serve as a conduit to um to you know to do some of that Outreach to communities companies and um and provide uh that Avenue for outreach and dissemination of information about The Hub so uh advisory committee members may be asked to develop um and or review elements of the Hub application uh if that is the case they will be asked to sign an NDA and as I mentioned those 12 um the uh the way that they've been the way that they're going to be structured is that each subcommittee would have a chair and then each subcommittee would also have a board liaison and so that would help with the communication between the advisory committee and the board any questions about this I don't see any questions or any hands all right on to projects and selections as I mentioned um even as the association um was being formed uh it's staffed by Washington Department of Commerce and so put together uh that first request for information uh so that wasn't um you know I had a lot of questions about that kind of early on in the board meetings and unfortunately we just didn't have a lot of information about how it was how it was created because we weren't included in um so the goal though of the first RFI as we were told was to really get a sense of the landscape what's out there in terms of potential projects interested parties how much things might fit together um and this was done with the understanding that this wouldn't be the only opportunity to get information on potential projects so in that first RFI uh there were 76 uh complete responses and so the majority of those projects were in uh Washington and the Puget Sound region uh there were a number of them in Eastern Washington um there certainly were organ projects as well um over half of the responses were from private uh for-profit entities but also over 20 percent of responses came from government entities any questions about that first RFI um Kelly I think you started to write a question do you want to just come off me and oh there it is uh Kelly wants to know what is a quote complete response on quote me great question I was really hoping nobody was gonna ask that um so this is information we got from Commerce I'm assuming that a complete application was probably most of the information um I'm gonna guess that that didn't mean that you answered every single question because if you looked at the RFI it was prodigious in its request for um but you know certainly people were told that even if they didn't have all of their project information locked down to at least complete a little bit of it you know as a way to get yourself on the radar and then also there were concerns from some potential applicants about confidentiality and since that hadn't been finalized and communicated to anyone Odo heard from some project uh proponents that they weren't comfortable putting in all of their details so I I don't know kind of where that cut off was for complete versus incomplete but I have a feeling that it wasn't every single field need to fill need to be filled out but you gave you know a fair bit of information hey Rebecca we've got another identities of respondents been made if not how are the participants in a regional approach expected to coordinate with each other or does the association intend that all coordination goes through it that's a great question um I certainly haven't you know as as I am Staffing uh director Benner as um for her work on the executive board and we haven't seen all of the names or any of the names of the project applicants the only applicants I know of are the ones who have told me directly that they have applied so I would add that um you know to the questions that we take back to the association and perhaps for our discussion as well um if we'd like to propose to them how we would like to see things go um certainly the association is aware that there hasn't been um a lot of transparency up to now and there have has been just have been discussions around how to be more transparent how to get information out so I think that if you know if we today want to discuss some you know potential uh ideas of what we would really like to see or what we think is critical for us to see then I think that that would be a good use of our time thanks Rebecca I've got a couple more questions for you here did you say what the split of those 76 responses were between Oregon and Washington do you have a breakdown on that I don't have a breakdown all I know is that most of them were in Washington right and then Matt asks um who is the m o contractor can you elaborate on what their role would be uh yes this is the slide for that uh but also no uh I can't answer your first question only because I don't know if the Contracting is complete I believe um that the association is in the process of finalizing the Contracting with its selected mno contractor um and so I think that that is going to be made public as soon as that is all how however uh the board uh had a meeting yesterday and so we did get to hear from the collect the selected contractor and hear about their approach to this their you know their experience in hydrogen their experience in managing multi-million dollar government um so um you know looking forward to hopefully being able to make that public soon and that's a question I can I can take back to the board as well is is when are we expecting to be able to make that public and so here on the on the bottom half of the slide pardon me uh is a little bit more information so Department of con Commerce issued a an RFQ through state government procurement processes for the mno contractor uh this summer uh it closed in August and they moved really quickly to select to select the candidate so the scope of work is for the contractor to lead the Hub planning and application development uh that's considered phase one and then also to lead the Hub construction and deployment uh if uh The Hub application is successful and so that's being called phase two uh up top on the slide though too is the project selection committee so this is another committee formed by the Association and so this is separate from the executive board it was decided that uh because there are project applicants on the executive board um that due to Anti-Trust issues it would be better to have a separate project selection committee they would all be you know all signing ndas all working in what's called a clean room format for sharing uh confidential but maintaining it security the um there has been developed project grading criteria it's in draft form right now with the goal that once we actually saw the foa um and then with input from the m o contractor and from the project selection committee that we would finalize that project grading criteria I don't know what the goal is for that to make that public or not or to make that um or to communicate that to the advisory committees I I would hope that it would be communicated to the advisory committee but I don't have any any sense of how that's going to work yet I do know that their goal is to come back to the executive board once they've finalized it um to have a vote on it any more con uh questions about mno or the project selection committee uh we've got one from Ken who asked are we providing input to the criteria or is that close to the public uh I think that that's something that we can discuss here today um we can discuss you know one if we want you know if you if you want to make a request uh that that be allowed um that that be taken into account um or if we want to even suggest some specifically and from our discussion here today Ken go ahead searching for the mute button uh I mean this is kind of crazy I mean is Oregon involved or not involved do you do you don't even know what whether we'll have input to the selection criteria and by we I mean like you and the advisory committee which hasn't even met yet uh the executive board is very sorry I didn't mean to speak over you oh that's okay it just it it feels kind of like being cut out if I mean I thought one of the purposes of this meeting was to suggest what folks in Oregon feel the criteria how to it's not even clear that we have input to it that is one of the goals um for this meeting that's why some of the discussion questions we included kind of you know what are your thoughts on the Hub concept and on criteria you know we share those concerns um at Oda we've heard them from a lot of stakeholders uh you know we certainly you know the associations trying to keep things confidential and competitive but also trying to figure out how to ensure that we're getting the right people involved um and and the right feedback um I think that there is a real concern around timing um you know I've definitely heard the uh the truism that you know we're building the the airplane as we're flying it but so one of the big goals today was for for us to hear from everybody about your concerns about how you'd like to see your concerns addressed um and so you know the executive board has seen the draft grading criteria so we could you know we could certainly go back to the board with you know asking that it be shared you know with the advisory committee or with or you know or with you know stakeholders at large um you know that's all on the table for what we discussed today um and that's why we're here today is because I I want to hear these concerns and we want to be able to ably represent you on the executive board I mean if they have um if they have draft criteria without even having convened the advisory committee it doesn't instill a lot of confidence in the process I um I definitely",

forward please state your name and place of residence for the record as this hearing will be recorded thank you silia Joy yes good evening mayor Roser and counselors Joy Chang senior planner for the planning department tonight we'll be discussing the climate friendly Equitable Community rules um that are mandated by the state of so this slide basically reflects the background U which basically states that on March 10th 2020 the former Governor Kate Brown issued an executive order directing U state agencies to reduce pollution with that the Oregon land conservation and development commission adopted climate friendly and Equitable communi C rules to help meet the state goals to redu climate pollution especially uh from transportation and again these rules apply to Urban metropolitan areas throughout Oregan uh the city of Sherwood again is mandated to apply these rules because if we don't um they will require the cities to have no uh policies so uh the goal was that the city has implemented the least impactful standards of all the C alternativ provided to us um as you are aware uh the city is under litigation where the city and 12 other jurisdictions um sued over the new rules and unfortunately um the Oregon courts of appeal affirm the overall validity of those rules um that was adopted by lcdc but the city and some co- partitioners are seeking review of this decision um by the the Supreme Court so if successful the C rules could be found inid and we are in the process of the draft ordinance has some specific language that allows for that toen we win so um key parts of the rules is reduction of parking mandates uh reform your Transit corridors and climate charging uh parking regulation improvements reducing the burden of parking mandates and housing or Fair parking policies uh we have been um I'm going to have a couple slides that address very specifics in regards to these rules and we have been granted an alternative date of implementation because the rules should have been implemented as of June 30th of this year so we've gred an extension due to meet U Council schedule and getting our meetings so let's start so the first is reduction of parking mandates of for certain development times so we require no parking or the rules require no parking more than one parking space per unit in residential developments no parking requirs for residential care training treatment facilities requir for child care single room occupancy housing residential units smaller than 750 square ft affordable housing public publicly supported housing emergency and transitional shelters and do domestic violent shelters the also the requirements in regards to reform your Transit Corridor uh line 94 um reques for LS of parcels within half M of the traic corrid as defined by the defined line 94 as frequent Transit versus Tri would not consider line4 as trans the other is the climate friendly areas which is uh the Town Center so of course we have Sherwood Town Center so again no parking is going to be required within our town center on Parcels of land within one quarter distance of the center line and so the image in front of view as far as the pink is the impacted area so the blue reflects line 94 and the red reflects the sh Town Center so everything out of that out of that area or everything that's pretty much impacted as far as us not requiring parking even though I just want to point out even though we're not requiring parking if a brand new development comes it doesn't mean that they can't build parking if they want it's just we are not going to re the other regulation specific to um electric charging Vehicles so it reques multi family residential buildings with five or more residential dwelling units and new mixed use buildings of five or more U will require to install EV conduits to accommodate 40% of the vehicle parking spaces so again it's just the conduits U so that the infrastructure is in ground when we're constructing uh the other uh regulation that we're also implementing that's tied to EV is that nonresidential devel both commercial and Industrial uh under private ownership will be required to also install EV cond at no less than 20% of the vehicle parking spes in the garage or parking area for the building um so that is very specific to the building code and so we're just rolling it in since we're already making changes related to regulation improvements um we're addressing uh preferential placement of carpool and back pool parking allowing Redevelopment of any portion of parking lot for bike or Transit uses allowing and encouraging Redevelopment underutilized parking for other uses allow and facilitate shared parking new parking lots more than half an acre in size also install 40% from tree canopy or solar panels or solar wind uh be l or green energy um we're also uh adopt parking maximum in locations such as downtowns Regional or Community Center and Transit oriented development additional amendments include reducing the burden of parking mandates so uh unlike today uh uh garages and car garages we typically J count as parking spaces within EX code so the garages and carports may now U be counted as a parking space um and also uh garages and carports may not be required for residential developments but again typically housing that are built typically have um so but there's provisions of share parking um shall um be allowed to meet the mandates parking may be provided offsite within 2000 of pedestrian travel of a site and then reducing uh parking mandates of providing solar panels or wind panel uh wind power capacity car sharings uh parking space parking spaces units that are fully accessible to people with disabilities so finally um there are fair pricing mandates um there were some choices and Council reviewed these choices and actually chose two options um and they are to require parking spaces serving lease commercial developments to be unbundled uh and second requiring a tax on the revenue from commercial parking lots collecting no less 10% of income with revenues dedicated to improving Transportation alternatives to drive alone travel um and at this time we're have we're implementing the regulation but we currently don't have any commercial parking lots within the city of Sherwood but if and when that ever happens we be in compliance and we will be collecting 10% of that again this is just a the new 5.36 that again commercial uses um with some exceptions as far as hotels Motor Vehicle sales and service trucks Min Warehouse housing or Self Storage uh vehicle fueling station car washes and again we're asking um the leases um the property owners that have these commercial uses to have rates of no less than 50 per space per month for each partici and they would be executed at the time that they Ren or get a new lease at that commercial development um again the parking lot aspect even though we don't have one again it's a new tax revenue for the city um these are parking commercial parking lots there Standalone parking lots that are that rent parking on a daily monthly or annual basis I just want that clear it's like a smart Park that aspect of it versus um going to for a plaza or Marketplace that's not what we're talking about here again it's based on unless Target starts charging for parking your store right not likely certainly under this they could well yeah they could uh but so um again this is going to be based on gross income collected quarterly um and we're going to generate a standardized form just to make sure similar to the transit loging tax form that we have to execute so yeah um applicable criteria in regards to plan am is reflected here on this slide and definitely they've been address St amendments um public engagement definitely is always key as far as Oran finding number one and um we presented to the Sherwood Chamber of Commerce twice at a network breakfast and also business licensing or business lunching we've had two public open houses uh one in the morning that was catered to the business community and one in the evening that was catered to the also did social media postings um and the typical uh public hearing notices so uh the Planning Commission was definitely our project advisory committee for this project they had three work sessions related to the regulations front of you and you have seen initial draft where we your in every session in regards to the work session for commission session for city council there always opport to the am amendments and public invol so public notice again was um submitted or was made um and also news we did get one new comment written testimony um where they had some um that parking reform near transor will create a larger demand for on street parking she she requested that bu zones be installed to restrict curb access stop areas so buses can pull up to the curve toward and you know this concern was sent to our city engineer Public Works reviewed the request and basically stated that buz zones or the no parking requirement is currently not implemented throughout the city the city will be updating the transportation system plant in the near future I believe starting in 2025 through that tsp update umbrella staff will consider creating that may park so we'll address that in the tsp update we also reive correspondence from uh dlcd directly in regards to a list of questions and recommended changes to our amendments and we ultimately ended up with two public hearings at the cling that those amendments the ones that um we thought could move forward um were made and you guys are seeing the latest that have blessed byc as far as Community comment we did receive one Community and Miss Master also testified in person during a Planning Commission um shequ the mandates reding parking Ando trans aru that while the intentions may be good the approach is flock um she highlights various challenges people had in their daily lives which make buing parking impractical and unfair instead of restricting parking she suggested focusing on promoting electric vehicles and public transit she also criticize the potential consequences of limiting parking cluttered Street and argue that such policies encro on individual freedom and represents government um as again as previously mentioned the proposed amendments are mandated by the state but again additional comments from the community are welcome up to the close of this year thank you Joy and I just I just want to add real quick um this is an issue that we've been with Salem for a couple years now and we as a",

        "text": " Corridor to really facilitate negotiations with land owners this change will allow IPC to work with landowners and accommodate change during the construction process as you know Wardman hemway is a 300 mile long transmission line and things will come up during construction and it's it's a key uh Energy Corridor uh energy pipeline for um to bring renewable energy from the north from the Northwest to Idaho and from Idaho to the northwest so to clarify the original site boundary really is a micro siding Corridor so we can move project features anywhere inside that um based on engineering as we develop final engineering work with land owners and that sort of thing what we're proposing is to have an expanded site boundary and changing the original site boundary to become the microid and Corridor so that doesn't change when we have this expanded site boundary which is that quarter mile from the center line of the transmission on on either side it allows Idaho Power uh to move a project feature with landowner support only we're not we're not going to move that without agreement from the landowner uh but we also have to do all the required studies ahead of time which include biological and cultural studies from there once we have a proposed move into that microid sorry expanded site boundary we would then develop the the amendment determinate determination request with um and send that into uh staff at um at the organ Department of energy from there it'll be it uh if that change is substantive enough an amendment is required we'll evaluate where we are the goal here is to be able to accommodate landowner changes and evaluate if they're minor enough and change if we're moving you know a common scenario we're working with a land they ask us to move an access road because it's better for their Farm it minimizes their impact if we would have to go through an entire amendment process that's as you can see from our previous timeline that's a lengthy lengthy time timeline and there'll be multiple many of those that might come up so what we're trying to do is if it's minor in nature we've done the studies we get uh we prove that it's similar impact same habitat um we've proven there's no resources that are impacted then it just sense for the project and for the landowner so that's what we're trying to do we're trying to accommodate landowner requests and if something happens during construction where um we have to make a minor change onto a road if we would move for example 10 feet outside the site boundary because which is and you can look at it you can say this is similar impact because we're moving that that area 10 just 10 feet outside the site boundary an amendment would be required with this new process we would be able to approach uh do an amendment determination request show that it's minimal impact and we could move ahead with construction and keep our construction timeline so I I really just want to clarify what this does and what it doesn't do so right it allows us to continue to work with land owners on a and and work to negotiations to to gain easements it doesn't grant us any sort of condemnation rights out we're not going to condemn in this expanded site boundary it'll allow us to keep construction on schedule this is a vital PR to the Northwest as I stated earlier and um it'll it'll really allow us to to minimize our impacts and and minimize the burden on doing multiple multiple amendments for minor changes what it doesn't allow us to do is we can't just build wherever we want in the site boundary without approval we we can't avoid studies we can't avoid def determining exactly what the impacts are we still have to go through that process it doesn't allow Idaho Power to force changes on land owners right now as the where the line is shown is where we're going we intend to build it we're not going to be really this expanded site boundary is going to be I I see it mostly for Access roads right we that is that is probably the the most common use of this unless we can reach an agreement with a landowner um for to change change drout really I think the goal of this is for remote flexibility during construction on a very complex project and I do want to comment a little bit you know right now um on blasting I believe you know we do not intend to do any sort of foundation blasting based on our current construction plans but we are trying to leave that open and we would have to gain approval with the Department on a blasting plan if we decide we need to do blasting based on the soils that we encounter during construction um comments on you know individual negotiations with owners those those we don't really discuss publicly because those are between us and that party and they are complex and really outside the jurisdiction of odoe and FC um yeah that's all I have to say Thank you Mr Sipple okay it is 7:38 on Monday on uh May May 30th 2024 in the public hearing on the draft proposed order for the Boardman to him andway request for amendment to is not closed the the hearing's closed but the records left open until 5 o'clock tomorrow so it's we're behind schedule significantly um what do people want to do a 10minute break okay 10-minute break we'll come back at okay it is now uh 750 the next agenda is for the wagon trail solar project draft proposed order public hearing and will include an information portion provided by senior sighting analyst Chase McBay Walker who will provide a brief overview of the agenda item and the request

opportunity tonight to provide comments on the DPO and on the ASC an overview of the energy facility sighting Council I'll keep it brief as Kellen has already gone over this but the energy facility sting Council um is a seven member uh volunteer uh Governor appointed Oregon Senate approved uh group Council um and the Oregon Department of energy sighting division serves as staff to council while Odo staff makes recommendations to the facility sighting Council or FC it's FC themselves yourselves um that is the final decisionmaking Authority for energy facilities under FC jurisdiction including uh the proposed Wagon Trail solar project next slide please which brings me to an a brief overview of the proposed project The Wagon Trail solar project is a a proposed up to 500 solar solar photov voltaic energy generation facility uh proposed by Wagon Trail Energy Center LLC which is a wholly owned subsidiary of nexera energy LLC the facility is proposed to be to be cited within a site boundary of 7,450 Acres all of which would would be in Morrow County and within exclusive Farm use zoned area private privately owned exclusive Farm use zone of that 7450 Acres within the site boundary uh the proposed facility would permanently occupy 3,641 Acres so less than the proposed boundary and related or supporting facility components include up to 500 megaw uh lithium ion energy storage and that would be uh cited in two different locations a Northern Battery uh storage component and then a southern one as well as two collector substations a northern and a southern uh 34 A5 kilovolt collection system6 miles of 230 KV transmission line and also up to 47 miles of access roads next slide please now I'm getting into the process steps there's uh seven major steps in the review of applications for site certificates I'd like to emphasize that we're currently at the draft proposed order step which is the fourth step of the seven the first is the applicant's uh notice of intent which is their conceptual plan if you will the notice of intent is reviewed by the department and the Department issues a project order which is the blueprint for the application it dictates what the applicable requirements are and would be following the project order uh the department receives preliminary application for site certificate from the applicant and through reviewing agency and coordination with the public via a public information meeting the uh reviews the preliminary application for completeness and ultimately once completeness is reached a complete application is provided to the department which is where the the recommended findings in the draft prop proposed order are based off of is the application following the draft proposed order the department uh and following following the public hearing and fex review of the draft proposed order the next step in the process is the proposed order and that's uh staff's revised Rec recommendations based on comments received if there's a contested case that's a a step following the propos the proposed order and only those persons who have raised a relevant issue in person at the public hearing tonight or in writing by the comment deadline which is next Friday June the 7th May participate in the contested case and the contested case process step is run by an independent hearing officer following contested case process should there be one is uh fex review of a contested case order if there is one or Andor review of the proposed order and the issuance of a final order which approves or denies the application for site certificate this slide",

        "text": " i'm not seeing any questions in the chat yet i'm hoping the raised hand function i know somebody wants to raise their hand and tell us that it's working that would be either that or everyone's just quiet and oh i see brooke thank you brooke and mary for a second they put their hands down so we did see them okay good phew thank you we um we're making good time here too so we looks like we will have some time at the end for questions great and i do see a question from laura in the chat about whether odo has some specific studies in mind for the research fund if janine or michael want to take a shot at that sure laura thank you for the question we do have some specific ideas on topics not necessarily specific studies in mind yet and this pop actually envisions us working with the energy advisory work group to come up with studies that would benefit existing work wouldn't be duplicative of other work that's being undertaken in the state there are a number of areas where we have identified in the past through the biennial energy report and some of the other reports we've been doing for the legislature where we'd like to seek additional information we don't have that expertise in house so that would be the um type of studies that we would be pursuing but i actually think that jessica rikers is on the call and jessica if you have anything you'd like to add in terms of studies we would be funding with the energy research fund go thanks janine um i think we hit that you hit most of the ones we've been thinking about i would just add that we do get requests regularly from our stakeholders in different meetings about studies that they would like us to consider and this would be the kind of thing that would enable us to be a little more nimble when we get those requests of putting them in front of the energy advisory working group and sort of doing that quick assessment on whether or not it's something that we think would be helpful um to do quicker uh sooner rather than later so great thank you jessica laura hopefully that answered your question and i'm hearing that maybe the chatting to all everyone is not working again so sorry about that but we are able to see your questions that come in uh to all panelists and we are um happy to read those out so everyone can hear what's being asked um were there any other questions folks with their hands up ruchi that you noticed um i think i do see a hand up but stacy confirms that might just be a testing hand and not a real question but um adam if you if you have a if you would like us to unmute you or if you have a question you're welcome to put in the i'm happy to answer any questions if they're not just testing the hand thing okay glad to know it works thank you and we're gonna keep working on that uh chatting to everyone okay michael back to you all right thank you uh so now we'll move on to the energy development services uh division and this division's probably seen the most change in the uh from two years ago where i was primarily tasked with administering administering inactive or programs to standing up new programs and extending the oregon solar plus storage program so the division now administers four incentive programs in addition to the legacy tax credit and lending that are no longer active again just some highlights that i won't read word for word uh i could go for the next slide uh so this division has 21 staff uh and represents uh 18.39 fte and the fte count is slightly smaller and is adjusted for positions that are only proposed for part of the biennium or that are part-time precisions uh we have part-time position and accounting related to this program so here's the eds budget breakdown and it's funded by general fund for incentive programs uh self loan repayments along with a small amount of lottery fund dollars uh through paid bonds for the inactive energy efficiency finance program and a little bit of grant interest fees here so this one is pretty and so again here's a division overview and um you know i won't spend too much time on these unless there are questions but you can see that this division has no vsa so this is where again kind of this the breakdown this is where you'll find most of our special payments in the incentive and you'll also see that there's again no esa support for this division and in case you're wondering the residual amounts in the energy efficiency s s are just kind of carry over and will eventually be phased out uh now i'll talk about the policy option packages for this division uh so the first and as i mentioned before the we did have to phase out most of our incentives and use policy option packages to face them back in hey michael yeah we had a question come there were a few mentions of funding that odo receives from bpa i think it's important that oda recognize that those funds come primarily from ceos who also pay the esa um yes thank you tom for pointing that out that that is how bonneville receives its revenues and bonneville does fund the northwest power and conservation council members also a reminder that if you send a question to all panelists we'll see it faster than sending it to the host yes thank you tom for that uh so sorry michael seeing a couple more questions coming in now um yeah now that's great peggy is asking about back on slide 18 oregon global warming commission is there an increase in staffing and research for the oregon global warming i'm happy to go back to slide 18 but the answer is no the agency request budget does not specifically seek additional funding for the oregon global warming commission but we are in conversations um with the legislature about the needs for that commission and assumed that some of the um additional resources here will help the work that the global warming commission does as well but it will be specifically for odo hope that answered your question peggy all right going back to which slide were we on uh the ossrp slide the first policy option package thank you oh and i see that peggy was able to chat to everyone so sounds like that is working now thank you all right so this first pop in the energy development services is to continue funding for the award-winning oregon solar and storage source oregon stoller solar plus storage rebate program uh for additional five years at a cost of 10 million dollars in general fund um our second pop uh has to do with the energy efficient wildfire rebuilding incentive program which we launched back in april and it is a general fund program that has reserved over five hundred thousand dollars in incentives for 81 wildfire survivors who are looking to rebuild um more energy efficiently and another over 150 applications in progress we are not proposing to add new money to this program just to allow another few years to the existing funds as the wildfire survivors won't be ready to rebuild by the end of this biennium and then our third pop for extending funding and staffing for two new heat pump incentive programs that the latest that the legislature authorized a few months ago just uh earlier this year one of these programs will provide funding to regional entities to establish heat pump distribution programs and one will provide incentives for the installation of heat pumps and rental again these are general fund so those are the three policy options packages being proposed in the energy development services division does anyone have any questions about eds i'm not seeing any rooty are you seeing any questions no no hands raised yet either all right oh we'll just keep rolling then and just definitely feel free to chime in with questions uh as you have them uh so the nuclear safety and emergency preparedness division represents oregon's interest in the hanford nuclear facility cleanup manages our radioactive waste disposal regulations and prepares for nuclear related emergencies and also leads the state's energy security planning division give me a second for the slides to get there uh this division has six fte and positions uh so it's great so on the next slide we'll talk about uh the nuclear safety and emergency preparedness for nsep is primarily supported with grants from usdoe for the work on hanford cleanup the program also receives fees from radioactive voice haulers and esa resources are used to support some of odo's work at emergency such as the fuel action plan or fuel action planning i will note that esa was used to support oto's work on radioactive in-state radioactive waste oversight but the current biannual odo requested and the legislature approved shifting that to general fund and this budget continues and expands the general fund support for penn state radioactive waste oversight let's meet we we anticipate continuing into the next biennium next is a breakdown of uh the nuclear safety and emergency preparedness budget again and i'm probably looking for it right now but by the personal services special services and their special payments are payments made to oregon health authority and oregon state university for helping with emergency preparedness and again um as i say in our agency request budget odo is proposing to increase the general fund support for radioactive voice disposal monitoring and oversight this increase will support additional work to monitor radioactive waste in the state and work with waste managers to ensure that they understand and are the laws so um are there any questions about this what program michael i don't see any questions about nuclear safety but a question did come in about the incentive programs do you expect the heat pump program to roll out this fall i think the answer is probably closer to next spring the legislation passed in earlier this year in the 2022 legislative session and that once it passed we then started hiring staff and we're still working on that so that we can design and launch the program yeah um we are working on that working onboarding uh or recruiting the staff getting their rulemaking working with our partners to identify um how to best parameters for operating both of those programs any other questions all right next is the energy facility sighting division and it's one of odo's primary statutory responsibilities to ensure that proposed energy facilities meet specific statewide and local standards and are considered with public input and this division is seeing an uptick in proposed projects and amendments over the last few years leading to an increased workload for the team and for the energy facilities citing council the citing division let's go to the next one here the citing division has 13 staff and fte there are currently five citing analysts that evaluate project",

        "text": " well but by the end of the week we should have the first one up and i think a link will be appearing in the chat momentarily if it's not already so the first portion today will be done in a presentation fashion so please use the chat if you have a question um during that time and and we'll catch up with you um and and if you could also i'm not sure that this tool captures the person that's asking the question so if you could identify yourself or your affiliation that might be helpful as but either way if you have questions during the presentation portion please put them in the chat i'll give ample a little pause as to to do little mini q and a's and catch us up as we go through um and then contrary to that conventional webinar advice when i get to the walk-through portion of this we really would like you to raise your hand and ask your questions in real time a lot of a lot of times once we get into that tool i think the questions might depend on context so so we'll break with tradition and and try to have you interrupt me during that and i may or may not remember to give you a reminder that we will be recording this so please contribute accordingly and the first tool i'm going to talk about is the electric school bus guidebook and don't worry i'm not going to read it to you it's a it's a pretty lengthy document but i am going to give i guess a pretty strong commercial for it um i i know that for some of us it'd be easy to skip the guidebook and start playing with the cost comparison tool and if that's you that's okay but please do yourself a favor and get back to this guide as it's a really high quality collection of information on the project for this guidebook was led by an intern uh now the the reason for that was we had somebody that had a singular focus on developing this book um and that intern also had full access to all odo staff that any connection to schools electric vehicles charging or charging infrastructure she also consulted with key agency staff at the department of environmental the department of transportation the department of education and she contacted school districts that have already implemented electric buses she contacted bus manufacturers vendors service departments electric utilities probably a bunch more i'm forgetting and she performed performed significant research um they said this is a a pretty cool piece of work um i also as we're looking at this slide want to point out there's a kind of a fun little side story that the cover art was a result of a contest from oregon school students i believe they were all like third graders um the contest was such a success that we couldn't pick a single winner and therefore we've sprinkled their artwork throughout this guide kind of making it a fun read just for just for that if nothing else but like i think it's got a lot of other good things to offer and i said that i wouldn't read it to you but i didn't say i wouldn't share the table of contents uh this is just kind of so you can get uh an idea of how broad uh of topics we're going to cover um and and i also want to point out here we're trying to be fair and balanced we're talking about benefits and challenges to this endeavor because it is a new new technology there will be things that that will need to be figured out as we go along um but again a tremendous resource here and i'm gonna go on now to a few just because i'm giving this presentation i guess i get to pick out my favorite um a few of them are uh evaluating your routes we're talking there about considering the length of the routes the type of terrain how hilly is it temperature weather and all of those other factors that might matter more to electric buses we also recommend talking with your electric utilities because they have expertise on charging infrastructure that would prevent problems in the future or reduce costs as you move into um including them early in your planning can really pay off and not only is this a suggestion but there's an appendix in this guidebook that gives you a list of questions to discuss with them and then we might all have different procurement processes to deal with um but but they're contained in this this guidebook is some really good practical advice for choosing a manufacturer and for evaluating warranties which which can vary quite a bit in this new realm uh of course advice from those already in operation i would argue that it's always best to learn from the mistakes of somebody else and or even better yet copy their and then the resources section and bibliography for this report makes a super great collection of resources if you have any interest in any of these topics uh this is kind of a great place to go back and and uh find the find those uh those dig a little deeper uh but again i i think the guidebook is done at a really nice level and as i said before do yourself a favor and go back and check this out so at this point i'd like to switch over talk a little bit about the the other tool the the officially the school bus alternative fuel cost comparison tool um however since we're talking about electric buses here we might have a slide or two that refers to it with electric in the name um either way this the the intent of the tool is to help somebody that's looking for school bus alternatives uh i'm going to back up to i just picked up my script and i need to tell you you don't have to worry about reading this particular slide they're kind of just graphics right now i'm doing the overview discussion when we get to the walkthrough i will zoom in and make sure to read about do a little check with you guys um so this tool was developed uh as a task of the zero mission inter-agency working group or zevi wig is those of us closer to it referred to um that was uh that that had an origin and executive order and the other note at this higher level is that this has a companion tool that's designed specifically for the transit um one might think of bus as a bus but when you start to get into this topic transit buses are quite a bit heavier vehicles they have a whole different uh use case they're running lots of hours typically uh so so they they are kind of different i think warranted two different tools um so the transit sector one is house that odot on their transit page again i think there's a link in the chat uh the transit version was led by odot and had support by us and and uh and others and uh and then on the contrary we swapped and we led the school bus tool uh but used uh the lessons learned from the transit tool and and worked with them as well as deq and other zevi wig agencies i'm gonna take a minute now to tell you what we think the tool is it is intended to be a screening tool for anyone intending to replace school buses that may consider alternative fueled buses alternatives being to gas or diesel um this work represents a balance between being as detailed and accurate as we could be while still maintaining some reasonable ease of use so in order to keep it relatively straightforward to use the published version is accessed through four of 14 total tabs other tabs not displayed include school bus pricing specifications maintenance fuel type fuel factors fueling efficiency measures like miles per clean fuels program credit estimates criteria pollutant data transportation consumer price indexing there's an inflation rate um there and a few pages for organizing on the calculations and building the graphs uh substantial research and consultation was performed to sure we accessed the most reputable and most current data of course we're talking about a rapidly changing technology so most of the most of the inputs we're going to provide a default piece of information but that can either be taken or replaced with your own information and we'll talk more about that when we get to the walkthrough i also wanted to uh to take a moment to say what the this the cost comparison tool is not um you might have noticed that they use the term screening tool um that's very much on purpose the results of this tool although we think should be really useful should not be the only information that you base your purchase it'll give you general ideas on the effects of fuel choices that you could make as you consider new buses for your however you should have more specific evaluations done for your particular by experienced parties before you purchase before you make your purchase regardless of the amount of care that's taken in building a tool like this there are necessary assumptions made for anyone familiar with electricity rate schedules and how demand charges may be affected by timing i should be clear how difficult it is to come up with a statewide average cost of electricity to fuel a bus fleet um in fact we evaluated all those published schedules that we could find and then developed a fictitious oregon average rate schedule that will be absolutely correct for no one but we believe it represents a fair average for this comparison that that again supports the idea that you will probably want to have a much more specific analysis done for the rate schedule that's at your facility or that could be at your facility uh and again i'll remind us one more time we're working in an area that's relatively new and changing quite and now i will take a little break and see if we have any questions this point as i prepare to switch over to the walkthrough portion i'm hearing none okay so and just for the audience um there is a chat function in the bottom of your screen um so you can enter a chat into that message there's also a raise hand option and if you want to raise your hand we can unmute you uh to ask your question live if you need to again i got out of sync of where i thought it was going to be on this so evan we do have one from greg at evergreen consulting um can your specific rates be entered into the tool for more specific analysis so maybe we can cover that when you do your yeah i know that's a great question and and yes i think there will be there will be a few options there um if if you can consolidate your rate i'll show you when we get to that input um or if you know your rate schedule well maybe we could even do a custom version of this for you um but yeah that's so so right now am i displaying the tool can everybody see the tool are you still looking at the slide we see the front page of the tool for inputs okay and inputs yep okay great um",

website after we're done so if you want to go back and listen to anything that we've said tonight or if you want to hear last night's presentation or the comments that were given there um you'll be able to find that on our website by Friday all right great and then um as we're kind of getting ready I did just want to point out that uh the department's website has a lot of helpful resources uh to help you learn more about the citing process um there's also uh more information about this project posted on the project page um as you can see on the slide here um there is a public guide to citing energy facilities uh to help understand the different phases and the different opportunities for public participation um there's some more General overview sheets a lot of those are available on the tables outside as well if you'd like to mix them up and we do have a helpful handout with uh just kind of all the links listed if you can't memorize uh the link that's that's on here I know I would have a hard time even reading it um and then one other thing I want to point out that if you do want to provide written comments we have a new comment portal you can access that from our website it's pretty easy you just go on fill on a web form and that will will automatically post your um your comment directly to our website so so everybody can see it great anything I missed there I would just say that um we do have a computer out in the hallway if anybody would like to sign up to receive email notifications so you know some of you got paper notices um but if anybody wants to sign up to receive email notices uh the links are on the handouts that um Chris talked about but we can actually just sign you up right now um out in the hallway um so and then after we're done with the Q a here we'll be here as long as anybody wants to have uh individual conversations or questions with uh with my staff or uh with the applicant so but we're happy to take any q a that you have right now okay and if you could go two slides ahead Nancy uh record KIPP um word of Washington fit in this I don't I haven't seen anything that it looks like it's only an Oregon Project great well I can speak to that a little bit so the project does fall in both Oregon and Washington jurisdiction and I did want to point out uh some of our colleagues from the Washington uh Court correspondents have sec the Washington f-sec are are on the webinar tonight um they have a separate review process that they'll be uh I guess my question is are they going to share in the the electricity that's coming only to Oregon or is it no no I I can I can answer that but I'm sorry I didn't mean to cut you off go ahead all right uh no the um one of the reasons for citing the Western converter station where it is is that there's a there's a bottleneck in Portland so uh we we are taking the past that bottleneck to that location the power can then flow north south once it gets to that point so it's in electrically it flows both East West I should do it this way uh and north south so by estimate 70 of the benefit will and this is a rough estimate but about 70 percent will uh benefit Oregon and about 30 percent so if there's any damage done to this cable at any time and I'm sure you're going to tell me this never happened but if it ever did how are you going to solve the problem uh we're not going to tell you it never happens because it does happen um and I may turn this one over to Ernie but uh it's it's very rare and the usual cause of a problem is an anchor strike uh and uh to avoid or minimize the possibility of an anchor strike that's one of the reasons why the burial depth is prescribed by the Army Corps at 10 to 15 feet below the sediment so I can't tell you that it could never happen it has happened not to us uh but it it can happen and uh you know the the permit requirements are designed to minimize uh that possibility so the capacity is that this particular time is set for this what's your growth pattern for the future if in fact you needed additional it we we wouldn't be the 1100 megawatts is the carrying capacity of the cable so how long is that going to last for the community oh the useful life of a project like this is rated at 40 years thank you thank you my name is Sam Churchill I live on the island here I I sometimes wonder if the high voltage lines that come over the Columbia from Vancouver that I think that 230 kilovolts or a BPA has one A G PGE has another uh if they fall down in a in a you know big earthquake would this Supply redundancy can we we have we're fed by one substation that's my understanding I might be mistaken over by the railroad tracks there and uh so uh that subcision gets fed by the overhead I think it's from the PGE line it just drops down so uh if we do lose those overhead one or two of those overhead I I think we'd lose power would would this add some redundancy this will add redundancy for flows coming over the Cascades in other words coming from the dowels into the Portland area that's that's where the redundancy comes in more more transmission multiple transmission lines that's the general direction that this area is headed in with regards to your specific concern for Hayden Island they've built redundancy in with those two lines that feed the substation in fact uh we were just out there walking that yesterday to take a look at that to understand how that works and what they do is each each of those pole lines that goes back towards the the large towers basically one of them comes in and feeds to to one 115 KB trans Mission line the other one comes in and feeds into the other one and that's how they build redundancy into it and they can PGE BPA those folks can give you better information as to the reliability uh those towers are pretty damn rugged uh so uh can I say that an earthquake won't ever do anything to them no but frequency and so on and so forth that's hard to tell one thing I have learned over I've been doing this for a long it's amazing how creative and how responsive uh these companies can be when they have a severe storm or they have a severe event they get pretty damn creative as to how to uh restore service also they have there are uh special transmission towers for emergency use that are basically located in various locations around the country for that very purpose as well to put key transmission lines back in service so that's a long answer to your question this cable doesn't directly provide redundancy to Hayden Island not directly it provides it to the system an important part of one of these cables is its system interface on each end it works with the AC system that's part of the design of how the control system that controls power Transformers power transfers and also uh voltage support through megabar support on each end as well so studies are done as part of the design process for the converters that allow them to work with the AC systems that they connect to and then that this interconnector will provide redundancy in the the major transfers east to west okay I I got another question about the um you know Oregon has like a dozen major trans-pacific fiber uh lines coming in and uh 12 billion dollars worth of data centers uh like Umatilla and then there's Google which isn't the Dallas if um I'm wondering if one of those either like say Google or Amazon could they buy the capacity and not make it available to do you have like a policy on that or how would that work the fiber that's a good question and I don't I don't have a clear answer on that it's it's an interesting idea they haven't approached us and I can't say that we've approached them either at this point I can answer that the purpose of the fiber optic cable as part of our system is strictly for internal communication and control purposes that said uh we are it it would be capable of having stretches where where say a local community and we've actually talked to some of the local communities including one in this region uh to see additional fibers could be added because the the conduit for the cable for the I'm sorry the fiber optic is already there so would it be possible to add fiber capacity to serve particular purposes yes and we would be willing to do that as kind of a a benefit because the fiber optic cable is going to be there one way or the other for our purposes we do not and don't intend to make it a separate sort of commercial Enterprise so uh and and the level to which we've been approached on this uh has been strictly kind of community oriented uh where there was interest in strengthening their own communication system and was there a way to do that and we're happy to discuss that again but not as a commercial Venture for us uh but as part of community benefit okay well thank you very much thank you uh do we have anyone else in the room who'd like to provide a comment or ask if not I think we will open it up to folks that are on the webinar and I just want to point out if you were oh sorry out of the total project costs with the two cables that you're putting in how much is the cost or material and how much your labor and other infrastructure costs so if you were to add a third cable how much would that cost interesting question uh I'm Richard Primark I'm Fiat Lux Modis we're an opportunity Zone fund what I'm going to do is and see if I can elicit some help from one of our our other members that's here today uh Jeff could you see if you can sort of feel the ballpark answer on that sort of this microphone here Chef wood I'm I'm with power Bridge uh part of the development team um the uh we don't have a detailed breakdown on all those costs at this point in time and adding a single additional cable wouldn't necessarily help us if we wanted to expand the overall size of the facility we'd need to expand our converter stations to match and then we probably would",

        "text": " that either go like broader or like more um more strict than the State Building performance standard that could potentially be based off of a greenhouse gas emissions type um type standard we've seen similar happen in Washington state with a Statewide BPS that's based on energy use and then a Seattle specific um performance standard that's based on greenhouse gas emissions so um you know we think there's still some value in directing a building owner to still consider greenhouse gas emissions like with an audit that they do for decarbonization assessments with energy and Emissions management plans um just looking toward the potential for a uh you know a local jurisdictional BPS that maybe does consider greenhouse gas targets um I think I'm going to skip ahead to the the next question because it's um also related to greenhouse gas emissions and then we'll we'll um back up to the question by Neil bondgard before that Ellen J had a comment about greenhouse gas emissions or question um when greenhouse gas emissions are assessed are these just combustion emissions of a fossil fuel employed to generate electricity um or do they comprise full life cycle emissions assessment if just combustion emissions the assessment gives methane pollution an unreasonable pass on the fugitive Upstream yeah I think the the specific emissions factors that we use um after we gather all the buildings data like that'll that'll come in in a few years um when we do that when we do that that analysis um after we get buildings data you know starting in 2028 um but right now we're just referencing in the definitions the emissions factors um that are used by the organ Department of Environmental Quality so and those you know those incorporate utility specific electricity emissions factors um and I believe they're they're mostly for the combustion um they're mostly just for the um like the on-site emissions that happen on the site I I don't think that they include much around um like fugitive emissions for gas okay yeah thanks for that question Al Allan so backing up um Neil bunard had a question have the building types been established yet will you be using the relatively large breadth of building types in building portfolio manager or is another list being considered uh uh we are looking to the uh build portfolio manager list of y great um those are all the questions that I see right now in the Q&amp;A okay I do see um another just scrolling down it looks like there's a a question or maybe a just about multi-tenant buildings responsible for tenant meters um BNC so that is one thing that we will be looking at in in a future Ru making discussion too about how to um you know working with our Utility Partners and and building owners about how to aggregate data for multi-tenant sites um you know we we understand it's not always an easy process or an easy solution um but that is something we'll be talking about in future um future R making meetings haven't really um gotten too far into it though uh okay oh I do see we have a few hands hands raised there too so now so I think we can um go to let's see I'll just go down the line Brian oh thought you were unmuted there there you go thanks sorry um yeah I just wanted to follow up on that um question of onsite energy use and I guess I'm I'm thinking in in the case of a compliance situation if someone switched from natural gas heating to a heat pump Heating and I'm just curious about what your point of view is about the on-site energy use reduction that you get out of that because we understand that this um this kind of Statute to set up as an energy use an on-site energy use metric as opposed to greenhouse gases but if you do a switch like that you you would see a huge difference in on-site energy use because of the higher efficiency factors you get from heat pumps if you're measuring it as on-site energy only so I'm I'm just really curious about what your methodology is going to be for how you would compare the on-site energy use if someone switches from natural gas to to electricity for heating and as a compliance me as a compliance measure like how are you going to deal with that do you have is there a methodology there um yes so I don't I don't know that there's a methodology other than just it it remains a summation of total um you know total sight energy use so if you take like the a before retrofit case that includes some total of gas plus some total of electricity um to get to the total building eui and then you take an after rrific case that includes some total of gas and some total electricity to get to the the total building eui um you know it could result in a a change of the eui um but um you know in the end it's just a straight um you know energy conversion getting to get from you know therms to abbt Independent of the fuel that it you the you know energy type that that was used to get there okay but but it is it is specifically about on-site I mean I'm I'm raising this because you know there's a lot of people who always will bring up if you're talking about electricy well yeah there's all this upfront there's all this like down uh energy use but that's not included in this right we're only talking about onsite correct right it's it's based on site energy use and not Source energy use yeah thank you thank you yeah yeah thanks Brian um next comment is n hi um I was just hoping if you could clarify whether tier one buildings are required to Benchmark and submit that report uh yes tier tier one buildings will be required to report their energy use for compliance demonstration and that first deadline is the larg just set of buildings on June 1st 2028 that's right Y A year later for the next size group and then a year after that for the the small when do tier one buildings have to start complying with the standards like calendar year 2027 uh so right yeah so they would if they would need to demonstrate compliance by that date um but there's no the benchmarking doesn't pred this the energy standards right yeah that will be the kind of the first reporting to Odo yep awesome thank you um Blake I don't know if you see it in the Q&amp;A um Tim Miller has his hands raised for a followup on Allen's comment around fugitive emissions uh I do yeah um and I'll say I'm I'm still seeing raised hands for a couple folks I think I think spoke so if you um if you've already spoken can lower your hand that might just help us kind of move through there we go um so next in line with the raised hand is hodiak oh oh I missed oh looks like you I think I accidentally unmuted Tim instead of Diane um let me go ahead Diane if you want to switch to Diane yeah there we go sorry Diane can you hear me I can yeah okay so uh my question follows some of the others and that is that if you're not really using the greenhouse gas emission calculations um but you you say that they are somehow um included in the calculus somewhere will there be any kind of an incentive for a building owner to actually look at that those uh options for uh that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions because I'm not sure a lot of buildings owners would understand the benefits you know some will certainly but how how would you address that if your goal is certainly to reduce not only energy use but greenhouse gas emissions if you're going to be in congruence with the Oregon climate plan and you know some of the other uh pieces of legislation that are across the state um yeah so we we don't plan to have any specific incentives for um like addressing a specific greenhouse gas missions again because our our statute is directly related to site energy use um and we don't have any incentive funding available for you know application for greenhouse gas emissions the only incentive funding that's available is for voluntary adoption of a VPS um you know so for buildings that aren't covered or aren't covered yet um so for early and voluntary adoption um there could be an incentive for that um but I think where we'll um you know where the clear tie-in is for greenhouse gas emissions reduction and you know to tie into to our state greenhouse gas reduction goals is just you know the one toone relationship that energy use reduction has on greenhouse gas emissions um you know any reduction in BTUs on site is a direct correlation to site greenhouse gas emissions reductions also thank you yeah thanks um Tim next next up Tim Miller great thanks PL I'm just following up a little bit on my question Allen had about the fugitive emissions and I totally get that we're talking about site energy here for the main goals and the main targets and all that but you're going to have this really important and helpful side calculation about ghgs which will be great to see as you report that and maybe if you you know you can give the magic decoda ring to the building owners too so they can do their own Cal if they want to um in that side calculation I would strongly suggest that you do don't just use deq's number because their definitions only let them look at what's burned on site at the burner tip and we all know that there's a heck of a lot of Upstream emissions and when you emit you emit it in methane form it's 86 times or 20 times depending on your time Horizon more potent so I would suggest that we go beyond what DEQ is able to look at since you're Odo give them a more real complete number on uh the ghgs associated with their methane and and frankly for the electric electricity too um you you might strive for a real 8760 you know every hour of the day calculation on electricity too so that a building owner knows that well gosh I'm actually using a lot of juice during the uh heavy solar and wind hours of the year that's better than using a lot of juice during the heavier gas or even coal hours of the day so um you might help folks really dive into their ghgs as you pull together this data um I think that'd be helpful yeah thank thanks Tim thanks for the the yeah uh next is Allan Allan Jour continue the discussion about greenhouse gases um de EQ as as Tim points out Tim teq only looks at combustion emissions of greenhouse gases and that as we know is totally inadequate but I'm also concerned that that when you are if if I'm understanding correctly that",

        "text": " is that it builds in the public participation and the input that we get from reviewing agencies and the public as we proceed in our review next slide so I'm going to jump into the facility as approved and also the amendment the site certificate was approved by Council on February 25th of 2022 so this isn't approved but not yet constructed the certificate holder is Obsidian solar Center LLC which is a subsidiary of apparent company known as obsidian Renewables LLC as approved it's a 400 megawatt capacity solar facility with related and supporting facilities including transmission line and a 50 megawatt battery storage in a site boundary that was approved to be 3921 Acres located about eight miles Northwest of here and it is within Lake County and again this is the first amendment request so I know that map is not all that easy to see but to the right of that slide in the Orange is the solar array then there's a orange line that goes to the left and that would be the transmission line as approved there's a little wedge and that little wedge is the point of interconnection as approved to attach to an existing PGE transmission line next slide so just a little bit of the procedural history I went over it a little bit we did get the preliminary request in April we had additional requests for information that we issued in may we got all of that information back from the certificate holder and we deemed that the prfa complete so we call it a complete request for Amendment until like 31st that's when we'll receive that complete request and then we issued the depart the Department's draft proposed order on August 1st along with that notice of the public hearing and all of those materials were made available on our web page and you know per review and then tonight we're here to do the public hearing next and all the other steps are TBD based on what happens tonight so in short the request for Amendment one is requesting council's approval to make a series of changes and the way I would frame it is as I explained in the one map there's that wedge that would allow them to run the transmission line and connect to the PGE line this request is basically to add additional area and components and little reconfiguration of the transmission piece and the collection lines to allow for the option to tie into the parallel transmission line which is BPA and they would have to go add it from a slightly different direction because they can't go underneath and there's some upgrades that need to be made changes in the in the voltage and the configuration to allow them to tie into the BPA line and the way that it has been proposed by the certificate holder is that their intent is to do one or the other not both but it gives them some optionality on how to connect and which line they would connect to depending on you know their power purchase agreement so there's a few things they're going to add and expand the site boundary to add this additional 169 Acres I'll show you on the next slide they're going to construct uh one of the approved generation Step Up substations in that and this is if they pick this location for the inner tie they will increase the length and the voltage from 115 to 138 kilovolts and that again is the upgrade required to enter tie to a BPA line as opposed to a pte line um similarly the increase of voltage for the collection system is so to integrate into that 138 KB and there's a minor some change in the structure type and height I think it's a 10 foot change in the height for the above ground and it's already approved for a combination of above ground and below collector system so okay next slide so this slide hopefully you can see on the map there's the approved facility which is in the black the orange Square that's off to the the cross hatch and there's a better map behind this on the wall is the area that they're asking to add to the site boundary that's that area e that's the 169 Acres about half of that is in kind of pink that is their proposed actual micro signing area where the where the actual components would be cited at this time while the proposed amendment is requesting no more than 12 acres of disturbance within that area it's not determined at this point where exactly that would be cited within that pink micro siding area which is why that 84 acres is within this requested amended microciting area but no more than 12 acres of that area will be disturbed and the footprint of the the GSU stub station I believe is supposed to be under five acres and again it allows for that option of interconnection to the BPA line next slide so just really briefly um this is just a slide to explain the scope of council's review because there are this is a request for amendment to ask to amend or add new area to the site that is really the scope of our review is the requested Amendment and the new additional area it is not the entire project as it was previously approved so just want to make that clear and then also we have to make sure that for any request for an amendment that the the bond or letter of credit that is required is sufficient to like 20 you know current dollars and with what they're proposing to do either changes in equipment or other things like and then as far as the scope of comments everything in the complete Amendment request is open and eligible for comment so it's not to limit the comments or questions it's just to realize like the scope of our review has been the actual requested Amendment this addition to an approved facility not a reapproval of an existing facility so just want to be clear about that next slide so I'm going to Briefly summarize what is in the draft proposed order as uh secretary Burnett explained earlier this is not council's review of the draft proposed order but this is really for information purposes for the public and for Council just and anybody who's interested that's participating in this meeting of just what is in this graph proposed order what do we see what do we find what did we change or not change so this first slide is really to show you that you know based upon we review every standard on an amendment So based upon our review these this list is the list of standards for which we really did not see a significant change either in Impact or in findings or in a need for an additional or amended condition to the existing site certificate so again you can comment on any of these things but the way that the draft proposed order is written we did not find anything substantive we didn't make any substantive changes so anything that's in the existing site certificate for these standards Is Still Still Remains it's still the same and you know we didn't have any grief you know concerns about how these changes would maybe change councils facts or or next slide please so these are the standards that we did actually propose changes in our draft proposed order and that's either because we've made additional new findings or new findings of fact or we have recommended amended or new can site certificate conditions specific to these standards and that's what I'm going to go over very briefly next and I'm going to keep it brief because the important part of this being here for this meeting is the public hearing so I don't want to get bogged out so next slide so one of our standards is the general standard of review and basically it's just that because rfa1 requests a change in the transmission line corridor um and we have included recommendations that we make an amendment to the general standard condition existing one condition nine that allows for that change because as it's approved it's for that 115 kilovolts for the PGE line so this is to allow them to have that optionality and include the 138 KB option next slide so the next one is organizational expertise and rfa1 includes increases in the transmission light voltage as I had mentioned the length and the extent of above ground components increases the GSU substation Transformer size collector substation Transformer size so one of the things that because of these changes and this changes in the just the technical capacity to do this type of work for a different type of configuration one of the recommended uh new conditions under organizational expertise where these six seven and eight they're all very similar one to supplies to pre-construction construction and operations it's just broken out into those phases but it's really to to to to to require that the certificate holder be able to demonstrate that with these changes they have also they will also ensure that the the right qualified technical people are overseeing this work so it's really just to make sure that as they scale up that the capacity and the technical expertise of those their experts and their um really meet meet that requirement and so that's why we have recommended that next slide so in landing um that area e is currently irrigated Agriculture and if you look at this map you can see there's a pivot circle in it so it's it's there's a water right that's associated with that and based upon our discussions particularly with Lake County that is a special Advisory Group for our their comments were that it was important that there be no net loss of irrigated AG in the county so that they're needed to they they requested and they needed to stay in our process kind of requires that they that the certificate holder demonstrate that that water right is transferred for a similar purpose which the county will allow to another parcel so it needs to it can't it can't be used for that water right can't be used for some other use it's got to be irrigated Ag and that's why we have recommended that Council impose new condition under land use which is condition eight which will require the certificate holder to submit evidence that that water right has been transferred for any area of that irrigated AG within that parcel if that if Council approves that additional person so it's to ensure that there's no net loss of irrigating agriculture next slide so under retirement and financial Assurance I think I had mentioned earlier that part of our scope of council's review is to make sure that this Bond or letter of credit requirement that it's adequate is is sufficient and so we take um the the current you know order 2023 dollars we look at all the equipment and any changes in that decommissioning estimate and when we ran the numbers we came up with a new retirement cost of a little over 38 or 38 million and that is the cost to de",

here Marcy Grail I'm here okay sorry I hit the wrong button thank you Perry choc toot here Richard develin here Katy IMS here Mr chair you have a quum uh thank you Mr secretary are there any agenda modifications uh Mr chair I've got a couple of updates um maybe not quite agenda modifications but I think worth noting at this point um so in the agenda that was sent out we included a review of the June meeting minutes in addition to the May meeting minutes um but uh at the time we thought that those would be ready Unfortunately they weren't ready so they weren't provided to you but I'm happy to state that the reason why they weren't available is uh Nancy was out for some period of time and as some of you who are on early saw is because she is now a proud grandmother um and so she needed to take some time off which is totally fine so we uh will'll have the June meeting minutes for you at the next council congratulations congratulations Nancy um the other thing is the in the agenda it indicated that the forecasted meeting end time was around 12 o'l and um in the timeline that was sent to council it says 12:30 12:30 is the correct forecast of when we're going to end you know that's always um we always make our best guess so that's not guaranteed that at 12:30 but the reason for the discrepancy was because uh since Nancy was out I was picking up some of the responsibilities and so you know essentially rather than having the varsity team with Nancy I had the JV team with me and so just that was uh one of one of my mistakes so my apologies if that created any confusion um and then lastly because we're all remote um you know you might be able to see each other but when when whenever who's presenting has their um is sharing their screen they probably won't be able to see anybody so you know if if the chair can see people raise their hand you know then he can kind of jump in but I would say probably you know we try to kind of Follow That protocol which is good may want to be a little more um if you have questions just chime in during the presentations just in case somebody can't see you so we can make sure that your questions get answered or your comments get raised uh at the appropriate time and with that I will turn it back over to you Mr chair okay uh thank you Mr secretary and again just reiterate if I don't see somebody wanting to speak uh please go ahead and just start talking get my attention uh if I miss seeing your hand or whatever okay uh I've got the following announcements please mute your phones and if you're joining us by phone and receive a phone call please hang up from this call and dial back in after finishing your other call for those excuse me for those signed on to the webinar please do not broadcast your webcam for agenda item C public comment period and agenda item G public notice discussion there's two ways to let us know you're interested in providing comments to the council for those using the WebEx you'll need to use the raise your hand feature for those on the phone only you'll need to press star three which will alert us that you want to speak we'll go over these options again during those agenda items if you want to receive future email notifications of Council meetings project Milestones or rule makings through our click Dimensions program you can do so by clicking on the link in the agenda or on the council web page look for the green box on the right hand side of the page that says sign up for emails updates you are also welcome to a access the online project mapping tool in any documents by visiting

in a respectful and courteous manner where everyone is allowed to State their positions at the appropriate times consistent with Council rules and procedures willful accusatory offensive insulting threatening insolent or slanderous comments which disrupt the council meeting are not acceptable pursuant to Oregon administrative rule 0080 any person who engages in unacceptable contact conduct which disrupts the meeting may be expelled so we'll move on to the um consent calendar and uh the approval of the May uh minutes do we have a Mr chairman I approve I move to approve the May minutes as presented thank you councelor delin do we have a second this is Marcy Grill I second that motion thank you councel Grail um okay we've got a motion in a second uh Mr secretary could you please call the rooll Kent how yes Richard delin yes Katie Imes yes Perry chak toot I'm gonna abstain Cindy Gan if you said yes sorry no problem and Marcy gril yes motion carries Mr chair thank you Mr secretary and I guess we'll move on to your report all right a couple of project updates um so the first one is the madis solar energy facility um that's an approved but not yet constructed solar PV power generation project uh with a generating capacity of 63 megawatts on about 284 Acres with an integrated battery storage system the facility is proposed by madis pv1 LLC which is a subsidiary of ecoplexus Incorporated project is located in Jefferson County approximately 5 and a half miles west of the city of madis on June 25th the department received request for Amendment one which is to begin uh to extend the beginning construction deadline from June 25th 2024 to June 2027 uh and the construction completion deadline to December 28th 2028 uh as well as to change the parent company uh because the Wildfire standard has been adopted since the project was approved uh the certificate holder will have to um do that one as a new standard we are currently reviewing amendment number one completeness as part of that Amendment request the certificate holder requested that Amendment one uh be reviewed under the type B process so they submitted an amendment determination um that request has been posted to the project web page and earlier this morning the department sent a letter to the certificate holder with the determination that the type B review is not justified and that type a review will be maintained primarily because uh as I just stated the council must evaluate the amendment um really the entire project not just the amendment but the entire project against the the new Wildfire standard so that was enough to justify maintaining the type a review and um for this type of amendment determination request only the certificate holder can request council's review so on other types of amendment determination requests this the department could um send the determination for Council for your uh concurrence modification or rejection or you um you know upon hearing about it could also do that but for this type of amendment determination request only the certificate holder can make that request and that just went out this morning so um we'll we'll wait to see if if that is what they ask for uh next is the Sunstone solar project and that's a solar energy facility uh proposed solar energy project with uh generating capacity of 1200 megawatt it would occupy about 11,000 Acres or 17 square miles promly cultivated land in moral County uh the facility is proposed by Sunstone solar LLC which is a subsidiary of pine gate Renewables LLC project is proposed in Morrow County approximately 15 miles south of the city of Borman on July 12th the department issued the draft proposed order with a 42-day public comment period uh which is uh proposed to conclude at the August 22nd public Hearing in Hermiston and that will be the U the next regularly scheduled council meeting will be both Thursday and Friday so the 22nd the 23rd and that will be held the evening of the 22nd um and we'll provide that information to council shortly um Nancy do you want to bring up up the advance the slides there we go you all right so we got a couple of incident updates on June 20th of this year Montag Wind Facility experienced a riser pole fire from an Aven interaction that caused a portion of the collector system to trip offline the AVM carcass was found at the base of the pole the incident res reported within the 72h hour time frame that is required under condition 23 the fire was contained to only the pole uh the incident is now closed and Aven grid is the parent company to the site certificate holder which is Montag wind power facility LLC um next leaning Juniper 2B also experienced a similar Riser poier um similar type of aving interaction and also the Avan carcass was found at the base of the pole the incident was reported within the same 72 hour time frame consistent with the uh condition requirement which is condition 23 um but with this one a total of five acres of grass land around the facility was burned uh the incident is still under odo's review um and then similarly auin grid is the parent company to the certificate holder which is leaning Juniper wind power to LLC so this one's not concluded because of the broader fire and then finally Klondike 3 wind project so on June 22nd Klondike 3 Wind Facility experienced a Transformer fire Transformer uh fault triggered uh a feeder to trip offline causing 23 wind turbines to shut down the fire was contained to the pad mounted Transformer area no Transformer oil was released also the incident was reported within 72 hours in compliance with condition 25 of that site certificate the cause was an internal short circuit in the pad mounted Transformer and the incident is now closed um because we know the cause of that and so similarly offen grid is the parent company of the certificate holder which is Klondike wind power LLC before I move on to my last item is there any questions about uh any of those speak up counselors if there's any I don't see any hands so I guess you can continue secretary corette thank you Mr chair um and then finally just the future Council meetings i' mentioned August 22nd 23rd uh we definitely are going to",

        "text": " have an update sooner rather than later but the full 23-24 possible updates so you know me I like a timeline let me uh start to answer here and then Aaron if you have some thoughts uh as well um I think to your your final part of the the question around timeline I think that staff I think we could complete that evaluation within the fiscal year so by by June 30th 2024 I think that is something that we could do and and uh appreciate the the question we could be more clear in future um I think um I think there's a couple uh a couple things to consider here I think uh we're uh very interested in getting the boards input on the program objectives uh now in a timely way because the program objectives really are the succinct statements where uh the board's uh interests and and principles around how staff should um think about and negotiate an sip deal are embedded within the policy um and uh they're you know again they're succinct they're clear there's a few of them the evaluation guidelines and the the the review process I think and can be refined uh and I think that the existing ones are still potentially in line with the changes to the program objectives as modified but I think that we can do better uh in changing those pieces the evaluation guidelines and the review process to create again a more transparent and efficient process going forward so my recommendation would be that we take a look at the program objectives so that the boards desires are are embedded here within the policy and then staff go and do that more a thorough Deep dive into the process so that going forward we have those additional pieces those additional details in place but I think it's going to take more time for us to to figure out kind of the policy pieces and where those are each kind of connected to to you know existing work that the county is doing so so and also just to kind of match with that the legislative changes go into place those terms those legislative terms the standards set by the state are not affected by this change they go into place they become the ruling basis by which saps have to meet their thresholds and and pay their minimums regardless of any changes that this board might make to the County's policy the County's policy then goes beyond to that place where we sit where we can negotiate what we want and by having an initial adoption of updated program objectives that sends that clearer message of this is what we're prioritizing this is the language of 2023's board saying here's what we want to see come out of any sap that staff will negotiate and then bring forward through that public process we're studying the objectives then those um evaluation criteria that are in the 20 the 2006 policy the the process that are in the 2006 Pro policy can be further examined to see if through an iterative process if we do this um what makes sense what gets us the answers to say did we meet the program objectives does the process meet our program objectives have we operationalized what this board has required of staff to do and so you give that that secondary look of that going into those finer details which are more implementation than policy so it's the I and analogize it to my world um when we set the legislative agenda you tell the gr team this is what we do this is this is where we base all of our policy decisions through those principles that's what program objectives are in my mind and then the priorities are you know very specific so but it's not a policy document that it tells you how it tells me how to Lobby that to affect the outcomes which is more where those um evaluation guidelines and review processes kind of sit so as we do further analysis you can step first into the program objectives update them from 2006 sometime relatively quickly um based on your feedback on this and then allow Matt's expertise to figure out how the evaluation guidelines and review processes fit within that policy and have a further conversation um with the board later in the year of this fiscal year I think that's right does that help with a more clear set of time yes it does that the legislature has taken actions that is helpful um it causes me to realize that uh seeing media articles over the last couple of months uh that and they they vary from you know all we're doing is subsidizing corporations to uh this is what companies need in order to invest in our country and Advance the skills and and productization of new technology uh in our Global Market and so I find myself bouncing between some gross generalization one way or the other to make sure that we help uh The Wider Community know that these are tools right that companies do choose to invest for a variety of reasons and these are tools to help ensure that as our county is positioned to be home for these Investments that we are doing good work uh to engage and to uh go into this with open eyes so that the company can be comfortable about their prospects in the longer term and that we as representatives for the community are ensuring that there is a process such that the community is getting value as well we're not just getting a sell sales job from a company and that's as eloquent as I can put it so um all I can say is for example um I saw that Intel submitted their application to DEQ for new air quality permits I downloaded the zip files I looked at all those spreadsheets and I've used my calculator to see what 2X and 3X levels are and I'm like oh okay I wonder what that means for public health and um you know good for them for being able to do all those calculations and represent all those different chemicals I don't know what all that means for the neighboring communities to the industrial areas and you know Having learned a lot about this the sighting and expansion of I-5 North um the neighborhoods where it split the middle of those neighborhoods and growing asthma rates and all of that where are we making sure that part of that community service fee can go towards funding the public health programs to make sure that future of clean air or at least have medical care you know things like that right I don't know what I don't know anyway it's it's all a mystery don't mean to be so long-winded commissioner Willie your question yeah um well my question on specifically on the program objectives was number four I don't understand generate increased assessed property tax value we're kind of bundling all that into the zip agreement aren't we and then I'm going to refer back to the numbers back uh Slide Five which I have more questions about that and again I have the the 2006 sip agreement here that I've been um but anyway so yeah what I liked team and I'm wandering all over I like what I see here as program objectives valuation guidelines those four I I liked what I saw there always willing to have conversation as to what else could we put in there um without being too onerous I guess but that number four kind of stuck out to me like okay that sounds counter intuitive USA just commissioner really that we go through uh each one of the program um when we get there I'd be happy to jump into details yeah I'm sorry I didn't think we were going to go that deep into the Weeds on this so okay um yeah and I'll hold off my questions okay to go wherever the board wants to go those are the weeds we intended to be in okay so let's let's do that let's go through uh each one of uh the primary program objectives yeah oh I suppose um so this slide has all uh nine program objectives as stated in the 2006 quality I'm not going to read them um we have additional slides here where we'll talk about each of the changes uh one by one I'm gonna make sure I have my own cheat sheet here so I don't uh miss any so uh we'll go through these and uh please uh interact with questions uh as needed um uh the first couple program objectives from 2006 talk about jobs and uh the first one is really primary to the goal of the Sip program this is about talking about creating and retaining high-wage jobs um here in the county um just a minor change here around using more inclusive language we would change residents to community members here but still think that the tenant of this tool should be used primarily looking for high-paying good jobs uh is um is vital here so that one's a minor a minor change if we're not talking about Community it's trying to get at community members of Washington County I mean if we're only looking the jobs may be here but people are choosing to live elsewhere it's not they're not living here it's not helping us with the property taxes so I guess I don't see it's really the resident community members as opposed to so it's um because I'm sorry um it does say create or retain jobs for Washington County community members um the term resident has a propensity to trigger related to immigration status yes yes okay thank you okay I missed that yeah I want this way though on the prior line in which was being changed yeah yeah thanks for the clarification thank you I just sometimes I remember reasons that's great great thanks uh the second one again about jobs and the 2006 language uses some language that we don't use as much today so talking about lower skilled workers um and we also thought uh in changing to more inclusive uh language and and current modern languages so also an opportunity here uh to reframe uh this one uh to acknowledge the Partnerships that we have with other organizations whether educational institutions cbos that um that all together work on Workforce Development so the change I'm sorry again unions here including including unions thank you commissioner and trees um so this one we have completely Rewritten again to to reframe and kind of to a modern thinking of Workforce Development so change it to provide or support Workforce Development Services to promote economic mobility of the local Workforce remember economic Mobility is concept of helping folks move move through their careers getting again better uh higher paying wages you know uh that's a great question commissioner Willie I think it's an or and I think it's an or because we are not asking these companies directly to do the Workforce Development but to uh support participate be an active participant in the workforce system here in Washington or County I see where you're going there okay I agree but how our company is held accountable to show that not only they had entry-level jobs but that there was that mobility",

        "text": " all right so with that um I'd like to open the floor up for any questions um or items that any one of us on as members of the Coalition can help um either answer or consider as we move John if we have no comments we'll give it another moment but we do have a couple in the chat that may be worth great great um while people get their thoughts together maybe we can turn to those that are in the chat okay Tom Bartlett from Ashland said that they have a virtual net merging program that works like meter aggregation and Tom brabsky and expand more and then we can respond Tom solder that's great uh Ray Sanchez muscador are you still around oh okay we may need to take people off a mute and I'm not sure if I can do that uh someone just queued me in are they on mute I'm not sure who has control right at the moment we've been notified that they're not here anymore okay great well let's see um so we'll go on I see we are getting um some questions um in the chat as we're going through oh and it does look like Rey is here um so we will um work with you Ray to try to figure out how to get you unmuted but maybe we can take a different question in the can you hear me interim oh yes there you are great thank you thank you yeah um this was uh towards the uh the grant programs that I think Ryan was talking about with uh energy trusts and other organizations and I think one of the biggest challenges that we have we had when we started when we built our first community school project and now we're going to have again is we're trying to focus on building a 100 low-income Community solar project here in the Rogue Valley the challenge that we have is that all the grants that we apply for are going to be applying for pay after the fact and I can see that for small organizations like ours in small communities like ours this is a major problem because that means that you somehow have to come up with the one two three four million dollars that the Project's gonna cost to to build it and then the grand Tours are going to reimburse you but that doesn't quite work for a small organization like that so I was trying to understand if there is any way that monies could be provided to small projects up front to reduce those those financing hurdles that's a great question I'm going to see if perhaps um Evan would like to chime in if if you have any thoughts on this that's a really good point Ray I think that you're you're absolutely correct that that's kind of a barrier that that doesn't just apply its Community solar projects that's certainly going to be a barrier in the single family space as um we I think that asking a low-income household to make a payment and have reimbursed afterwards clearly won't work um likely will also apply to some of the contractors we're potentially working with so I think across the board um the timing of payments is going to be something has to be woven in and um definitely you you bring some first-hand experiences how that's going to be challenging specifically in the community solar case for Community scale I I would add to that Ryan that you know this could be an opportunity to build in uh some services or an approach with technical assistance to help raise projects or like projects access construction financing now I know that doesn't always help on like the development expense and that's a big barrier that we've seen But providing some uh you know direction or some framework where projects can access you know private sector lending to finance their projects and have that built into your assumptions and your pro forma I mean that's a possibility so you don't have to come out of pocket for that adds a little bit of cost to your overall project but a construction loan is less costly than a term loan that's 10 or 20 years long great thank you um I think that's a topic we'll we'll need to do more consideration on as as we move forward but thank you for raising that okay the next question we have I think is from Toby Toby are you still here well yeah oh okay thank you would solar EV charging placed in disadvantaged community parking lots stations be um that's a that's an interesting one um I the way that I am reading the opportunity announcement it seems like it's not focused on Transportation but is really focused on on households on um uh so I don't think that's an angle we have considered so far um that is certainly something we could take a close look at the opportunity announcement and and see if it would be permissible but um I would just add that well it's solar it's distributed in the parking lots of a disadvantaged community it's consistent to that goal we could structure the finance where a single entity takes care of all the finance and let the people just have it for free and because it doesn't touch a grid or any other utility really small footprint kind of very so we could place these in a very distributed fashion and you just uh maybe Target even level two charging which would be great for people who park for a while people who work or for shopping and that way it's it it doesn't save the world with DC fast charge but it does add really quite extensive value some like even five kilowatts puts quite a bit of range into a level two so those were the reasons why it kind of overlaps I realized it's for residential but with such a distributed parking lot type of approach you don't have to touch roofs or any other complicated Regulatory Affairs but yeah that is an interesting idea my my initial impression is that it most likely wouldn't because we wouldn't be able to demonstrate the minimum um Savings in quite the way that I think the EPA is is envisioning but um thank you thank you for raising that I think we'll definitely um at least take a second look well thank you okay the next one is from veto in regards how the program will handle getting savings to residents of a subsidized household can Oregon get a Statewide waiver from that is a fantastic question I think um if Rob is available I'd love to try to bounce this one over in his Direction that's a good question I'm not sure I fully understand it but in the way in which our programs currently work and the way that we're proposing the single family program the rebates go through a contractor and so they essentially are um upfront reductions in in Project costs and if we do this correctly in the low income space we'll have little or no um Financial involvement with the actual homeowner so I don't know if that starts to get at the question I see that Ryan and Evan are both on screen so if they have a more to add I would welcome their thoughts yeah Ryan if you have something sure yeah in the in the Oregon Community solar program space um we've got a clarification from HUD that the bill credits that customers receive do not count as income and so the utility allowance issues fortunately sidestepped with the Oregon Community solar program so um residents in affordable housing properties any Resident that pays their own utility bill can enroll just as a subscriber in the Oregon Community solar program and receive the benefits for residents that don't pay their own utility bill if the housing provider pays it on their behalf there's also a mechanism for the housing provider to receive the benefits and then pay the majority of those benefits um through a separate payment to the resident so there is kind of a pathway there specifically in the the Oregon Community solar contexts um but for for single for on-site installations would be could be a bit yeah and I would maybe invite Vito to to unmute as I he might be the expert in the room here on this topic but we struggled through solar on multi-family affordable housing for for a few years and it's been a while since I've looked at this topic and my assumption is that it boils down to who the funding entity is of that specific property and so a HUD subsidized property might be treated a little bit differently than if it's a low income housing tax credit property versus if it's a USDA Rural Development subsidized property um and I did get a similar takeaway from what Ryan just said that um if it is a kilowatt hour Bill credit on a utility bill um it is not income but if your rent plus utilities is calculated as part of your total cost of housing and your utilities go down um it could raise your rent in some instances so it's definitely a component to build into a program if we're addressing multi-family and veto if you have more clarification I'd please love to hear it you guys hit on all the issues I I think with Community solar it's easier we found in Illinois that we can effectively work with HUD to to not recognize Bill credits from Community solar as income so that they're not raising rents or reallocating so I think that there's a way to do it just sort of State wide HUD is love to do any kind of blanket statements or rules but they will work with States and programs so far for Community solar so it sounds like you've already had that established for the existing program which should be easy enough to extend to solar for all it does get more challenging though uh if you're if you're working with subsidized multi-family uh with distributor generation there was an example earlier you gave where you were able to do things like shift to a Master Meter and take away the bills which which is great I mean in other states utilities will fight tooth and nail not to let that happen so if you can pull that off I think that's you know that that's a practical way of doing it but you still have to look at the subsidized housing allocations and we're still battling that sort of issue in Illinois so I didn't know you guys had thought about it or you know have any solutions I I think we're going to lean on our year of planning to figure out some of these questions and then maybe as we Loop in Oregon Housing and Community um a little more they may have some uh good Insight you know I will just point out that um you know folks that are in affordable housing are are receiving a subsidy and a benefit already and there is a lot of um organs population that is not receiving that benefit so um you know there there can be an equity consideration to reaching further Beyond affordable housing with this program um but it will certainly be a component Vito while you have the mic do you want to speak to your community owned model as well um that you",

        "text": " feedback we get from the committee uh if staff gives us that and then once we issue the notice there'd be a public comment period for 20 days so I did send you a comment we received uh last night um about our proposal and specifically there was a concern that using the commenter group would not create a representative in particular they are concerned about including just public commenters that didn't necessarily have specialized um about uh fiscal impacts if the council wanted to have a more targeted group we could exclude some of the commenters the council could of course add other people I do want to note that in that comment the the the person who's new sun energy they said you know we need to have uh small businesses local governments uh energy developers environmental and maybe other groups included those groups and interests are pretty well represented by the commenters that we got and these are people that have already expressed interest in participating the one group that maybe were missing is local governments but um I don't think local one local governments just haven't been participating in this will making haven't raised any concerns about physical impacts to them um and don't we don't think they would really be affected by this Rule and a meaning meaningful or in a direct way at um we could invite Association of Oregon counties or someone else along if the council wanted us to uh and then if the council did want to limit the public participants we could we could extend this invitation to everybody except for the people that commented through that that online platform but I personally think that that those people were interested they represent local communities they have local knowledge and you know we have trouble getting members of the public to come to these kind of meetings so sending an invitation out to 70 people probably isn't going to result in 70 people coming to this meeting um and if they did the smartson good for them yeah I do not in favor of um because I'm almost like hey I let them played but now you can come play so yeah I think that's a terrible yeah um I would say that in it magically you'd end up a level you want to participate and then you know have some kind of discussion on what he could do or you could team things up but I am not in favor of now drawing yeah this is how I don't see the um well so Nissan industry is a a solar developer the organ solar and storage Industries Association is the industries Association representing the interest most likely to be affected by these rules to the solar is what we're seeing the most of renewable Northwest is a renewable advocacy group but their interests are often represent the renewable energy industry as well there are no Public Utilities yeah um public utilities will not have much to say about the small business impact statement but they could provide an impact on the fiscal impact statement more generally so we could include Idaho Power oh well there's an error on this side because Idaho powered by comments and this is just Larson my opinion when you start getting into the utilities this is their world and I would expect them to have they know the process they know how to be engaged I don't feel like we have to do extra work to engage them so I'm not concerned about that what I would say is maybe they're part of it it's like in my mind lives with Chambers of Commerce sight of people like those are that's a a kid they wouldn't follow on a rule but um that's where I'm going to go see on some of this places should be you're going to say small businesses then go to small businesses otherwise I think you're just so I'm more concerned about balance you know business these most of these folks are going to advocate for small business and yet our definition of small business doesn't really include science certificate applicants and so you know these aren't a certificate outputs generally that is for us and and we could invite if you if you would like us to invite applicants like the big ones like up in Greater nextera um there's a couple of others that I'm not thinking of right now um we could send this out to that pool as well um uh obsidian was specifically referenced as uh you know a small business that could potentially be affected although we don't agreement uh obsidian did not comment on this woman so yeah this is again this is Marcy for me this is their their wheelhouse this is what they do they did not participate and that's just strange to me that developers who we've obviously been engaged with them sitting in over the last several years that they would not have participated I don't I don't have a lot of I'm concerned about this because that's what they do for a living it's the the average the ranchers and the farmers and the people who don't sit down on a computer all day and track who's been put outside their job because developers that is their job and they know the definition of small business that's probably why they didn't participate yeah go ahead I guess that's my I'm a little bit confused by the conversation with respect to applicants being the parent company which is clearly not a small business commenting on the applicant who is in LLC that at least in some there aren't any even any employment employees that's what I'm a little bit confused what they would with the parent would add you know for an invitation you know if they were invited so the physical impact statement does have two components I mean one is just a general statement which we provided and we did estimate how we think these rules would affect certificate holders in that um the second part is like specific to small businesses and as you'll see in the amended notice we basically say if there was a small business a heavy there plus medical assistant setup by the impact would be the same small business and to me the Oregon solar and storage Industries in renewable Northwest I don't know who all the members are but they're enlightening to be those small business actions I would think this is Mercy I would say as individuals and the people who are affected to do the work they probably would mean yeah yeah and we can you know we invite OCS to participate um it has been you know their executive director of the staff that have been the most active but we could you know ask them to everyone kind of their members if they can yeah that I was going to say that it you know not necessarily that the invitation go out for the Oregon solar Association renewable Northwest for instance but they them and their members you know so for an individual if they want to participate in an individual companies but not sorry this is Marcy and I think we ought to not move sight of what the rulemaking is is a start that's where I think it goes off the grants you know we're talking about senior resources and Recreation standards rule making not because if I sit there and go otherwise then I say well I should be getting every left contractor and we're going to say because they are small businesses you know we could go we could make some big mess as we're trying to do the right things so I don't want to do that and if if I made one additional consideration is that this is who we're proposing to send the invites out to we'd also have to do public notice because it's a public meeting whether or not we wish to allow other people who show up at the meeting to participate is kind of that's more of a discretionary Choice I personally I mean I kind of feel like depends on on what what the the audience looks like being if there's you know if all 77 comments are going to show up you would likely knocking a lot of other people to participate but if we have a people five and two people who two two members of industry or other people show up that that were not on our specific invite list like there's nothing set up table and participating by um the important thing is that there's the committee and we ask them the question about this one box uh and consider their advice and this is Marcy and by the public notice being there that doesn't because it is it's just the meeting or they can still submit cops um on the fiscal impact statement that's included in the amended notice it would be more limited um often we do have a like public comment period at these kind of advisory committee meetings or people that a designated member of the committee can kind of say well this is my recommendation I guess that's what I'm asking is if there's still okay we want to not have every person from every enactment people could still comment on the specifics of what we're discussing Yeah by having the mirror back there's a public thanks that's awesome and I just want to be clear that there's an opportunity it may not be the desired opportunity because you're not sitting at the table or on Zoom but there's still looking for people to fun specific issue with you thank you chair yeah I think that's accurate and then I will just add that also if we once we issue the amended notice that is a full public comment period and there's no limitation on the comments that people expect during that yes and the quick question City condom um for the advisory committee do we do you set the size you know like work send out this invitation but it gets unwieldy after you know with more than seven people are right if you've set the signs typically yes um and what we would normally do for like a regular rules advisory committee yeah oh well I think what like a practice is anyways and this is what we're recommending for the amended enrollment amendment rulemaking that we're talking about later is that we would solicit interest have people give us you know tell us whether they want to participate uh and we'll you know give us some basic information about what interest they they why they're interested or what their qualifications are uh and then we would come back to you and say Here's the pool of people who express interest you know we want you to pick a representative group out of this pool um here's our recommendation you know do you have any changes in this case since we're on a I mean it's kind of a tight time frame um we don't really have I mean we could send out conceivably a request for interest today uh say you have to let us know by next Wednesday so we have enough time to get the notice out for the actual meeting uh and then you would have to authorize staff to make the decision on who gets included or not I must be uh you want us to come back at the November meeting and you know we obviously we can spread this out as long as you want if you want to be more involved and all",

        "text": " that's the Gap that they have to move onto doing the second phase so uh to participate in that project you would have to have an ownership stake which could either be in the land or in the units as there developed um this is land that we you know basically donated was a very nominal value amount that we sold it to them uh for so we would either be buying back the land for greater value than we donated to them for um so that we could meet that test and have ownership um or we would have to be a partner in the ownership of the units that are for how long the life of the bond is that so so these are these are kind of interesting uh so our broker when we sold the bonds structured the taxable um Series in an interesting way so they're actually paid off in 2026 so just here the next couple of years okay is how long we have to be within ownership they have to be built before no no we had yeah because in lik project I don't know I just it's a very slow developing sorry keep us from maintaining okay so um that's the first project that has been brought forward the second one that came up came out of a medium that I had last week with Richard Berger and they are looking at building 183 units out near Corbin I met with them as well okay so fully affordable and they have significant offsite improvements there's some um Road improvements to bring the roads up to Urban standards water line and sewer line extensions as well um and they're looking for $3 million to fill that Gap so couple of things to consider I one is approving either of these in absence of having a process and criteria so that's one consideration second consideration is for the neighborly Ventures project they're submitting an application to ohcs for the remainder of their funding in the very near term that's occurring by the end of July so they need to know what their perform is going to look like uh or have kind of a thumbs up on this to help them through that process they would be breaking ground next spring if they get this money and they feel that if we part were participants that would severely significantly strengthen their application to the state because if the city's a player project helps it does yeah yeah um so another consideration with all of this would be that if we were to construct affordable housing ourselves when we do it through the Housing Authority that ends up costing us around $400,000 a door $3 million into their project with 183 units comes out to a little over $16,000 a door so in terms of a return on our investment and getting units fast at a low cost for the public dollar that's a pretty good return on investment so I think D said that's around 12 units for the second phase of the cottage development so then you're looking at around $46,000 both of those are well below well well well below uh anything that we could do if we were to hold the money and do something through the Housing Authority so as a model um um whether or not we want to put structure and criteria and have a process around it as a model this is a pretty good model for getting the units uh and maximizing how many units we get for the public dollars compared to doing it ourselves but then you know just that piece that the the time piece is pretty essential for the neighborly Ventures project um if we develop criteria go through an app process it will be moving you know stretching this money out more over time so it's going to mean that units are coming online more slowly potentially jeopardizing the one project pardon me potentially jeopardizing the one project it could yes yeah yeah so so those are just all tradeoffs to be considered yeah thought I just have a question about the the uh unit way out by Corbin are there buses out there um that do that route and we would be supporting infrastructure roads that would those buses would be on the bus currently goes out to the to 4,000 Highway which is just up the street from there and I think that they would ultimately look at extending a little bit once there's a and there would be the Sheriff's Office jail they have okay I can understand that so that's just maybe we just right click right click and measure I know how wondering could we look it up because I don't know where that is could we pull that up on Google sure sorryville and Joseph Highway Jose is it okay that you're talking about this isn't this is this a judal or is it because it's a meeting light you're not talking I just want to be sure the wrong have the wrong yeah Green Light Is this different project the cottage is are the motion from from that Mouse it is this one is the one that I'm talking right no but there's we'll talk okay I don't know where it's at though I'm not sure be so um it's at um I can tell you it's actually here's Corbin University down yeah so it's it's right up in that goofy little where the onsville highway keep going to the north yeah right there and over to where mville meets deer park see that goofy little intersection in on no this side of south of it right there okay other Southeast I think it's that zoom in a little bit I believe it's that I've seen some rough plans on it six months ago yeah yeah it's that funky little shape and so if you zoom out a little bit um and go and just scroll up a little so you can see so there's the police academy and then the sheriff's office is the one the next one up right there the bus goes to right there okay no right here right there yeah yeah and then it goes all the way into downtown the bus depot the pound out there yeah that what we call it still yeah dog service and then there's the new route just up the street to goes to Amazon yeah I think the bus is the one that goes on Lancaster yeah and then connections and get off and get you go from bus 11 up to Center Street connect on bus five and goes downtown so I'm glad the Buss are there okay sorry we is there in the weed we in the weed is there any risk increased risk if we or what's the risk if we don't develop individual criteria and application process and I'm assuming what you're saying is that it's either that or it's we say here is there what's the trade-off there so I mean it certainly could come back to an equity and fairness um consideration where we are approving these you know upfront so then let's say next spring somebody else comes in and they've got a request for $1 to4 million and then do we approve it or we don't approve it we don't have criteria for that and then we run out of money you know when we hit that 10 million um so then you know there's always the risk of well it's not it wasn't transparent advertised open competitive anything along those lines so again those are are tradeoffs that's definitely a risk but then if the goal is to get housing produced as quickly as possible then there's also a risk of losing housing project so it's we're under a state mandate and it's that council's number one priority is to produce housing and reduce homelessness so it's there it's a sticky wi I just want to be clear like what perception public you know that kind of that's the downside they appear we want don't want to appear unfair like if a developer comes in after we approve this and said well wait wait a minute I didn't know about this I didn't know I could apply I was going to do 300 minutes right well I want to say this is a sticky Wicked for me because this is a very poor location accessibility wise it may have at some point in the future Transit but you're at the very end of the line and as far as I know this neighborhood ain't really much you can walk to and there's not likely to be much you can walk to in the future so in terms of where we want to put housing to further our climate objectives and provide affordable housing that people don't have to have cars to uh you know make access to this is strikes me as the kind of location that would rate very low where is the urban uh not too far from there this is actually in the Cascade School District it's not in the Salem Kaiser School District it's the it's the one little section of town that's not s Kaiser um Christian can you explain a little bit about how why neighborly has now converted to wanting to build all affordable housing versus doing a combination of a percentage I can tell you what he told me go ahead he he doesn't pencil multif family does not currently penciled unless there's government involvement and there's not enough government with with um mixed income levels so they're going to 100% affordable to be able to build housing otherwise they can't build it and will they be constructed somewhat differently then to be able to have it pencil out I'm just trying to understand their initial intent was to be a mirror of the jurry apartments yes I that's what I understood and I don't we didn't get into that much detail about that I don't know if he did with you but I I it's not going to be a duplicate of jwelry I don't know is not NE necessarily working as well as one would have but it's still going to be sort of a walk up Garden style yes okay rather than what we have down maybe square footage is different maybe the amenities are different to keep affordability we didn't talk about that we didn't talk about that um there'll still have to be all of our standards for design yeah but in terms of like is there going to be a swimming pool that kind of thing but we don't have different design there's not any requirements of if they have all affordability that there's any wraparound services or any Social Services combined with this is simply affordable housing reduced rent this I think would be more like Cornerstone uh they would be um partnering with community resource trust to do the management and CRT tends to have I'd say light services not like um permanent Supportive Housing level of services it is going to be and they're the ones who built Cornerstone and they are modeling it you're right they're modeling it after so then again how close are they to services and if they need it to go I'm just again we're just I'm just trying to figure out a location this to that point and to Bob's Point you're right it's not",

chair it looks like you are okay okay we have a few folks um signed up for Testimony here I would like me to do this Lindsay would you like me to just call them up one more time or Jay would you like to introduce this case for us I'll go ahead and introduce it okay great uh good morning Commissioners like I said my name is Jared Bradford um with the Marion County Planning division uh the item before you today is an application for a comprehensive plan and zone change to change the comprehensive plan designation on a 0.69 acre parcel from rural residential to community commercial and to change the Zone from acreage residential to community commercial located at 8792 Portland Road Northeast in Salem in the unincorporated community of Brooks hot mirror the applicant is proposing to develop the subject parcel with an administrative office and to be used as storage for his business the subject property is located uh 745 feet south of the intersection of Portland Road Northeast and Brook Lake Road Northeast currently the property contains a dwelling and three accessory structures properties surrounding the parcels are zoned residential and Community commercial the surrounding uses consist mostly of residential and Commercial the planning division requested comments from various governmental agencies these comments are located in the staff memo and file for reference as well as the hearings officer's decision this decision is based on the criteria in the Brooks Hotmail community plan the policies in the rural development element of the Marion County comprehensive plan the state of Oregon Statewide planning goals and the zoning criteria found in Marion County code mcc-1713050 and then being met the Marion County hearings officer approved the application on January 30th 2023 considering staff's recommendation to approve the proposed comprehensive plan zone change based on the criteria outlined in the Brooks hotmere community plan the policies in the rural development element of the Marion County comprehensive plan the state of Oregon Statewide planning goals and the zoning criteria found in mcc-17123.060 MCC 176.010 and mcc-17143050 additionally all findings that this decision is based on can be found in the staff memorandum and the hearings officer decision and I will be happy to answer any questions the Commissioners may have any questions before we hear from the applicant for me I don't have any pictures okay great uh then Nick you are up first please introduce yourself for the record thank you hello Commissioners my name is Nick rhoten I'm the attorney for the applicant Rafael Mercado along with Chris Matheny and Matheny law as Jared and staff said this is an application for a comprehensive plan and zone change we believe that as a matter of law you know we said an evidentiary record at the both with submission of our application documents attached to the application is along with testimony at before the hearings officer we believe this record meets all the applicable criteria to accomplish the comprehensive plan and zone change we believe the commission should adopt the hearing officer's findings and make the changes along with conditions a through e and as a practical matter this would be a small scale commercial use that fits in nicely with kind of the existing uses and development in the surrounding area so I'm available for any questions you might have and the applicant is also here for any questions that you might have um to supplement the record that was established before the hearings officer and with our application so thank you if you have any questions for Nick he answered Mr chair thank you I think he answered your your clients okay with the conditions a through e and items one and two on the hearings officer's recommendation so my understanding is that conditions A and E were recommended by the hearings officer but then one and two were not recommended as conditions those are something that was proposed by public works but they're not necessarily needed for the legal criteria to make a zone change comprehensive plan change that's something that if a conditional use permit is necessary based on the use of the property that can be addressed at that time but as far as the making the zone and comprehensive plan change they're not necessary kind of based on the legal analysis so I'd ask that those not be a part of the zone change and the hearings officer agreed with that so I'd also ask for you to not include one and again so eighth conditions a through e yes Mr chair uh so in our file signed by the hearings officer it does have one and two still in it so if I may commissioner as I as I interpret I'm looking specifically at uh age um as I interpret the uh hearings officer's recommendation she is recommending uh a through e be imposed as conditions of approval and if I understand this correctly one and two were proposed conditions that Public Works had proposed but she recommended not imposing one and two as conditions of approval so as I read this advisory in in nature to the applicant that those are there but the recommendation from the hearings officer is that only a through e be imposed as conditions of approval Mr chair if I may so it states in the middle of page 16 it says proposed conditions of approval f and g are not recommended and I assume f and g translates to one and two on page 16. it doesn't say that clearly but I appreciate that you asked that question because I just spent this time with legal counsel and planning to dive into this so commissioner thank you Mr chair I think that needs to be clarified yeah because as I read this as I read the file it basically says prior to issuing the building permits um I don't know what f and g are I see one and two that I don't see f and g so it needs to be clarified either in our motion or someplace that we're not asking the client to do one and two or are we I would like to hear from staff on this specifically and if I may um if perhaps this is helpful perhaps not but if you look at the staff memorandum on page 11 that's where f and g derived from originally because that's what we were referencing at the um the hearing in January so but if to the extent there's ambiguity in the hearings officers recommendations yeah we would want language clarifying that those are not conditions of approval imposed upon the applicant Mr chair can we have staff come back up yeah uh anything else for Nick um but I'll be eating stay there okay we're kind of reversed from where we normally are but Nick you can stay there no you just stay in that seat Lindsay come on morning Commissioners for the record Lindsay King so Mr chair for me so Lindsay I just want to clarify as I read page 16. uh uh Mr Rogan referred to page 11. I don't see that on the hearings officers uh deal are we good is our one and two actually referred to as f and g that's my understanding in the staff um which I unfortunately don't have in front of me um it would be in the file under staff report or staff decision or recommendation maybe um and so and that hearings officer has recommended that the board not include f and g in their decision of approval for their those conditions so you would it would read something as the board would adopt the conditions set for recommended by the hearings officer one and two all right okay that's how that's how the motion will be then right okay so why do you think she included one and two in in her decision I believe I'm happy to share why it's more comfortable for staff so the rural area transportation plan has specific requirements in it and our engineering team in ldap which this is my interpretation of how they process they basically put the whole enchilada in up front and then after that after this process is approved and they go into applications and and moving forward they do some negotiations with the um I understand that that's their process I'm not comfortable with that and I appreciate the commissioner Cameron brought this forward because I um we as a as a government entity have a difficult time meeting the rfpsp rural Transportation plan study whatever it is um on the cost basis into overtly push that over onto an individual business owner seems a little um too much it seems a lot too much and it and while I'm happy to compromise in a relationship I don't know how you get to a compromise here that makes it successful for a business owner to operate what they're asking to operate in this environment so yep okay great that was I think you got you got what you needed right commissioner yeah I'll clear it we can clarify the motion that we're going to make the motion that with conditions minus items one and two with conditions a through e excluding items one and",

agenda item which is the Oregon Trail solar facility with the final order on request for Amendment one of the site certificate this is an action item and we have senior signing analyst Kathleen Sloan ready to present yes sir just really quickly before um Kate begins so normally you know if we have an in-person meeting or a big agenda item we would be in person Kate was intending to be here today in person she woke up with ice all over her driveway and unable to safely leave her house so I just wanted to clarify that's why she's participated remotely today rather than in person thank you and I do know that uh staff has been great about that that seems to be that the directive that is possible so thank you we do not need anyone having an accident to to join us so um Kate um I just would remind you please that we have uh several council members uh remotely so it periodically you can just identify what slides you're on to help them find it they're not going to be looking at the stream they'll be looking at the slides on themselves so if you could do that that would be awesome okay thank you chair Grail and members of council and I do apologize for not being there in person today last night and this morning we've had like five different kinds of weather so I appreciate being able to uh participate and present to you remotely so with no further Ado I will launch into until the item D which again is council's review and possible decision on requests for a moment one of the Oregon Trail solar facility just real quickly a presentation overview I'm going to do a little bit of a refresher on the facility itself and the site certificate history the request for the amendment and proposed changes Council reviewed this in January at the meeting in common we received comments on the draft proposed order um of the public hearing and also with problem Council so we'll go through that real briefly and then I'm going to review the proposed order and our staff recommendation to approve as the final and then at the end Council will have its opportunity to deliberate and possibly make a decision to learn is of operational facility it is approved for a combined 41 megawatts of federating power combination of wind and but it's not yet constructed and it also has a shared battery storage with the neighboring mind type solar the Oregon Trail solar facility site certificate originated out of the amendment number five the Montag Wind Facility site certificate which split that Montag win into three separate site certificates and that happened in 2020 so today our RFA and our proposed order are specific to the Oregon Trail solar facility so this map just shows the site boundary and the approved micro siding Corridor for the facility on the micro Simon Corridor attorney has two what was the approved win component that fits inside the Oregon Trail solar boundary and the other piece was this 1220 Acres that was approved with the creation of the site certificate for Oregon Trail solar it's important to note that the certificate holder committed that the footprint for the solar should not exceed 400 Acres within that 1228 Acres already approved for silver and this flight is just a real quick procedural history on the RFA it's filed originally in August of 2022 we issued a DPO kind of DPO Hearing in January 2023 how the in-person hearing economy reviewed the DPO with Council put those comments into consideration issued a proposed order and a notice of contestant case on January 25th and on February 24th that opportunity to request a contested Case Closed there were no requests for a contested please and so we're here today to review the proposed order and a possible final decision from Council so just really briefly um the request for Amendment one that the certificate holder requested was to amend the condition 24 Health static instruction commencement deadline from August 30th 2022 bumped that out three years to August 30th 2025 and also to make a revision to existing condition 50s and Part B which was to modify the cultural resources monitoring requirements and this is a Refreshers Council scope of review for a Time extension request is basically considered a general reopener so the department and its CPA and its proposed order consider any changes in fact or law since the last flight certificate was and that was the scope of our review was a department when we prepared the DPO by the proposed order so this slide just shows the right boundary area that was approved by the department for the RFA one because Oregon Trail solar house during and supporting facilities that it shares with Montague and Montauk solar and Department approved the certificates holder request to exclude the transmission line from the RFA one uh analysis area so the site boundary excluding the shared transmission line and other shared and related facilities such as the battery storage which is located on one side solar not included in the rfa1 analysis area so the department commenters that commented on the DPL and that included members of the public the landowner on which the facility was provided members of Representative of trade unions Salem County the certificate holder and comments from council members during the hearing and also during council's review and those are summarized and compiled in attachment B2 of the proposed order basically to set the stage of what we're going to discuss in the revision and additional findings of back to amended conditions that were issued in the proposed order so for this slide these are the standards that we asset time councils of the GPO and also the Departments uh preparation of the DPO of the proposed order there were no amended conditions there were no um substantial findings of fact identified in the draft proposed order or the proposed order so this is the review that was consistent with no changes hey Kate yes you seem to be fading in and fading out a little bit I don't know if it's just the you know proximity to the computer but just to let you know that you're kind of you know again fading in and fading out okay I think it might be the technology because I haven't moved good to know I'll try to at least project a little louder okay thank you okay thanks for the record um Kathleen um uh it says the standards uh where there were no new impacts or new news of Sandy emitted conditions or a record were recommended or made for the draft proposed order now on the historical culture of archaeological resources there were phase one archeology done what about phase two if the general public is allowed to this area and even the private owners um those indicators on the surface could be removed in the forms of artifacts or uh clusters of of flakes or bone or shell or any of that um was there phase two archeology done on this I do not believe that the for the cultural resource monitoring was based upon archeology it was based upon the confederated tribes of umatilla's identification of potential historic properties of religious and cultural and so the monitoring condition was developed with them in the original site and then based upon the work that was done on Minecraft Solar and the monitoring works that Umatilla did there the certificate holder worked with confederate tribes at Umatilla to come up with this proposed recommended things and it allows more flexibility for the tribe and the certificate holder to determine how much and where they're going to monitor so in that regard it um I think outside that specific question because there were no phase to fight to be identified this was identification of hypocrisy answers your question okay thank you okay slide is a little different than the previous slide so the previous slide I'm going to go back these are the conditions where we did not identify any any substantial findings a fact or make any new recommended or amended conditions this slide here there were conditions and additional review and findings of fact in the draft proposed order which included that recommended language for condition 50. but there were no changes in the proposed order based upon the comments received and we have received a written letter of support for these changes from from Confederate Transit Umatilla but there's no further questions I'm going to launch into where we would make changes from the draft proposed order to the proposed order so this based upon council's review of the draft proposed order and the comments received the department put all that information into consideration made additional findings of facts to support changes to breathe recommended conditions from the Bradford post-order version to the proposed order those fall under the land use standard Wildfire information with mitigation in a public health and safety of Wind Facility standard and I've listed the specific conditions here of note is condition 120 is actually a new recommended condition and I'm going to further discuss those additional findings of that on the final recommended language for these conditions in the following slides additional findings of God were based you know I'm counting comments received on the record of the DPO at the public hearing and council's review of the DPO at the same meeting from the following day as a result of those comments we have made the following additional findings of that and it's really tied to the local economic benefit and the goal three exception um the condition will require and to meet this the standard requires a random typically holder in the county for what has been called the community and that Moa is to be drafted and as committed to between the certificate holder and the port of Arlington in Dillon County Soil and Water Conservation District for a specific and the county um has approved these that these moas will resolve the county concerns that were on the record of the DPO so as a result of those new findings of this is the final language that the department recommends for that new language condition um condition 120. and where the where the significant if where that change was incorporated into this final condition language within that subpart the to specify who the recipient of the community donation fund would be so on top here ncf Council has any questions or comments on this part or I'm

        "text": " still have questions about future funding of these projects and also prioritization of the Nexus projects so at this point we're moving forward with the idea of just putting anything we expect to meet the definition and put it all on a big list and our projects of course will be in addition to Clackamas County Multnomah County Portland um the port so everybody and and the cities also so it's everybody's projects are going to be in this big list we still have questions about what the next steps are but ODOT is going to be working on an implementation plan that the governor's office has asked for uh that is due in December and so we will stay engaged in this process so that we can make sure that the implementation plan includes some next steps for what are we doing with this Nexus project list how it will how will it be prioritized what are some future funding and just a reminder that mayor bubenik and commissioner fi are members of our Tech the regional toll advisory committee mayor bubik is not here today of course but commissioner fi is and so if you have questions about that process I'm sure she's happy to answer them next slide please as I said at the beginning the timeline for this is very fast this is the a slide that we have gotten from ODOT so this process was initiated at the June 26th r-tech meeting the July Art Attack meeting was canceled but we at the staff level we have been in in pretty constant communication with Oda about this process so the Nexus projects call for projects opened on July 31st and it closes actually on September 5th because of September 4th was Labor Day so they have extended to September 5th they have also proposed that our tech only meets every other month now going forward so the October our tech meeting shown on this slide will now be in November and the next r-tech meeting will be in September next slide so now I'll go through the definition of nexus projects and the selection Nexus projects are pedestrian bicycle roadway or other Mobility projects that would complement a tolling system on I-5 and I-205 and the Portland metro area by supporting congestion relief on a corridor that may become more congested with implementation of tolling this was actually a big win for us because the Oregon Highway plan Definition of corridor is one mile from the facility from the tool facility so there's a lot of discussion about this at the staff level and so this has been broadened to be any quarter that may become more congested with implementation of tolling or improves access to public transportation or improved Mobility options on a 12 highway traffic diversion Corridor and so that is again is that one mile and it provides access to opportunity or addresses Transportation related disparities and barriers experienced by Toll projects Equity framework a map of that coming up next slide so just a quick run through of the selection criteria there's uh the congestion pricing Nexus bucket and within that project location that has a safety Focus or improved safety provides additional network connectivity supports congestion relief provides access to transit or complements a public transportation strategy project as a whole nother list that Oda had been working with a different group of staffed and Transit providers to identify public transportation strategy projects that would be needed to support next slide there is an equity bucket that includes a project location that it serves Equity framework communities Equitable engagement has been done or can be done it reduces travel times or add modal options it provides access to job centers and it provides opportunities for reduced greenhouse gas emissions or multimodal next slide and last bucket is Project Readiness and so that's where they want to know is the plan included in a regional transportation plan or a local plan when will the project be ready for implementation and does it have local next slide so to kick off the discussion we pulled together a draft tooling Nexus project composed largely of projects that were proposed for the regional transportation this was reviewed by the wccc attack on August 3rd and the discussion there showed some concern about potential mitigation projects and I think we just heard this from mayor Beatty and can expand on it that these are communities that are adjacent to the freeways and the solution is not always just widening local roads so there was a lot of concern about we don't want to have to widen a three-lane arterial to a five Lane arterial for example so the projects we propose might be more like a complete streets project to add bike lanes and sidewalks it could be signal improvements things like that there is an opportunity to add projects in the future after modeling data is we have asked ODOT to make sure that this is an iterative process so questions for consideration today are there projects that should be added are there projects that should be removed do you have any other feedback or suggestions that we can take back especially at the staff level as we work with your city staff to refine these project lists here's a map showing the equity framework communities they are shown in pink this is based on Metro's Equity framework communities work um so again back harkening back to the definition it has to support Equity framework communities or access to jobs things like that so I think it's a pretty broad definition that we can make I mean people travel to jobs all throughout the area and so having available routes to do so is important next slide and then just a quick run through this is this is a map showing all the proposed Nexus projects that we pulled out of RTP proposed projects um next slide and then a closer look at the ones in the South part of the county so many of these are parallel routes such as a Boones Ferry 72nd Avenue Highway 99 and also includes some trail projects and Transit so it's it's got quite a lot of projects in here and then next this shows ones in the north part of the county that we think might be impacted with congestion diversion next slide so next steps in this process again the call for projects ends on September 5th um the next rtac meeting on September they are expected to discuss the submitted project list and then in November they're expected to refine the Nexus and the public transportation strategy project lists however at the staff level we're we're asking ODOT to just include the large project list we we don't really see a way to refine that in the absence of modeling data so that will be certainly under discussion over the next few and I think that's all I have for you thank you uh let's go ahead let's see um mayor rosner's hand up and just as a reminder because this is such a big topic obviously anyone can contact Jessica uh with follow-up questions after the meeting and County staff will continue to coordinate about the Nexus project list uh with that I'll hand it over to Mayor Rosner awesome thank you um great presentation appreciate all the hard work um I do have a question on the map of uh potential congestion diversion areas that may be impacted that you showed for South Washington County I noticed uh you didn't have 99 heading down towards Newburgh is highlighted and I guess my question is how are you doing that modeling because our anecdotal belief is that if you put um tolling on I-5 that people are going to cut over do newborn Newberg and come up at 99 and avoid those tools all together especially if they're going to the work centers over in Hillsboro so so I guess you know how did you get to that conclusion how do we get potential major quarters added to that that uh such a great question and I think just just the simple answer is that we just included the portion um in Washington County I think I have to look at the map again do you want me help me pull that together we can certainly include it to the Washington County boundary what is interesting and I hadn't really thought of this before um Yamaha County at Marion County are not involved in this discussion as far as I know at the rtac table or just the Nexus projects but I agree with you what the I-205 toll project NEPA analysis showed was a huge increase of traffic through Canby on Highway 99e as people were cutting across it or Aurora and going up to Oregon City so that is certainly a question I can take back mayor Rosner to the ODOT team we're meeting right now with them I would really appreciate that and you know if Yamhill County doesn't want to get involved it doesn't change the impact it has you know on on areas of South County South Washington County you know not just sure but the King City tiger you know et cetera so um yeah I'd love to hear how do we get that added to the map and um it might be worthwhile for some of us on the edge of the county here to Advocate with Yamhill County to get involved because I think it's going to impact them as well yeah I will definitely pass that on DOTA and ask the question thank you thank you uh I'd Echo I'm sure Heidi also Echoes uh I would assume uh mayor bobneck and Tualatin also is going to Echo those same concerns so um Tim thanks for raising that uh Steve you're hands up thank you chair um great materials Jessica great um and as I'm looking at rmpp options 2A um you know where it has the different um and I'm just looking at a printout on in a notebook here and it says like Zone one has three gantries is that three separate tolling locations within that zone so that there could be conceivably you know 10 to 12 tolling sites along the road or is that three gantries to cover three lanes of trap one for each lane of traffic does that make sense it does make sense and what I think is that it's a Gantry at each place that someone would enter the freeway within that zone so if there was three on-ramps say to the freeway that that's where they'd get the charge okay so you wouldn't necessarily be charged each of those zones because once you're on the freeway then you're just on it and you're not going to be charged again as you go through each Zone unless you leave and get back on at another on-ramp I think you'll be charged once per Zone but not three times if there's three gantries per Zone if that makes sense yes so then if I'm driving up I-5 looking again at 2A I would",

be mechanism to help us um Implement uh some of the very ambitious climate and clean energy policies that we have um instituted over the last few years we've been very busy in um creating policy and I think we need to get really busy in implementing policy now and um particularly thinking about HP 2021 or 100% clean energy law which um requires a lot of um different moving pieces and process policy processes um and I'm hopeful that the energy strategy will help us kind of start to um aggregate some of the things that we need for a clean energy transition in thanks welcome glad to have you with us next up Juan barasa good morning everybody my name is Juan barasa I'm the executive director of Latino Founders we a nonprofit supporting uh Latino Le Ventures to scale in the state of boring on

our work usually uh most of our works with rural customers and so we work throughout Oregon we've had contracts with bondable power energy trust uh of Oregon to help deliver some of their Energy Efficiency and renewable energy programs we also um had re have received um funding through rural development to be a technical assistance for uh programs uh such as the reap program Statewide so most of our work is with rural small businesses and agriculture producers uh we've done a lot of work with the irrigators the farmers throughout the state um um we've also got some programs earms testing out electric tractors electric vehicles and rural areas we've done some work with trying to help um figure out where to put EV charging in some of our rural counties creating some guide books there and um so my my interest is the rural areas uh resiliency and Agriculture and I was going to say addition to that I'm the chair of the school board and so we've done a number of energy projects at the

plants um and and wetlands um also just with respect to Wetlands you know like um the what the required area to be delineated is the area in those micro sighting areas but and there's you know a list of uh conditions because this project does require a removal fill permit which is under council's jurisic ition and you know um we can impact Wetlands that's like you know they Idaho Power is trying to avoid them and it's fairly easy to with like Tower pads and whatnot it's mostly construction activities that might impact them however they have this whole um you know offsite mitigation site it's all very articulated and worked with with DSL um so that's just um Wetlands aren't a complete avoidance the preference is always to avoid them so um but yeah the the intent is to coordinate with land owners to avoid minimize uh and minimize impacts to resources on their so so we'll we'll see we yeah okay we'll look into it um and again this this is not this is us talking about it so even though this says this here I we very May well may not end up changing that condition okay another one of Susan Gear's um issues is I'm not going to pronounce the scientific name but this is the Ruff golden weed um she contends that uh it's known to occur Morgan Lake Park and that it's on its way to the the Oregon biological information center or orbic um and that's kind of the repos itory where one would go to find uh the location and list of um of threatened endangered plant species so um and then this is one of those we're still working with Oregon Department of Agriculture because there's a process right by the by which something gets kind of uh on on the list for t&amp; um so miss gear is actually the one who submitted the reports to the Oregon Department of Agriculture about the you know Loc existence of the rough golden weed in Morgan Lake Park Oregon Department of Agriculture you know initially there's like the seems It's doesn't you know doesn't seem likely um but they're going to look into it more and the only known occurrence of the species is in WWA County and one of the things that we look at under t&amp; if there's not you know we talk about suitable habitat for the species and then whether or not there the species is actually there and then I believe the certificate holder and their responses to this comment are um you know that you even if it was our existing conditions would would would capture and cover any potential impacts to those species um but I think right now we're just in a position that it's not we don't have any there's no facts that say that it indeed it is um or that you know and it would have to be reviewed on whether or not the report she submitted it is that actual species located in Morgan Lake okay um this is a teeny teeny teeny uh little picture here um I'm going to go to where am I going to go um what is called addition eight where's the coding for that okay oh all right so um we kind of air quote opened up retirement for RFA 2 because we added on the midline capacitor station and it was just different um which actually was a really good opportunity because you know the last retirement mostly this is just like administratively we've kind of have a have not changed we've been doing it pretty consistently but we have a kind of like our our spreadsheet like C C Council looks at retirement how we break things down by component how we like you know like the units that we like to see it helps us process to make sure we're capturing everything in our retirement cost estimate so having the midline capacitor being added it gave us the opportunity to kind of update that format but also get updated unit costs make sure check the box make sure we got all everything there per facility component that we would be retired and then add in that midline capacitor so we're going from right underneath the scope of council's review it's whether or not the amount um uh of the bond or letter credit is sufficient we went from you know 140 million to70 million um most of that is just by updating those unit costs right it's F functionally that's kind of like adjusting which already would have been done prior to construction with the previous unit costs and and then there was some minor in increase in uh adding on that midline capacitor so that was the total and now we're kind of going back in time again very litigated issue um because it was a unique proposal and what uh a proposal in the application what council finally landed on in its uh final decision is is unique to this facility because it's a transmission line which is a utility facility necessary for public service which is also regulated by the Oregon Public Utility Commission um as opposed to other facilities that Council reviews like solar facilities and wind facilities those are private developers they're not a public utility um they are you know they have other laws and regulated in different ways but utilities like transmission lines are you know heavily regulated entities by lots of other entities so that that is kind of one of the one of the tear that supported council's approval of you know it's basically the the the $1 Bond right so I'm gonna go back to my slide here um Mr chairman yeah councelor deblin uh just a quick question and I think um the speaker has alluded to it um there is an issue with transmission lines probably outside of our purview which is uh maintaining those transmission lines um it has obviously has been a significant public issue over the last few years and not particularly for idah whole power uh don't know of any issues there that are that significant but that would be an item that's regulated by the P correct they would have authority which what type of Maintenance or like what example are you are you one one of the issues on power lines like in the not the PGE but the pg&amp; system is that perhaps some lines were not as well maintained as they should have be should have been um both in terms of the condition of the lines conditions of the towers and also in terms of um keeping the lines away from uh possible fuel supplies absolutely no yeah and you're you're you're correct uh council member delin and and you that kind of um woven into like stop B2 H's comments and and Irene Gilbert's comments with respect to the bonding kind of the premise totally paraphrasing here is that you know like this propos right this what you approved is risky or you need to change this it's risky because for example look over here at Pacific core and you know like their fi their you know the cost of their litigation and settlements from those fires is putting them into a financially position and the same could happen over here again totally paraphrasing so there what I'm saying though is that the the organ pu has ability",

        "text": "hi there hi good to see you see too we are live streaming and John can you hear us I can good morning good morning welcome all right I'll call this uh meeting of the climate action plan committee for the city of Sal for Monday 8 I'll call me the private action plan committee for Monday July 8 2024 uh president are Barney and staff be identified so do we have any public comment great we have a couple of folks come on up so we make sure you is Sol and thank you mayor I'm Bob court right from West Salem I'm here today uh speaking on behalf of Salem uh and myself um for those of you who don't know me um I start my career as the lead staff at the department of land conservation and development working on Transportation Planning and planning for um main point I want to make to you today is that you're going consider a couple of items dealing with Transportation Planning and the scenario planning B and it's to urge you to do more and sooner as part of both of those efforts uh last 10 to 20 years of science policy and planning how us what we need to do to reduce greenhous gas emissions in the transportation sector we need to reduce the Mt vehicle miles travel uh the amount of driving we do like between 20 and 30% we also know how to reduce I the things that the city and any City in Metropolitan are can do and that's to plan for walkable mixed use development and to make walking and biking and Transit uh safer and more convenient more easily available um so that we double or triple the number of trips that are made by those mons however despite this knowledge in the last 10 years of effort we've made almost no progress in reducing BMT and increasing the share of C in addition our adopted PL for example our regional plans anticipate that will make little or no progress in reducing B over the next 20 years what that should tell us is we've got a pretty big fit to make in terms of reaching the goals that we have reducing greenhouse gas emissions so couple of things to think about as you're thinking about the tsp update andario plan is that they need to include the scale changes to existing plans that achieve our VMT reduction objectives we're concerned about scenario planning because frankly it's too high level what it's going to tell you is that yes you need to increase Transit and bu comped and make changes to land use and if you do those things you will reduce emissions but we really need to get in specifics of where do we provide for more compact development how do we accomplish those increases in transportation so the specific recommendations for you are that um scenario planning and the PSP should a clear proposal for accommodating most most new housing and jobs in climate friendly areas and along Core Transit Network things you the tsp update should focus on and prioritize pedestrian life and Transit improvements um so that we get a saf more system especially in those clate areas third thing we ought to do is defer roadway expansion projects our tsps include boatloads more than we will ever have money for roadway expansion projects that move us in the wrong direction and reduces dfp we really need to put those on hold until we have a clear and effective strategy for reducing and finally you should include BMT reduction as one of those lenses as your climate uh lands to inform and guide policy decisions as thank you questions W and I'm a co-coordinator of P St in Oregon and I don't think we have to tell you you know we're having a climate crisis it is a 10:05 and temperature is 85 degrees going over 100 today you breaking Daily records day by day but um I want to um just endorse with Bob B said that in order to reduce people travel greenhouse gas emissions that are changing the climate we have to pay a lot of attention to the way our cities are built I want to thank un our Salem for all the work done on on you know zoning and encouraging you know mixed use you know neighborhoods and this kind of things and keep it up you know we still have more to do um and I have other um things in terms of that like I just walked here but okay I will take the bus going back I have an aand run and it's getting hard like a minute so I don't want to do that walk even I could um on the way out of here but for me um personally and also as a person very aware of climate you know um to get people to stop you know to use their car as the last word to stop all together needs to be a lot of attention to safety and like Bob mentioned I want to expand on that a little bit um and you know for for bikes and pedestrians and for people in wheelchairs are different kinds of issues that account for safety but walking you know there sidewalks that you know are well maintained you don't trip over on um the bikes you know you need sort of protection from the Autos you need to reduce speeds you know everybody and a big deal of the people are FL is in intersection because that's where you face game from Cars thank Virginia because she proposed um a program and they just instituted the the start of it today or on a certain part of downtown which I just walked through where the walk light goes on a few seconds before the green light car so people walking have a chance to get into the intersection be visible and you know that the cars will notice hopefully for you um that's a good thing I want to thank Jim was public work you know for public work getting it to happen quickly and it started to happen today because I just you know I just walked through that some of those intersections um on Church Street so um I guess that's just what I want to say that we need to prioritize safety for bike pedestrians in wheelchair in other way that they get around that are not in colge because that will make it make people feel more comfortable you know driving life thank thank you all right I take everybody on line or do Lucy did you have public comment that you want to say okay all right uh we has everybody chance to look at the meeting from second say the opposed okay very okay we're going to turn it over to T1 and tl9 hope you don't ask me what tl1 and tl9 are we know good okay so um we have a brief presentation and then um you know we be have take questions so today's focus is really on the scenario planning process that um Bob referenced um we are referring to this as phase one of our transportation system Plan update because it is a requirement that we have to do by state rules um that will inform what we have to include in our transportation system plan itself so give a little bit of background on it and then um talk about what we've heard so far in community engagement and some questions and so I guess I Advance rather than make you guess at what I'm thinking so we've already really talked about you know why are we doing this this came out of the climate friendly and Equitable communities rules from the state that were adopted in um late 2022 about the same time as the r salum project focuses on the reducing the greenhouse gas emissions Transportation but also equity and housing um choices and it's our phase one of our update to the tsp this is a regional process so it's not just Salem it is Salem Kaiser and Maran County working together to uh identify more sustainable Transportation um options and make sure people have a choice in how they get around I know it's come up before but I'll mention quickly that P County the reason they're not directly part of this is because the their population Within our urban area is very small and outside the city inside the ugb thank you yeah outside the city inside the ugb is small and therefore they are not required to do it and they requested an exemption because really who would want to do extra um extra work but we are coordinating with them through our scats process and of course they will be you know we'll be closely coordinating with them as we up at our tsp because they have an interest in what happens inside the city limits as well as outside there we go um so we have state goals to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions that are essentially translated into that reduced vehicle miles traveled and there are specific targets for different metropolitan areas you've heard us mention before that the target reduction is 30% from um but it's not just 30% right you see that there's a graduated uh reduction goals Targets in there and this is from a 2005 base and that's based on the state rules so it's a a little bit wonky um you know as part of our process they have to go back and estimate what 20 five was in order to estimate what we are today in order to estimate where weing in the future Qui question yes have we increased since 2005 my guess does that make sense we had our base and then I'm guessing we're here now and we have to get not only back to the base but below the remember the other thing is happened since 2005 is the method for evaluating trans well every every method is a little different so we have to be careful that we don't compare what comes out of this directly with what came out of our own ghg inventory because the methodologies are different so as long as you're using a consistent methodology then you can compare the results so that's what we are working on with ODOT is funding this study and they have a consultant team that uses this model and Nationwide and so it's a pretty well vetted model but you can't compare it to our other models and so that's the note about it being different from our the Target also being different from our own goal you know we can definitely exceed this 30% but moment I think it's just just safe to say don't compare apples and oranges throughout this process so this process is basically testing different levers um to see what is going to get us to those to those goals and some of the levers are listed up here we've talked about uh increased Transit ridership active Transportation um land use changes a lot of which we've already put into place at least in our regulations uh through our sailing process uh remote work options um you know is something that has definitely changed since 2005 um and there more opportunities going forward before you move",

        "text": " and then I'd say the third scenario if they do come in for an amendment to extend out the construction um you know we we do evaluate and whether they still have the fish sufficiency at that point so we would require a new Comfort letter at the amendment for a Time extension request or beginning Construction um so just so if uh if a request for Cindy Condon actually for the record um so if the requests were made um for an amendment an extension um it's at that time so we're three years let's say three years out and that's I think the maximum maybe that I've seen um that for completion of or beginning of construction um that there would be a comfort letter at that point which is certainly more timely we're not waiting eight years or you know correct for multiple extensions okay yeah because at that point they still have two I mean you know theoretically they have to show that they meet all of the standards again mostly they can rely upon what was in the record um but sometimes we have to evaluate you know what are the their changes in circumstances on the ground or laws or in this case you know whether they still have this sort of sufficiency of that um Comfort letter so that's where we would require it um you know again so it wouldn't be you know if they get you know an original approval with a three-year timeline and then getting a timeline extension for another three and another timeline extension for another three that we wouldn't wait until you know that sort of very end to figure out if we actually had that ability um there would be a couple opportunities to require another um proof of um availability to get a bond or letter of credit okay thank you I'm Grill yes council member buyer council member buyer this is um just kind of a wonky question we approved the site certificate this year construction begins five or six years from now with extensions do we do inflationary adjustments to the bond amount during that period between certificate issuance and start of construction just to just uh so for the record Todd cornet the yes the short answer is that when they submit the uh decommissioning amount and when you know Council approves it we determine in the findings you know what quarter of what year of you know that amount was so if they submitted the you know request and you know a year later Council approves it and we haven't updated for inflation you know in our evaluation we would pay it to the date that they submitted it to us and effectively then when they come in and say hey we're ready to submit the bond or letter of credit that would have to be updated for inflation you know throughout that time frame whatever that was so right the answer is yes yep and and I'm really comfortable with the start of construction as the date the bond has to be um submitted does construction include groundbreaking or just structural components just out of curiosity we struggled with this at the local level so there is oh sorry no no go ahead the definition of construction is two hundred fifty thousand dollars site exploration investigation type thank you okay uh I think I'm on Nancy's slide 14. yeah that's where I'm at uh this is another back to the retirement Financial assurance and mandatory conditions this is an important condition because if the certificate holder allows the site to deteriorate to a point where it could impact the ability to properly restore the site council could step in and bring an enforcement action for as we've discussed for example in voice impose penalties uh suspend or even terminate the site certificate next slide please Nancy another mandatory condition this one is pretty straightforward it requires the certificate holder to retire the facility consistent with an approved retirement plan if they permanently ceased Construction or operation of the facility next slide please Nancy another mandatory condition must be included in all site certificates it provides the basis for Council to draw on a bond or letter of credit uh if the certificate holder stops construction or operation but doesn't retire the facility on their own I've highlighted language that's the language that I just described it allows you to draw on the 100 letter of credit the language I've highlighted in yellow I would characterize this as possibly unlikely to happen but still good language to include I say it's unlikely for example the first highlighted language if a certificate holder stops construction or operation without retiring the facility it's it seems unlikely that they're going to submit a retirement plan after receiving notice from us but the intent is to give them that opportunity to give them that chance to do that uh the second uh yellow highlighted language I would also say is possibly unlikely if the certificate holder has stopped operating facility but hasn't retired it properly it seems unlikely that they would voluntarily pay any cost of retirement that aren't covered by the bond or letter of credit hopefully we don't get to that situation the bond or letter of credit should be enough especially since we include those future contingencies that I described uh but it's good nevertheless to have this language in because it gives the state a foundation uh in the conditions for pursuing any costs in litigation that might be we might incur above what the bond or letter of credit covers um Cindy Condon uh for the record Project Specific if our or if our applicant holder I mean say churches get this happens they cease to do business we act on the bond now we have the responsibility to return it uh to a useful condition and those expenses run over what our bond is even with the included inflation and and risk um at this point there is no I mean and maybe the LLC is gone it has has been um it's just no longer operating at all um there's no access to the parent our Reliance on the parent company prior to this site um to issuing the site certificate uh there's no access to the parent company with respect to to paying the overage costs here is that true I think that's yeah there's definitely there would be risk there that's why it's important that we get that we do the estimates and adjust them for inflation and include the contingencies uh in the scenario you've described we would certainly I'm certain that we would still I would suspect that we would still pursue a parent company uh to the extent that we can but there's definitely exposure there because it is the applicant and the certificate holder that is obliged to comply with the conditions uh we have a letter of credit in the bond that the whole intent is to avoid that type of situation right and and just um coupled that with some conversations we've had um at previous Council meetings uh many of these llc's are um organized in Delaware they're Delaware llc's providing protection to the parent company and and other other company you know that sometimes they're stacked subsidiaries and it strikes me that that those articles would protect the parent yeah that's I mean that's the basic idea one of the basic ideas of parents and subsidiaries is you're setting up the subsidiary to provide some distance between you and the parents uh and then that's your your then would be getting into a whole different Arena which is called piercing the corporate veil right and you're trying to either get to the parent or to the individuals behind the company and to yeah and and that is an arena that we don't even want to get to which is why we have all of these other conditions that we've been discussing that are set up to avoid that situation again which is why it's very important that we hold the applicants to demonstrate to us that we're comfortable with the costs that they're estimating for decommissioning and I'll I could provide one example where we have pushed back on applicants where Africans said well you should give us credit for the scrap value our facility in other words you should be able to if you got to the point where we're gone you should be able to sell the materials that are left on site for scrap value and so you should reduce the amount of the financial assurance that we have to provide in order to account for scrap we made it give it I don't know how many years ago that said we will not and consider scrap value when imposing the financial Assurance condition the amount of the bond or the letter of credit so that's that's just one example where we are taking as many precautions as we can to avoid the type of situation where the state has Financial exposure uh and has to pay out of its own pocket for these types of situations thank you okay next slide please Nancy so this isn't in a mandatory well the beginning of the condition is the standard mandatory language that we discussed a few slides back the language in green you'll recall from our meeting last December uh when we were talking about the West End solar project site certificates and we discussed wanting to ensure that the state is protected if during operations Council learns of developments that merits increasing the amount of the bond or letter of credit so something is happening at the facility they're having compliance problems or might not be something at the facility we might have learned that uh it's going to cost more to dispose of wind turbines than uh we originally thought if there are those types of developments either at the facility or in the this language in green that we added in that particular site certificate would assist in ensuring that the council can adjust the financial Assurance amount uh going forward I would recommend that Council to continue to include this type of provision uh Insight certificates but I would recommend one revision here we say Council reserves the right to adjust the financial Assurance uh if it determines its necessary to ensure that the amount is adequate to maintain health and safety of the public and environment I would instead state that we reserve that right to adjust the amount if counsel determines its appropriate necessary to restore the site to a useful non-hazardous condition and there are two reasons for that first because this that's what the standard requires the standard itself requires restoration to a useful non-hazardous condition but second returning the site to a useful condition might not have anything to do with protecting health and safety for example clearing solar panels from a property so it can be farmed again as we discussed earlier today that might be necessary to return the property to a useful condition but it has nothing to do with protecting public health and safety uh so again this this stems from and it's another example of how we're evolving and we're trying to make sure that we're adequately protected this is a provision that we just included in December that I would recommend we you consider yeah uh including with that revision that I just mentioned Patrick this is Marcy in addition to what you said about it being that's what the standard says I think anytime that we",

        "text": " else on this i will move this forward and i will note i think i will uh right at 11 30 i'll take a pause we'll probably be just beginning kind of our discussion of question 11 but i'll pause to see if there are any public comments just to make some opportunity for that and then we might push a little beyond 12 but that's okay but i think we're within striking distance of getting through everything so question 11 around market design optionality so obviously there are numerous ways energy markets could be designed uh the studies we reviewed uh certainly consider multiple different constructs everything from the bilateral status quo to an expansion of eim and potential day head markets to full rtos either single rtos across the west or full rtos so that's really what we were seeking feedback here uh with this question uh general uh bigger is better it's definitely feedback we heard a bigger more diverse footprint would be desired to spread out and increase the amount of variable renewable output across the map but also as noted as you do that it also adds complexity minimum size there is a minimum size geographic footprint needed to justify the cost of developing and transitioning to an rto and one commenter suggested one that the minimum size for an rto is probably quote the northwest region and then any rto footprint that fragments that region could create friction and kaiso expansion before kaiso could expand into a regional rto it would quote have to adapt its governance structure to become independent from the government of incrementalism a full rto quote may not be necessarily the right solution for the west at this time should be expected that granting grid integration evolution and incremental expansion will continue status quo partial regionalization is represented by more utilities and soon bonneville participating eim and the development of a potential e-dam is preferable to rto formation for the northwest retail benefits again bigger is better was the general theme that multiple commenters suggested generally a bigger footprint will increase net benefits to retail customers another view some preliminary analysis by one commenter suggests that an rto market footprint with and without kaiso may result in only a nominal difference in the benefits a third view to see real benefits the rto's geographic footprint needs to be quote large enough to generate diversity and load and generation and this kind of ties back to the previous question that perhaps is more important than focusing so much on specific benefits that focus and emphasis should really be placed on developing effective independent governance rather than trying to maximize potential benefit achievable transmission evaluation of the impact on retail benefits of expanding the geographic footprint must also consider consider the increased cost for transmission as that's that footprint scale of the benefits one commenter pointed to a recent study that found three times the gross benefits would accrue from a fully functional rto again that's one that would include imbalance in day ahead markets ra and transmission planning functions compared to the status quo even with existing eim and planned edam market optionality negotiate the outcomes and rto can be organized in many ways that will be the result of a larger negotiation with stakeholders and the focus should be on building on best achievements of existing efforts single entity rto uh would be quote preferable to establish a single entity responsible for all the traditional functions of an rto but that that single entity should not be iso as currently separating functions multi-jurisdictional regional system that separates out traditional rto functions is possible but a fully functional single rto would provide the greatest benefits one view one commenter contends that separated ra and transmission functions must be correlated in sync across the same geography in order to realize both the full benefits that an rto could another view a multiple construct path could be viable as long as the important functions transmission planning ra reserve sharing and real-time marketing are provided effectively and this may allow for many of the benefits to be realized sooner with less execution risk a third view market alternatives that include quote hybrid constructs should be considered if not prioritized the ein model the existing western ein balances these interests well providing diversity benefits to oregon customers while preserving state influence um and then there's a question here on marginal cost dispatch and the need for uh market design to consider changes uh markets maybe to grapple with this mostly academic issue uh ultimately it's quote a great problem to be faced with for customers and one commenter suggests this is going to be an issue with or without with or without an rto as more renewable generation is developed and that the northwest power pole effort will begin to address it uh capacity value to mitigate concerns the market should account for capacity value not just the marginal cost of flexibility the flexibility of resources should be compensated by energy markets to address the value of these resources to integrate the uncertain and variable output of renewables the northwest hydropower resources are unique compared to other regions and this unique resource must be taken into account when designing an rto and the missing money problem uh low margin cost prices and energy markets may not adequately reflect the value of the investment needed in dispatchable resources to maintain reliability this issue is addressed differently by different rtos whether it's separate capacity payments in pjm energy only markets in ercot and or hybrid administratively determined capacity procurements such as spp or miso so a couple of discussion questions here so if you can get your hand raised function going and i'll note again i'll cut us off here in five minutes just to pause for public comments might be a little bit disjointed but just in case folks are joined in specifically for the 11 30 time and then i mean get back to this and this wraps into some of our roundtable discussion anyway which is going to be quite truncated but one of these questions was really dealing with this issue um so discussion questions do you support or oppose a particular perspective would you emphasize something differently is something and two two additional questions so missing money as identified previously uh we shouldn't look to rto formation to solve all of our challenges to what extent do you believe that potential rto markets must be designed explicitly to address the so-called missing money problem or would it be acceptable for out-of-market actions to continue to drive capacity procurement and in terms of flexibility with respect to potential rto formation should the sector's needs for flexible capacity be evaluated separately from the challenges identified by the missing money problem uh what potential rto markets need to be designed to value flexible capacity explicitly or would it be acceptable again for out-of-market actions to address this need for flexibility and then of course there's the broader questions on incrementalism which i was planning to address in the round table discussion but i think we're going to merge all that merge all that together here to get us to complete our agenda so i'll open up the the floor now and again we'll we'll pause here in a few moments uh it looks like uh commissioner tawny has her hand up no she does not it's poor hand management on my part i like that phrase poor hand management sarah um i just sometimes i feel like the ms i might not understand what missing money problem means because i think i've heard the concept in a couple of different areas sometimes i hear about it in terms of like you know baseload resources that are part of the market that are really needed for those times that they may not have the kind of payment or capacity compensation mechanisms in place to really make it economic to keep that plant um operative in terms of whether or not we should mothball it or keep it operative for those few times a year it's needed sometimes i hear that's a missing money is that what we're talking about or am i getting this is there something else going on does anyone know yeah that's a very good question because i do think it's uh my view of it is that it's it's uh used in different contexts by different interests for different reasons at different times so i i would be curious to hear feedback from others and mostly i'm curious to hear feedback on however the problem is defined is it something that now there's a view that an article needs to solve it's right um or is rto markets designed to economically dispatch the capacity that's made available to it and shouldn't be relied upon exclusively to incentivize new capacity builds so curious for additional thoughts on this one or i could uh give you time to think about that uh juicy question although i see spencer as his hand up and i was gonna say i'll take spencer's comment and then i will pause and uh open up the phone lines here for public comment and then we can revisit this along with the additional round table discussion questions which kind of tie into this thanks adam uh i guess to respond to i don't know that we need to sweat the business money problem i view it as something that comes up in the context of states that have already restructured and in which the vertically integrated utilities willingly or by the direction of the state legislatures have given up their procurement function and that function is supposed to be run through the the essentially operated markets in the northwest we've gone so far down the path of setting up this resource adequacy program that sarah's obviously um one of the architects have been very knowledgeable about and the states haven't restructured in the same way as they have in the east and so i think it's entirely conceivable to set up an rto that um in in the west certainly the northwest can sidestep missing money problem because we haven't had that divestment of generation and transfer of the procurement function to an rto and i don't think we have to have an rto presumes that kind of restructuring in the west so i don't view it as as relevant a question for rto formation here as it has been in the east and i'm uh happy to hear if others have thoughts on that question um but first i will ask uh linda from odo if she can check to see if there is any interest um among attendees in public comment it looked like most of our public attendees were associated with organizations that are on our committee so i'm not sure but there were some others so i wanted to make sure we uh have a chance to hear from them in reviewing the um attendee list i don't see any hands raised or questions submitted i will check back in say 15 minutes linda so if remember if you can monitor that and let me know at 11 45 i will uh pause again so we",

        "text": " is that's an excellent point especially for our planning um and as we move forward into one of the other key questions in section six is please describe the renewable energy resource the project will utilize include the levels of supply for the energy resource and how the system will access the resource uh to help with this to help applicants in the second round we have created uh it's a simple guide but it's the resource assessment guide on the program webpage you'll find that in the sidebar tab labeled applicant help we do advise taking a look at that will give you a little bit more idea of what you're looking at uh at determining that'll help you answer this particular question about the resources for your particular project or planning project uh clay do you have anything more you want to add here well this plays into the strength of your application and the strength of your project and so the more work you can do ahead of time and put into the application in assessing um the renewable energy resource you're going to be planning for it just makes it a stronger potentially higher scoring application that's an excellent point and uh so as we continue on through Section six uh please describe how the system will connect or transmit energy to the community identified in the um and what we're looking at here is uh in addition to the response that you could even upload some supporting documentation excuse me such as the project plan scope or letter of intent regarding utility interconnection may be um but what we're looking at is uh is how the system is going to connect in and transmit energy to that Community is that going to be through interconnection is that going to be uh you know into an energy storage based system and as much detail as you can provide here clay do you have some additional guidance here um no I think you've hit all the high points on this one it is related to the equity section of the scoring criteria and so um you know those details that you have planned out um will help your score right and and helping that score to those uh communities and in in many cases drilling that even further down into the qualified environmental justice communities and how your project is going to have that impact there all right and uh we're gonna continue uh to move forward through the Section 6 project description uh and on this question it's going to relate uh pretty much specifically to uh those planning planning projects uh that are going to have a resilience component uh built into that project and the question is please describe how the community renewable energy project would support the energy resilience of structures or facilities essential to the public welfare include how the energy resilience will be increased and the energy resilience benefits the project will bring and and what we're looking for here is uh you know we're looking uh for you to describe that structure or um that this planning project is going to have an impact too uh who is going to be impacted by that in the community how they're going to be impacted uh within that uh in that planning project if that planning new project materializes into a construction installation project in additional you can detail you know how well that proposed project is going to support or increase the particular community's energy resilience within overall buildings or structures or facilities and uh and a part of this program priority is always if it's going to be essential to the public welfare and I'll go ahead and toss over to Clay if he has any more to add here this is a standalone scoring criteria for andesia resilience so it's very important to pass the grant you're applying for that you have a good description of the who what where when why of the the resilience in connection with the definition for this program which Jason just outlined and so that that backup power of a grid outage and how long it's going to last who it's going to serve and how long it's going to serve them things like yeah I think that's a great assessment there and um so with that we're going to uh continue on um into this next section 6 question key question is describe the community buildings infrastructure or other community assets that will benefit from the proposed system um and so uh this kind of ties if you're in a resilience project kind of ties to the last one but what we're looking for is a little broader uh aspect here or if you're in just a renewable only project uh we're looking for more of a a broader assessment of the local and or uh or drilling down into the qualifying environmental justice Community benefits that are essential to public welfare for this particular planning project and Clay do you have any more you want to add in there um this ties in as well with Equity scoring criteria and so describing you know who you're serving and how you're serving them with your project is the the key aspect here um and again an example from from round one would be where a city partnered with a community agency and the system was put on that Community agency and so they went into great detail about the population that they serve in that in that Community agency and and how they serve them and um and the net metering and the backup capabilities that were provided by their excellent thank you clay and so in this last key question uh under Section six is if the community renewable energy project will add capacity to or be paired with an existing Renewable Energy System uh provide a description of the existing Renewable Energy System so uh relatively self-explanatory here is that uh you know what we want to do and what we want to know is if there's already an existing system in place and you're adding to it or pairing with that as part of your planning project we just want to know more details about that particular system uh even you could even include uh or answer the answer into the provide your response but you could even strengthen this by uploading existing as built designs any of those types of supporting documentation or materials clay do you want to add anything here um in this one if you don't have existing Renewable Energy System don't feel the need to to fill it in with something else or to expand upon your current project this is a very specific requirement of the program and if you have it then describe it but also keep it separate from the planning that you're doing for the new system we had some applications in round one that sort of confused and overlapped existing as being part of their new project and want to keep those things separate when it comes to the details of the project and just explained to us how you're tying in to what you already have I think that's an excellent point um so uh I just want to uh take a moment thank you all for uh continuing through this series we hope it's helpful um in the uh in the next video uh we're going to be going through the project plan uh in its own video to uh point out those key questions there as well uh and again I'm Jason on behalf of clay just want to say thank you for joining us and we look forward to seeing you in the next video thank you",

        "text": " describe how you came about coming up with that service elements of the project that relate back to to that earlier question you know in the Outreach um contacting the leadership of environmental communities involving them in the project you know how did you go about those things if you've done so and uh in this uh next question we're starting to move into more of the location aspect or this is uh ties in with the community location under the equity area uh and this is going to be another follow-up question that pops up if you answered yes to the prior one and this is to describe in detail how and to what extent the community qualifies as an environmental justice Community similar to the other these appear a little bit similar but what we're looking for is one is more Project Specific and serving that community and this is more of how that qualifies as an environmental justice Community uh and so as I mentioned before this is another area where utilizing some of the resources to uh to provide uh qualitative quantitative data mapping Etc down to your specific location uh where this project is going to be uh and what we're looking for is is uh specific details about the local environmental justice communities that will be served uh primarily served by this project if they're going to be primarily served and if not how they would be served in general just that basic information and so again I just hit back to that list of helpful resources uh document with links on the program webpage and Clay do you have anything to add here well the the Preamble question is is your project located in a qualifying entity and then then we'll want the details of yes about that and it can be as simple as yes we are Rural and that's pretty self-evident in Oregon whereas Rural and where is it the same for Coastal um those are very specific um but if you want to describe in more detail specifically where that project is located and how it relates to the definition of environmental justice communities this is the place to do that um we continue to move forward uh this is another priority scoring opportunity so it's a non-required question uh and this is uh uh seems like a difficult question but it is Rel relatively easy to describe any Equity framework used by the applicant in developing the project and what I mean by easy is that you're really going to have already developed uh as part of your organization and planning for this particular project uh an equity framework not just a uh diversity Equity inclusion policy or what have you but broken down even more into the framework that you use for any of your projects that that highlight uh or require or put policies and programs and procedures in place to address Equity at at each or various stages in any particular project and in this case we're looking for how that will relate to this particular project and clade you have anything to add there so just again to that key element of equity framework in developing the project yes a lot of communities might have an equity framework but please describe how you apply and what procedures and policies are in place and that that's a good example you describe it all in the question response but then also upload that supporting documentation say here is our Equity framework this is what the city uses all this project and here's documentation on how we apply the equity framework to this project that would be an example of reaching for the highest possible score in this area excellent that's it then that's a great and so continue to move forward we have another of the non-required priority scoring opportunities uh and that is how will this project assist in achieving goals included in the applicant's natural Hazard mitigation plans as approved by FEMA again this is one uh that can seem maybe a little bit complicated or an opportunity to explain a whole bunch of stuff but it's actually a very simple question uh you have a FEMA approved natural Hazard mitigation plan that is the first part you have that or you don't if you have that then we are looking to see uh the record of that and then we're looking for how this project assists in achieving the goals in that plan uh very very simple uh kind of a yes or no area with some supporting details there clay do you have anything to add there nope this is a standalone scoring item in the scoring criteria and so those folks that that can't answer yes to this and then describe the specifics related to the project have scoring opportunities and others may not so as we continue to move forward uh this is kind of a key one under the subheading uh in the program in Section 8 of the OA squaring criteria for the energy cost savings area and that is detail any direct energy cost savings to families and small businesses from the proposed project again this is uh this can be thought of me as as maybe being a very expansive area to answer a question but the truth is it's really a simple to answer that question and that is that this project is going to have uh Direct Energy cost savings to families and or small businesses in that local qualifying EJ Community or it's going to be potentially unknown what those savings uh direct savings could be but definitely want to highlight the word Direct Energy Direct Energy cost savings to small businesses and and with that word direct we'd be looking for how explaining how uh and where we would expect to see that and Clay do you have anything to add there well the strongest scores with this one again this is a standalone uh scoring area I think five points are possible under this one and you know numbers will speak loudly here on exactly who is um you know a lot of it's a bit of a catch-22 honestly when we are asking for applications from public bodies because they serve their entire communities in most cases and that's fine mentioning it but that steers away from being direct as Jason mentioned so I just wanted to highlight that and and also uh down in the application the application guidance area is a nice hint as well as you're looking at maybe developing this question or developing your response to this question and supporting documentation and that's you know that level of anticipated cost savings uh maybe that amount of savings predicted verse the grant amount being requested uh over time estimated number of diversity and types of families and businesses that would see and here we go again direct savings uh so just consider all of that uh with that answer if this is applicable uh for your project on the application and we'll go ahead and continue moving forward in a similar uh this is another one of those Standalone uh scoring areas uh and that question is describe the level of Economic Development uh that will result from the project uh and again uh we are looking for what your forecasted anticipated uh or or proposed or planned uh Economic Development from this project maybe that's economic development that relates back to these communities maybe it's economic development that extends uh beyond that but we are definitely looking for something that is beyond just the job creation we've already addressed that uh in the application each of these projects are clearly going to have uh some economic development in the jobs category we're looking for more what's what's beyond that and Clay do you have anything to add there nope nope you've covered all the points on that one Jason okay all right we'll keep uh moving through and here is uh one of those uh Standalone scoring opportunities uh this is going to be just in a construction uh system with a resilient component this will not be in scored in just a renewable energy system only and there'll be a prior question on this one and maybe if clay if maybe if I'm lucky you'll be able to pull that prior question up but the question here the follow-up is describe the energy resilience benefits provided by the proposed project include key resilience factors such as the nature of the facility being served a description of the community being served the importance of the facility to the community and specific natural hazards being planned for with using the system and the duration of backup power provided by the project so how impactful will the resilience come component B and even timeline impact duration is that going to be on this facility and then the importance of that facility to these different criteria and again this the resilience component if you go back to our definitions and all the info about the bill the rules Etc we are looking at those projects that are highly focused on structures or facilities that are essential to the public welfare uh and I'll let clay provide some more there um yeah I mean you've touched all of the key points um I just want to reiterate this is a compound question and so break the question down into its pieces and answer every portion of it to the best of your um and use this question um you know to we would hope that in in looking at the opportunity announcement that if your organization had the opportunity to design a project around the grant you know then you could address these more clearly for those that have projects already in the pipeline and are just looking at a way to apply this Grant application to their project that's just the nature of business and you'll have to do the best that you can do but I just break it down answer the answer each element um where you can for the best possible yeah and and I would add to that uh just like what clay said is uh if you had an existing project already in motion um addressing each of these uh compounds uh uh addressing those even for that particular project is uh it's not only uh going to strengthen that application but it's also going to give us a lot more information uh internally and from the review standpoint of just a larger framework or larger picture of of your project in general and what the uh what the anticipated benefits were even in your own mind prior uh to planning this out before you knew about the sea rep Grant so that information is always great for us as we're assessing and reviewing the projects as well as for the evaluators and uh here's our last one not the last one in this entire section but uh uh the key one this is what we were trying to cover in this particular recording group and that is please describe the extent to which the project includes inclusive hiring and promotion policies again this is not required it's a standalone scoring opportunity uh priority scoring opportunity and similar to a couple of the other questions that we're asking um we're uh certainly uh if your organization partner organizations both Etc have uh inclusive hiring and promotion policies that would be an excellent document to uh to label and to upload and support what we are looking at is for you to describe the extent to which those are going to play into this",

        "text": " people in the community well first of all I want to tell you that in the project we did for I haven't heard anything from you in Salem. about it and bringing a project and me I'd love to talk about it but can be suspended project or put a lien on the project for non-payment and I I'm also wondering if I could I don't know if I would have misunderstood because our How many of the workers in These projects are used and how many of them are employees of a subcontractor then really huh Would you like to see the video of which this gentleman spoke at least find out if this is an employee of a subcontractor or dicken None of the employees on the project they are from dicken we hire dolky construction they are the contractor and they hire the subcontractors and we are the project developer we do not we have employees construction because uh I you mentioned my carpenters my yes we were talking about a project in Portland and not I know what project it is eh And it is a project dicken yes it is dicken development the one you're talking to huh And we We do not hire any workers construction and in this case in particular in Salem not even we hire the sister company huh Because if not dilki because it has a good registration with subcontractors with the city \u200b\u200bWe have been there a lot time we don't have builders in this project everyone is subcontracted I wanted us to let's get out of the conversation a little of us against you but the industry as a whole because sometimes we can go back a little defensive but to be in the heart of the theme and the heart of the theme and it is new For me I'm just learning to learn what is happening around the world state and in that industry as a whole So what worries me greatly It would seem that the industry as a whole you have a problem with eh practices huh of work not even fair human rights violations I would say and it is not in a space where monitored or regulated by the Been then in a space or am I going to speak for myself I am a space now where they ask me to vote on something that I am learning more and that gives peace and makes me pause because the problems for the sake of the problems in the industry And then a couple of questions and I think the counselor Gonz\u00e1lez understood it a little too. He mentioned it because if we are people who are here are going to put our name we are going to say yes we want do this What kind of guarantees are we going to have to power give for this type of behavior or concern is resolved in such a way that is accountable to you that to the general contractors and that information return to this group for put our eh like seal approval we are Partners with you to This works and I'm doing it feel bad personally what guarantee Can you tell me how you understand the problem? it's hard you're doing everything what I can so that it does not happen in projects in which you are involved is the first time I heard about this topic I think it's not fair what I'm going to do with because I don't even know this is a prevailing theme are listening to the of history I feel and believe that It would be better to have both sides of the history and have a common discussion and not here but so we can sit and talk about this situation because I believe that they are not eh I think they are giving me the impression that each project construction always has workers unpaid that are not paid for 6 weeks and they are paid 8 an hour and I don't believe that is accurate or even close to being precise, I think we have to define and see what worries us start and then talk about whether there is a remedy if there is a necessary remedy those lawyers these workers can uh leave the job if they were paid unfair way and I believe What is it? Let me tell you what it is. first time 20 years that someone has request How are you going to check that the people who work for him subcontractor working for the general contractor are paid their standard and normal salaries and appropriately because Well it is important that everyone gets paid for what makes everyone get paid for what it does and no more laws are required states to enforce maybe the worker has to know what laws they have at hand are available to them but that is not It means that there is no mechanism to bring that to light Many Thanks I have a couple more questions yes I wanted to know if we could see the way to solve and have a more robust conversation and not in the public comment is not the place correct I think if we could discuss have a follow-up meeting so we can talk about these problems more broadly and if there is any specific question for this developer in particular in general with the industry I simply want to see what is the way to get more information and for questions to be answered questions and so that mr. dicken made prepared for these questions So how do you have any advice? well we can have a meeting to that the parties meet with the Council members to discuss those themes and after that we have the point on the agenda tonight and that brings us to some procedural issues regarding we resolve I think we also had other topics related to the opportunity of the project and depending on what it happens it doesn't happen tonight eh let's go be worried about the team development having said all this We can move forward with the discussion. convenient and then we will continue having conversations tonight around the agenda items A unless there is a motion to make something else and also eh We're not going to know these answers until later go to that part of the agenda but without care about what happens with these points on the agenda because this is a important point of the conversation is a way where we are going to have interest with counselor Gonz\u00e1lez and Others seem like what we're going to do do let's want to have a bigger conversation I am delighted facilitate the conversation and I mean one more thing if you allow me what they ask me to do is to invoke the unions or the salaries of unions eh To have that extension prosecutor and I guarantee you that this will not work stop the project and it can be done I saw that it was something more complex, I want have a conversation to see what people say they understand the implications understand what you say in that We can't do it at the moment but I think that this is a pretty group of things complex I want to understand everything better so let's leave it for us to see at a time where we can talk to depth mayor Thank you very much for to be here and talk about the project This took eh out of the place because I'm from agree with the fact that it is a challenge have new concepts new information last minute I don't know why it happens tonight I would like to learn more night and if it's not something you can answer there are several questions that can i ask you as a personal but I'm not sure first of all it is How big is the problem? opportunity they have to have a project and I heard the other comment from Los salaries And that's not my question my question is We have to vote tonight I believe that the next meeting We are going to meet the following Monday and there can we vote and the other question I have it So I don't want to give it the impression to the community that this is totally regulated because this is something highly regulated as advisors and also As colleagues said, that is a society that we have made before and what we as a city get is eh homes equi 16 of the units eh It's not a eum same a eh room inhabit is this affordable housing is very important questions What is that process To define affordable housing I know which is something that is monitored regulated how it works Ian is our finance manager knows more than me and times do not have to be decided today at night eh yes what I can tell you is that without the tax exemption the probability for the project to work is minimal but it is your decision and you are going to have to do it when you vote no It has to be tonight and the other challenge in the industry right now are the construction costs have been very high in the last 5 years but now The costs of financing are also very high and until faith decides to reduce rates of interest Financing costs they are going to continue to be very high and it is something that will have an impact not only on our project but in many projects out there in the world today day is this combination of high costs construction and financing No Of course you don't have to do this vote tonight I'm going to do it allow us to talk a little about how the 16 units are measured and monitor Thank you very much briefly we are used to monitor and control in Portland We have systems of 16 units that we are proposing that they be assigned different types of units to give them to you affordable units and leave six studios affordable communities seven one-bedroom homes four two-bedrooms to have prata entados At the levels for make sure that we are in compliance with the protocols and the income would be 80% of fi for a studio they are like $50 gap like 1172 for a study and market rates are 1 10000 of a room are 00 00 the difference between our incomes affordable and market rents and Those numbers are provided by the state. yes they are published every year and they are State numbers Thanks for confirming that there is an official process to speak of the most specific points and I know It's a bit of a difficult time and I appreciate the flexibility in all of it AND again I and this idea appreciate the one They are working with us and I don't know what are we going to do in this gray area in the one we are in but not at this moment I can tell you that the problem specific is foren develop against Dick construction and I don't know how we're doing Let's find out. Maybe we'll see it. again of this process to see which That's the problem is all I have to say and thank you for your testimony thank you counselor sir I know that noted has additional comments You have 3 minutes Not unless you have",

And with that, thank you very much. Thank you very much. If I can just see show of hands, who is looking to come up? Okay, if you would like to come on up. And what we'll do is we have two podiums. The first person could just state your name and address. And sign in afterwards while the other side is signing in. Come on down. Your name and address, please. My name is Janice Garvin. I live at 1283 northeast 120th street in Ocala. We live in an area which is just below that housing development you showed on the screen. And we're an equine area. We consist of the meadowlands, winter's turf, Cardinal Hill and Hickory meadows. We have 100 plus homes in the area and we have a homeowners association, of which I am the president, and we are in opposition of this totally. This is a very dangerous intersection. This past summer, I was sitting with a neighbor in the northbound lane of 441 to turn onto 329, and we were discussing how dangerous this turn is when we heard a bang and the car next to us had been rear ended. It's extremely dangerous. It's very difficult for us to get out. We have two entrances to our area off 441, 117th street and 113th street. It is extremely dangerous and hard for us to get onto 441. Southbound's extremely hard. The only other access we have is 120th street, an old Jacksonville road. We beg you, please do not put any more traffic. We have accidents and it backs up from 329 all the way to 117th street. And then we can't even get out. There is a very steep hill that goes down past 117th. Down. You cannot see what's going down there. And if there's an accident, you go flying over that hill and if it's backed up now we're playing bumper cars again. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. And we're gonna have you state your name and address, but we really, I can assure you, don't have to bring up the traffic and the accidents. We really totally understand. My name is Zachary Metheny. I live at 831 Northwest 124th street, etcetera. If you look on the map, you see my street on that. Right there in that neighborhood. There's two gas stations there in that corner already, and there's never a wait for gas. So I don't think there's really a need for another gas station. The lawyer kind of said something about taking those guys out of business, which I don't know, I just. I moved here from Orlando and I don't know if you're familiar with Orlando on 441, but it's all concrete, all buildings. I came out here. I love it. It's beautiful. It's all these pastures. If it was like a wind, if it was like a publix or something else, maybe, but I just. I'm not for a racetrack and I live right there, so sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Does anyone else want to come up before I close the public portion. Sure. And if there's someone else, please come on down and come on the opposite side. We'll have you state your name and address, and you can sign in afterwards. And you can sign in now, if you don't mind. Okay. It's Margaret Meyer. I live on 117th street and 441. I have 65 acres there. I need an address. 710 Northwest 117th street. Anyway, the main thing that no one has talked about is that 329, there's two schools on 329. There's a grade school on this side and a high school on this side. So having a convenience store there, that's going to have children driving cars and into an intersection, that's already dangerous. One, is a bad idea, and two, it's just a convenience store that they're going to hang out at. And child trafficking is an issue. I'm sure you're all aware of that and you're just adding to it because you've got transient people. People coming down 301 get on 441, and then they get on 75. So you're going to funnel them into a place where we have high school kids who don't have the best judgment, and they're going to then put them into cars and take them on, you know, right on to 75. So I think thinking of the children in the community is not a good idea. Thank you. My name is Mary Tortura, 1750 West Highway 329. I border the 38 acres. And one of my concerns was exactly that. The children. Three schools right there. About a mile this way, a mile that way. So that was it. It's just not compatible to livestock and. And animals either. Lighting and all the runoff water, but that was what I was going to bring up. The three schools on that road. Thank you very much. We can have your name and address while we finish signing in. My name is Mindy Morrow. My address is 12680 north Us Highway 441 citrate. My property sits just to the south of this proposed land. I've been living there for 19 years and purposely purchased to be in an agricultural area. I run a nonprofit off my property. I work with kids that are low income kids and we partner them with horses and to have a gas station sitting just to the north of my property to see lights at night where right now I have a wooded area that kind of buffers the hay field that's there is not something I'm extremely excited about having, so I'm opposed to that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Is there anyone else before I close the public portion? Okay, we'll close the public portion. Mister Bassell, do you want to come up and do a quick rebuttal? I thought you would. Well, I was just going to say, unless the commission has any questions. I think I said everything at the outset. Understanding an application, a notice in your. In your mailbox is concerning. We. I hope we've answered what we can answer. And if you all have any remaining questions, I'm here for you. I have one. Yes, sir. Are you proposing a gas station or a truck stop? A gas station. So the 163 development agreement that I mentioned is something that is a tool that's used similarly to what we have now become used to seeing as a pud. This site is in a location ideally situated in the rural lands where rural commercial with gas stations is permitted. But I also understand our attempt to take down more property than we needed to. To provide plenty of buffering, open space, maintain scenic views, maintain the rural feel. That's the intention. I understand what's been made of it in recent marketing. I get it. And that's a valid. Frankly, a valid concern. So the only way I can assure you that that's not going to happen is to submit and the commission that that's not going to happen is to submit a 163 agreement to box my client in to build exactly what they say they're going to build. Mister Brockway brings up a good point. They all have terms and can, you know, they're contracts, you know, and open to interpretation. So it's. We have to get it right. But the perp. What I will be asking for is rezoning approval contingent upon that taking place and not effective until it does. Thank you. Thank you. Bring it back to the board for discussion. It's very simple. Bothers me also. I don't want to set a precedent that we keep going in a farmed and preservation. I'm staunch opposition to that in a sense. But I also want to be equally sensitive that we don't only kill the people who has less backing and who has more backing. And you know what I mean by that. We want to stand on our ground that any application comes. I would like to see the staff stand on their ground and don't leave their ground. Because if we set one president, I am all in favor only because we need to stand on our ground. We need farm debt preservation. That's what created. We can't keep running because this guy so and so and this guy so and so. And even if Mister Bernie Leetle comes someday, I want to make my farm this and this. I want to stand on our ground and say we won't give it to you. And that's the right thing to do for this county. Because horse is a big business. Horse is a big attraction and a horse is necessary. And that's how we are known. I'm not impressed by this presentation or any. I'm just saying overall, my request to the staff is just stand on your ground. But next time the case comes, I don't want exception. Just stand and finish it right there. And that is how we're going to deter anybody's thinking why applicant comes because they have an example that somebody got it. So I will try. And there's nothing wrong in trying. They must try. And attorney was very well prepared. He did a very good job. He brought many valid points. But I think it all depends on our staff and our county and our commissioners right here and our county commissioner. I think I agree. That's what I mean. But I don't want exceptions every time. And I hate it. I passionately hate it. Greg, before I ask, several years ago we had a similar situation. It wasn't for RC one, but it was when right there at 95th when they had the feed store and it was roughly eleven acres. And they tried to",

        "text": " 33 current planning uh grantees submitted for construction funding uh in this third opportunity round that represents 67% of our current grantees uh some of those have not completed their planning they're in that final stage of doing their project reports and their final documentation so that's how they were in a position uh to have the information necessary to be able to move their projects into construction so that's uh very very exciting it has also Amplified the competitiveness this has always been an excellent competitive program um but the uh competitiveness for the projects moving into competitive review has really gone up another notch and we're really excited for getting into that process for this third round if we could go to the next slide please and so as just a quick breakdown uh construction resilience recommends or uh uh equals out to 35 5.2 million in requests construction Renewables sits at about 10.1 in requests uh and then planning projects combined uh represent just a little over 1.5 million uh in requests and I'm going to go ahead and toss it to my colleague Patricia for some additional information on round three okay next slide please um for the the round three applicant type summary there were uh the the types of organizations that applied were um tribe there were three tribes two consumer owned utilities Seven Counties 24 cities and 39 other public bodies um of with a variety of of schools community colleges water and fire districts next slide please um energy resilience use cases included a range of responses to energy disrup disruption events such as heating and cooling for Emergency Shelters powering emergency response centers power for First Response responder facilities drinking water availability and cooling food storage meaning food banks and distribution facilities next slide please uh notable Technologies included solar battery storage micr grids hydrogen hydrogen meaning small SP small scale renewable energy production storage and electricity generation for emergency power biomass and inline hydro and geothermal exchange next slide and then several of the applications include grid tide battery storage systems to provide Power for Peak grid demand periods next slide please all right um as as we said we're trying to move it along just a little bit here so we can get into the rule changes as well but uh just wanted to stop for a moment and see if there's any questions uh that our advisory committees have on the third on the first two rounds or our current grantees or round three so we'll go ahead and give that a moment and Patricia you'll have to tell me I can't see see all of the background screens if we have a hand raised or a comment come through no questions well hopefully we can at least get a thumbs up uh from everybody for the uh excitement of round three and those planning projects coming through as well as uh some really really exciting projects that are coming through for that third round um Patricia had me mentioned the hydrogen one which is a very interesting project uh utilizing uh one of our first instances of utilizing hydron as a potential energy storage within one of our projects so uh lots of very very Innovative uh engaging projects that have come through without giving too much away a couple of floating solar uh at wastewater treatment facilities uh and then as Patricia had mentioned um a new influx of battery storage in conjunction with the utilities for demand response during Peak periods so we do have some really really exciting projects that are coming forward we can't wait to announce uh these latest winners when we meet again um but with that uh without having any questions there I want to quickly turn it over uh to my colleague James to walk through our proposed uh rule changes for the program so take good away James thanks Jason all right I just want to start off with a very brief overview of um the previous legislative session um for this program so Senate Bill 1525 from uh the last session amended the program by including partner costs into what is considered the cost to plan construct an installer project uh the bill also further defined what is considered an electric cooperative for the purposes of the program um one of the main one of the main change was to add in the ability for Odo to release an additional 30% of a Grant's funds if the grantee meets certain Provisions specified in rule which we're now in the process of outlining and I'll kind of outline the whole payment Pro um kind of division of payments as well as I go through that rule um so you can see what how that add additional 30% can falls in the uh in the um program um so when incorporating the amendments to the um from the legislative session into rules Odo is proposing additional language changes to assist in implementing those changes um so with the inclusion of partner costs into the definition of plan and project costs um Odo is proposing to clarify the role of a partner as well um So currently a partner is defined as an entity listed as a partner to an eligible applicant on an application for a grant um and a partner may be a federally veganized Oregon Indian tribe public body nonprofit entity private business with a business site in Oregon or uh owner of a rental property in Oregon Odo is proposing further defining that definition by stating that a partner May assist or take a lead role in the acquisition installation construction or planning of a community renewable energy project uh that a partner can have Financial or ownership interest in the project um the definition would also clarify that an entity whose only role is provision of goods and services through a procurement contract would not be considered a partner um also proposing that a written be in place between the applicant and any partner before any release of funds under performance agreement with Odo um for those kind of um performance agreements entered into in the future um the written agreement uh would be required to include certain key Provisions uh from the performance agreement between Odo and the applicant provision such as the ability to photo to inspect the project site or audit do any advisory committee members have any questions about the potential rule changes on this slide and we can Circle back to any um if any questions do pop up okay so the amendment to add an additional release of Grant fund for construction projects provided the ability for Odo to establish requirements for the release of funds in the rule um currently the first 30% of grant funding may be released um if upon entering the performance agreement the applicant demonstrates um having taken meaningful steps to seek site control um and having filed a request for interconnection with host utility um or appropriate transmission provider and met any of the requirements provided uh in the performance agreement such as kind of demonstrated use of funds a need for the funds um and so that's the initial 30% and that's currently what is available for construction projects uh with the remainder um remaining funds released upon completion of the projects and any final reporting requirements so this additional um 30% is going to be the 30% at the beginning uh once they meet those requirements and then additional 30% once they meet these um proposed um and so the current proposals that we uh have come up with are that the applicant or partner has fulfilled all the requirements for the release of the first 30% so that's the filed inter request for interconnection and taking meaningful steps to seek site control and um other requirements in the agreement um and then that the grantee demonstrates that they or a partner has incurred a minimum of 25% of projected Grant monies on eligible costs prior to requesting this additional funding so they've already uh spent some uh uh funds um on eligible costs um an updated project budget that did details eligible inable costs has been provided just to kind of so we can assess um progress on the project and um anticipated future costs for the project um and that the construction or installation of the renewable energy system has started at the project location or will start no later than 60 days after the submission of the request for Grant monies and not later than the required construction start update in the performance agreement so that's kind of um either it started or it's going to start in the next couple of months um so we can see that progress is being made with the pro uh the the project and then met any of the requirements provided by the department in the performance agreement and then the uh remaining funds as uh previously it would be released at the um completion of the project so once it's constructed in uh an operational and um commissioned and done the inspection reports and all the final report requirements have been submitted um so and then that they we then review and uh review those um so do any advisory committee members have any questions about the r changes on this slide um and so finally we're also proposing a few other amendments um these just to outline that um fixed costs incurred in the normal cost of business such as existing staff salaries or overhead uh would be considered ineligible Pro uh costs for project construction costs uh this is already the case for planning we just kind of wanted to outline there would be the cases for project costs the construction um costs and then also to um currently we have a requirement in the rules that um during the application um stage that uh applications can't be amended during an open opportunity announcement we would just kind of um with the online application system uh we able we have the ability to um allow so uh them to be amended so this would um if we remove that restriction we could then allow um applications to be amended during an open opportunity announcement um any questions on this or any of the other rules we've gone um okay I will hand it back off to Jason then thank you very much all right thanks James um if you don't mind uh going to the next slide please uh we will go ahead and start to move in with uh We've we've sort of had uh ongoing or in process uh discussion with our advisory committee so uh we are going to keep that open for a couple more minutes to see if there's any questions that have come up from our committee members and then move on into our public comment period uh just wanted to make sure that uh that for public comments that you raise your hand ahead of time if you want to make a comment um and we will definitely get to that as we move into that section and obvious and then could you go to the next slide please and this one we've already really been doing but as we go through these meetings if when if and when possible uh we'd definitely appreciate it if uh when you are making a comment and you and",

        "text": "morning everyone thank you so much for being here at the Oregon Department of Energy's public hearing on our application to the U.S department of Energy's grid resilience program for those of you I haven't met my name is Janine Benner and I'm the director of the Oregon Department of energy and I'm really pleased to be here today uh today's meeting is uh specifically to discuss a program created in the infrastructure investment jobs act under Section 40101d and this is actually our second hearing on the topic the previous hearing was held last August and since that time the application deadline was extended by the U.S department of energy we've learned a lot more details from the U.S department of energy and we've been able to receive feedback from interested parties on the initial ideas that we presented back then in August um the uh program narrative and public hearing today covers our revised approach to this program and it also covers excuse me two state allocations providing what we refer to as our first and second year funding all at one time so this means that we are anticipating being able to award more funds in this in this initial year than in the years that follow because of the format of this webinar and the number of people in attendance we have everyone muted currently all the attendees but as we go through the presentation we'll pause for questions and at that point people can raise their hands and we'll be able to unmute you to ask questions we'd also encourage you to use the chat function on WebEx if you have questions you want to put in writing and then at the end we'll have dedicated time for further questions and public comments so in addition to responding during this webinar you can also enter your thoughts and feedback through an online portal that we've set up if you would like more space to respond more time to consider your responses or if you don't feel comfortable speaking out at a meeting like this I will ask my colleague Jen to put the link to the portal in the chat so that you will have it available for you and it will be open through the end of this week we've got a pretty quick turnaround on this particular opportunity so you'll see that in the chat in a moment and I'm hoping Jen can also put a link in the chat to the narrative that we are going to go through today and asking people for feedback on so in a minute I'm going to go over some Logistics on how to use WebEx but at this point I would ask everyone including the Oregon Department of energy staff on the line to please introduce themselves in the chat so if you can just enter your name and if there's an organization you're affiliated with we'd be really happy to see who's here with us this morning next slide please okay so for those of you who are new to WebEx here's a quick guide on how to use some of the features as I mentioned before attendees are off camera and muted but our host will unmute you if we call on you to ask questions you can see the option to raise your hand on both the right hand side of your screen under participants under the participants panel if you click near your name there's also an option at the bottom of your screen where you can see a visual of a hand in the reactions bar as I mentioned feel free to use the chat function to ask questions or make comments and if you do that please send to all panelists or to everyone so that all of the Odo staff can see the question and help respond we'll try to get to as many questions in the chat and through raised hands as we can but we may not have time for all of them today please notice that we will keep a record of that and try to follow up with you where possible I also noticed um I don't if we have people who called in on the phone you can press star six to raise your hand and star three to unmute yourself when we call on you so I also want to make sure that folks know that today's hearing is being and that a list of attendees will also be posted to our website later today I know it's hard for attendees to see the list of other attendees so we'll make sure to get that on our website all right hopefully that is clear and by now people have used all these different uh next slide please so here's the agenda there's a lot to get through today in the first part of today's meeting is going to focus on the grid resilience funding opportunity in the inflation excuse me in the investment infrastructure investment and jobs act the way that Congress and the usdoe structure the program and the requirements that fall to Odo on behalf of the state to submit an application my colleague Emily salmery who is our new federal grants officer will be leading this part of the presentation the second part of the presentation will be information about the state's approach and my colleague Rob Del Mar from our planning and Innovation division will be speaking about the specifics of Oregon's program then finally we will look for your feedback on the state's approach so we'll try to stop and ask for questions during the presentation but please know that many of your questions may be answered as we go through the materials so feel free to hold those till the end my colleague Jen Center our other grants officer will be helping to keep an eye on the chat as we go through the presentation and finally my colleague Linda Ross is our host today and we'll be helping also to keep an eye open for questions we are joined by some team members from a consulting firm called Hagerty Consulting who are assisting Odo with planning for this application and program launch and we'll introduce the project managers for hegarty at the end of the presentation next slide please okay before we jump into the grid resilience fund stuff a quick introduction to the Oregon Department of energy or Odo as you might hear us referred to on this slide you see our vision mission and what we do our mission is to help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable Energy System we advance solutions to shape an equitable clean energy transition protect the environment and public health and responsibly balance energy needs and impact current and future under the what we do section on this slide you'll see the services we provide and how we achieve our mission and this funding opportunity that we're discussing today will certainly help Odo support a more resilient and affordable Energy System in Oregon next slide please so before I turn it over to Emily just to highlight the three objectives that we have for our time together today first we want to make sure that you understand how this grid resilience funding works and the parameters that Odo has to work within when designing the state's program the is a huge opportunity to bring federal dollars to Oregon to help make our electric grid more resilient second we want to share with you our revised approach for this funding and what we're planning to put in our application to the U.S department of this approach has been developed over the past nine months in close consultation with the Oregon Public Utility Commission and it's informed by Outreach with experts working in this we want to especially thank those of you that submitted information through our previous public hearing and comment session last August and our request for information conducted in December consider that feedback and made adjustments to our approach from last summer but even with those adjustments we still want to hear from you on the program design and application and get your ideas for how to improve it today remember the draft proposal that we're sharing with you with you today is just that it's a draft we do want input and feedback to make it better to align with work already being done by utilities and others and to better meet the objectives outlined in the federal funding as I mentioned earlier we will have time for verbal public comment at the end and we also hope people will submit written comments through our online portal if you don't want to or don't get a chance to speak today or if you have more to say again that portal will be open to the end of the week our application is due to the US Department of energy at the end of the month so we are working to get this all wrapped up pretty next slide please all right and now I would like to turn this over to Emily salmery who will share more information on the federal bill that created this opportunity Emily thank you Janine and good morning everyone the program that we're talking about today is specifically funded funded excuse me under the infrastructure investment and jobs act this piece of legislation includes 62 billion dollars from the U.S department of energy to deliver a more Equitable clean energy future for the American people by investing in American manufacturing and workers expanding access to Energy Efficiency and clean energy for families communities and businesses delivery and reliable clean and affordable power to more Americans and building the Technologies of tomorrow through clean energy additionally this program like other Federal Energy programs is covered by the justice 40 initiative this Federal initiative directs 40 of the benefits should flow to disadvantaged communities back to Eugenie thanks Emily uh after the passage of both the infrastructure investment and jobs act at the end of last year and the inflation reduction actually I guess it was that more than the end of last year got my years mixed up but after that bill and the inflation reduction act last summer um Odo recognized that the state would be receiving millions of dollars from the federal government to invest in clean energy Energy Efficiency and resilience among many other important opportunities so through a series of public webinars discussions with our energy advisory work group and other interested parties we developed the principles that you see on this slide to help guide our overall approach to the federal funding for all of the programs in addition to grid resilience so I won't read all of these word for word but you can see that we are hoping to consider Equity at every step and that includes Geographic diversity we want to make sure that the benefits of this funding make it to the oregonians who need it most and are distribute it equitably around the state in designing the programs and distributing funding we will coordinate with tribal governments as much as possible and communicate clearly inclusively and efficiently to ensure that stakeholders in the public are informed and supported where possible and where internal resources allow we hope to provide technical assistance to build community capacity and support Grant recipients there's actually a position funded in the governor's requested budget to help us do this we're working across agencies to leverage expertise and support

one of the problems is there's a peak demand and those low demand this might be one way of providing storage electricity while there's a low demand the electricity be uh pumped into the not pumped but uh stored in this uh door or there's a there's coil super gutting conducting and then when you need the power you just tap it and then yeah you can put through a inverter to convert it to ac i'll just say maybe uh the other way is large storage batteries of lithium batteries i'm just suggesting maybe you ought to do a study on that see what the benefits there's also hydrogen uh converting the electricity to hydrogen then converting back to electricity through a fuel cell i'm suggesting maybe you ought to do a study on maybe on storage methods for electricity and see what is most uh economical or what uh you know they've got to look at maintenance uh a reliability and they look at the technologies that i think the technology recipient of magnetic storage is much more improved now than back in the 80s and it might be more uh feasible it might you know or you might want to develop a test bed to see if how this these different technologies work and let's just compare them see how they work get some uh research money or something to see if that would work that's great thank you so much for those comments harvey um i'm not as familiar with the coiled approach but that is something that we've noted down and the um we actually do have an ongoing study a different staff is working on it related to renewable hydrogen and we'll put a link to that study in the chat in case you're interested in it um thank you for that comment jason is there anything that um you wanted to um add around power quality i'm recalling there might have been something from a pnl study and while you're thinking about that there's a comment related to from shannon um power quality on the coast many of our solar installations are regularly faulting out not due to the solar generation but due to the quality of the utility power with which they must synchronize this limits our capacity for accessing rooftop and community solar thanks um shannon for that comment if anybody was looking for more on power quality um there was some references to that in the literature review and the references we cited um i don't know um the details of you know the quality currently and i'm sure it differs by location and differs based on the day you know or the season um so there's probably a lot of different ways to look at that but it was just generally flagged you know and we're just highlighting it at a high level so i'm just checking to see if there's any more hands raised or comments or questions in the chat related to local reliability and not seeing any hands raised yet just pause i think um mike just um raised his hand so we'll um go ahead and call on mike and unmute him for his commenter question thank you um i'm just wondering if a distribution plan for the power and i imagine some of it's going to be utilized for replacement of fossil fuel plants being shut down i'm just wondering what comes after that or if if there is a plan um thanks thanks mike for that question um i know jason has done a good job of covering this in some other forms jason do you want to provide a little bit of information on that question uh yeah i think the question is just i mean i mentioned it before and there's different facets to it but i think it's kind of on the on the buyer in the market who buys it um and then you know if there's a buyer then the project would get built and interconnected to the grid where that would happen is a little uncertain but once the electricity hits the grid um you know it kind of it goes where it needs to and then there's like paper trails of the contracts that are signed um for those for those buyers and and sellers the developer and the buyers at the power and so that kind of covers to some extent where it goes um but it would get distributed you know up and down the coastal grid and if there's more than then the grid can accommodate them that's where the storage topic kind of comes in or the transmission upgrades um so i don't know if that's helpful or maybe there's a different way to interpret your question or a different way you would phrase it but great thanks jason i'll just add that um there's a number of utilities that um do integrated resource planning which is a required process at least at the public utility commission for the three investor-owned utilities pacific corps portland general electric and idaho um and they do um every two years update to that integrated resource plan it's basically an analysis and about resource planning in other words how do you ensure that the customers of those utilities continue to get power uh while the resource makes like coal going offline as you mentioned um as happens and so that that is a sort of ongoing process that would be um used to analyze a big part of your question and then the other thing i'll mention is the northwest power council does a regional study for oregon washington idaho and part of montana that also looks at sort of the regional look on power related to a number of factors um but but what your your question goes to is is also included in that um but but i agree with uh jason that it it sort of depends on who the purchaser of the output of the power from the project is but the reality of sort of the physics of the grid is that it would be used wherever the power is needed at that let's see here there's um a couple more comments and questions in the chat that i'll speak to mark is asking can you give a link to the power quality reports you're referencing i work for utility on the coast and we really have customer complaints about power quality thanks um thanks mark for that and also thanks for being on the line we have a really um soft spot for utilities are a big part of the work we do so thanks for being on the line here sean from pge talks about has a comment oftentimes people think of power quality related to reliability but depending on the perspective they can mean different and then jason shared the pacific northwest national lab link for a technical report okay we're going back to the raised um i see that harvey has his hand raised and then shawn um after that so go ahead harvey well meet you thank you very much uh another uh another comment uh thinking about the reliability of these wind generator you're out in the middle of the ocean uh it's not very often but you have storms like the columbus day storm the and the uh storm of uh december 12 1898 uh have hurricane force winds i think that creep blanco wind speeds were up to and oklahoma state storm was 100 i think a coast guy told me best about 150 miles an hour and you've got this hurricane-force winds bearing down on this wind you have provisions of uh is there gonna be the the connections being there be such that uh they're strong enough to withstand not only the high wind but also the large waves you could get 30 40 maybe 50 foot high waves and what happens if they snap the anchor uh cables and then you got this wind generator floating around in the ocean it's now becoming a uh a uh hazard to marine traffic uh you are you're gonna have a like a uh a radio transmitter on it or something that's able to be able to track this thing if it breaks loose uh what do you what what are the provisions you have for that type of scenario that's great um great comments it's actually um kind of prescient because our april 7th public meeting is going to cover in more specificity some of the energy-related topics and turbine and platform technology that you might be raising so it's actually a great segue um also noting that we only have about five minutes left in the in the meeting today um but i think we've had a really great discussion on local reliability and resilience i think we're going to need to skip our last topic and just move that to our next meeting on april 7th in the interest of time but also wanted to encourage any additional written feedback on local reliability and resilience by march 25th thank you so much for your comments and questions on this topic there's just a few slides on next steps but i did see um rep rocksmith come on video to see if you wanted to okay um so i think we'll skip the draft literature review and move this to the next meeting and then we'll spend a few minutes with jason talking about next steps by jason right yeah and the literature review topic is all i was gonna do was flag a few things that were raised um within the confines of these topics and it was very minimal um and it was kind of like the miscellaneous questions so we're not missing much and and the feedback's all visible online um and more opportunities for commenting which is what i'm talking about here which is the same link we use the first time so you know easy as easy as it can be for remembering or just coming to the powerpoint here and clicking or going to the floating offshore wind website we have up all the links are there too and as you'll see i don't know how visible is but just the topics we covered today are kind of bolded and bulleted here and we have um different different boxes in the online comment portal for these topics generally for anybody to add any more things i thought about after hearing everybody's discussion today just a reminder of the you know that we have some required fields and then you just hit next and that saves save saves what you've submitted but it won't fully submit until you click through all the topics and then hit submit and so if you could do that for those of you who are interested um you know over the next couple weeks by march 25th that would be great nothing really to add i think i could mention again you know the idea for another meeting after april 7th we did a great job today i felt like we kind of hit the you know area of feedback not too much not too little to overwhelm the agenda it's kind of hard to build these",

        "text": " you know a term what it means in rs chapter 469 and that is just an editorial preference uh thing but it does i think remove some unnecessary duplication yeah and so that that would be the remaining housekeeping rules that we have uh in place uh or have recommended have kind of looked at the fiscal impact uh we want to make it very clear that the rules implementing hb 2021 do not create fiscal impacts uh because they're just implementing existing law but we do want to acknowledge that that law itself is likely to be fairly transformed transformative uh in the oregon energy system and it doesn't itself have physical impacts and economic impacts on uh energy facility developers uh we also want to acknowledge that there may be some increased cost of uh from changes to the emission standards and monetary offset rates um for existing fossil fuel power plants and other carbon dioxide emitting but those actual costs would be realized under very limited because of the limited applicability of 469503 standards um as a result the overall magnitude of impact would be small and um based on analysis of the social cost of carbon uh would likely be offsetted by reductions in emissions and again for the same reasons i mentioned under agent itemc these changes are not expected to affect any small businesses as small businesses are defined in oregon law we have our rule making recommendations but i want to just focus on the timeline based on the conversation about moving forward with the changes to the emissions standard the timeline we developed was based on a desired effective date of july 1 2022 and that is tied to the update of the monetary offset rate to get that rate in place by july 1 we basically need to issue notice to the before the end of this month um the public notice can wait a little bit but typically we send out notice to everybody at the same time if the council wanted to wait to um do this rulemaking until later all that means if we didn't send out at least the notice to the legislature before the end of this month um the rules just couldn't be effective uh probably by joy one um that's not pressing there's no legal reason why we have to have them effective july one it's just we can't have them effective before july one um based on the statutory limitation on and then whatever the effective date of the new rules was was be determined when you could make the next change to the carbon monetary offset rate but again that's limited applicability and limited effect and if you're in a couple months you know there's probably no pressing reason why that monetary offset rate change has to be july one hi but that that's the only consideration i would have when you're deciding whether you want to move forward with changes uh any changes um or if you want to wait to do the notice of proposed rulemaking until we have test data from the two reference plants to change the emission standards thank you council we have comments from deliberate any conversation mrs hanley i um you know i think we can move forward we've got quite a bit of time between now and whenever we're going to make a we have a pretty good record on issue for the most efficient plant you know i i think i think we can move forward with good thank you others this is kent i think we can move forward as well i think we can document and even comparing with the uh chart that had the blue red and both of the yellow lines that could be support for it as well and i think there's a good likelihood there will be some response we get from those other companies that have the generating facilities that we can get the data for so i i think we can move forward okay thank you indeed perry either of you have any this is cindy i i guess i'm i'm not i'm is the thought that we move forward with the whole thing i i think we're were ready to move forward with the offset piece but i thought we were we wanted to wait for test data for other parts of rule making and um and just a question because we have the authority to raise it by 50 every two years does that require rulemaking every time we do it yeah i guess i you can do you can do less you can do less if you want no i don't i don't want to do a lesson i'm not sure the current statutory requirement even um fulfills what hb 2021 wanted so i i i'm with you guys moving forward satisfying with me okay perry are you okay with that yeah i'm prepared to move forward okay so again christopher you have an inanimous decision of the council need a motion all right are we at is that what sorry is that what this part is like madam chair yes uh if the council is uh comfortable with the proprietary and i will say that we uh have heard the caveat that intend to update proposed uh emissions standard based on field test data and that that final value will be provided before the council makes its final decision um and we can make that clear and then notice as well that there will be that change is expected and i think i think that's fine and i think uh you will will probably receive comments and may receive comments that there's other more efficient plans out there too but um so yeah all that said uh yeah if you were ready to make a motion um on the proposed rules i think this would be an appropriate time to do so okay thank you anyone willing to take a stab at it knowing that uh we've got some support todd and christopher if we go awry sure um is it going to be different than the motion that this is tent is it different from the motion that we have in um already prepared for us council member how unless you would like us to make specific changes to the draft rule language itself i think we have sufficient direction okay you're in under any of those don't need to nuance any additional language into it okay well madam chair i'm ready to make a motion um okay i move the council authorized staff to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking and initiate formal proceedings to adopt rules implementing the new statutory standards for fossil fuel power plants and updating the council's existing carbon dioxide emissions standards and associated rules has provided an attachment to the stature staff report thank you smith thank you hanley we have a motion we have a second any further discussion terry nunn mr secretary please call the perry choctoot haley jenkins cindy condon yes mercy grill ken howe yes motion carries madam chair thank you christopher well done all right that's all i can tell you it's well done you do a lot um thank you very much thank you madam chair and thanks for the great discussion today i really appreciate it all right everyone it is now let me make sure i'm not making a mistake yes it is now time for uh a break do you all want to take a 30 minute break and regroup before we resume or is that too long what's your pleasure it's great for handling so i'm gonna go with that question i think that sounds fantastic all right it is uh 12 47 i know it's an odd number but how about we just come back at 12 50 because 12 40 uh one sorry yes oh wait we are really sorry my math is all bad hold on a second i'm screwing this up uh it is 12 47 how about we come back at 1 15 if that is okay with i'm cheating you out of two minutes thank you marcy thank you see you at 115. thank you agenda item f i guess i should confirm uh todd does it look like everyone's back still waiting for people to show their screens and i don't yet see council member or councilmember condon okay i'll wait a minute until you tell god will just i know there could be a minute with clocks sorry about my tardiness okay oh you're not hearty yet it just okay thank you uh so again the time is now at 1 16 and i'd like to call the meeting back from recess and continue on with the next agenda item uh agenda item f is bond template language this is an action item we have fiscally slimming fiscal analysts to present sicily welcome and the floor is hello good afternoon members of the council for the record i'm cicely fleming the fiscal analyst for the sighting division at odoe um i just want to apologize i've had some internet issues this morning and so i'm logged onto my hot spot and i'm afraid if i turn on my camera the whole all the walls might start crashing down so i'm just going to leave that off and nancy's going to run the slides for me so i'm here to provide an overview of the claims process for bonds and letters of credit follow up on questions previously posed about language in the council's bond template and to recommend an edit to the template for council consideration and before i start i just wanted to take a moment to thank the council with a special shout out to council member condon we've talked numerous times over the past couple of years working on this topic and i really appreciate your time and helping us improve this process to ensure the state is protected and the way this financial assurance is intended so next slide please through our previous disqus discussions the question of in the event that a site certificate holder fails to retire their facility and restore the site according to the terms and conditions of their site certificate how would we actually go about collecting on a bond or letter of credit when i started as an administrative assistant for the division a million years ago i was told that we'd simply show up at an institution and return with a suitcase full of cash three days and while it's not exactly that simple as you can see drawing on a letter of credit is pretty straightforward the letter of credit and all amendments with the site draft and draw certificate would be presented to the issuing bank and provided all the documents in order the bank is expected to honor that draft within three business days so this process is pretty much that simple is there any questions before i move on to the bonds for bonds we would initiate the process by filing a claim with the surety i reviewed the websites for the insurance companies on the council's approved list and found that most allow online claim filing or have very clear instructions and contact information for doing so once a claim is filed the surety will complete an",

        "text": " So you can see that Marion county, which is circled in the orange, is kind of the head part of a lot of development activity that is coming from the south and in this north central Florida region. We think it's really important to address this area of Marion county now, because we know that Marion county is growing. We know that Marion county is going to continue to grow. The question is, how does that happen and how does that happen in a way that supports your economic activities, that it supports your residential communities. It provides great places for people to live, work and play, and it supports and protects the rural agricultural areas. In doing so, it sustains the urban growth boundary. As you can see in this map, your urban growth boundary is the area that is highlighted in the kind of bright green colors surrounded by the dotted red line. The lands are. Anything that is in green is agricultural, anything that is blue is industrial. Anything that is in red is commercial, and yellow is residential. You have a lot of agricultural areas in this urban growth boundary, and the question is, how do those areas get utilized in a way that supports the urban growth boundary, supports the activity that the county needs to grow, and in doing so, supports the development and protection of the farmlands and agricultural areas around it and the rural activity centers. We're bringing this up to today because we've really been focusing on the urban and suburbanite, but we want to recognize that our rural activity centers are going to have some of the same concepts, some of the same ideals of the, of the psas, only in the rural areas. So we recognize there are a sister or a cousin of the psas. Those are rural activity centers. And we will evaluate them through this process to make sure that they also have the right planning framework in place and that they're in the right location. So the study for this, when we think about this, we think about it really in three phases. The first phase is going to be your community assessment. That will take, as one of our team members today called it, this is where we're going to be doing the x ray of Marion county. We're going to be evaluating the community conditions, kind of figuring out who we are, where are we right now, and how do we move forward. That phase of the community assessment will take place starting now and will continue through May. We'll have a kind of a check in point halfway through that, sometime in the March April phase timeframe. The next phase will be developing the policy framework, developing that roadmap for the future that will take place from May through September, and then the adoption phase will take place from October through December so that in January, we can submit to the state the evaluation appraisal report as required. And along the line, as I said, we're gonna have benchmarks. So we will have a, we'll come back to you sometime in the March April frame time. We'll also come back to you then again in the June July timeframe. We'll come back again in the August, September timeline, and then finally we'll come back to adoption through the October, November, and December period. So along the line, we're constantly checking in with you. We're letting you know what we're learning. We're having an opportunity for you to set our path straight, making sure that we're going in the direction that you all really want us to go, and making sure that we're headed in a path that is going to give Marion county what it is they want to see out of this project for both the PSA and the adopted evaluation appraisal report. So this is just that. This goes through that period. Every time we come back, we'll be highlighting to you where we are. You'll know where we've been and where we're going. And on that. Now you've heard kind of what we have learned talking to you, and I'm going to ask Brad Cornelius from Wade Trim, who is, I've been had the pleasure of working with Brad for. Well, I'll age us if I say exactly how long I've worked with them. And we want to have a little discussion with you. You've learned what we think. We've heard from staff, from reading your strategic plan, from reading your comprehensive plan, reading your other planning documents that we've been doing kind of the preliminary work that we've done. Now we want to hear from you. Are we on the right path? Have we got this right? Is this where we're supposed to be headed? As we said, this is kind of the kickoff, and as you're planning a trip, you got to make sure you know where you're headed. We want to make sure from you that we know we're headed in the right direction as we go forward. So if we could just start with kind of a quick conversation of is there anything that you feel that we did really well and we've got, we're really solid on, and are there things that you would like to give us some redirection on? Thank you. Miss Ebaugh, I'm first going to ask you, did Bernie Little give you this photo? Thank you for your presentation, and thank you for working with staff to get us to this point. It sounds like you have read our comprehensive plan, especially looking at plan service areas. You've been touring our community as well. I hope that you have taken a great appreciation for the boundary areas of what we're looking at. And it looks like you've identified where we see those plan services areas are, in our estimation, the three areas that have been identified, and that was on, I think, slide number five. So that may be something that you want to pull back up to just refresh us, but we have it ourselves. And so your question to us is, what have you missed? What do we need to share with you more about our thoughts about a planned service area? Yes. What in this, you know, we outline what we think we have learned doing our preliminary studies. But as we get this dive deep into the assessment and the evaluation, we want to make sure that we hear from you that we're headed in the right direction. So I'm going to start, if I may, for just a moment. How many plan services, area surveys, and evaluations have you completed in the past? So together, this is not your first rodeo? No, this is not the first rodeo. The biggest one I've done and the most comparable one to this one. Brad and I did one together for the city of Venice, which is municipality, but the largest that I've ever personally done was for Lee county. Okay. And I think that's important. I'm sure staff has fleshed that out. But when, just for our. We don't know that you're introducing yourselves to this board today, and so I appreciate the expertise that you're going to bring to help guide us as we move forward. So, Lee county, we've also done citrus, either independently or as a team. We've worked on Lee county, we've worked on Citrus county. We've worked on Hendry county. Early in my career. City of Cape Coral. I'm Brad Quinnius with wait Trim, and actually this is my 30th year being a planner in Florida. Just real quick. I was the director of planning and development for Sumter county for about six years, from 2006 to the very end of 2011. Just so the record's clear, I was not the official assistant county administrator. I don't want anybody to get mad at me. I was the unofficial because we didn't have one. But that was a big part that what I did in Sumter county and how we did it a little bit different than here, but establishing those growth areas in coordination with our cities, getting those agreements in place, we did a lot. That was how we did it in Sumter county, but in Cape Coral, we had it. Different environment for sure, but that same idea. And as Kathy said, right now in Citrus, we're finishing that up. We're working with Citrus county on the new interchange with the Suncoast extension and State Road 44. And that is, they're not using the same term, but that is what they are calling their service area. And we are putting in place. We've already done the comprehensive plan amendment to put it in from incentivizing to attract the development there. And where we are in that process is now we're writing the zoning code to move that forward. So what I like, too, that as a team, we've done it in very similar environments, you know, like citrus, very similar here. Sumpter, not quite as similar as it used to be, but kind of those similar ideas. So, yeah, we're excited about this opportunity for sure. Okay, great. And so have you spent any time with our transportation and planning, looked at our congestion management plan as you've been evaluating our community, especially in these plan services areas. So to date, what we've really done, and this is the beginning of the kickoff, is we've been evaluating it up from the policy level. We had an extensive meeting this morning to talk about what the data that we need to look at and what further policies we need to evaluate. And we will bring that information back to you at the next meeting, March April timeframe. But before we dug too deep into your current policies and your current assessments, we wanted to hear from you because we wanted to hear from you before we were rethought through assessment and what we're learning on looking at data. Sometimes it's better when somebody tells you what they're thinking of and you're not tainted by. Well, I've already read data that might conflict with that. So we really wanted to talk to you first before we dug too far into the data part of it. Very good board. I'll bring it for conversation, to share your thoughts with our consultants",

        "text": " know uh because there's outside I don't have the outside what look oh I do actually is there an opportunity to have a similar kind of discussion with Public Works about canvases they may have at the airport or other or in other locations as we think about building our our canvas our inventory database absolutely because I could really see you know and we talked about this last time but you know there's a history I know like at the Portland airport for example of having major you know having Northwest painters come in and do a real important mural installation there so maybe obviously I can I understand that there's some a tourism um related you know initiative going on with those images that we just saw but maybe there's also room for an artwork to to co-mingle with those um scenes of of Vineyards and beautiful locations around s absolutely this is not necessarily related to the airport but are there works in the public art collection that are not on view uh there's some in storage um those that were hung up uh like the city manager or mayor can say okay we want these these from The Collection hung up in my office and then when they switch it out it gets put temporary temporarily in storage um so we do have few pieces in storage I haven't done a complete inventory of it um because I don't know where everything is uh so this is going to be a good opportunity for me um checking on those paintings that uh Urban Development wants U for me to get a good idea of where they are and then that brings up the question of how do we want to organize information that we have of the collection um possibly talking um discussing a an inventory system uh but here's a German rooster in um the library when it was removed from the pond um so could be something that could go right there somewhere you know uh but so yeah let's talk with Jim Bonnet um I can include Zack and Spencer um um and we'll talk about the Drummond possibilities um and then maybe you guys can even meet with Lee uh lee em I sent him I guess we're moving forward oh I can update you guys later on it but this is the airport any questions on the that one I guess I just brought that up because I saw these empty walls and I just thought is there anything in the public collection that we could put up in the mean I mean I don't know if it's any it's something that we would want there but is are there works that are available to the display oh yeah that was take a look maybe we could if we can identify what they are maybe we could show them to the the airport team you know and see if there's something that they would like to display there he do you know has it been a successful start I know I know a few people have used the airport but um I Heard the first flight was a bumpy ride they got a little um delayed but my sister has it planned in the next couple of weeks to go so okay I don't know anyone else that that's actually been on it okay so just curious yeah please use it so we can have more I've heard reports I mean that the uh mayor was on the TV the just last week I guess and he said that most flights are full but the ones that are more full were the um burb flights and yeah that they're almost completely full and that it's going well from what he says that's awesome my sister lives in LA and she prefers flying out the Burbank uh airport so yeah okay oh Zach would you like to move to the next item yeah keep going Spa vacancy and expiring terms so we do do you want to do you want to take that one yeah um I received an email today we received an email today from um commissioner sers young and she will has to resign because she's moving out of the area uh unfortunately so we are one person we're two people down let me show you the current list that we have I'm kind of get your juices uh commissioner Eduardo di Salazar you came in on an a partial term and your term ends the end of December um the boards of commissions for the city will be meeting in December to reappoint uh officers and board members uh are you interested in continuing your term yeah I definitely do that excellent uh we'll I'll get i'll let them know um and so we'll update you on that one our current so the two current vacancies will be uh experienc of Museum curation and art restoration or art appraisal and then experience in landscape architecture real estate development or Community Foundations at the last meeting um Susan I believe um and Barbara mentioned sending out an email like a solicitation email to the different organizations in the area um and I got approval from our Communications team that that is uh good to go and by combining uh Susan's email list with that with the list it'll be an easy email to send so um that's the next step I just had updated I think the one that um commissioner sellers I can't remember whatever that she um uh she had some older organizations that no longer existed and some you know you know and I just kind of updated it with the ones that I knew so I think you should have a pretty comprehensive that's all I got on that one um for the spec vacancies anding terms um cool thank you I might know I might know someone in the art appraisal World we'll see yeah if you know them um have them fill out the application before December uh so that we can um consider them in that month's Boards of commissions meeting uh for this commission the mayor uh appoints it and then the city council approves all right we have an update on the Northgate neighborhood Hood View Park fence painting uh here is the park fence painting that picture was not did not do justice it's huge whoa it is huge wow it's amazing the whole thing not yet but uh yeah this is interesting so I went out I was like okay I got to go check you know take a look at it and it was impressive and I spoke to the jogger who was my classmate at wamit and we had a good discussion about how everyone uses a park um and it's surrounded by let's see um h View Park it's a Northeast Salem we don't really have any there so this hoodview park it's surrounded by three sides with neighbors residential this is the long fence line where the painting comes up too uh it continues all the way down this is not fenced and then there's a long fence here graffiti has been on all of these fences when I show you the Grays you'll see it painted but all of this is hodge podge patched with gray um this to on this side let's show it again right here all the gray and this was recently painted like yeah it's been the past year I guess they've been working on nine months maybe ever since it got approved by the Spa Grand or not Spa spiff so it's called a Salem Parks um Improvement fund and it's a buy it's it's once every two years is a cycle and they give out monies for different two different neighborhood associations and so this project was brought forth by the association um and apparently the neighborhood association talked with the private fence owners and got permissions and from them there were no written agreements there are no easements to the city um and unfortunately well not unfortunately it was um used City funds to produce it um but they didn't go through any of the permitting process when I talked to the per it was an email to everyone because I didn't want to like Crush their hopes and dreams or future work like this uh but what we found was that it is considered a sign because according to the mural code mural are only on building walls walls buildings deddy's laughing um and so uh let me read to you what the um let's see one second and this is from Development um this is uh this would be regulated under the sign code unless it were to meet the exemption for public murals public art and Street painting as defined by SRC 15.01 0 and regulated under the provisions I'm sorry of SRC chapter 15 um we are are so sign code is in the or the sign code is in the middle of revisions and it's been six years since the last one and they meet on Monday so to introduce an exemption like this um would derail it U and so um they're not um um advising that route uh what she said was I would strongly advise the council again oh I'm sorry if you want to expand what it means to be public art or a public mural you would need to make those amendments in SRC chapter 15 so the same process we use to redefine to Define what a building was to redefine the the plane of a wall to be painted that's the same process we need to do um and to prevent it from going on all fences we could Define public art as a you know on a fence that's been approved by this as you know by the spiff as a Parks only project you know not on fences anywhere else could mainly only be the ones facing Parks but I'm not sure what to do in this situation but since no one comes complained about it um and whenever there has been a and I speaking with my classmate she said that whenever there's been a u marking or graffiti on it the artist was there within a couple days making the making the uh Corrections um repair and so it's a beautiful I encourage you all to go take a look at that scene it's all nature there's no wording on it um so I think it's beautiful um they I think there is an they might be work on another or plans for another Park um but I would like to make sure we kind of walk through this and you know make it make it not an issue um for people to do it you know um and this uh is also I kind of talked about it with the PGE um walls uh long River Street for the potential Grant uh with Bloomberg and those are walls but they're not walls to a building uh so I think it might be good for us to revisit it what do you guys think would this not be considered you know under that amendment that allowed art on 3D surfaces I mean could a fence be considered a 3D surface uh well fences are fences are not even called out in code here let me show with you what it shows so public miral means an original to relative to the plane",

        "text": " of a handful of in the interconnection queue and there are 3 000 uh just in that in that study area that pacificorp is looking at and that's mainly larger projects uh some of it's on behalf of pacific core themselves they're looking at doing pump storage and so the access to the grid for these scale of projects is kind of a you know it's a it's a pretty precise shot right now there's there's so much power trying to get out of you know the less populated areas of oregon and back to load area and um and the problems that we're seeing all over the country with with transmission and and an old grid that's being you know that we are you know we're investing in as we go but um you know to the scale of bringing all this power out of eastern oregon or wyoming or montana um that's a that's a much greater thing that's needed so i suspect that smalls you know there there won't be a next purple wave even if we fixed all the other problems without sort of uh a lot of thought about how we integrate as to how the util as to how the grid is working today versus five years ago great well corey um we're just past the ten minute mark um i want to have anything to wrap up and then i'll and then we'll see if we have any hands up or thanks to i guess my wrap up would be um what purple really did was was removed some obstacles um and and that was a great benefit at the time and while we were on that learning um and so i guess my main thought of what we could do going forward from a policy perspective is is to think about where things are not yet economic but they are still desirable and you know there are several things i know somebody's going to speak to dual use another one of the things that we could speak to is the silo between land use and and selling commodity electricity um we are not incented to use land as densely as we possibly could and yet if we're going to keep building out as much renewable energy as we need um at some point it needs to become economic to think about doing these projects more densely so great thank you so much lori um i don't see uh any um uh with or anybody else with hands raised but if you want to visit in the chat there might be um there are at least one question for you in the chat if you wouldn't mind checking that out and trying to answer it angela i see your note um that person's up in three the next person up is maggie but i'll make sure that we get that person elevated in the meantime and then maggie whenever you're ready and rob whenever you're ready for mikey to go great thank you all righty thank you lori that was um really informative nice to hear about some projects that that succeeded i know there's barriers as well but yeah so moving on developing prod developing tribal projects we have maggie to talk to us about that and um maggie if you're all off mute take it away i know you have a lot of slides so feel free to tell me where to go on the slide deck exactly yeah so um i put in a big slide deck here i really think there's a lot of information that's just not covered in um many mainstream contexts um i feel like i could put a course together on so i'm gonna go quickly through um the slides will be available and you can go back for reference um so first slide please um and i'm maggie tallmadge also uh navajo power is a private uh company it's unaffiliated with the the navajo nation but is a native owned company and most of our pr our largest and most mature projects around the navajo nation next slide next slide um keep going keep going please so um first and foremost i wanted to provide a little background on uh tribal sovereignty and federal indian trust responsibility for those that are um so there's over you know 573 federally recognized tribal governments in the u.s um so do not view this as and the federal government has signed at a government to government level with many of these tribes and started treating them as domestic dependent nations and subject to federal law but not state law uh tribes retained tribal sovereignty which means that they retain the right to form their own governments enforce laws within their lands to tax to establish requirements for memberships uh to license and regulate activities to zone and zone and tribal reservation land is held in native americans by the federal government um so what that has done uh is indians tribes can't own land they can't build equity this is held in trust by the federal government so when going through regulations when going through leasing it needs to go through the federal government unless there's specific uh processes that have been set up prior next step or next slide next two slides actually um great potential in indian country it's 5.8 percent of the land area and the 48 uh contiguous states um but almost 10 of all energy and 6.7 percent of potential renewable energy but the majority vast majority over 85 percent of this is un underdeveloped undeveloped at this point next slide um keep going so just some images to view on that wind and solar potential keep going keep going um and and one thing we've uh i've also you can keep going as well um and i'm coming at this from a couple of perspectives right i come from a utility uh development background um so but what we hear from tribes is is largely two things for for uh renewable energy and the purpose is you know one is you know microgrids uh small-scale solar to meet resiliency needs a lot of tribes completely um you know or just underserved by distribution and transmission lines are can be out of power for weeks up to a week on a 10 or 10 days at a time so um really and then our tribes are often subject to pretty costly uh co-op utility bills so i hear resiliency as a need and i hear lowering energy costs as a need and secondarily we hear um or you know it just depends on the land mass but um tribes wanting very large scale solar for the economic development potential revenue potential job creation so some of these next barriers are going to be um if you want to keep going are both um are both are for for all uh scale um so looking at the renewable energy development process we have site site control transmission and interconnection regulatory and environmental impact and then financing these projects and we see barriers all um that spectrum next slide um when it relates to tribal land um society identification there's oft even if you go into gis wetland data is often not available there's often very little um data available um to identify these sorry i'm actually gonna make this a little bigger so i can read it um uh and there's uh often not a lot of understanding from external properties on tribal sovereignty and the processes so that discourages development in the first place a lot of reservations lack clear property rights ownership is often fragmented which we'll see in the next slide in a minute uh and it requires a negotiation with so many different parties when it's a tribal trust land when it's individual uh fee simple land whether it's a lotte land um so it can get really complicated and time um the biggest thing we hear um usually is transmission and interconnection tnd infrastructure is just really absent from tribal lands and the build out is cost prohibitive um on the regulatory and permitting point of view projects need to go through again through federal processes unless tribes have been pre-approved very lengthy processes so need to go through nepa environment environmental impact statements which is again very costly very time consuming and we know in development that that time is of the essence and um all of those cause financing risks but there's also limited off-take opportunities um lack of precedent for these deals which really increase the risk and drive up cost of capital for the projects keep going and we're going to skim along a couple of slides let's just keep going keep oh sorry there's a repeat keep going please um these are like just the federal entities that govern energy development on indian land so you can you can extrapolate and add on the state and county any um state level keep going keep going um and this is a highlight of little matrix keep going uh matrix of uh issues so again some of the biggest things we've heard are the infrastructure uh um for development um but another big thing is tribes are not taxable entities so this really and in some states tribes cannot um or third party ownership of facilities is not allowed so um there's really little room at the utility or a small scale level to um bring in a third party to um absorb tax credits something i've heard even from local tribes too is you know um there's limited off-take opportunities it's very difficult to get through multiple utilities for example bpa and umatilla electric cooperative there's um even though it shouldn't be the case there's often double taxation by state or county uh and try which makes tribal projects uncompetitive because tribes may also want to tax the project or the property tax um and um so i think some of these examples have been listed earlier but is you know looking at some in lieu of taxes revenue share agreements um actually full lifetime property tax exemptions for tribes um because i think some of them are limited a few number of a number of years um rather than the lifetime of the project and i think a lot of what we heard too is limited capacity um to to engage on these tasks and i want to jump in actually i sent out a report or christy did uh next slide of from mterra the midwest tribal energy resource association and nrel keep going so these are points that i pulled directly from their report um so some of these biggest the biggest barriers they've identified with um national outreach um is lack of tribal representation at the utility state or federal level uh and that includes on local um local we see limited capacity clearly tribes are served by multiple utilities making engagement really difficult to navigate and and frankly costly and and very um um time intensive um keep going in many states there's net metering limits or a lack of net metering policy uh which really inhibits the ability for cost-effective small-scale projects to um to take place on on tribal lands so really making sure that that those are in place um and it makes economic sense",

since they said so we'll get started around 102. so talk to you in a minute all right we'll go ahead and get started thanks everyone for joining us we have hopefully you can see a slideshow up in front of you as well as some smiling faces of uh Oregon Department of energy so um we're here ahead of our formal rulemaking process on two new heat pump programs and what we're going to do today is walk through the two programs um folks are welcome to raise hands or put questions in the chat at any point and I will just ask those questions as makes sense or get people into as makes sense and then we have some questions for you at the end of our time together today it's really important to us as we put the program together that we're hearing from folks in the community folks who have expertise on these topics so thank you so much for taking the time to join us today so I'm going to move us through um quickly just a reminder about the Oregon Department of energy and sort of where we fit into things when it comes to energy in Oregon a lot of different agencies do a lot of different things our heat pump programs are an example of energy programs and activities at the bottom of what we do but we also are using the other work that we do in order to pop these two programs up um actually while I'm on the department of energy slide let me do this I'll introduce myself and I'll also ask Odo staff to say hello that are working on these heat pump programs just the ones with their cameras on is fine anybody who wants to say hi my name is Christy split and I'm our government relations coordinator and I should flag that we're very excited that we have staff coming on board specific to the heat pump programs very um and so I've been calling the crew UC today sort of a ragtag crew of folks that are working so that we can get these programs up and running so that they can be available to oregonians but you may not always see us uh when we're in the future because we'll have new people coming in and being the ones that you'll be interacting with more so I'll pass things on to James Stephanie and Doug who are the leads in putting the program together and then Patricia Michael and pandian hi thanks Christy uh James Koval here uh policy analyst for the program and also I'll be the administrative rules coordinator for as we go through drafting these program roles I'll hand over to Stephanie good afternoon everybody I'm Stephanie Cruz and section and I have been following this uh these programs from when they were legislative Concepts and we'll be providing technical support to the programs going forward assistant here I'm also here to help make sure that you are have access to your um to the program um to the WebEx and if you have any issues please put them into the um uh please make a comment in the chat so we can help you out thank you hi I'm pandian Krishna Swami I'm managing the heat pump programs I'll pass it on to make it good afternoon everyone and thank you for being here uh Michael Williams is the director for Central service this team we're having a little bit of trouble with sound and I think it's because we have somebody off from you um Cheney if you can hear me it'd be great if you could mute yourself because I think we're getting feedback um and we're trying to figure out if we can meet you at our ends I think that's where it's coming from see maybe Patricia you might also mute see if we can figure it out what's going on with the sound oh great and thanks Judy we can't see that you're on mute but I'm glad that you you are on your end thank you for taking care of that awesome I think it was maybe Patricia it seems like it cleared up you never know who it is that has the weird echo in their house or something thank you all right so um I'll move us on um so uh we use WebEx for our public meetings here at the department of energy and so I know that it's not always the most common we have no issues with it but uh we just like to make sure folks have a chance to get familiar with it before we get started since we do use chat and hand raised in order to like have the conversation here today so you'll see on here that in the bottom corner you should be able to see the chat or at least the chat button in order to set up to open up the chat you can also see the smiley face is what you click on and then the raised hand is right at the top we kind of joke the raised hand looks like a raised fist so look for that that icon and that's the um that you need to raise your hand so that we can get you in the queue to ask questions or answer questions or make comments when the time comes and I'll uh if anybody has any questions in that you can add about the WebEx format or anything go ahead in the chat and I will go ahead and handle those but I will move us on for the time being uh so Senate Bill 1536 passed during the February legislative session this year uh some of you might have been involved in the passage of that particular Bill we really tried to invite everybody that was part of a really large Coalition that worked on this build together and the bill comes from essentially the heat heat Dome event from last June in which around 100 oregonians died most of them died in their own homes and most of them were renters and so the bill deals with a lot of Provisions that we are not going to talk specifically about today but that are designed to protect renters or allow renters more choices when it comes to cooling as well as providing an emergency air conditioner deployment program a community cooling spaces program administered through the Energy Trust of Oregon we got a couple of different um different tasks handed to us we're doing a study on cooling needs and affordable housing we also are helping with that Energy Trust program I mentioned but the two biggest uh programs that were handed our way are these two heat pump incensive programs that will be the topic of our conversation today one of them is called the community heat pump deployment program I'll talk about that one first and the other is called the Oregon Rental home key program I do want to make a note that the inflation reduction Act passed since February and includes incentive programs for heat pumps as well as federal tax credits to support Energy Efficiency upgrades in homes and we know that this exists and we know that it'll be a helpful tool for folks that are doing work on their homes I just want to note that the incentive programs laid out in the inflation reduction act we don't really know when we'll get the details for those programs from the U.S department of energy the bill itself doesn't have a lot of detail and so the approach that we've decided on as an agency is to proceed with setting up our program sort of in a vacuum and then when we get guidance from the U.S department of energy we can do what we need to do with these existing these soon to be existing um either making changes to them or if we need to have some sort of different legislation or different program that we can deal with that when the time comes so that's our general approach there we have not been able to find out um an exact timeline for when those inflation reduction act dollars will be available I heard an estimate this morning from somebody connected to Congress that they thought it would be between a year and two years so it's not something that's necessarily going to happen very soon part of the reason for those who don't know the U.S department of energy also got a lot of money from the infrastructure yeah infrastructure Investments and jobs act which passed last November so they're dealing with those programs and all that new work first and then Ira so just sort of know that we know this is coming we're mindful of how they'll interact we just don't know yet so for the time being we're just building the program the way that we need to build it to work with what is existing right now so with that I will move us on and I'll keep an eye out again for questions in the chat or hands up throughout and as I transition between slides I'm happy to grab any questions that come up the community heat pump deployment program is the first one that I'll talk about today this is a program that's based on grants that are actually going to be provided to Regional entities we're calling them Regional administrators and then they are the ones who will administer the program or work with the folks that are actually putting in the heat pumps they'll provide financial assistance and that can be in a multiple in different forms depending on the program that that Regional entity chooses to um to have so that's loans grants rebates incentives and then also the money these whatever that Financial assistant looks like assistance looks like it's to support the purchase and installation of heat pumps and related upgrades that's a big deal because sometimes when people go to put a heat pump in their home they find out that they need upgrades to their to other aspects of their electrical system for example in order to support that heat pump installation the total budget for this program is 10 million dollars and in a minute I'm going to flip over and share sort of a map of Oregon that shows there's 11 different regions in which there will be administrators or could be administrators and how that money gets divvied up across the regions is also written into the bill and it includes factors like population in that region but it also includes other factors like energy burden so if it's an area that has a particularly High number of people experiencing energy burden or if there's particular climate constraints like it's a colder climate or a warmer climate in the Summers I'm going to talk about the regional entities right now Camilo so just hang tight and then if you have any specific questions I'll grab them after the next two slides when we're talking about the regional entities so as I mentioned there are 11 regions in the state this is a map of those regions the regions are based on Oregon's Economic Development districts which are in statute for those who are familiar with Oregon's Regional Solutions program this is this",

        "text": " which is in the application is further they want that substation to be north of the umatilla river for access reasons and so if that project sorry if that substation does not get built the alternative connection is either a smaller project to the existing bpa line a mile to the north or the uec transmission option which is the long 25 mile line that goes off the page so to answer questions about phases that is going to be somewhat dependent upon the commercial solution to this project which is not yet uh finalized and so ultimately we want to provide a product to a customer um who's willing to pay a certain amount resiliency and reliable power and so as of today and the reason we added solar in batteries that you need those all three components to get to that close to around the clock solution and that's not just the utilities in oregon but cni customers are also looking for that uh more reliable product and so ultimately we're going to build what we can sell and so if we cannot sell 600 megawatts at once we will build in phases but but that's to be determined i think your other question was will you build wind solar and storage together right and i think i i you know i can't guarantee that i will say that all of the products that off takers are requesting these days they those products take priority and so when you bid into an rfp it will look be looked upon more favorably it will be more expensive to build and the power will be more expensive but ultimately in terms of shifting away and creating a a you know 100 renewable grid that's going to be a requirement and so our expectation is to build it but i i can't guarantee that will it will all be built together so a quick follow-up on that so is there a chance that a commercially viable solution is just is solar only on this on the the ground that's being the goaltree exception is requested potentially i think it will be difficult to build a long transmission line economically without a bigger project and if we do do solar it will most likely have batteries battery component as well okay so it likely will not be solar only it would be solar and storage but we started this project as a wind farm for a reason it's a windy site it's got its winds blow at a unique time of the year and a unique time of the day it's evolved over time to become what it is today great thank you anyone else on council have questions or okay i'm not hearing any does the applicant have anything else that they would like to provide at this time or present uh tim mcmahon here again for the record uh mr corey is in the room he does not intend to add additional testimony to a sworn declaration but he is available again for questions should you wish to ask any such questions so you won't be hearing from him again today unless you ask questions and in terms of the purpose of today's meeting which was to respond to comments so we we talked about the goal three exceptions we talked about the the the only other one that i had in my notes was about um capital power standing behind nolan hills and and making sure that the council is satisfied or that we provided an adequate response to that and i just wanted to kind of reengage on that and make sure that you have everything you need um thank you for remembering remembering that comment and it was not the material that you provided and um i am prepared to make a comment after because you asked the question i don't believe there's been sufficient evidence on the organizational expertise for the applicant capital power comes through loud and it's my understanding um nolan hills is not capital power um i i do have concerns about that and i think there probably there's probably evidence that can be given but i i certainly don't see it in the materials okay um that were offered in the application so uh and the reason i brought this up is is this was not prepared by the june 15th submittal and and we wanted to make sure we had the materials in your hand with adequate time to review but we did have our general counsel write a letter you know from cap on behalf of capital acknowledging that capital power will stand behind the nolan hills facility within exhibit a and exhibit d and exhibit m in terms of that expertise and and how capital power will bring that to the table and stand behind this project and so to the extent we can submit that on the record i wanted to do that here okay um do you have copies of that that you can provide to counsel i have two copies so there's a letter and then the the letter references exhibit a exhibit d and exhibit k which are append to the to the back end of it so your honor for the record todd cornett um we are making copies to hand out to council members and so this will just be more of a question once this agenda item concludes if you want to take a break in order to take a few minutes to review that or if you just want to go directly into the next agenda item so you don't have to answer that now but just be thinking about that all right is there anyone on council that wants to review that before they ask any questions of the applicant about it or are we ready to move on grail we can move on please is there anything else that the applicant wanted to present today i don't know okay and i realize i've checked him with council several times but i just want to make sure uh that there's nothing else the council wants to ask of applicant or any other comments they want to put on before i close the record for the public hearing so anything else from council on okay sarah grail no thank you all right well i'm not hearing anyone speaking up um the time then is 1 32 p.m on june 24th 2022 uh the public hearing on the draft proposed order for the nolan hills wind power project is now closed i want to thank everyone for their time on this i think that's the end of my my duties here thank you everyone your honor thank you honor thank you thank you so just from a time check sarah is going to make copies we could take a five minute break we could take a 10 minute break whatever your choice is to get the copies made hand them out it's about a page and a half so probably just take you a few minutes to uh to review that so but however long you want to take a break obviously it's fine let's take a 10 minute break please thank you please return it 142. you say that all again so uh patrick kellen can you verify that you can hear us okay thank you uh yes kate please okay start again i will start again so thank you chair grail thank you council members for the record my name is kathleen sloan i'm a senior signing analyst with the oregon department of energy i'm here to lead the presentation for the information item on agenda l for the nolan hills wind power project and this is the council review of the draft proposed order on the application for site certificate we're going to present this in somewhat of a team approach i'm going to start off the presentation sarah esterson our senior policy advisor will interject um on specific standards where we received public comments or comment from the applicant or comment from council helen tarte weather is on the phone she will be presenting on part of the dpo from public services on i will advance my slide i got two clickers here so just for uh organization of the the presentation i'm going to start with just a really brief overview of the applicant the proposed facility and its location a summary of the procedural history and then we're going to launch into a review of the council standards the issues raised and comments received and just as a note we had a total of 19 commenters that submitted public comments either oral or written oral testimony at the public hearing written comments received submitted in by letter or email and also comments from council and the so the nolan hills wind power project a pro an application that has been submitted by nolan hills wind llc a subsidiary of capital power proposed facility is a 600 megawatt wind and solar energy facility with supporting and related facilities and components that includes two proposed transmission lines a battery energy storage system or a bus and a occupies a micro sighting quarter of about fifteen thousand acres within a forty eight 000 acre plus site boundary located in northwestern umatilla county so this slide here i'm going to see if my clicker works okay this slide here depicts the micro signing corridor the proposed site boundaries so the is the site boundary what is depicted in purple is the microsighting corridor and i think what is important to point out here are a couple of features this purple polygon that i'm circling with my arrow up here in the upper right corner is the proposed solar facility that's the 1896 for which a goal exception is being requested under goal three and there are two proposed transmission line routes leaving the the site boundary the first one is the one that's going to sorry my mouse is getting away from me going to the proposed bpa substation this is the line that goes north crosses the umatilla river the other transmission line option is the uec the umatilla electrical co-op follows the existing uec line and would go up to another substation or existing substation so um it also depicts the turbine strings and access roads which are the longer linear purple lines throughout the site it's a little bit on the procedural um the notice of intent was filed in september of 2017. the draft proposed order was issued by the department in april of 2022 in between there was a series of revised preliminary applications changes in site design um but the dpo was issued in april it opened a 37-day public comment period we had a public hearing pendleton in person on may 26th the hearing was held open at the applicant's request to respond to comments received at that hearing that hearing just closed in the previous agenda item so the public hearing has been closed and where we're at today is council's of the dpo um after today the next steps would be to issue the proposed order which the department will work on so today is the opportunity for council to",

        "text": " will include a lot of different a lot of different types of Outreach we like I said we had a we have a project website that will be updated at all stages of the project and we hope for early and continued stakeholder Outreach um Outreach to underrepresented groups through commit community-based organization and other community events we have our tack up and running and our plan is to go where the community is um attending these events farmers markets for example throughout the summer providing information on the project signing um people up for emails and updates we will also be having a in-person and online open houses we call a community Forum we'll be having several of those throughout the project and also briefings through to the Planning Commission and Board of Commissioners following up with eventual hearings next slide um sorry Michelle the the slide was also ahead so oh right that's right I see that yes yeah yeah yeah um so one of the really important things is our Equity inclusion goal um is to involve all of Washington County Community particularly people living with lower incomes disabilities Latino Pacific Islander African-American and other people of color and people who do not speak English as their primary language in our process we're doing this by reaching out to cbo's through the process and events that focus on underrepresented communities as well as our webpage a web page and different methods of translating important pieces of our next slide so here are some of the community events that we have attended or are planning on attending later this summer feel free to stop by if you see us at one of these events um it we've had a really good time meeting different people in the we also have a really exciting spin the wheel and you can have your share at trivia too and we have we're handing out some swag that is extremely popular so you may see a lot of back um Washington County land use and transportation bags in orange and yellow throughout the summer so it's been really fun so far getting out there next slide so we have our second Tac meeting where we'll be discussing the inventory results and ese methods that'll happen um in the middle of August and tentatively scheduled for August 21st we also will be doing our property owner courtesy notice in August those property owners that could be impacted by changes to the regulations that have that may have significant natural resources on their property the first of two Community forums that's our in-person open house we'll be sharing the inventory results ese methods and code Concepts which will likely happen in September along with an online open house um that will be kind of web-based sharing information that way um also those community events and updates to our Focus look page and continue updating this board this commission as we work on the inventory and what we've heard so far and as well as the outcomes of our community Forum likely in September and with that I'll be happy to take any questions that you might have or um comments anything like to share to share next slide please there we go Commissioners comments and questions so commissioner will um yeah thank you Michelle Miller I wanted to say to the other planning Commissioners that after hearing this presentation it helped clarify some of the things that I didn't understand from the TAC meeting so thank you um it looks like we have a multiple step process and um I think you guys are getting a good start here on this first process related mapping and I look forward to seeing that as you outlined and it sounds like just to clarify Michelle so when we'll talk about mapping and then in the next step later next later this year we'll talk about uh criteria and clear and objective standards for how things get reviewed that'll be a future step is that correct right so so we'll take what we learned from the inventory and so so we'll have this bundle of these are our significant natural resources then we'll do that analysis of kind of deciding and balancing what level of protection those resources should have and then the final step is developing regulations or standards and policies that reflect that analysis that we did so we'll kind of get a consensus along the way and there's that kind of show your work middle phase that gets us to the end result of those clear and objective standards for the resources for protecting those thank you commissioner Kaiser yeah I just wanted to ask real quick at what point does the Planning Commission have an opportunity to uh it looked like there was a meeting on there to talk with the tack a little bit about sort of the preliminary uh standards that will be used for uh the technical advisory committee for determining what those store areas are having gone through a goal five before that those those criteria are critical um and and I I know what happened in the past on a couple of goal five type situations was that we got down the road and then the criteria didn't end up matching what what sort of the policy makers at the end of the road wanted to see and it ended up going backwards again I I certainly don't expect as a Planning Commission member obviously uh commissioner Wills on is on attack don't expect to be part of that every step of the way but I wanted to make sure we had an opportunity to give commissioner will and and commissioner Lockwood our feedback before those get adopted or sure so we've kind of have uh the tack is and it serves as an advisory role and they are they will be um helping to inform the Planning Commission we'll get that feedback to you as we have work sessions along the way so we'll kind of take these these steps of what we're doing like when we show you the inventory report we will say this is what the tech thought about it and and what you'll be able to give your feedback along the way as we get to developing those criteria and the standards and policies that will will hopefully be in a good spot that you'll know what those are some come the time that we are filing that ordinance and so that that we'll have heard what you think your recommendation is for that before we get to the filing point so we kind of have an idea what where you're coming from in a general sense before the it's before the ordinance is filed thank you oh oh I was just gonna say feel free to contact me offline anytime email if you have a question about anything you might be reading on the website or hearing from a Community member or had a question I'd be happy to answer any questions so that you um you you understand because this is a really really technical a lot of things that's going to take a long time and you're not going to be hearing about it all the time so so feel free to send give me an email and I'm sure I don't want to volunteer uh Commissioners Lockwood or will but I'm sure that they'd be happy to to help um get your point of view across or or hear hear what you have to say to along the way as they are both serving on our technical advisory committee commissioner milliman thanks chair Lockwood um speaking of timing did I see a timeline anywhere what is the estimated how long is this expected to take at least the inventory and then here I think when the guidance would come out we kind of had a rough timeline early on on slide seven um if you could pull that up Chuck or if it is Chuck I think it's Chuck uh uh there we go so we're working on the inventory right now sorry I missed the whole right side of that slide that's okay that's okay it has a lot of information on it um so you can kind of see some of the steps were kind of do simultaneously so there'll be some overlap but we hope to have a draft uh inventory report this um by the time the community forum is along with some of the e-s-e-e also starting to to formulate and then we need to meet that deadline that we have in October 2024 we have to file our ordinance in early April I think April um it'll come fast really so a year from now I'm sure we'll be we'll be in lots of meetings to to be talking about this hopefully hopefully got it thank you sure yeah thank you I just want to clarify So when you say we it's it's the consultants and working with staff well uh well for the most part yes and and we have the technical advice advisory committee and Outreach and all those kind of it's not us who's doing it it's we when you say we you're talking about you and the consultants and then you'll report back to us at these different times yes right we have Consultants that are doing a lot of the heavy lifting on the uh with the inventory and an ecologist working on this as well as a a project management team with um years of experience in conducting goal five work and and so we've we've compiled a great team to help us um get through this but it is a local process with a lot of you know local ideas and so we're definitely a joint effort all around so I wanted you said Michelle the ordinance needs to be filed in April so April 24 okay um I had a question as far as all the um the public engagement and Outreach how does that get memorialized or you know is there some kind of summary or how does that work so as we attend the community events we are keeping track of um the interactions that we have with people and getting those numbers in general and then I am writing or whoever is attending and has a specific question or a comment about significant natural resources that will write those down um and write at or and point them and that's all being tabulated internally by and keep keeping track of it that way likely they'll prob there'll be a component of a report of some sort that be generated so that you can see those comments the official comments you know for the ordinance will come through public testimony and when we have our community Forum that will be recorded and we'll have notes and comments about what people say there we'll have an online open house two online open house houses where people can comment and then we'll likely have a survey at some point too where people can't well that will be recorded and we'll have information that way as well but the community events it is a little bit trickier it's more just sharing information about the project and point directing people to the project website so they can continue to stay informed yeah if I could just add at the end of the project I think we we will put together a summary of all the community engagement and maybe themes that we heard or maybe things that we change as a result of what we heard so",

        "text": " process is taking hydrogen and splitting it with electricity is that the Crux of the comparison of whether this is a synthetic synthetic kind of process going on like or am I off base there well I think so um that's what we're trying to get to is compare the two of them to see if one equates to the other or not yeah um and you know and again the well maybe I'll get into the kind of the the context before I sort of um start responding so I think maybe the um my evaluation here might help answer that question okay or or at least provide you the information to help you answer the question okay good um I do have sure um thank you Cindy Condon um can you put so two billion bqs of heat a day is stated how does that relate to hydrog to what we just heard about hydrogen what is the two billion what's produced what's the amount of energy that's produced yeah that would be the equivalent so we would basically say if you take all the hydrogen that was produced at the facility on a daily basis and if you utilized it would it be equal to or greater than two billion BTUs and so if if you know the determination that an electrolyzer a hydrogen electrolyzer is a synthetic fuel plant okay then and then somebody came in and said we're only going to produce 1 billion BTUs equivalent you know a day it still would not be your jurisdiction it would have to be you know you would have to make this determination today that you believe a hydrogen electrolyzer is a synthetic fuel plant and then and somebody came in and said okay we want to create this industrial facility you know our answer would be well the Council made the determination that it is a synthetic fuel plant however you have to show us that you're producing you know equal to or greater than two billion you know BTUs per day equivalent and the use of the hydrogen would have to exclusively be for um fuel not for say um fertilizer or some other use okay I don't think and I'm I'm waiting deep into things I don't know but um you had mention that so there's one gallon of gas you made that comparison one gallon of gas and hydrogen um so is two billion BTUs a day of hydrogen like a really large PL I just don't don't know um relatively what we're talking about is it a really large plant that is or is it a small one as you a small relatively small electrolyzer that is putting out two billion BTUs or that could uh I just don't know anything about electrolyzers um well there's there be there's quite a wide variety of electri alzers used today industrial processes so I'm envisioning that this would be a facility that would that would produce significantly more uh for it to justify uh like a creating a hydrogen facility that's dedicated to creating hydrogen for storage or for use as a fuel it would it would probably far exceed that um and as far as like how much it's hard for me to say um how much it would be con I think I'm getting trapped in my facility my idea of what a facility is and so would a hydrogen facility with using an electrolysis process or electrolyzer be as big as a coal plant producing electricity it it could be okay okay more to be revealed I guess all right thank you Mr chairman oh uh councelor delin Mr chairman being a little bit familiar with this technology but by no means any more than a little bit familiar most of the environmental Advocates that are pushing hydrogen talking about this process which has uh literally no um no no green gas no emissions uh that are going to be problematic in the future I mean it's not only advocated for like smaller vehicles but it's perhaps advocated by some perhaps the only way that you could have larger vehicles uh transporting on things other than fossil fuels oddly enough what they do is they convert hydrogen back into electricity to run you know Electric Motors in the vehicle but it's far more practical than using electricity directly the amount of battery storage you would need in larger vehicles but I think it has a really broad potential use uh there are a lot of questions about it I think the staff analysis is On Target I mean it's think clearly outside of our purview I did have a question though although it does not exist at the time if there was a hydrogen pipeline in the future and one of the difficulties in transporting hydrogen is it has to be kept very cold um would that be under our purview so that's not a question that we're evaluating right now um so the answer to that is um I don't know because we have not um taken a look at that so that would have to be a separate um you know so this is really just looking at the sort of the plant that converts you know water and electricity to hydrogen and whether that's a synthetic fuel plant so we've not evaluated the pipeline question okay but I think clearly your presentation it doesn't follow under our definition of a of a facility under our jurisdiction um NOP okay you're back on all right so um getting back so again we wanted to kind of provide you know what the what the threshold is what we can answer what we can't answer you got the technology and I'm kind of looping back now to that sort of question you know which then puts us into the context so we looked at the text that didn't give us the answer um now we're looking at the context so um again does a hydrogen elect electrolyzer constitute a synthetic fuel plant so it helps to go back to when that was just put into the statute and what what were the thoughts at that time what was the legislature thinking what was the understanding of these you know respective um Technologies at that time um and so one of the ways to look at that is just definitions so it would be nice that if you know the legislature every time they put some word in the statute they would include a definition that clearly doesn't happen and it didn't happen here so we don't have any definition in statute to provide that value for us so it is worthwhile and the courts look at this all the time um you can go back to what the this the plain sort of more standard dictionary definitions were at the time so looking at the 1984 Webster's 2 new Riverside University dictionary definition of sin fuel um and so this was relative to the time that this was put in um it says a liquid gaseous or solid hydrocarbon fuel derived from naturally occurring fossil fuels as coal shell or tar sand um and then similarly the Oxford English Dictionary U which is now online the the word sin fuel first appeared in there in 1976 and and when this was put in statute it is it was the exactly the same it said any fuel made from coal oil share or uh Shale excuse me or the like as a substitute for a petroleum product so looking you know at these the the definition is really both related to fossil fuels so that was the sort of the context of those standard definitions you know at the time um next slide please so then going to the legislative record and there's a pretty significant legislative record so it was House Bill 2260 in 1981 that added the synthetic fuel plant to the definition of an energy facility and um included on that house bill record um were the Oregon Department of energy director at the time there was a representative from the Oregon environmental Council um as well as the House Legislative staff and and that information is more detailed in the staff report but all of the language that was provided on the record again was related to the possible environmental impacts and harmful byproducts of a synthetic fuel plant to determine why it needed to be added to FX jurisdiction so looking at air quality looking at effluent looking at you know greenhouse gases those were the reasons why they wanted to put it into FX jurisdiction was those environmental issues um and you know so again we believe that the focus and concern at the time was really related to fossil fuel feed stocks next slide please so this really just kind of goes back and summarizes what Michael um provided and comparing the two of them so looking at the Technologies the relative Technologies so for synthetic fuel plant feed stocks are typically coal gas biomass hydrogen electrolyzer water and electricity um what's the how does the technology work well for synthetic fuel plants you mix hydrogen carbon monoxide to to produce synthetic fuel plant which then can be processed into a hydrocarbon fuel um for hydrogen electrolyzer just use the electrolysis process to split the water into hydrogen and oxygen for synthetic fuel plant byproducts can include um greenhouse gases and other pollutant that need to be evaluated and limited and then for electrolyzers um you know no no harmful gases or by products from that process itself just oxygen and then the hydrogen quick question if I might um water consumption which was raised early on is Is water considered to be consumed as part of this process and who would monitor the water use do I need a water resources permit do I buy City water well I'll answer part of that and then I'll turn to Michael to answer the other one I mean like anything you have to have you know access to what you know whatever the size of the facility is they have to have legal access to that water so whether it's a water right or whether they have you know they're using industrial so this is not sort of granting any I mean if you determine that a hydrogen electrolyzer is not a synthetic fuel plant you're not giving anything to anybody they still have to go get a local land use approval they still have to site that facility according to local land use requirements they would still have to have legal access to the volume of water that they need to produce the amount of um hydrogen that they're intending to produce so um and you know as as Michael indicated you know some areas of the state you know we have you know groundwater limited areas and and critical groundwater areas and you know water is becoming more and more scarce so this again that's something that a developer of a hydrogen electrolyzer would have to figure out as part of their process and then I don't remember the first part of the question but see more oriented towards you yes so I I was just going to address so the water that is that does go through the process and and does get converted to hydrogen and oxygen that the water would go away yes yes so you would lose water in that process uh a fair amount of that water",

        "text": "thank you very much I would like to acknowledge that general manager Pollock is not in attendance this evening he was a 10 appointed to the American public transportation association's nominating committee which met earlier today he's currently returning to Oregon and will be back in the office tomorrow um I don't think there are other changes to the agenda now we'll move on to oath of office so our newly elected officers will take the oath of office director Duncan at the board of directors special meeting on July 13 2023 the board held officer elections at which

and we're moving right along with our item four for presentations general manager Trimble I'll hand it over to you soon in the presentation oh well we'll move into public comment actually not presentations so we'll proceed to public comment do we have any in-person public comment present today and I don't think we've received any written comment either all right so we'll move on into our consent calendar does any director wish to pull an agenda item on the consent calendar okay so is there a motion to approve the consent calendar I moved to approve the consent okay so director Duncan moved Director Holstrom seconded any discussion on the matter all right all those in favor please say aye aye any opposed seeing no opposition the motion passes okay and on to action items now I'll hand it over to General Manager to present the its report chief operations officer Tom Dietz will present the staff report the union president you know Chrissy members of the board I'm here to talk to you about chariots intelligent Transportation Systems contract award so the issue at hand is shall the board authorized the general manager to enter into a contract with avail Technologies Inc for the delivery of an intelligent transportation system and approve the project budget not to exceed 2 million eight hundred seventy seven thousand four hundred and forty eight in 2019 the district embarked on a solicitation for an intelligent transportation system uh that contract was awarded and we began the implementation and deployment of that system and that is our system that we're using today throughout that process there were delays and and challenges especially we deployed this right before the pandemic hit so as it turns out today we have significant gaps in our in our system uh that that should be covered by an its so I'm going to switch to acronym mode intelligent transportation system its so the consulted with FTA and subsequently put out another solicitation for now what is chariots uh intelligent transportation systems or sits as we're calling it so we went through the process we received four bids they were all deemed responsive qualified and complete the source evaluation committee was convened of every Department that would touch this system so it was very large SCC 12 of us in all um much deliberation much reading and much conversation the initial scoring uh reduced the field from four to two finalists we then began interview process um so we interviewed both of the finalists and they gave demonstrations of their product there were site visits we conducted a very extensive reference on on both of the finalists and uh reconvened this made a decision to issue the request for a best and final offer or a baffo that was completed and the scored a final scoring of the two finalists and arrived at the decision that the successful bidder was Avail Technologies Incorporated so the the SEC is very confident in this decision it was a unanimous decision and in in the debrief really found out that it was pretty much a decision early on through the the interview process and the reference process but we went through everything possible even extending it we were going to bring this to the board last month um just weren't quite there yet but we're here now and so the recommendation The Source evaluation committee staff recommends that the board authorized the general manager to enter into a contract with avail Technologies Incorporated for the delivery of an intelligent transportation systems and approve a project budget amount not to exceed 2 million eight hundred seventy seven thousand four hundred and forty eight dollars and I'm happy to take any any questions Director Holstrom thank you thank you very much for coming today you know I just want to say first of all this is just a key enabling technology for helping to build so many of the important things that the district's looking to do both from the management of the system and the things that you know the district does internally but also I think down the road there's going to be customer facing pieces of this that are just just super um work towards the you know the district's strategic goal of having that excellent customer service so um look forward to that help me walk me through a little bit about the the capital versus the operating in the in the staff report so there's a chunk of this is about below under 600 000 that looks like that's a it's kind of an operating issue the rest of its capital is is that operating for the first year how how long is that for is that going to be an ongoing cost is there a length of this contract that we have or that we're proposing to uh adopt today yeah so um I'll see if I can go through one of the one of those at a time so the the cost of the operating cost for a contract like this is is for maintenance and Licensing and and just ongoing um fees which is why it's obviously significantly lower than the capital cost and of course the capital cost is the purchase of the system and then the ancillary equipment that is to be installed on our on our Fleet so I'm trying to remember what was the last party question so is there is there a time a length of time attached to this contract with the with the firm so part of the cost thank you uh for reminding the really the extent of the the contract is how many extended warranty years that we're willing to purchase so a lot of that expense goes I believe 72 months after system acceptance so um those are just year over year uh or year by year costs so the the actual what you're approving today is just the project contract which is the again the large chunk purchasing the equipment and the services and software and so then so you're saying after 72 months six years that they'll continue to be some payments for licensing and maintenance and things like that but will we have to go out again for another contract with this firm are well I'll separate my questions sorry too many compound questions I appreciate I apologize yeah so it it would be up to the district if if if for some reason at the end of that term we weren't happy or there were no upgrades which um you know it it's unlikely and that was confirmed in a lot of my um conversation with um they're on some of them are on their third or fourth upgrade with a veil so they've spanned 12 to 20 years relationship so my hope is that we wouldn't have to go out for anything other than coming back to well first staff and then the board if necessary to either extend the contract or purchase updates or an upgrade okay thank you and I think that kind of leads into my next question which if you kind of already answered is how much of this this is kind of proprietary to this firm and that we would need to continue to contract with them to continue to have our system be operational versus how much of it can be switched out if we decide to change in the future the the the parts that count um uh the the so let me back up currently we have a tablet in a dock um and and we use we use the term mobile data terminal or MDT quite Loosely currently we have a tablet in a dock with with this firm we actually will have a true mobile data terminal it's hard fixed it's permanently mounted and it is proprietary so there there are pluses um in my book but that's operational and I'll save that for another time but any system like this that you purchase you run into some if not all proprietary equipment especially the software but there are there are pieces of equipment on our vehicles that we're going to reuse automatic passenger counters the fare box that sort of thing so there are some some components that are interchangeable depending on the provider thank you um and then I think my last question um so assuming that this the board approves this contract tonight what what's the time frame for getting this all up and running the ballpark at least in a perfect world 12 months so there's there are um we haven't not finalized their timeline yet obviously because we don't have a contract yet but we've seen their timeline there's a discovery phase where they come and evaluate all of the vehicles they're going to work on photograph and map and and then they go away they build wiring harnesses and put our kits together and then they're sent back out and then they the installation and uh the discovery phase and insulation is right now tentatively eight months to 10 months and then there is uh two to four months of testing so there'll be you know September end of September of 24 we should be at system acceptance thank you very much appreciate it you director Duncan I just have a little question um so for the kits that you're talking about knowing that 12 months we may or may not acquire more vehicles in that amount of time um will that be something that eventually goes when they're building the buses or will those always be something that we kind of have to add on before we're going to have those buses in circulation that um thank you for the question um yes so we we could certainly purchase separately we could use from the spare spare parts ratio that we have built into this what they proposed and we would have any vehicles that are surplused and not replaced which can't think",

        "text": " working on quite a bit and the program you're referring to climate and friendly Equitable Community cfac if you like acronyms is something that the the DLC or lcdc put forward and put those those goals and and rules forward to communities I know as a city councilor in Eugene um we've got those sent to us and um they landed with a big uh question mark that uh we don't know at the local level how to actually Implement that there's a lot of study for just for Eugene the estimate was it would cost a million dollars just to figure out how to implement that rule and it will take probably a couple of years so there's still and and that's exactly what this is saying those things need to be fleshed out more before they can be actual uh action implementation plans that can be delivered and that can deliver greenhouse gas reductions director Bateman do you want to respond yes um our staff is happy to to um I think collaborate and work with you on um that we certainly have um the guidance and the resources here um available to work with our local government partners and implementation and make sure they've got the resources and the information they need to move thank you director Bateman and I just want to emphasize again that you know we have not gotten um state agency review of this work and and so I think making sure that we get good review from the state agencies uh to make sure we're making the right assumptions I think will be really and again you know we're this is this is the reveal of the recommendation with public comment and commissioner comment over the next couple of of weeks I think Zach it's uh through the 25th and of January and and then we'll be coming back on the third at the next commission meeting to uh adopt these recommendations or modify them as the commission sees fit yeah I'll run through these a lot quicker because the explanation we better got through it so the next slide please Zach so when you look at the Hybrid scenario next slide please here's the tierings tier one two and three these are a different set there's there's five actions that go away that were in the electrification scenario and four were added different that are unique to the to the um to the hybrid scenario and those actions are the RNG and the industrial renewable hydrogen use and the injection of renewable hydrogen into the pipeline and then using fuel cells five percent fuel cells by 2030. very impressive school and those were the four unique actions in the hybrid scenario and they're colored here in purple and they're uh on terms in terms of greenhouse gas emission reduction mounts that those fit within uh two of them fit within tier one and two of them fit within tier two next I please Act when we did the analysis and we'll run through these quickly we did it by cost Effectiveness they kind of moved to the to the elite lower end of the cost Effectiveness scale next slide please when we did the uh co-benefits only analysis they ended up moving to the Lower Side of the co-benefits uh scale or ranking uh next slide please when we did the evaluation criteria it was a little visible more of a mixed bag in terms of where they landed with two of the higher ones because they have high greenhouse gas emission reduction amounts being in tier one and and two of them being in tier three so next slide please Zach in the next two oh sorry don't understand that and risk and uncertainty same uh that kind of mixed bag in terms of where they landed um so next slide please Zach but then we developed the prioritization recommendation uh and and next slide and when we looked at again this tiering of these three tiers and now we're only looking at the purple bars we're assuming in this analysis that the electrification scenario prioritization of all the common um action stays the same we're only looking at whether or not any of these purple bars should move uh up or down into different tiers so when we look at the next graph chart we looked at Cost Effectiveness and what we saw was that these were indeed not highly cost effective uh 18th and 16th in terms of cost effective 17th and 14th and so the recommendation here is to because of those cost Effectiveness rankings to move them down the first two into tier two and the other two into tier three so RNG and and Industrial hydrogen into two and three and and injection 15 injection and fuel cells into tier three next slide please when we looked at just the co-benefits analysis uh the same thing happened they were they ranked 21st and 20th and 17th and 19th and 14th again the recommendation is Shifting them from tier one into those two into tier one and the other two into tier next slide please the first two into tier two you in the second two into two three same with uh evaluation criteria with regard to the lower two they were ranked relatively low and moving them to tier three but the evaluation score actually kept the other two uh RNG and Industrial renewable hydrogen it has high priority next slide please when we looked at Federal funding that would be available all of them uh had Federal funding that would be available so that didn't result in making us make any recommendations about whether or not they should shift in terms of tiers and then finally risk and we looked at again the two two of the lowest ranking risk and uncertainty ones with the highest risk and uncertainty because we just don't know either the technology is not there we're uncertain how it's actually going to get done moving the those two actions unique actions the hybrid scenario from tier two into tier three so the summary of all of that analysis next slide please is again this chart of what's into your one two and three again the green actions are highlighted tier one are in green they're highlighted here in green insert two with blue and tier three is white this reflects the movement of the recommendations of the other analysis of the RNG and the industrial renewable hydrogen into tier two so making them go from green to blue and the renewable hydrogen injection 15 by 2035 and home fuel cells five percent by 2030 shifting them from Blue to White from tier 2 to tier three uh finally the there the um categories are there to the left again 14 of 25 are Energy Efficiency six Transportation three hydrogen and one RNG and one waste and then finally last two slides again there's quite a few of that do not have uh existing delivery Pathways or their mechanism for delivery or technology is uncertain um and so they need to they Merit more uh study before we can develop action implementation plans uh so we wanted to pull those out and make sure that we understood of course that would take more uh staff time to be able to do that so it's linked to the recommendation that you'll see about increasing organic Staffing I don't know how these would get more fleshed out in a timely fashion without that without that Staffing pushing it on a lot of these and again the ones that are unique to the hybrid scenario are bolded and in the italics the two uh that are in here they both need more analysis and study and how how to get them to be able to be create an action implementation plan and then there's some in tier three next slide please in fact uh the the two are in are in two three and they need more and more analysis as well before they can be fully implemented and then my final last slide uh is that many of you know that uh there was the legislature put together a resilient and efficient building task force the rebuilding task force they came up with their recommendations last month and and their recommend these are their recommendations that they had and you could see how much support they had their rank ordered in terms of the support level but let's let's uh important here is that uh their recommendations are wholly consistent with the recommendations that we're making in in the Tigger process that they emphasize uh promoting and incentivizing Energy Efficiency and heat pumps so does the actions that we have and that they improve codes and that is a high priority um action our part as well so our recommendations are consistent with what this group just came up with and forward is the legislature so there's no and that's the end of our presentation sure thank you Alan um any questions for Alan and and or comments on how we follow-up comments on how we think about all of this information as we worked to finish the roadmap oh I'm sorry one more thing sure so in the I didn't put a slide in there but in the end as I started I don't want to bury the lead so I started with with the recommendation the recommendation is that all the the tiering uh that we came up with for the electrification scenario would all move forward in those tiers and the four unique hybrid would also move forward uh but in in in their respective tiers as recommended in tiers two and tier three so all of the all of the recommendations all 31 of them would be moved forward towards um towards trying to figure them out and Implement them better so Alan um maybe just to interpret one of the things that now the commission has discussed is whether or not we wanted to pick one or the other scenario that we modeled um or if we should you know move all the actions forward in one form or fashion and so that's what um Alan is referring to is that the staff is recommending that we move all of the actions that we identified forward either you know something that needs more study or you know a high tier one two or three um priority um so that's one question is you know are we comfortable moving all of those actions forward and then and then secondly you know power are we feeling about how we would be describing the benefits of the actions and uh putting them in tears so any comments on either The Proposal from staff to move all the actions forward or comments on further reflection on how the the scoring worked yeah just one further comment on that so originally we thought that when we would do this analysis that the hybrid and the electrification scenario would be significantly different in fact the hybrid was actually initially called alternative fuel scenario but when we found was there wasn't enough an alternative fuels to actually create a scenario unto itself so we had to borrow a lot of the actions from the electrification to actually meet the goal in the hybrid scenario so there there was that big overlap between the two the",

        "text": " true um those grants are highly competitive The Residency grants uh national competition as you know there were seven to ten Across the Nation so you know one of the strategies that we took you know when we looked at what's eligible for funding under these the resiliency grants and things that we're talking about undergrounding of uh electrical lines and some of these other things are very expensive we put those into a large National Grant award because it we just can't do much for the states on so we're going to get you know exposure to limited dollars if you have 10 million a year um well I think we can do microgrids for emergency resilience centers and and critical equipment and stuff like that with with the funds um so that that's the strategy we're taking that you know what can we do with the state funds and make an impact versus what could we do with the federal funds that make an impact so um you know that's probably what we're going to submit uh for this event that some of our like I said the larger prior qualifier protection things we're doing on a national Grant um so I would like that to be considered you know we're going to review these applications yeah that's um thanks for that comment and yesterday we heard yeah we had a lot of discussion about um focusing in on critical facilities and that being one of the primary Community benefits that you can flow through this program and so um ensuring backup power to those facilities to certainly get a score of the community benefits points that we could talk about yesterday so um we were in The Narrative we adopted as much of the broad Federal language as we could to keep all options open so I would say it it this is the what we hear from folks that we would like to make this uh microbrews especially for you know battery backup and critical facilities part of the program but that's definitely on the table that would be perfectly allowable use of bugs we have one question uh from Thomas elzinga about when usdue is going to respond to Odo about the expanded eligibility criteria I wonder if Emily could jump in on that question because I'm not sure if she may not be maybe just waiting sure yeah like if you if you can hear me yes okay perfect um we're we're anticipating and I say anticipating uh Loosely receiving some feedback hopefully you know by the end of the summer um the U.S department of energy has a little bit of a different timeline and some other things going on that things have been moving a little bit slowly with them it feels like so um that's our hope but we we really don't have any promises from them in terms of exact thank you Emily and Thomas I see you you raised your hand would you like to come up uh off mute and lay in on that can you hear me okay yes thank you great awesome thank you very much I appreciate that thanks for this opportunity to to to to discuss everything yeah so I uh uh uh just like uh some of the other previous comments that have been made in regards to the kind of the national um this National opportunity announcement that came out I know that we had tried to participate with some some other larger utilities on some stuff but but we didn't quite meet I guess what what are some of their some of their thresholds for for uh for some of our projects and I guess I just I just want to understand I mean there there's a lot of great things on here we're we're trying to do a lot of these things that are on this on these eligible activities list but I guess I guess I just really want to understand and I know some of the the details are still in discussion or at least up with USD usdoe for review as well but trying to understand that threshold from from like yes this is going to go and no this is not um and and I kind of saw that that kind of objective list and it sounds like that so that stuff's still getting you know decided or still in discussion but I just really want to understand a little bit more or maybe there isn't anything more now but just really what's what's that threshold that's going to push us over for some of these things because I feel like we're almost right there but maybe we are over the the the Oregon you know doe uh threshold but maybe not the federal I don't know okay can you hear us now okay great we're back on okay okay I don't know that was missed but um yeah just that um Thomas that that's a good kind of precursor into the next this meeting where we're going to talk about the criteria for this program for selecting um right now it's it's a blank slate and we're hoping to get input from all of our stakeholders on how we should select these projects and that oh no for this program will manage all of the federal requirements internally and when we get to the point of the competitive review and the final negotiation of a contract with an awardee we're going to try to make all those Federal requirements as easy as possible for both thank you does that answer the question yeah can we take Thomas off mute again yes thank you can you hear me again okay okay uh yeah no Rob that that actually does answer quite a bit maybe just one one little follow-up question this is a point of clarification um uh so so basically if I understand correctly the we will the I guess we will be submitting projects you guys uh Oda will will manage you know meeting all the federal requirements and then it still is a competitive Grant afterwards to see to make to see if the state net or everyone under the state uh uh Grant is going to be able to or are going to be able to apply and get that is that correct so there's still like a competitive nature to this still yet even though we might be accepted into the state deal yeah we will have all the complete competitive review at Ono and so the state will manage the selection of projects and everything that we select in that review will automatically qualify for the federal requirements if we do our job perfect thank you thank you Thomas we had one uh one question from Martina with renewable hydrogen Alliance um can you elaborate on whether fuel cells fuel cell systems count as new generation under eligible measures you know I was thinking of that question when I heard that she was on the line and I was thinking to myself would hydrogen qualify as a storage technology or a generation technology and I don't have an answer to that but we can dig into the regulations on all closely and see if there's a an opening there yeah so I think we should dig into it but my record from one this came up before was that it depends on how the project is designed like if the hydrogen is being used in the project as stores you kind of have to document the purpose of it but we can um I think we should double check and get back to you too yeah thank you for that Martino are there any other questions from anyone participating virtually or anybody in the room Andy collector columbia-based from live cricket small utility these are when you have listed theirs is everything we struggle with um from a from a cost perspective we have limited funding as everybody has I'm not going to say that people don't have that but but every little bit for these projects um the downside that we have is we have 1300 miles of line uh with 2 700 members in 4 000 meters um so do you do the math on that we're very low density or kind it's low operation so the community benefit of that side of it is is somewhat limited when you when you start talking about hundreds of thousands of people versus 10 people um and that makes it even more difficult because the cost benefit from our perspective is it's it's pretty hard to put in you know 10 miles of underground four and hitting 15 houses along that way and make it to where it's a project that we would end up doing but these funds would be perfect along those lines yeah that um we heard a similar we had a similar discussion yesterday about whether or not the number of people served was a good criteria in the program and then if it's decided that that is a good criteria that it should be also balanced with vulnerability within a system so that it's not writing all the projects to higher population um you know service territories so it's going to be one of the challenges to balance that in the criteria so you can help us through that I don't know question and I'll just base it on a percentage of cost to Consumer at the end if they had to pay for the project in their race you know the allocation is based on that and the rate case or whenever you have to pass a long call so if you got 4 000 customers in your entire system anything that you do is going to impact the customers a lot more than a higher density populated area you know that's a really good point yeah that could help the smaller sparsely populated service territory maybe rise but the other consideration is too is that you can't make it so that you got one guy that's going to get the benefit of the service enhancement you know and then you know because that doesn't make any sense so it's going to have to be uh you know thrown out at that consideration in my opinion because it's a do you certain well one one yeah good points as long as it's not a business customer that's the other aspect too you know some of the desired here though that we like building more room some potential constraints to growth so those communities and future Vitality in this community and then you would make any potentially being more so into the deaf criteria proposition for them doesn't even know I mean just like thinking yeah so you have the Administration I mean that's just yeah you know I mean we see so many communities that are you know their low population that they're absolutely constrained because they don't get the investment that they made in order to be able to do and I especially to see the amounts of the young people in this community so you don't even have obviously based on see Peter Potter it comes into play where you have too much of a matrix right to try to absorb you know so if you're looking at plan growth or anything then you have to start looking at the open Urban growth District or the you know land use commission plans or whatever and then you're starting that okay well how long a process do you want needs to be a simplified template you know",

        "text": " in Boardman May 30th we had that public hearing where Wagon Trail gave um comment and I believe they actually did touch on this subject so I feel like it is in the record and that we should be able to to speak to it um just from a procedural standpoint um even though this issue could not have been raised At All by the public or by the applicant in under your review it is still under your authority to review this question if nobody had brought it up and you still had a concern about this and this is why going back to the other slide that chase had shown here's all the standards that we're not going to talk about because nobody brought up comments on these you still within your review of the draft proposed order you have the authority to review everything and anything that you want to review so regardless of whether those were brought up or not now it certainly helps because it identifies what are the major kind of issues or concerns that are raised by people um that's typically the driver for us to bring these up to you but Chase even sort of said there are some things some standards we're going to talk about that weren't based on comments so I just want to make sure that sort of the kind of the scope of the council's review is really everything you you have the authority to review everything uh even if it's not brought up by anybody else thank you berer um on this particular issue the exception as we get larger solar facilities being proposed on agricultural and um I think just being mindful of our findings and know that once the council issues a certificate with certain conditions accept certain evidence that kind of becomes the Touchstone for other developers so I know I get hung up on precedent but it's a thing and um just trying to make sure that how we articulate our findings and what kind of evidence we rely on to make those findings will be pretty important especially when we have no real specific guidance in our administrative rules or our standards so it's just something that we as Council have to be paying attention to and how that information is put afraid for us just is is a a big deal because I think this will become a bigger deal thank you thank you very much yeah and just for clarity in at the public um I believe the applicant just reiterated what was already provided on the record in exhibit K like the the agricultural mitigation fund and how they got there and like the dollar amounts and where it was going and specifically to the Morrow County grain Growers um and Oregon State's agricultural research program so I thought that that was like it was a summary of what they had already provided um well we will um continue to evaluate the conditions um proposed by the applicant and their analysis provided by their thirdparty consultant to determine if there are any information gaps or uh additional conditions that should be imposed to ensure that this reason can be realized during implementation um so I guess with that and with your feedback there may be um changes to goal three portion um in the proposed order than yeah um please Mr MCB Walker I had to if we go back to the um locational dependence sure uh factor and I know with the the West End there were no transmission new transmission lines required if I recall um and that but we did have an agreement that um we required on that to um help make the case of local dependent locational dependency being one of the four reasons and so that's the same situation here no new transmission lines really required to connect into or is it here um for the wagon trail facility there would be 0.6 miles of 230 KV right but that would then um connect with the Ridge um an existing Blue Ridge substation yeah which is in the southern yeah so oh on that map it's right in the center uh so there's that big blue rectangle that's a that's the Battery Center but the dark blue is the Blue substation and going laterally to the left is the approximate half mile transmission line that would be that's being proposed okay and so we'd kind of do the same condition of approval for an interconnection agreement okay great thank you yes and there is an existing Umatilla electric line that that runs north south and on this figure it's in the middle of the in the middle of the the figure itself um the blue line that bombing yeah it I mean well yeah that is bombing range Road yes yeah correct okay I think we can go back to the standards portion unless there's other um questions comments instruction for land use in three okay Mr chairman can I get a clarification yeah councelor delin in terms of that we may be addressing more in the draft um now all we're doing today is a review and how does that mean we would re we would review adequacy of the justification that we have in the draft order for the goal three exception based on the moral concern and obviously taking into consideration the applicant's response the reason I'm asking is because that would imply that there's some perhaps not significant but some change to the draft order so in the next committee would we be uh making a decision to approve or not approve the draft order or would be we be reviewing it again yeah so for record secretary cornette um council member delin and really just everybody kind of as a sort of a procedural Point can you go back to the uh procedural slide yeah that one so where we're at now is the draft proposed order so I always like to say it in this way is this is staff's document it is staff's first recommendation we've evaluated the application and made our findings of fact conclusions of law conditions of approval based on the information that's in the record the complete application that allowed for then a review you by the public and the the applicant and the ability to comment on the record um Public's commented the applicants commented and responded um Council commented at the last council meeting you know and this this stage is this is your review in terms of okay you've looked at the draft proposed order you've listened or read the comments um basically this is your opportunity to tell us do you think we got it right or do you think there's more changes that need to be made and that's your ability you know through this conversation either today or if you want to extend it out into another council meeting of do you think we should look at things a little bit differently should we look at our findings should we look at our conditions and based on what we hear from you and also looking at all the comments that we've received on the record then we issue the proposed order so again that is still staff's document that is staff's second recommendation of whether or not we believe the applicant has met their burden of proof and meets all the standards or not and then it goes into an automatic contested case if there are any party or any persons who commented and you know request to participate the hearing officer will determine you know whether they have met the burden to part participate or not they will hold a contested case hearing and then ultimately it's that final order so the reason why is you know Council can make changes at the final order stage the reason why we want to go through this you know very carefully with you is ultimately it's your decision but not now it's later but we don't want to sort of just push through and then have a final order in front of you and then later on you're like well we don't agree with that you know we thought you should have made all these different changes that's why we're seeking your input you know today on this to see you know where you either believe things are fine or things need to be amended so that's again why I want to make sure that you have enough time based upon either the issues that have been raised or your own review of the draft proposed order whether you believe we've got it right or based upon your review and your review of the comment the changes that need to be made so I don't know uh council member Devin does does that help uh yes it does um okay and I think but one clarification in that sense there may be other issues that come up but it appears their primary issue of discussion right now is uh the goal three exception and whether or not there is more consideration that should be taken of the Morrow County comments or just in an independent fashion whether the commission or council is satisfied with the justifications for the goal three exception so when the when the staff goes back and reviews that which appears to be the direction they may be receiving from the council the council in the next stage of this obviously will have a chance to review any modifications that are made to the order based on that review and at that time they could probably either ask for more time or um or make a decision that that you know what is being provided is adequate or it's it in the council's view it's inadequate you know I feel a little bit of there's been some previous discussion in the council about um goal three exceptions and even though president is not as big a factor as might be in some areas uh I feel like kind of a necess necessity to hopefully get it right this um so I guess what I'm basically saying is you'll go back you'll review what's been the the order itself based on all the council comments but there has been a lot of concern expressed or at least issues expressed around goal three we'll get a chance to review that when it comes back uh we can either accept that delay it or um or or or or rejected at time as an adequate justification so I just want to make sure I'm clear I I'm totally understanding what you're saying your ability to review this again won't be until the final order um so while we have this open right now while the council is reviewing the draft proposed order you can conclude that today you can say we still want to have a little more time to think about it and we'll put it on the next Council agenda but you need to be comfortable with your review of the draft proposed order and then specifically you know I agree this seems to be the most significant issue so you have to be comfortable whether you've had enough time to review think about it you know see what's currently written you know what staff's recommendation is in the draft proposed order whether you agree with that or based upon the comments and your own analysis you think some changes need to be made so that's why I want to make sure you know we can take",

        "text": " of what the South Salem Transit Center needs are I think that we would work with the provider that we have in place at that time to to get the right services and coverage from security in place thank you yes you're welcome manager Garcia Could you um maybe talk me through PPC as a as an organization I I saw as I was reading about them a little bit they offer a whole variety of Security Services they're you know as a regional security provider they're fairly large they offer a lot of services I did not see any instance of them working with Transit districts necessarily and I just want to state that you know what we expect of our security officers is a little bit different than what a security officer for a different organization might operate and I just want to make sure that PPC is equipped to hit the ground running right from the get-go I think that's a great Point president um we actually were excited to see in their references that they did have a number of Transit districts that they do work with they're primarily in Washington they do not work to my knowledge with any Transit districts in the state of Oregon but they work quite a bit with Sound Transit they also support the transit district and Fairbanks Alaska and a couple other places in Washington state and so they did have quite a bit of Transit experience and I'm glad that you spoke to the fact that our security services are different than just posting a security guard we're heavy into customer service so if you look through the scope of work and the role of those officers it's it's a 50 50 responsibility customer service and providing support to our employees and to the ridership as well as the ordinance enforcement and law enforcement liaison piece so they do have a dual role and it is very unique as compared to what other security locations might need great thank you for addressing that could you I didn't see this in the memo but out of curiosity um what is what's the cost difference between this contract if we were to approve it today versus our existing contract that we made years ago with so the existing contract was a five-year contract we had three base years with two one-year options and we exercised both of those at the beginning of that five-year contract we did not have any of the extended services we were on Monday through Friday service so you know to take the total of that five-year contract and divide it by five would not be a fair representation of what actually occurred over that five-year period The Five-Year total contract was just over 2.1 million um but the wages obviously and billing rates have changed significantly because that contract was negotiated in 2017. I think people that are working fast food are making comparable to what our security officers are making to be honest with you and that's presented some recruitment problems for the current contractor so of course the wage has gone up and we're expanding the hours we have many more hours of service additionally right now our supervisor is part of the Staffing so trying to be a supervisor be a responder to be doing all the duties of a security officer and supporting the officer at the Kaiser Transit Center it's a big task as we expand to seven days a week and later weeknights so we have separated out the supervisor role this time so that they can focus on making sure that that team is providing the highest level of service to our internal and external stakeholders so there is a difference if you look at the five years with Allied versus what we're doing doing seven years with PPC but you can't compare the numbers because there are so many differing factors the number of hours per week of service is significantly higher than what it was when we first contracted with Allied I hope I answered your questions you did thank you yes given the increasing rates and increase in expectations you know service hours and certainly service area coverage more Transit centers coming online a similar question that I posted Deputy general manager I'll ask to you which is um what is your thinking of bringing Security Services in-house my impression in North America that is rare for Transit agencies typically contract that out okay is is my assumption correct what what are you what's your thinking of like okay at perhaps at the end of this contract we're now we've reached a Tipping Point where you know what we're going to have chariots employees I guess I would respond by saying there's pros and cons to doing it both ways I think that there's probably and I haven't crunched all the numbers but if you look at a fully burdened rate of a chariots employee there's going to be additional cost to the district we would also have to stand up pretty substantial training program that we don't have in place now work with the Department of Public Safety standards and training to certify those officers our contractors do that for us now I know that Lane Transit District made the transition from contract staff and brought their security staff in a few years ago and just in my communications with them they've definitely had some bumps in the road doing that I think that they are at a place now where they've been able to fully transition and I think they're doing okay not to speak for them but it took them a few years and especially doing this like right during a pandemic I'm sure that they experienced even more challenges than what would typically occur but there are pros and cons I think as a district as our needs change it's something that we should evaluate to see if that would be the right decision for the district but I think right now the best decision for us is to continue with the contracted because of the the cost and the amount of training and infrastructure that we would have to put in place to bring it in-house right thank you I have two final questions um the first is are we with this new contract are we expecting the security officers to have Crisis Intervention training we did add some additional training about mental health awareness Dei I don't have the list in front of me um we we did some with crises intervention I would have to look at the whole list but we did expand to reflect some of the needs in our community the training that we wanted these officers to be able to have as tools and their tool belt when they're interacting with the public great thank you thank you and I forgotten my second question director Duncan well I had two but you asked my first one so good job my second one is not really a question I guess it's more of just an encouragement which is that I've heard from some I've heard from constituents say that they've tried to convince their friends or relatives to take the bus and their security concerns so I would love to maybe see a strategic effort with marketing to kind of talk about how we're going to have periodic non-law enforcement but security officials on the buses I think that that would go a long way for individuals who may not have ever taken the bus and do not experience it on a day-to-day basis and think of it maybe it's a scarier thing than it is this might do a lot to kind of assuage their concerns and I think that could be a kind of an added bonus we maybe didn't originally uh think of but I'd love to see more people feel a little bit more confident taking the bus and this could do a lot for that so thank you for coming up with some new solutions for that and I appreciate it you're welcome thank you very much uh is there a motion who would like to make a motion no is there emotional motion motion me I moved the board to authorize the general manager to enter into a contract with PPC Solutions Incorporated for the delivery of Transit Security Services and approve a project budget total not to exceed 11 not to exceed 11 million dollars over four base years with three one-year option years is there a second I'll second we have a motion and a second all those in favor please say aye aye aye all right any opposed see no opposition motion passes unanimously thank you very much manager our next agenda item is for an adoption of a new resolution great I'll ask Denise LaRue our CFO to present the good evening president Davidson and members of the board at the March 23 2023 work session I presented and the board discussed a new proposed travel policy there were several recommendations which one having both the general manager and the Chief Financial Officer approve the travel authorization and reimbursement two clarifying the personal usage of mileage and or rewards points and three contacting the general manager when changes in travel are necessary due to unforeseen circumstances at no fault of the director these modifications have been made are there any further questions regarding the policy any questions for CFO LaRue director holmstrom I just like to thank you for making the little tweaks we asked for me back thank you other questions or come I would now invite the emotion I move the board adopt resolution number 2023-03 as shown in attachment a which provides guidance for authorization and reimbursement for board of directors travel on behalf of Salem area mass transit district is there a second all right a clerk of the board pressie decide who got that second we have a motion in a second all those in favor please or is there any okay no discussion all those in favor please say aye aye any opposed with no opposition motion passes unanimously we'll go ahead and proceed to General Manager report thank you I do have a few items to report just uh first just for Clarity on the bus design Graphics of the electric bus is it stands now the back third of the bus windows are covered not the full bus uh my my assumption is that probably the rear door is the brake but I will verify that in my weekly report okay you do have in front of you uh you've been provided your information notes for the month of April so so there for your use in your public Outreach as you heard earlier we did return last night from the APTA Mobility conference that conference is really operationally focused and so in addition to that I was also attending the executive committee meeting as well as several committee meetings over the weekend then the conference started Sunday evening in addition to lots of sessions on zero emission buses and uh there was also a heavy focus on some issues we talked about earlier tonight security issues and Facilities on buses homelessness issues and how societal issues come into the transit space as well as mental health issues so this is a area of Ephesus in transit agencies throughout the country at differing levels of impact so I learned a lot",

        "text": " local Washington County based U Builder developer um in residential construction um the company's been aware of the North Plains the expansion discussions and we' followed along to some degree over the over the years here as we often do when land use and development activities are taking place in the region we've never built or developed in North plains we don't have any current contracts options or active negotiations in North plains or the proposed expansion area despite these facts it's possible that my company could in the future the company I work for I should say um could in the future um end up building or developing something in North plains in this area um but since we don't have any active or current um contracts or any current um true conflicts of interests I I do intend to continue to participate in votes and discussions um but I did want to disclose that just have it on the record thank you did you want to make a comment Mr bouette uh no I just appreciate that on the record um that's perfect I have no no comment on it thanks thank you is I'm not sure if you wanted to ask a question commissioner podar was your hand just left up yes but I also now have a uh comment about um commissioner Free's uh if there is potential for conflict um even in the future direct conflict in the future because if the company if the company that they work for would um sign up for uh paid for a contract sign up for a contract I think that's a direct conflict of interest so that could happen with any one of us and so how do we um deal with an issue like this considering if I could take that chair yes please so this is actually not a direct conflict with um the commissioner described for the record what is uh what is called Under Oregon law a potential conflict of interest he would had uh he would have had a direct conflict of interest if there was some level of certainty that his company um would have benefited financially or avoided financial detriment um by for example constructing housing in North plains but at this point uh it's theoretical um and so what he did and placed on the record was in my opinion precisely what he needed to put on the record um the difference between an actual and a potential conflict of interests is with an actual conflict of interests which is a direct conflict of interest um he wouldn't be able to vote um with a potential conflict of interest a theoretical conflict that may or may not ever arise he he just needs to disclose it on the record and then he can proceed to deliberate vote and that's what he's perfect thank you Mr B that's what I wanted to hear thank you so that Community gets to hear what is a conflict of interest direct and potential thank you so your hand is still up lock I'm waiting after you speak to make the motion so I've left my hand up thank you all right well then I'll go ahead okay uh commissioner fry um in chair Lockwood if if uh I just have a question um and I don't know if you'd like me to save that question for later or ask it now um regarding um our deliberation process here I'm happy to wait if you want to get your statement out yeah what why don't I go ahead thank you all right um with the Indulgence of my colleagues I wanted to talk about the um the four options that we have in front of us and um Express a couple of concerns that I have so um we're here to make a decision make a choice among these four choices um option three is um continuing deliberations until a date certain prior to the North Plains referendum so that one um we would be wanting to meet again and deliberate uh before the vote in um North Plains um that one I feel like we've had this is our third meeting of deliberations and we've had lots of questions lots of testimony um I kind of think that's the least attractive of these options is to meet again sometime before the um before the referendum so that one I kind of put aside and um I'd like to talk about the other three more or less in a grp group um and express my my two concerns that I have um the first one is um if we make a recommendation now um we're we're kind of out of sequence in the process um the process as I understand it is that North Plains um develops an ordinance based on participation by their staff and their Planning Commission and their city council and they've done that they have their ordinance for this um proposed expansion and then at that point it comes to the county and again there's a process where staff develops an ordinance it comes to the Planning Commission it comes to the um Board of Commissioners and then it at that point it would move on to the state so there's this orderly stair step process that goes on um but that process has been interrupted by the North Plains referendum and um so at this point I feel like for us to express uh one way or another about this ordinance and this proposal we're we're we're kind of out of out of sequence we we have to my comfort level would be for North Plains referendum to be decided and then we if if if it if the um expansion is approved by the voters of North Plains we'd be reverting to our normal stair step and then uh would be appropriate time for the Planning Commission to make a recommendation so that's my first concern um my second concern um relates to the role of the Planning Commission and M Mell has talked about that uh this afternoon we do two things one is we um make determinations about quasi judicial plan amendments and there have been a couple of those this year um the other thing we do is we advise the Board of Commissioners well right now the Board of Commissioners is uh continuing this matter uh they're not going to be taking it up until after the referendum so raises a question in my mind if we make a recommendation who are we advising if we make a recommendation at this time and it seems in that case in effect practically speaking we'd be making a recommendation to the voters of North Plains uh we don't make recommendations to the citizens of Washington County we we advise the board again so that that that's my second concern is that uh it seems appropriate to me no matter what I feel about this proposal um to let the voters decide it's their time to um weigh this proposal to consider the merits and uh their right to decide if that's what they want for their City so um what am I uh that I guess I'm suggesting we make no recommendation today and I'll open this up to um comments I'm not I think commissioner podar was first and then commissioner fry oh and then commissioner millerman thank you chair lwood I would like to make a motion considering uh the presentation that we received today and your words chair Lockwood um we are an advisory committee to the Board of Commissioners however we are Community Representatives um with that in mind I would like to uh put a uh put forward a motion that the Planning Commission continue deliberations on ordinance number 899 to June 26th 2024 thank you commissioner is there a second um pardon me chair Mr Mr boette go ahead I just noticed a m I'm hoping the commissioner P will accept a minor friendly Amendment because I just noticed a technical defect under uh section seven of our rules we actually have to not only uh have a date certain but a Time certain so really that should say June 26 2024 at 6:30 pm. because that's when that meeting will be held is that is that acceptable perfect I will make the motion again considering that we are are an advisory committee to the Board of Commissioners but we are a community uh representative board I would like to move uh make a motion that the Planning Commission continue deliberations on ordinance number 899 to June 26 2024 at 6:30 p.m. after the May 21 2024 primary elections thank you we have a motion to continue deliberations till June 26 2024 is there a second and those who have their hands up I'm not sure if your hand is up to second or I'll second Rachel Mor beu okay thank you commissioner Mory beu it's been moved and seconded that we continue deliberations till June discussion commissioner fry did you want to comment on um commissioner milman was actually ahead of me if she raised her hand I can wait for her commissioner mman thank you chair Lockwood and commissioner fry actually I have I have two things uh the first one is on the the role of the Planning Commission um I've I've heard a lot of folks say things that sound like well they followed the policy they followed the laws and I I I'm sure that they did and I do think that there's folks that verify that I don't I don't think that's my role I don't think I'm qualified to say whether they followed all the rules and ordinances I think I think my role is to make a recommendation based on what I hear from the community so that's what I intend to do unless someone thinks my role is different or I'm wildly incorrect on that um so that was the first thing and then um the second is I am concerned about the time I under I understand we don't want to come talk about this every two weeks and have a presentation what I'm concerned about is that the ballot measure falls through somehow between now and May and it goes to the board of commission without planning commission's opportunity to have their voice in deliberation and so I'm not sure how to solve that I'm inclined to recommend option three so we just roll this meeting forward but I think it's got its it certainly got its drawbacks so I guess the question to staff maybe question to uh legal is there a scenario where the ballot measure doesn't happen and the Planning Commission or the board of commissions gets this again before the Planning Commission does so the Board of Commissioners continued their hearing to July 16th 2024 if the board would like to hear the matter sooner than that so let's say that scenario that you're outlining does happen we decide that you know there is a legal challenge the ballot measur is not going to happen the Board of Commissioners could make a decision to bring that forward we would have to Ren notice the Board of Commissioners hearing and go through that process of letting the community know it's back on the board's agenda this is going to be the date if that were to happen staff would also bring that",

        "text": " a mile you're putting in another housing Village in putting these these two sites together so where's the geographic distribution um I also want to talk about Community engagement you know it was very sad for me to see as a Washington County employee to see the lack of communication from the county to the residents of aloha we found out about this through Word of Mouth Facebook next door there was no engagement from Washington County until we heard about the the NIMBY meeting that the church was holding um earlier this month so we decided we were all going to show up there in force and make our voices heard um the other thing I'd like to to bring up is I I've read through the governor's emergency declaration as well as the attached executive orders nowhere in there does it state that it supersedes local ordinances or zoning laws this air this church is zoned institutional which strictly prohibits the placement of manufactured residences on their property how are we going to skirt that uh let's see here I think everything else has been said so I appreciate your time thank you very all right next we have Jen Han and Alex eugenic okay uh Zach Hughes is it oh Jeff yeah I apologize hello my name is Alex pacenik and I live just around the corner from uh Aloha Methodist Church there's not a whole lot that I can add uh to uh what's already been said but with respect to this side being inappropriate I would just like to point out that there's no sidewalks immediately next to it all down 198 there's almost no sidewalks down 195th if you look at the map there's no sidewalks most of the people that will probably be living will most likely be walking so they will be walking either to the mall on Baseline and 185th or the mall on uh TV Highway and 185th they will be walking down Johnson no sidewalks down 187th no sidewalks and down 198 so there's going to be a major safety issue with respect to cars and pedestrians it's probably going to be like 50 of them or so um also like it's been said before there's no buffer between the pods and people's front yards and backyards how is that appropriate and it's not fair to our neighborhood to to house such a large proportion of the Washington County's uh homeless population also I'm a parent I have an 11 year old daughter she takes the bus home from school and she takes the bus to school how are we going to just let this 11 year old girl stand on the corner while we're getting ready for work uh when there's you know a 30 to 50 drug addicts and who knows who because you're not doing background checks walking right down 195th to one of those malls with outside walks thank you that's all I have my name is Jeff honey I live maybe three four hundred feet from where this is across the street from the Aloha Methodist Church and in all honesty I'm just feeling railroaded the only way I found out about this was I'm on my way my way home from church and I see a protest there I feel like whoever is in charge of making these decisions that affect our community has had absolutely zero consideration for the people who work hard to live in this neighborhood who go to work every single day to pay mortgages to live in this neighborhood we my wife and I have been scrambling to try to comb the internet to try to find out what is even going on and the things that we read are that these pods don't affect crime in the area that they don't affect property values that they're going to have continual somebody there 24 7 but for the last several years we've been watching a homeless camp on the corner of Baseline and 197th the police are there every single day they brought porta potties in they brought garbage cans in and the property was destroyed they had to bring in Hazmat Crews to clean up the garbage and the needles and the trash that was there I don't understand how whoever's in charge of this can say that we're going to have one person on staff that's going to make sure that this doesn't happen on a much larger scale not to mention those people who don't fit inside this community there's 30 spots right where are the others that want to be in these spots going to go they're going to be camped in front of my house they're going to be camped in front of all of our houses because there's only 30 spots so I am strongly opposed to this it is not the right place a neighborhood is not the right place for this thank you before you call it the next two people up time check half hours with the board agreed what yes so the half hour will expire at 7 18 p.m so we've got about seven minutes yeah about seven minutes how many people who are left uh so we just have Zach Hughes as the last person that signed up in the room and then we'll move to online is there any other members in the auditorium that I missed that wants to provide comment on this item okay so Mr Hughes will be the last in-person one okay good evening I'm Zach Hughes I live around the corner from the church my background in construction management has given me a wealth of experience in Contracting and collecting proposals so far the County's action on this has left me some questions into how we're going about the Contracting and proposal process there's been a lot of talks about a good neighbor agreement that has yet to been established with the neighbors I think it's a critical flaw to proceed in Contracting And discussing with operators plans for this safe rest Village without that portion of the scope being defined the county will not get accurate nor wholesome bidding and replies to their proposals without this in place secondly a failure to have developed a site plan for this Village makes me nervous as a neighbor I don't want to see this look like the camp next to Winco in Hillsboro it's a temporary chain link fence with cut open tarps I also have concerns about the infrastructure that's available to actually run this camp for those of you who don't know what the church looks like it is not a set of a grounds that has been maintained I have concerns that it's gonna well full undertaking infrastructure wise to provide electricity Water and Sewer to the camp and all these items according to what I've read our infrastructure Improvement to the grounds not for a safe rest Village which would mean they are outside the bounds of HB 2006 and should need to go through the proper probating process voting yes to approve the acquisition of these pods prior to these items being fully vetted is in my opinion irresponsible thank you we have people online uh so would any members watching this meeting via Zoom like to provide public comment for up to a minute 45 on this Aloha Methodist Church did you please raise your hands so the first one raised here is Rose Medlock Rose can you hear us yes can you hear me yes we can please go ahead for a minute 45. thank you my name is Rose Medlock I live just a few blocks from the Aloha United Methodist Church every resident from the neighborhood surrounding the church I've heard from support solving the homeless crisis and empathizes with people affected by it at the same time the church's property objectively is a poor location for a pod site to house the homeless from the fact that development must occur to us residents strongly opposing the project there multiple things can be true at the same time the county including by a County Employees own admission during a recent meeting about this site has done a bad job of communicating with residents and could have avoided such difficulties by selecting a more appropriate location for the Pod none of the information or studies that the county has shared on other pod Villages provide any reassurance that our neighborhood will not be negatively impacted they are not one-to-one comparisons we all know that pod villages to house homeless guaranteed disruption in the form of increased crime noise and social impact its disingen news to pretend otherwise we residents are legitimately concerned for the safety of current residents including children and seniors who are among the most vulnerable and for the hard work we've all put in to be able to afford to live in a quiet safe Suburban single-family home neighborhood I encourage the county to find a location that will better serve the needs of homeless individuals and to avoid doing this work in a vacuum housing is only one piece of the puzzle to actually solve the houseless crisis but there are other necessary services to provide that a single-family home neighborhood does not offer thank you next we have Maya Maya can you hear us hello can you hear me yes we can please go ahead for a minute 45. hi thank you I live right around the corner from the proposed Village and when I heard about this I decided to go and visit a few of the Pod villages in Portland and the one here in the county that is currently up and running during the day I saw shopping carts surrounding the properties people loitering and makeshift tents I was yelled at by one pod resident at the one on the TV Village simply for looking at the site from a distance I'm now concerned about the experience people here in Aloha are likely to have furthermore if the proposed ordinance for regulation of public property with respect to camps and camping passes will be surrounded by RVs and encampments within 500 feet from the village there's already been two meetings with one more scheduled about this ordinance my concerns include the safety of myself my neighbors as well as property values and there's no shame in wanting to make sure that the invested investment I worked hard to achieve isn't negatively impacted especially by something that does not have to happen at this location the other pod Villages are in commercial areas from Perimeter perimeters from neighborhoods not in the middle of a neighborhood a quiet family neighborhood is not the location or a village also as many have stated there's a bus stop a school bus stop nearby just at the corner there and many of the other residents have very well mentions or concerns which are the same concerns I have thank you Mr chair that concludes our half hour for this topic thank you very much thank you all for attending it uh I would encourage you to stick around and hear what we might say uh in just a few all right if you're following Along on our agenda we're going to go to our proclamations next the",

        "text": " change but um i think if the the comment is that's not not feasible i think that's definitely something that we should we should hear i i would say it's it's a bit infeasible and if if you're trying to protect predict the future my experience is that you're usually wrong so um and then on the site boundary it seems like it analysis the analysis should be contained within your site boundary yeah i think that's definitely consistent um with how a lot of our analysis does work um and i don't know if anybody on the call might have ideas about how you know risks to assets near a place where a fire might start would be considered in the analysis of you know because obviously i don't think an energy facility would be starting a fire outside of its boundary but um there you know could be some spillover effects so i think that's what we were thinking there um but i also understand that that might be beyond what is was necessary perhaps thank you yeah thank you thank you great any other thoughts on um how we should or or should not be yeah or i guess i guess how how we should consider impacts to those resources so i guess both you know changes to a facility over um or you know impacts related to wildfire from a facility that may occur outside of the site boundary i don't know if anybody has any other thoughts related to any of those issues all right jim i'm full of comments today i guess um earlier you had talked about um another slide about local zoning and i'm wondering if if a facility is sited close to a residential area or if say uh you talked about a nacelle catching fire and the prevailing wind i'm wondering if a type of analysis should be done of risk outside of the site boundary because we also do have civilization encroaching on rural areas and they could encroach also on your facilities so i think kind of being somewhat forward thinking of saying okay if population grows closer to the facility what's our contingency plan there but i also think you need to go look at wind conditions and things like that because we've seen how fires can quickly grow several miles beyond their starting point i'm not saying there should be a specific plan yet but i do think that should be considered at this phase of the rulemaking and not just limit it to the site boundary great thanks jim and i i i think that's that's a good point about zoning um i know one reason we had included that is because we do know um that local governments you know already have some hazard obligations or do some of those activities and that those efforts are kind of being uh also being looked at by lcdc now um and so i think one thing we were trying to think about it was was was that but i i think you know we hadn't thought about looking at surrounding uses and risks from surrounding uses so so thanks thanks for those comments okay hearing nobody else i'll go ahead move on to the next kind of topic we wanted to cover which was preventative actions and these are things that you know we could either look at in the context of asking for a plan that proposes preventative actions and programs and then kind of identifying the things that we would want to see in there or require to be in there um or we could you know the council could look at establishing separate uh rules for construction or operation that require specific things to to take um so some of the things that we know are in the puc rules uh include public safety power shutoffs we definitely would not be looking at the same thing uh under a council rule because energy facilities that we regulate do not serve uh end use customers you know most of our facilities are are serving the there are providing power to the to the bulk transmission grid or are part of the bulk transmission grid themselves um so we wouldn't necessarily be looking at the same kind of public noticing requirements or the same level of impacts about you know shutting off customers powers um but we may want and would like to hear people's feedback on whether or not we should you know have some requirements for um facilities to either shut down or de-energize elements of their their under certain high-risk conditions we definitely you know are interested in looking at whether or not we should be including specific uh inspection protocols if there was a facility or facility component cited in a high-risk fire area and then looking at vegetation management practices um again uh in in high risk fire zones or even generally um and then the last thing that's included in the puc rules and and we are thinking about how it might apply to our rules and maybe this is something that relates to jim's earlier comment is system hardening um and and that is really you know looking at existing infrastructure and making it more uh resistant to fire and if we're looking at new facilities i'm not sure how that applies but if this was to apply to um older facilities as well that may be something we're uh thinking about about incorporating into our process um so again i'll turn this over to other folks and just see if anybody has any comments on whether there's specific preventative actions or programs that should be required or how we should evaluate actions or programs proposed by an you know whether we should be looking at specific de-energization protocols uh and then whether we should have specific inspection or vegetation protocols required under our rules or standards as well and then just generally if there's anything we're missing here we'd be interested in hearing if anybody has recommendations for other specific safety devices or design features that are commonly used in generating or not generating facilities that we should be aware of and brian i see your hand is still raised which i'm assuming it's still up but if you do have a common go ahead if not you can lower your hand by pressing star five again otherwise i'll look for anybody else that that has a common okay and then i guess while folks were thinking about that um the other uh things that we are interested in hearing is if anybody has any other ideas on whether we should be looking at any particular land use or development standards so things like defensible space requirements uh which would you know normally apply to residential areas but but we know that there are some uh requirements for say solar facilities to maintain a defensible space area or we should be looking at specific access standards if there's specific uh fire safety codes or construction codes that we should we should be looking at in the context of energy facility siting um and then going back to what we discussed a little earlier whether there's specific uh training needs for emergency responders or other fire protection service providers associated with any specific types of facilities that we should look at um including in a rule or standard of our excuse me i have little frog in my throat if anybody has any recommendations on any of those things any of the last two things um we'd definitely be open to to hearing any of those and if not i'll just go ahead and um say that um so we will be definitely um noting all of the comments that we did here together today um and incorporating them into our update and analysis to the council which which should happen in the next few months in anticipation of that we're asking anybody on this call or anybody else who would like to provide comments uh to give us any written comments you wish to provide by march first to give us time to get ready um to incorporate those into our analysis and go back to council we were wondering if there was any need for additional workshops or engagement um if anybody thinks of anybody who should have been included on this call that wasn't um you know we are happy to set up one-on-one meetings or um meet with people um in smaller groups or or set up another workshop if needed although i'm not sure if that's the case at this point lori as i mentioned we are planning on working on reaching out to odf and working with them on some of these finer things and we'll definitely get their input on any issues related to the the wildfire risk explorer as well um yeah and then if anybody has any other comments just about other persons or groups that uh may be um we would be open to hearing that as um we did uh oh sorry and it's uh time let me know that the sign is in my screen so i will adjust a little bit over here i'm actually gonna turn off my camera for a second um uh yeah i guess that is that is our presentation today we did schedule this to be going until six so i'm going to leave the meeting on for a second but i'll uh turn off the recording here in a minute unless anybody else has any closing comments they'd like to make so i guess cnn um thanks so much to everyone for uh joining us today and look forward to some additional communications and our our preliminary analysis and maybe draft proposed rules in the next few months as we're working on this feel free like i said to provide any written comments by march 1st you can do that too either that this email here or my personal email which is christopher.clark energy.oregon.gov okay hopefully the light is a little bit right and thank you lori for being here",

participants to introduce themselves in the chat and state whether they wish to offer comments during the hearing we don't have anybody on the phone oh I will we will also offer the opportunity for attendees to ask clarifying and procedural questions after taking testimony as well so my name is James kogel from the Oregon Department of energy and I'll be the hearing officer for today's proceedings uh I want to thank you for participating today as staff introduced themselves um we have one participant in the line and class thank you for introducing yourself already if you would like to offer comments later in you would like to offer comments thank you very much I appreciate that and now I can introduce the rest of the Odo stuff on the call so I'll start with uh Doug if you don't mind uh introducing hello my name is Doug Baer I'm the senior incentives analyst working in the thank you uh Christy hi there Christy split I'm our government relations coordinator but also do community work on behalf of this and pandian hi my name is pandian Krishna Swami I manage the incentive programs at work and Department of energy and Patricia I'm Patricia Phillips I'm here to help with the webinar let me know if you have any questions through the chat thank you thank you and so uh we'll start with a brief summary of the proposed rule amendments before discussing the procedures for the hearing and then entering the testimony stage of the hearing materials for today's hearing including Draft rules are located on the Oregon Department of Energy's website oregon.gov energy so just a few quick words about using um if you're new to the platform you can use the raise hand function to ask a question and use the chat function to type in questions and if there are there any questions before we begin I'm happy to answer them so this hearing is this hearing is being recorded to maintain a permanent record today is May 18th 2023 uh the time is approximately the public hearing is being held online and all attendees are participating this is the time and date for set for a public rulemaking hearing the purpose is to take public comments on proposed permanent rules amendments which would extend the application and completion notice submission deadlines for the energy efficient Wildfire rebuilding incentive program the Amendments would also update the heat pump efficiency requirements to include new efficiency requirements for heat pumps manufactured after the start of this year now would it provide more details on these shortly the filing caption for this rulemaking is energy efficient Wildfire rebuilding incentive program Amendment so organ House Bill 5006 from the 2021 legislative session established the program for incentivizing your energy efficient rebuilding following the 2020 Labor Day wildfires the bill appropriate 10.8 million for the program the Oregon Department eventually filed permanent rules in March 2022 their own Department of energy has requested the Oregon legislature to be able to continue to use those funds through the 2023-2025 biennium this should be should this be approved the application deadline in the current rules will need to be extended Oda provided notice of the these proposed rule amendments to avoid disruption in accepting applications however Odo will adopt the rules only upon receipt of legislative would extend the application deadline and also the deadline by which the completion notice for rebuilding the structure would need to be submitted the application deadline is proposed to be extended to June 1st 2025 and notification of the project being complete would need to be received by June 30th 2025. a further amendment is being proposed to the rules um and so specifically the testing procedures for HVAC systems have been updated and new procedures for hearing efficiency and cooling efficiency have been developed uh in the US and are now in use this means newly manufactured heat pumps are being labeled with updated Heating and Cooling efficiency terms these are in hspf2 and HS and C2 as opposed to the older terms hsbf and the proposed change to the heat pump efficiency requirements include the new rating terms on newly manufactured heat pumps while retaining the same efficiency requirements for those manufactured prior to when the new terms came into effect at the start of the you all know that these numbers are not the same in the rule um this is due to differences in the testing procedure so the Oregon Department of energy appreciates the information and feedback that stakeholders have provided through the the rulemaking process notice for today's hearing was filed with the Oregon Secretary of State on April 11th uh 2023 and published in the May 2023 Oregon bulletin which is published this hearing will be conducted according to the Oregon administrative procedures Act of RS chapter 183 and the Attorney General's model rules in addition to the opportunity to present oral comments this hearing anyone May submit written comments in the email or mail until 5 PM May 22nd 2023 which is the close of the public comment period for everyone comments received at this date will not be reviewed or considered by the department unless the department decides to extend the public comment period for everyone after the close of the comment period the Oregon Department of energy will review issues raised during the public comment period and prepare a hearing officers report at the Oregon Department of energy will make the ultimate decision regarding these rules if anyone has joined since the beginning and hasn't introduced themselves I would like to ask you to please state your name Affiliated organization and whether you wish to offer comments uh then we will move into the testimony from so this hearing is being recorded to maintain a permanent record uh before beginning your testimonies I want to remind you to please state your name and affiliation with an organization if any for the record and if you have any written statements please email them so that uh maybe made part of the record many questions before we begin with the um so we will begin public comment protection now and uh we'll start with Cass uh Patricia if you can uh thank you very much because you should be unmuted now uh I see that was what that noise was sorry about that um yes I'm Cass Cornwell with Firebrand resiliency Collective I'm a Zone captain uh I'm also a fire Survivor and a board member with the ltrg I wanted to come today to express how vitally and important it is to extend the deadline for this incentive there are I was trying to find my I have extensive spreadsheets on the recovery of manufactured home parks and um that alone tells me that very few people have been able to rebuild in time to take advantage of this incentive and there's been a hiccup in resources to be able to help people replace their homes that hopefully will we'll pick up again when the HARP program releases we've been kind of in a a limbo State since the wrra funds dried up to be able to help people replace their their homes and again I was trying to find my my data but it it's just very few of the over 1500 manufacturer homes that were oh gosh we're I guess I have to stretch my screen a little beer sorry everyone only 244 or so have been replaced I'm not done with all 20 spreadsheets I've got three to go but from the data I've collected so far there's not a whole lot more coming because most of the spreadsheets I have left are from parks that don't have anybody coming back yet so it's pretty safe to say that less than 300 of the over 1500 manufactured homes have been replaced to date yeah that alone tells me how vitally important it is to extend the deadline of this incentive not really sure what else to say to to punch that home but and hi Doug nice to see you but yeah if you have any questions for for me um I have a lot of data that's great I appreciate you coming today to provide that feedback unless there's anything else you want to add cast I think we can I'm trying to think of something um that that I think pretty much says it all we we have numbers on the dash on the county dashboard about how many building permits have been issued for site-built homes as well and again it's I would say we might be approaching a third of the way there with the site Milton homes but it's still way behind as far as people who will still need to use this incentive okay appreciate it um I see you you put your your email address in the chat and a sort of data would be uh great to take a look at uh as well so I can uh followed with Doug and the team and see if we can reach out um to kind of get a snippet of uh your um to kind of take a look at you bet yeah the uh Firebrand resiliency Collective GIS team has a dash a recovery dashboard that they've been tracking all of the site built information on and then I feed them the information for the manufactured home parks Okay so I'll talk to my team once I get that email to respond to maybe more familiar yeah give a better picture of the whole and I'm really glad I showed up since it doesn't seem like anybody else did so I I as a fire Survivor myself I feel this is really important to represent the voices of other fire survivors uh yeah I appreciate you coming along um thank you uh with that um again thank you for joining um and as a reminder uh written testimony will be accepted until 5 PM May 22nd 2023 um and so um yeah uh no other comments or exhibits will be accepted after this date unless the department decides to extend the public comment period for everyone um at the close of the comp period the department will review all comments and summarize those comments in hearing officers report and now uh we'll also kind of add in some of the written comments we've received um should I have mentioned I'm representing Jackson County oh that's great I appreciate you adding that in as well thanks guys yeah the Owen Department of energy will make the ultimate decision regarding the although it's gonna just kind of reminder we're only able to kind of extend the deadline if the uh legislature uh provides the authority to kind of uh do so before we conclude I can answer any rulemaking process questions as well or any additional questions so if you have any cats I can't think of any thank you no it's cool uh so the time is 4 20 um and thank you for coming",

right now that's what you're reviewing right now and staff concurs that a 40-foot wide easement will serve that facility yes all right that there are no other questions for clarification I will close the public hearing all right carrying is closed we have another opportunity for more questions or we can go straight in for emotion which I was going to by acting like I guess ex-vice chair is de facto vice vice chair in the event that Vice chair is not present well I I've fallen I've volunteered you as you were walking up I mean unless someone else wants to suck up and do it oh okay yeah all right so prior to taking a vote um I think it would be would be helpful for us to have some deliberation on this because um as it stands you know I think what the site will either what the site currently is and what the site will potentially change to the city has kind of a need for both but for for myself you know given the constraints of the of the site you know I think what is proposed makes makes the most sense but I at the same time I think it's kind of a there's I think there's cases for or reasons for for either for you to stay or or to to change so yeah is this considered legislative or quasi-judicial this is the first one of these that I have done is volunteer on um so to what extent is this uh yep meets code or or legislative so a zone change is legislative you're making a recommendation to city council and the Crux of the conflict is in the economics opportunity whether or not we believe as a community we need the housing to fill the housing needs analysis more than we need the restricted commercial s to fill a need for retail commercial on our community and that's where the recommendation to say we concur or not with the applicant's determination of the community needs for housing versus well there is a need for housing um I mean that's it's clearance and we'll document documents that we use um what kind of housing you know I guess you could be what kind we prefer in the city but this you know for high density I mean it's it's surrounded I mean look what's surrounded by I mean it's encompassed by that there's high density to the to the East and around it and there's retail right up next to it I mean I can't imagine you know a bunch of single family you know loaded cities going in here exactly either so and housing is needed so it seems to kind of fit in concept the surrounding area at least to me yeah I would concur with that and I think that the way it's set up with walkability is also a high rating here and there's a bus stop right there and I think that this is a good use of this particular parcel or at least high density zoning rather than the actual site by itself yeah I mean I would concur I think that the zone is appropriate absent some sort of comprehensive Redevelopment of the entire site for mixed-use development I think it makes the most sense um the reason I asked the question before about what the Zone allowed because I could Envision some small amount of non-residential right at the the frontage road on Langer potentially but but yeah I think I think it makes perfect sense and provides an appropriate transition to the existing and I think it'll get used better as uh residential here rather than what the applicant has earning you know it's harder to put retail back here what would go back there how would that benefit the community with these kinds of retail spaces kind of tucked away in this back corner behind an alley a little more difficult whereas residential kind of is an extension of what's already there so I think there's benefit here as well in that sense I also think for the neighboring apartments and and residential to the east trying to cram in some sort of commercial there would create a much higher intense use than this high density residential Zone creates a buffering opportunity from retail commercial to the existing residents that are there so all right thank you Mr Kaiser enough deliberation for it here I believe so okay you want to make additional death report or is that something we can um nope cool this good opportunity if there's another staff report update that needs to be done so we can vote on the if we if it changes the context of the application that we vote on a revised application or revised staff report it's just a clarification point on page and under paragraph h changing height density residential to high density residential oh look at that the remainder of the net the criteria net we've been addressed has been addressed already the same for height on page 19 under findings the third paragraph in the page spell check on pages 22 findings this Criterion is satisfied as conditioned below it I just as a clarification and I think that page 25. first paragraph eight foot wide Public Utilities Amusement I believe is versus public utility easement only because it was used previously as that's all thank you and then we captured page three all of these herbals uh Corrections versus there's Scribner errors with the exception of packet page 33 we're adding the condition approval B9 to the findings okay what's that the B9 was the substantive change correct yes addition on page 33 yes the applicant agree to adding B9 it's the it's uh or it was already added it's already a condition but it the finding needed to have the condition stated it's already stated it's dated on page 35 already okay so yeah it's already in the conditions but it's not within our findings so but for the motion the motion can stand as the standard language versus revised since we're it's more Corrections versus correct we didn't change the we didn't change any findings or add any okay right I get it I'm getting head dots from staff so we're good thank you very much all right ready I moved the Sherwood Planning Commission forward recommendation of approval to the city council for Sherwood Plaza Apartments zone change and minor land project number lu2023-005 PA MLP based on the applicant testimony public testimony received and the analysis findings and conditions contained in the staff report I'll second all right it's been moved and seconded that we forward a recommendation of approval on lu2023005 PA MLP Sherwood Plaza Apartments zone change and minor land any further comments or discussion all in favor say aye aye aye opposed motion carry thank you very all right and then we're going to move right into our second public hearing the public hearing on econ economic opportunities analysis land use case lu2023007- PA is called to order before staff describes the procedures for conducting this public hearing I want to note that the applicant which is the city has requested a continuance of this hearing to a date certain of May 9 the Planning Commission can grant the request to continuance or conduct the hearing this evening as previously scheduled the public testimony received thus far has been entered into the record and will be addressed as part of the public hearing on this application whether the hearing is conducted tonight or at a later date Steph is there anything further you would like to address regarding the requested continuance not necessarily but we are requesting a continuance of this application because we want to address some criteria um uh from our agency partner Metro so are there any questions for staff or any issues the commission would like to discuss re related to the continuance itself not the application and I did you know had someone showed up we would have probably proceeded differently but just for anybody watching this there are no members of the audience here to testify this evening and we I'm assuming did not receive any uh request to testify electronically so um we are a we we do not have an audience wishing to testify this evening so um I would ask that we I would entertain a motion to continue the public hearing on application economic opportunities analysis to May 9th I moved the short Planning Commission continue the public hearing on the for I can economic opportunities project number lu2023-007 PA until May 9th 2023. will there be another work session on all right is there a second on the motion I'll second on the motion all right all in favor of continuing lu2023007 PA until May 9th 2023 motion carries all right moving right into commissioner comments all right I don't have anything intelligent to add to this evenings I'm hearing I was just curious um Erica can you give an update on the on the project adjacent to Symposium um no kind of where it's at yes it's a Pine Street Live work project they have building permits issue they've had building permits issued for some there is a delay and sure that's probably why you're asking PGE is the main issue they need to underground the overhead lines on Second Street and I think PGE has just really backed up with the design and then also the actual construction to actually pull the lines underground with that said they're very close so just a heads up to you guys if you're driving on Pine Street downtown May 1 to May 5. Pine Street will be closed for them to actually do this work so despite the Interruption it's good news because it's the work is actually happening but yeah it's been about probably a four month delay with PGE which is you know not not what we like to see but happens sometimes and usually these things come in after land use you know we don't usually get really detailed comments from PGE at the land use stage so it's something I think we're trying to work on to try and get more to give the developer a heads up on you know some of this stuff so they can just keep moving forward once they get their building permits but project is still moving forward just a delay in yeah it'd be I don't know if it can happen in time but it would be great if the site would at least allow for better pedestrian act um is through especially with the",

        "text": "thank you for I just really want to take to thank everybody who came out tonight we really appreciate you being here for in put important us my name is Kathleen SLO I'm the senior sting analyst for this project yellow rose Energy Center for the Department of energy so I with the Oregon Department of energy I am a cting analyst that works on behalf of the energy facility ccil and I first wanted to introduce my Odo team that it's awesome here so Sarah esterson is here in the room she's our senior poliy advisor been with Odo for many years eight thenor behind meing out CH MC B Walker he's been with Odo for six Years also a sting analyst and then our administrative assistant is Nancy hat she is our All Purpose go to for all things Technical and we'll be running the technical part of our meeting just so people in the room know we are also broadcasting this meeting live it is available on WebEx the webinar and there also opportunity for people call in so when we get to the comment period of our meeting we'll open it up to the room first the back second and then but I would also like to introduce the what we call our applicants from the yellow rose bush team and savan and this is Jeff Watson he's going to co-present with me tonight he's going to present on the project itself on behalf of the applicant developer and I'm G let him introduce his team team with us yeah hi everybody again my name is the button yeah there you go you're hi everyone my name is Jeff Watson I'm a development manager at Savon energy and the teque developer on yellow rose bush um so I'm going to go around the room here and introduce the Savon team so starting with Mitch Taylor who is our director of development for the Pacific Northwest and and m&amp;a we have ANUK soulsby who is our director permitting we have uh let's see Chris Powers senior director of Permitting Adam Williams who is our BP of uh excuse me our BP of development in the west and Gary Parker to his right our VP of BC so we also have Paul Hicks and Ash Woods who are joining us from tetr who are our permanent consultant and working very closely through the uh photo process with us so I think I got everyone yeah and that is the the sav team so excited to to uh tell you a little bit about the project and and hear whatever questions or comments we have tonight thank you so first couple things I want to go over just general housekeeping there are coffee tea lemonade water there were cookies they might have all got me um out by the door in the lobby and then the rooms or pass the front desk take a left then take a right and see the writing on the wall case for emergency run out the store so so that's just houskeeping um let's see okay so I'm GNA go over a meeting agenda the purpose of this meeting is really to give a little bit of information about the project and our process um but it's really to allow the public to comment if they have comments or ask questions about the facility Theos facility so we're going to keep the presentation site brief so that we can open it up for public comment as soon as possible but there are some things I need to cover one of them is just the energy facility site process overview as I mentioned I work for the Department of energy the state of Oregon we are the sighting Division and we work in support of the energy facility sighting Council it is the council that makes the decision to approve or deny an application forite certificate um so I'll go through our process and how the public can engage and participate in that process and then we're going to go over a little bit on the project facility and then I'm going to turn it over to Jeff who will give more information on the propos facility and then we'll open it up for so as I noted this is an informational meeting um the informational meeting is intended to give the public an opportunity to make comments it is not a contested case hearing and participation in this meeting I'll get more into the contestant C when I get into our process but participation in this meeting and making comment is not required in order to preserve the right to to um have standing or up asked to join into a contested case we do ask that everybody hold their questions and comments to the end of the presentation and then the last part is you know please just be respectful we like to conduct ourselves in a respectful manner um we have a lot of material to cover and we just want to make sure that everybody has time um to make a comment if there are a lot of people who want to comment you may have to put a time limit but um we'll just play by yours we don't want so as I noted this sighting division um we serve as technical staff to what we call it energy facility sighting Council we use a lot of acronyms but we call it FC for short so the FC process is a state process and it's set in Oregon administrative rules and Oregon devised statutes and we have 16 General standards which I will cover in a minute and as I said the sting division staff really works in support of Council and our job is to put applications through technical review um so to make sure that these facilities can meet the requirements of those standards that need to be met in order to have Council be willing to approve a c and then it also has conditions that certificate holder has to to commit to in order to have that set certificate next slide so this slide is really just to explain our role and why we're involved we're not involved in all energy projects we're limited to those that are defined through the OS 46930 which is what defines a state jurisdictional energy facility and there are different rules that um this is basically the the actual reason why we're here tonight is that this proposal falls under the definition of an FC jurisdictional facility for a solar and it's really um defined by either 160 Acres of high value Farmland 1280 acres of land that's predominantly cultivated or at least meets the the capability classes for agriculture and then um a limit of 199 20 acres or larger for in other so we're you know this proposed facility covers 8,075 Acres approximately 12.6 M square miles of private land that is zoned for exclusive F you so that is why it's an asset jurisdiction facility and for that the the proponent the applicant needs to apply for a site certificate and in order to obtain that site certificate they must demonstrate that that facility can meet these standards that we're going to talk tonight and the first step in that process is submitting what is called the notice of intent we issued a public notice on the notice of intents in October and scheduled this public information meeting as part of our Outreach on the no this is kind of my favorite slide because add a glance you can see next like the um process laid out kind of in a graphet so we're SE we have seven major steps in the site certificate process and as you can see with the red box we are at the very beginning we're at the notice of intense phase and those purple boxes they're supposed to be green but our projectors not projecting the right colors um those purple boxes are the areas the ones that say public noce comment period info meeting and across are areas where the public has the opportunity to provide input and engage in our our process so at the notice of intent phase and applicant will submit a proposed project and the information that they submit in that notice of intent is basically a desktop level analysis of the you know the idea the concept of their facility what they want to do where and then the known information as it applies to our standards we then issue a public notice we held a public information meeting and when we issued that public notice on October 10 we opened up a public comment period And so until that public comment period closes on the notice of inent which is DEC 1st the public has the opportunity to provide comments on this project it's the first step of getting public input on this project and our council is very interested in heing what the public has to say so if you have thoughts or opinions about a facility that's under art SE jurisdiction I highly encourage you to to engage in our process um because it it will help our Council make a decision so we are at the very first step of a notice of times um after the public meeting and the public comment period closes and during this time we're also coordinating with what we call reviewing agencies reviewing agencies are local governments local affected governments the state resource agencies like we have ODFW here tonight Oregon Department of ficial Wildlife we as a department a division have to engage in coordination and consultation with all our state reding agencies and also tribal government to trial governments um and again it's to engage coordinate make them aware of the project and get input from all of these entities on how this proposal is being presented any concerns are issues things that we need to consider as we review through our standards so um based on all of the comments we received we move on to the next step and that's the project order I will be preparing the project order so the project order is basically a summary of all of the input we get run it through a filter of our standards and come up with what we call analysis areas that are required for each of our standards um that need to be what needs to be included in the actual application because at a notice of intent it's a notice of intent to file it or submit an app for a site certificate no application has actually been submitted or received so the applicant is preparing all the materials to include in their application with at this time and so while I write the project order they're working on their studies and coordination and Analysis coming up with their plans and then we issue the project order and it will tell the applicant what needs to be included in that application and that is you so we issue the project Court the notice of intent is valid for two years so in the time that from the notice of intent phase we received a complete notice of intent on this project on September 28th 2023 they have two years to submit an application now the applicant has indicated they would like to submit it earlier than that but just realized there's a",

        "text": " everything you can with us and one thing that we really really said was don't plan a meeting in the middle of harvest and you looked at us and very sincerely seemed like you would kind of follow some of these suggestions and said yeah that that sounds like some some good advice and so here we are July 25th in the middle of harvest and I'm looking around and I'm actually surprised at how many farmers I see and how many should be in the field right now but they're here because this is such an important topic an issue and it's going to be impacting a lot of people so uh the main thing that I want to say and bring up is I guess I do lean more on the side of with private property we should be able to do what we want however we have land use laws and at county level state level and I guess what's frustrating about this is because your company has enough time and money you're going to be able to do what you want whereas the rest of us that don't have that time and money have to follow the laws and that is frustrating to see over and over and over again and so why not instead of trying to be able like instead of trying to get um like the governor to sign off or whoever needs to in order to get this project going why not get lobbyists and go to the Capitol and change the law so that we can all do these things if we want to but I guess that's my biggest frustration is that because you have enough money you get to be above the law I guess I'll take two of the questions at least that I heard and you guys can respond if you want to um first you know she was looking at you guys we scheduled the meeting um so if anybody's to blame you can blame the Oregon Department of energy not the applicant that's our responsibility so we we will take that 100 so but I will also say that um when the applicant submits their notice of intent we're on the clock we have to provide notice uh we have to get memos out to reviewing agencies we have to provide enough time in advance of the meeting we have to provide enough time after the meeting for public comment um we have to synthesize all that information and put that into a project order within 140 days so we don't have a lot of time to play around with um so we could have done better and we will do better and look forward you know that in the future so again that's on us um not on the applicant um what was the second part Above the Law thank you sorry um and I will say nobody is going to be above the law in this that is entirely what our process is about um you may not agree with the laws but we do have the laws we have statutes we have rules that is exactly what the Oregon Department of energy at least my division is here to do is to ensure that whatever they submit is consistent uh with the local with with the requirements of the energy facility citing Council and if we recommend approval to the council it's because we believe they have provided enough evidence in the process to meet the requirements so our process is all about the law and again that's exactly what we're doing here today is try to convey that to you so you understand what those requirements and standards are so if you want to continue to track this project and comment you understand what those are and what what they're going to be held to and so again you know whether you understand that today or or that starts to you know kind of become more clear in the future please continue to participate Chase and I are always going to be around if you've got questions but it is absolutely has to be consistent with the law to add to that um we did take a lot of notes especially with the meeting with Farm Bureau and one of those was to continue Outreach to the locals um and have more meetings so we did meet with various cities try to get in contact with them to see whether or not that's something they would allow us to do to hold Town Halls outside of the fsec process and requirements so we do want to continue to do that whether it's at another city in a public space or even if we had to rent out uh some type of venue that is something me and my team are actively trying to do so we can you know homeowners within a certain range so I'm going to cut people off please don't kind of raise questions we have a lot of people online they can't hear the questions in the back and forth so we are trying to actually find more venues to do public Outreach to uh locals within the county but various areas so we can't get more uh comments from everyone Chad Higgins and then Carl woodsig is next Chad's first we became friends by the fridge I I looked for beer but there wasn't any um I actually didn't plan on commenting tonight I just wanted to come and see what the community thought and um I really appreciate the passion that everyone has brought I can't believe how many people are here um I'm commenting because my name was brought up a few times and um I'm not commenting to to you Todd or or to you I'm coming to the folks here um hence the young baby here uh we do have 10 years of data um I um I should say my name is Chad Higgins I am a farm kid my family's Homestead in New York state still stands I own a farm in Lynn County and I operate it and in my spare time I'm a professor at Oregon State University where I do research on maintaining agricultural land and production even in the presence of solar cells we have 10 years of data on this we're global leaders in this space and uh if you want to know more please reach out to me um I can do my best to explain my my biggest fear of my research and I've said this many times is that it's used as an Enron around land use laws um and because the the whole point of what I do is to protect AG lands and affect rural culture and the rural way of life so but if you're interested and you want to see us drive a tractor through purpose-built solar array if you want to see us growing melons and tomatoes and even cannabis and uh berries and even grass seed um grass not grass seed right now please come and visit us I have an open house at our research facility the second Tuesday of every month that's the next open house is going to be August 8th at 1 pm everyone here is invited it's it's um it's at the North Willamette research and Extension Center in Aurora Oregon which is a bit up the highway from here um it's on Miley Road and uh everyone is welcome to come and I can show you what we're doing um I can't let you drive a tractor through unless you go through the tractor training um but we do we do get big equipment through not the 30-foot header that they they that I heard mentioned but we can get um 25 foot headers through our array no problem so um yeah I'm here I'm I'm a servant of the thank you Carl's proxy um sorry my name is Joanna whitsick and kind of around this area uh a couple questions for you Mr train why is the project so large uh just from an economic standpoint it makes more sense to build a project than size especially with the the need in the um we were able to find enough landowners who wanted to partner with us to size it this large um the substation itself can support that much uh capacity um so it's it's kind of just the we would size the project to how much land we can find if we didn't if we weren't able to find enough land then we would have to either downsize the project or move it entirely because most electricity going to be going to Eugene Salem the urban areas it would go wherever the demand is needed um I assume it's the urban areas in your experience is that the urban areas it's kind of hard to tell where it flows but it would stay within the Willamette Valley just because there's actually a demand needed like there's actual demand in the Locale and Sir um you did uh studies with wildlife and that sort of thing and you're aware of course that all these Wildlife have a yearly not a six month habitat rotation migration patterns and so what have you done to your is your study going to be done in August and you're not going to do the when all the migrations too I can answer that um so our fish and wildlife standard requires well I I had mentioned before but I'll mention it again so our standard is actually references the Oregon Department of Fish and wildlife's um policies on fish and wildlife habitat um we talked before about reviewing agencies we work very closely with Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife so we seek at this point their input on based on this location what are the survey protocols so the applicant doesn't get to decide that it's the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife decides that okay and I have I have been unable to really follow you know maybe I'm just a dumb farm girl but I have been unable to follow what you were saying about the uses when they go to you instead of the land use laws I can read statutes you happen to be able to do that but are you tell telling me that for solar projects there are conditional use and they do not have to follow if they go through you they don't have to put any kind of agricultural use on these farmlands um they don't know what you said they don't have to do that for any project whether it's County or state now that doesn't mean that you know if they're going to take Prime Farmland out of production maybe you know if there's no habitat or no Farmland mitigation plan maybe that doesn't justify approval um so it really depends on the particular application so in the east side of the mountains where most of the projects that we reviewed are there is not much in the way of you know it's there's a lot of up in wheat some of the areas are exclusive Farm use so let me speak exclusive Farm use owned but they're not in active production so in that situation you know it's the same requirements it's the same standard those may not require any kind of agricultural mitigation here if it's their argument to make it's it's not our argument to make it's the applicant's argument to make and it's your also your ability",

It would involve hiring a couple of additional staff to support the off site kennels, which I'm wondering if perhaps some of the interest accruing from the earmark shelter funding could cover. There's substantial unrest brewing in the community over our failures to sufficiently provide for our animals. There are many, many rescues in the area that would come together to help the county to facilitate emergency solutions. So I'm asking you, please use us to help. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay. Mike McGovern. Mike? Mike, I need your name and address, please. Mike McGovern. 760 West Highway 316. We're just across from the 137 acre farm. You've mostly answered my questions this morning. Thank you, the commission, for what you've done here. I do want to follow what the sheriff wants to do. That sounds to me like a much better use for that property, and so I'm not going to take a lot of time. Just say thank you for the change, and we'll be following what the sheriff wants to do out there. Thank you. All right. That's all the folks that I had signed up. Is there anyone that wants to speak about an agenda item? Yes, ma'am. Come on up. And you're not going to believe this, but I need your name and address. Oh, that'd be good. My name is Kathryn Gandy. I live at 100 410 Southwest 105th Street, Ocala, Florida I've been here many times. I'm an animal lover. I lived in front of the humane society when I first moved here in 1975. I want everybody to know that I loved having the animals there. It did not disturb my life one bit. And. Well, I'm just curious. You say you have 60 acres. Is that ready to be approved? You don't have to go through a bunch of stuff to have it proved. Why can you use that? We. That's up near the silver springs? Yeah, it's in Silver Springs, Cohajo. And we will need a special use permit. So we would have to move through the special use. Well, we have picked up many animals. People take them when they're puppies, and sometimes they can't afford to get them. They get out. But there's so much love for these animals. I live in an area where a lot of trees are right back at top of the world, and we get a lot of wild animals, you know, that's just from their homes and everything, these domestic animals. Some people can't take care of them after they have them. I understand that. So they get out on the streets, but they're dying. So we need some help with them right now. Anything you can give us. Thank you very much. Thank you. I saw another hand. Yes, ma'am. Karen Armon, 22 34, northeast 6th place of California. I'm here with the same question. If the 60 acres needs a special use permit and the 20 acres needs an annexing this and that, can we just work on the 60, which would actually, in years to come, be able to accommodate this county and the growth that it's going to, going through? I personally am president of a nonprofit that has been helping this county for over the 13 years. I'm getting ready to retire because I feel like I'm just spinning my wheels here. I have been kind. I've begged for everything. And we get a lot of promises and we get nothing like. So now the 137 that isn't appropriate for our animal shelters is appropriate for our sheriff's department, as is the hangar and the new helicopter and all of these other things that they get every year. With our penny tax, it's been split between fire and police, fire and police. And then we squeezed in a little bit of roadway because the growth got so crazy here, people couldn't get anywhere. And now in 24, 25, almost all of it, I think I saw 97% is for roadways from the growth that you guys call progress. But the problem is progress brings more animals and I am tired of adding these animals to a necklace because I can't save them all. I have over 1700 animals I have personally saved for this county out of my pocket, and I am not asking for help. I am just asking for some compassion out of this council that has seen us stand here for over seven years. I had a conversation personally with Kathy Bryan two years ago where she said we were getting the new shelter. And I promised that I would campaign for her only to learn that the shelter wasn't going to happen again. I mean, I don't even know how times we've heard this situation conversation and we keep ending up at ground zero and the animals can't take it anymore. And I see the light is red. Finish your thought. I signed up, though, and you didn't read me off. I didn't see there that, you know, unless you signed up for them. But I appreciate your comments and so why can't we do the 60 instead of the 20? If we've got an annexe the 20, why can't we just special use the 60 and just be done with this and quit wasting the money? What happened to the money? There was 11 million. Now you're telling us not okay. Is there anyone else in the audience that has an agenda item that they want to. Yeah, nine, three. I remember. Name and address. Oh, Henry Munoz. 495 Marion Oaks boulevard. I remember it was about maybe four or five years ago when you guys started with Mali's law. Unfortunately, the commissioner who started that is no longer here. And I remember saying that this leniency stuff, you guys, and then you came up with the no kill and I said, guys, be careful. This thing's going to come bite you in the rear end. And it seems to be happening now. I guess my prophecy was right. I'm not against animals. I like them, but as good stewards, there's time for them to go, and it's as simple as that. And I refuse to let this council be swayed by less than 1% of the community. If you guys want this animal shelter thing resolved, put it as a referendum for the community to vote for, and then everybody, then I would be happy to say, okay, everybody wants it, but I don't think everybody wants all this expenditure on animals when we used to, just after a few months, nobody wants them. Goodbye, you know? Yeah, that's right. Heartless. Yeah, but you guys do that at an abortion clinic without thinking about it, so. But this is the point. This is the point where we ate. We're trying to do a feel good thing and trying to make it feel good that you can't please everybody and don't even try. We're building the shelter. We've got money committed. When it happens, it happens. But I think maybe we should rethink the no kill policy. Really? Thank you. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Wow. Your name and address, please. Wow. I. That's okay. Just. Just wow. Give me your thoughts and don't worry about that. Dale Kratzer. 259 Marion Oaks Lane, Okello. Wow. 1% of the people. Well, you listen to less than 1% over the 137 acres. I'll say that much. When I was at that meeting that night, you said, no personal reasons. Should this be an objection? And all I heard that night was personal reasons. I can't look at the stars at night. I have to sit on my deck drinking a bourbon and be annoyed by dogs barking on 137 acres. Let's get real, people. 137 acres up in citra, in horse country. It would have been a dream for this county. We would have been the envy of the state of Florida to have such a facility for our animals. And what was it going to hurt? Somebody drinking a bourbon at night and looking at the. But that's all I heard. Personal reasons, not anything that was legitimately facts that disgust me. Now we have 60 acres that we own. Why aren't we using it? Why are we waiting? We've been waiting for seven years. I was here. I helped get no kill into this district, into this county, and I fought really hard, and you guys did it. But right now, we are at no kill. I came up here with papers to show you that we're going against our own ordinances by euthanizing owner requests, by telling people to bring in their animals. Let them come in, and we can then euthanize them in minutes. That's against our ordinance. I helped pass it. It says, no owner surrenders will be euthanized by request. But yet our county is having our owners sign euthanasia forms. What's going on? We don't have a facility that's enough to handle this county for years. Now we're pussy footing along trying to get stuff to this land. That land. Let's just get it done, people, and ask for people that there's more people that want no kill than there is, than less. So if you were to put it for a referendum, I'm sure it will pass, because this is the horse country of the world. This is an animal county, not people. Yes, ma'am. And your name and address? Deborah Waberson. My address is statutorily. Ex",

        "text": " whatever role that we could play small part that we could play in the program um reducing reducing any potential harm to environmental justice communities um so I'm going to go to the next slide but I I did want to just emphasize you know the amount of time and it took for us to develop that I just wanted to once again acknowledge the sheer volume of uh comments that we had received and the engagement we had received again from stakeholders from regul entities from Individual oregonians and I do think again for us as DEQ one of the things that we took away from that process is you know for us it was I think based on the my understanding is it was really one of the few times that we had so much new voices engaging on some of our programs and those new voices part of that I think was reflective of the fact that you know all agencies all of us are learning ways in which we can remove obstacles and more voices can participate in our R making and our regulatory activities but I also just think the breath of comments that we received was reflective again of the importance of climate change to so many folks across Oregon the importance of how we're going to design it how we're going to find it how we're going to deal with it how we're going to respond to it and like I said hundreds of comments at every stage and you know ultimately when we put out the the notice which is our way of like talking about the rules we put that out I think in the late summer of 2021 I think at that time we received something like over 7,000 comments which may not sound huge but for us uh I think for the agency that was that was a huge amount of um of Engagement that we weren't anticipating so you know where we were the program did start in 2022 the first year of the program was really focused on our implementation steps um those were things that were very specific to our regulated entities specifically our covered fuel suppliers so again that's our Natural Gas Utilities and our um liquid fuels and propane suppliers another important step for us in 2022 was the establishment of our Equity advisory committee who was a key partner um in helping us Focus um the program outcomes on environmental justice and Equity goals but really very much focused on supporting what we call the community climate Investments component of the program again in 2023 I'll just flag we were very much focused on implementation of the program I think we really started to kick off what was our best available emissions reductions component of the program so that was a site specific approach to tackle additional mostly industrial process emissions um and we had just start the process of you know starting to do um the implementation of the bear program and we had also actually were had selected a provisional CCI entity which was going to uh help uh basically implement the CCI program and we were close to having that finalized so that our cover fuel suppliers could uh contribute to the CCI program if they so wanted and then we also made some minor program modifications in a rul making process at the end of 2023 and then you know obviously if the program hadn't been in invalidated we would have um had the last year of our first three-year compliance period so the program was designed to have three-year compliance periods so again our regulated entities had not yet demonstrated compliance with the program but the third year of the program would have been 2024 and 2025 would have been the first year in which they had to demonstrate compliance so I'm going to go to our next slide so I just want to talk really briefly about the scope of the CPP 2024 rulle making um I think one of the questions we get a lot and one of the questions that we discussed a lot internally DEQ as some folks have even my own colleagues have said to me well you know it's just a procedural notice error so aren't isn't that all that you're doing aren't you just going to aren't you just fixing that error are you just having this Ru making process to fix that era and yes obviously we need to have a rule making so we could reestablish the program but so when we think of the scope of the CPP rulemaking we do want to reestablish a program to set limits on emissions from significant sources in Oregon we do want to have enforcable and declining limits on the emissions from these fossil fuels beginning in 2025 and we do want to make sure that this CPP 2024 program is comparable in scope and Emissions reductions as the original CP program you know we're not as DEQ staff intending to propose a major program R design as you just heard me walk through all the steps that we went through to develop the program for the 18 to 20 months and we don't intend to you know Chuck out anything B because we've had this invalidation but I think one thing we do know at DEQ is that we do need to make some adjustments to the program just for a 2025 Program start you know we've already started working with our Ru making advisory committee and we're already getting feedback on how we might have to make adjustments for the 2025 Program start but I think more broadly we're also open to hearing any new ideas um around program design and implementation that we think could strengthen the program I think a lot of this is driven by our experience the last two years implementing the program um and we're also I'm going to say obviously it's also I think driven by the experience of our regulated entities in terms of complying with the program what are they seeing what kinds of obstacles might be there I think for us a DEQ are we seeing the types of changes that we were hoping to see when we designed the program and I think also this isn't just our regulated entities our public lots of stakeholders have insight and had experience with the program after the last two years so again we are we are open to hearing you know recommendations for program design implementation but again we want these recommendations to be strengthening the program um so I might just go to the slide so again in terms of considering modifications that would further strengthen the program this are just some of the things that have that um might be suggested to us that would be examples of how we could strengthen the program I think what's what's really important and I think in our conversations just we just had a rack meeting this month is you know within this umbrella of keeping our comparable emissions and reductions scope and you know are there opportunities for us to increase Equitable outcomes are there ways in which we can bring more folks along in the clean energy transition are there ways that we could do a better job of uh identifying who are those environmental justice communities and what might be needed in infrastructure I think also there might you know we might hear opportunities to further minimize costs not just our regulated entities but again we're all users of these fuels to businesses and the public um we've talked so much today about these huge changes that have occurred since we first implementing this program in 20 first designing this program in 2020 and 2021 as I said CPP was always designed to be complimentary with other initiatives but as we just heard with Ira climate pollution reduction Grant there's so much Federal Investments and funding um not just through DEQ but through other agencies and even through other other entities across the state so I I think that's definitely top of mind for us is how we can continue to leverage those future Federal investments in ways that can make supporting the climate Protection Program 2024 or implementing it easier and I think the other thing that we're also looking at here might also generate more opportunities for improvements is other state programs right now that are occurring in climate mitigation again since 2020 2021 we have a a program in Washington California is making adjustments I think for us it's just are there things that we can learn from those programs even though our program has to be designed specifically for Oregon but you know are things that we can learn from those programs about program design elements and more broadly you know are they are they benefits or considerations as other programs in the re other states in the region are you know more actively addressing uh reducing greenhouse gas emissions so I'm going to stop there I think that's my last slide I don't think I need to spend too much time on this just to keep us on schedule but I think the next slide which I'll just throw up there is just basically our Ru making schedule for the CPP 2024 we just kicked off our advisory committee meeting in April I know folks here were either attending or on the advisory committee or listening we actually did for us our first inperson I think advisory committee meeting in the agency since pre pandemic so we were actually invigorated to have an in-person advisory committee meeting again all the advisory committee meetings are the public in listen to those meetings and we have public comment periods at all the advisory committee meetings again this is a Brisk timeline because we think it's important to get the program reestablished um but it's also very representative of the rulem schedules that we have for most um rulemakings and again we are we are deploying all the all the work that was done when we first developed the climate Protection Program back in 20 in 2021 we are hoping to publish the notice in Late July and obviously we'll be making sure as an agency that we think that we are complying with all our procedural requirements and then our expectation as the cue is to present uh present a rule to our Environmental Quality Commission in November of 2024 I think that's it Nicole thank you so much for your presentation um one of the things that uh did come out of the work that we did as part of developing the road map was just how important existing programs like the CCP CPP um were to uh putting us on track to meet meet and exceed our goals and so um our first recommendation in that road map was to was to really track imp implementation and and make sure that these programs such as the CPP were being implemented in a in a really uh good and aggressive way so appreciate that um that the department has picked up the the ball and is going back through this um roeming so we can get the program back in place um are there any questions for Nicole comments well uh commissioner",

this project are closed so thank you please do not speak specifically about this project i will not speak specifically about this project then i will talk about um you know that this is a relative weakness for building long distance high voltage electrical transmission lines due to those factors that i have just noted and that's the main thing that i wanted to say is i would like to look at a consideration strong consideration that if this project were to go ahead that there would be a look at using the public right-of-way access along the uh interstate system to bury these lines rather than having them be submitted subjected to the uh changes that occur weather-wise in this okay that's what i wanted to know thank thank you for your comments ms ryman are there others who would like to comment good morning and thank you um my name is margaret l mead i live at foothill road we often hear that a picture is worth a thousand words most of us have taken photos of an awesome scene and then become disappointed when the image isn't what we saw because there's no way to capture the enormity the reality in a photo or we've taken a photo and then it's ruined because we have some power lines running through it and that's not the scenery we want to be showing others and sometimes we've seen photos like through all different media and then when we've seen the place in reality grand canyon for an example or yellowstone park we see those in real life and we have a totally different therefore we often make a real effort to see for ourselves what the lay of the land is the actual scene is often very different from what a flat one dimension image juries often go to the scene of the crime to get a real feel and sense of the place so i would like to invite you that when you're in our beautiful valley you take an hour or so from your very full schedule and check out look at what we have here see why people are so you know enamored of living in this very special place thank you thank you for your comments ms mead are there others that wish to provide public comment hi my name is ann morrison i'm a retired attorney i live here in legrand um i am really a latecomer to these issues i know that that most of you and many of the people who object to b2h have been working on these issues for years and years it's only in recent months that i have started looking at these issues and as an attorney my interest has been how are these decisions even made what is the process and once i started looking into that i had a lot of concerns i just thought oh man my understanding is that this council receives its information for making decisions primarily from two sources one would be idaho power itself the other would be oregon department of energy my understanding is that the statutes require developers to the oregon department of energy for the costs and the salaries and expenses that go into developing a project and that idaho power at this point has paid the department of energy more than four million dollars towards um the work that has been done on this project ms mead you need to be or i'm sorry miss morrison you need to be speaking in generalities as opposed to this project i am speaking i'm speaking in generalities my question is when this council is receiving information primarily from the utility involved who has an interest in building property building constructing this development and from the department of energy which is receiving funding from the developer in question how is the department of energy acting as an independent party i've worked in state government i know that one of the balls that every state constantly has in the air is the issue of finance funding and where their money is coming from my concern is that the information that comes to this council comes from two peop two parties that are interested in the development of this property oregon department of energy receives significant money from idaho power and to work on this project to work on any project and holding a utility to account and requiring a utility to comply with regulations would cut off a significant stream of funding to that agency how is this council receiving objective when both of the parties that are informing this council have an investment in seeing a project go who is representing the in the public interest in a situation like this a second concern that i had when i started looking into these issues is that i started to look at the make of this of this council we have seven members on this council from the profiles that are by the department of energy most of the people on this council work full time or have significant other volunteer interests or members of other boards this council is making billion dollar decisions on the on behalf of the state of oregon this council people with expertise in two of the 16 areas in which this council must make decisions there there are issues of scenic value of cultural and historic value of wildlife protection of well the council will know but there are 16 issues each of them is very technical each of them requires a great deal of expertise but on this council there are people who are familiar who have background expertise in only two of those areas which would be cultural resources and land use planning the remainder of council members that i as based on their profiles do not have background in the energy in the in the areas of sighting of requiring developers to post adequate bonds waste management weed management or the many other issues that this council must address that is a significant concern for me if we have a council here that does not the kind of background that is needed to address these issues the council is entirely dependent on the information coming from the two vested parties the utility and the department of energy i am acquainted with mr jenkins it's a small community my understanding is that mr jenkins was originally appointed to this council over the objections over significant objections from this community from people who were aware of his background and ethical issues in this community by statute counselors are required or allowed to serve only two consecutive terms of four years mr jenkins as i understand it is now serving his tenth year on this council all of these things caused me to question the legitimate legitimacy of this entire i guess the last thing that i would say most of you are not from eastern oregon you may or not may or may not be aware that there is significant significant anger significant hostility significant resentment resentment in this part of the state based on the fact that decisions are made for this part of the state by people in western oregon who do not live here who may have different values who may have different attitudes on things it has caused it's it's a significant risk rift you may be aware that there's actually an organization that is trying take the eastern oregon counties and break away to join idaho i think in the context of that kind of division and that kind of hostility and that kind of sense out of eastern oregon that our interests are not being considered our values are not being taken into account it is important for this council to be aware making decisions to impose facilities over the objections of the strenuous objections of the people who will be affected is one more manifestation of western oregoners ignoring the feelings the sentiments the values of people who actually live here and i guess that's my entire comment so thank you thank you miss morrison are there others that wish to comment please come forward hi i'm tim leventhal i'm a resident and the former speaker has pretty much stolen my thunder so i just have a few brief notes it to support what she said and i find it interesting that the budget for the oregon department of energy is paid for by developers which could run into millions of dollars then after the developers are given the go-ahead to proceed the department of energy continues to get paid by the by the energy so it appears the oregon department of energy has a vested interest in the utilities succeeding no matter the consequences of the for the welfare of the livability of the state or the people who live here and since uh the former speaker much better than i can i'll end with thank you thank you mr leventhal are there others that wish to provide comment to the council irene gilbert 2310 adams avenue and i wanted to discuss this this is a a newspaper article just just within the last week i'd say says upcoming investigation how an airborne blade exposed broader popular problems at pge's flagship wind farm and i'm sure most of you are familiar with this the bottom line is um i worked for oregon osha for a dozen years before i retired and i did i trained osha staff on safety and health issues i also did a lot of customized training for employers when it comes to things like safety inspections what i used to train people our staff was go in and look and see what their plans look like check and see what their lockout tag out program is there can their confined space program because those plans are what dictates whether or not a a agency or a an employer is going to have a successful safety program or they are not so if the plan is inadequate the outcome is going to be inadequate and so once you have a good plan really you're just looking at are is management enforcing the plan and are people are there consequences when people don't do what they're supposed to when you come to a situation like this where for years this wind farm has been spewing bolts and nuts and pieces of the all over the ground and oil leaking that tells me that pge did not have a good plan for maintaining and managing their equipment um so i'm concerned because this development was approved by this and the plans were developed by the oregon department of energy so now you have a development here that not only i'm sure has inadequate plans but there hasn't been any monitoring to show that they're actually following those plans and i just bring this up because there's been some discussion about the fact that the council tends to approve basically site certificates that are not complete because you can't approve a standard without knowing what the plans are that are that are going to be implemented in order to meet that standard so when council turns over the development of a of a",

every five years and the next one will occur in 2026 also associated with the state line the certificate holder reported one carcass observed within the facility which was an american white pelican so that concludes my updates on the projects and monitoring requirements are there any okay last thing on my list is the next council meeting which is june 23rd and we will be having rule making hearings the evening of the 23rd thursday and then the regular council meeting on the 24th currently we are planning for the meeting to be in salem and so if anybody would like to travel please we will be reaching out to you so we can make appropriate reservations for you otherwise you know we will be holding similarly a hybrid meeting so those who want to come in and attend in person um that would be great but those who would rather attend uh remotely that will be that option as well tom yes mrs hanley um which rules um well it kind of depends on tonight could be the protected area rules could be the wildfire i think those were the two we also have carbon rules so but i might be getting confused chris will be able to provide i know one of them will actually be in july that i think that's the carbon or no maybe it's sorry i think it's the wildfire and the carbon rules would be in june and because you know if you decide tomorrow to move forward with the notice of proposed rulemaking for the protected areas i believe that one would be in july if i'm wrong chris will correct me thank but it is some combination of those three on those two different dates okay with that i will conclude my secretary report thank you mr secretary the next item is the nolan hill hills wind power project the public hearing on the draft proposed order on application for the site certificate um the nolan hills is a 600 megawatt wind and solar facility in umatilla county is proposed by nolan hills wind llc we have for an overview of the proposed facility uh kathleen sloan a senior citing an analyst that will provide the overview of the citing process the proposed facility compounds components and there will be a public hearing overview by kate triana the senior administrative law judge at the oregon office of administrative hearings that will explain the legal requirements we're providing comments on the record and will facilitate the hearing then we'll have the public hearing where interested individuals will have an opportunity to provide oral testimony on the asc and the draft proposed order written comments may also be submitted to the department through the close of the public hearing so with that i'll turn it over to ms sloan thank you vice chair howe for the record this is kathleen sloane i'm going to go by kathleen this evening because our administrative law judge is also goes by kate and i don't want people to get but thank you for being here and being here for the meeting i'm going to go over a few slides about our process um where we are in our process and a little overview of the project and then i am going to turn it over to the alj and she will open and run the hearing so so to start i'm just going to go over a few overview slides so tonight we are on the draft proposed order for the nolan hills wind power project so i'm going to go over the proposed facility the public hearing process and then like i said the alj will go into the hearing she will open and run the hearing so can i have the next slide please so the f sec is short for the energy facility citing council and this is part of the review process of fsac um we have a consolidated review process and fsac the council has oversight over most large-scale energy facilities and infrastructure within oregon we have seven members of the council they're governor appointed and confirmed by the state senate and they are volunteers and they are various parts of the state and bring a whole breadth of experience to our council for these decisions and odos which is short for the oregon department of energy citing division is the staff for fsac and so we have some staff here i am one of them i'm a senior sighting analyst i also have uh sarah esterson who is our policy analyst todd cornett is our council secretary he's also our program manager and behind me is wally adams he is also one of our policy analysts i and um nancy hatch who is helping as an administrative assistant in our department and she is helping facilitate this meeting next slide so very briefly i just wanted to give you an overview kind of a schematic of both our process and where we are at in our process so in the beginning the applicant files a notice of intent that notice of intent is open for public comment and it initiates the agency coordination that we do and it's basically the initial plan or proposal for the project the next step is the project order the department odo will issue a project order and the project order will review the notice of intent and the project information and basically set the framework of what the review and the analysis needs to be within the draft proposed order for the project and after that point um it says the parameters for the analysis within the project boundary and the things that that the applicant needs to prepare and submit as part of the pre-application and the application so the pre-application the preliminary application for site certificate gets and there is a entire process that goes between the applicant and our department from the pasc to the asc and that is where there's a lot of requests for additional information we review and analyze the information and the studies that's provided we take the reviewing agency coordination information and what comes out of that is a revised and then a final application and the application for site certificate is not the final application until the department deems it complete so once it's deemed complete then we do initiated round of agency coordination and start the drafting of the proposed order the draft proposed order and once the draft proposed order is is we issue it and it's open for public comment and so we have issued the draft proposed order we issued it on april it was posted on our website it went out in publication as a public notice we have emails that go out and whole distribution list of how how people get and notified that the draft proposed order is out it's available for review it's posted on our web page and our website so people can go and review it and review any sections or any exhibits any parts of the application that were and then once that is done and we are drafting the proposed order um and it's drafted and we've published it then we have a comment period and that comment period is opened at the initiate when it goes public and it's issued and then it will run through the public hearing and typically it closes at the end of the public hearing and so tonight is where we're at in the process so we are at the public hearing on the draft proposed order and so this is an opportunity for those who are interested who may not have submitted written comments or comments through our comment portal to make public comment it's also an opportunity for the applicant to be here and they're here and i'm going to introduce them really our applicant is nolan hills llc represented and a whole subsidiary of capital power i believe i got that right so matt martin is the lead person for capital power and he is here with two of his team linea fossum who is with tetra talk who helped do the lead on all of the environmental review and the application parts that they submitted and then to mcmahon who is also here as i believe your legal support or legal counsel okay of me turning around is it going in and out okay okay good because i can't really hear how i sound when i'm talking into a um so anyways that is where we are once the draft proposed order and the public hearing are closed then the department will move into the proposed order and that is basically taking the input any changes that may out of tonight or public comment and finalize the draft proposed order into a proposed order there's a process that we have called in a contested case and that is also going to have an alj assigned to them if it happens but it is um part of the public comment importance is that in order to be a member of the or participate in a contested case you have to have your comments on the record and then the final order and site certificate are the last steps the final order is issued and the site certificate is issued and that comes after council is finished so next slide so little project overview i know capital power will give a little bit more information in their section but for nolan hills wind um as i noted nolan hills is an llc and they're a subsidiary of capital power corporation um the proposed facility is in northwestern umatilla county and it is a proposed 600 megawatt wind and solar facility the site boundary which is what you see with the black line surrounding is approximately 48 196 and the related and supporting facilities for the facility will be um dispersed and centralized the battery energy storage system sys which we call a best and there are two proposed uh transmission lines the 230kv gentile lines and those are the lines extending out of the site boundary next slide so again this is another kind of overview of where we're at this is our procedural history so as i mentioned before the applicant filed a notice of intent they did this back in 2017. then the preliminary came in and originally it was only for wind and that was filed in february of 2020 and through that iterative process that i explained of requests for additional information that they respond to and revise preliminary application they also expanded the project design to solar pv to the wind so now it's a wind and solar project and by the time the application for site certificate they also included the bus and the transmission line so the whole project became what we reviewed in the final for site certificate which we didn't complete on january 31st of this year and as",

        "text": " it's also political um support as well and so you know you guys accepting the concept plan and then uh doing a resolution to you know make an ask that is a formal you know decision by the body that there's support for it the example that we always go back to is Damascus and you know I don't not the expert on what happened in Damascus but um there was uh there was maybe polit political unwillingness um and also from the voters as well and so you know it was they kind of saw it as a backward process you need to get the Buy in first and so we're going through that right now and so I think we check that box um the other boxes that need to check our yeah financing so we have an infrastructure memo that talks about um infrastructure financing for Sherwood West uh we will if we do a partial ask we can we can update that um they're looking at is the memo part of the memo is part of The Confident plan and and it lists all the tools in the toolbx could be used right and that's and that's um a start so there should there have to be a next step whatever the point is the next step in which um it gets more solidified as part of of what the community council um is going to require and then um in turn the steps that are required by other people to make sure that we can do that so again potentially Property Owners potentially Metro potentially the state potentially county isn't all that happen in the next St yeah I know I'm just saying if I that's some part of the decision we're trying to get to here yeah I'm just thinking out loud and forgive me I'm I'm thinking through what are the reasons Metro may say no right and or me say or we get a response back that has a lot of conditions on it you know we get a bunch of conditions we can say no then no we can but you know if we're going to ask we want it to be successful so I'm just try to think through what are all the that your previous point I'm where you're at of of going down the path of the of the full ask I I you could make a case for B to carve off the way down the road future low density stuff but beyond that it doesn't make any sense to do like c i I appreciate the work you guys put into it but C just seems like what are we even doing here you know yeah I I came in here leaning towards the full ask as well with the master plan so that we have control over there Keith brought up some good points there that of course I don't understand all that the the financing to make sure the infrastructure actually get and that would be the only reason I would even support B would be if if there's an argument to say carving off that low density and B helps us with the financing of the infrastructure you're saying no but like if it helps us sell that better then okay great but if not bring it all in if you know develops as it develops plan it all yeah there's a lot of push I'm getting a lot of political push that we should do full ask right but that's also opportunity well I don't care about political push I care about doing what's right no I agree too but what I'm trying to say is that's opportunity to get help on some of these infastructure problems so good point in so I think Taylor wanted to say something yeah Taylor go ahead oh yeah I was gonna say there's a lot of wha ifs and still a lot of you know road to travel here I feel like doing the full ask and getting the full plan and master planning areas and stuff like that puts us more in the driver's seat uh you know which should some of these what if situations happen right because we can kind of only deal with that initial decision ahead of us and if we're getting you know political support for it and you know we've got not all the home builders but as you said they don't all have to agree but you know a lot of them do and we've got some Builder support you know it feels like uh we could be in the driver's seat here more so than if we do the partial ask uh that is not as um you know it it wouldn't be as well planned at the end is my only thought unless I'm unless I'm understanding this right I was trying to is I need the help of some of these agencies to make sure that they're pushing that we get these financing tools as well and you know and for and that that's something I'm going to be asking them so hey Metro you need to push on Washington County if we're going to do a full ask we need this help so that makes that makes that makes more sense that's where I'm coming from in terms of positioning us ourselves so between now and January 16th conversations need to be had or or the first meeting yeah yeah and some of those conversations have already started and there potentially you know if it there's other the state supposedly has money that they're trying to help you know boost housing production well and that's another that's another Source because you know right now the governor's office is kind of finalizing their uh their what do they call it their housing framework that's W HB 3414 and they are talking about infrastructure money to support housing but right now they're putting so many restrictions on it in terms of Heth support infrastructure in the area so like brookman's out um 20 units per acre and 20 units per acre of density and I don't think a developer is going to be interested in building that and surely W it helps us well is there a concern that Metro is going to reject if we do a full ask have they ever denied amount I've got a lot ofp Metro level whispering by saying do it do it do it so not worried about that right now I think one if I can just really quickly one of the considerations I know from Metro Staff that they're going to be looking at you know what Metro Staff is going to look at is different than the electeds um is is the criteria we have t we have criteria for just like when we approve stuff at Planning Commission Metro has criteria that we are demonstrating compliance with so that's what they're going to base their decision off of um you know their recommendation I'm sorry their recommendation to the council to their Council right Metro Council to their Council um uh the only feedback I've heard from staff in terms of a partial ask is you know we really want to think about a complete community and that's one of the boxes we need to check and so if it is a partial ask we'd have to make the argument that this is a complete Community um so I think sure would what you know the full ask definitely gets us there the partial ask I think we can make an argument for um certainly B I don't think C would be question and I think we have good Tailwinds on this this item too but you know when you look at the different types of asks the housing is a no break the industrial Mone is something that Metro has boed against in the past seems to be good momentum on that right now staff and Bruce have been doing an amazing job getting in front of all the different groups out there explaining why explaining why this important understanding it's not just about Acres it's about size of lots and all this kind of stuff so I think there's really good momentum there but I do worry a little bit that we might see conditions on the industrial side but so we need to keep pushing it and then you step them collectively As you move forward you just had the hunker down and and be stubborn back said we're we're trying to be good partners but but standing on our and yeah and Mak us feel clear I'm generally supportive of fulls too I just want make sure I have that tools and support Partners out there to get it correctly for the residences in the most western part that is gray out in the partial they were not wanting to come in to begin with they're mainly the the road alignment conceptual Road alignment I don't think that's why it was grayed out that was great out because that would be the last phase in sure it just coincidence but that also okay the Domino of infrastructures I wouldn't even fair to say all the people in the gray area would be against we've heard that yeah yeah okay we the most vocal I would say from that area of the yes we have five more minutes is there additional information that you would like to see for the next meetings in I think I'm ready make decision but we can wait till January if we want to there's no issue waiting right whatever whatever you guys what's stand where you thinking what are you can't make a decision I know but I mean along with your question the financing for the infrastructure I think would be the biggest to do the full ask just I don't know enough about that to to know what I don't know right now yeah it's it some it's very political I mean the headwinds in general right now are you got Washington County with big budget deficits because they burned down all their reserves over the last four years so they are looking for ways to supplement that so our Mis tip Transportation dollars are at risk right now uh the Cy's portion of wccls Library funding is at risk right now so that's where where in my mind a lot of the uncertainties coming around this and talk about is directly related to M Bond against that stuff so at the end day doesn't do whether isn't that just a more about when it develops whether we bring it in or not right like if it at least if we bring it in it's there ready when the funds are ready we just have a little leverage right that's we have yeah so we should use it we should use it yes information to more information I don't know what else about financing wish I had one you me both yeah you I me we can bring the details of what the what that memo says right now I mean I mean I just tell you quickly we look really good on Transportation we'll bring it back but there there are some and I think the thing you got to keep in mind is this is conceptual so it could be you know we can't get to certainty um but we can get to relativeness which is what we're talking about if you do a partial it's going to be less and we would be more concerned if it's the",

        "text": " the work of the um the interagency work that was completed uh recently to get lost in in Translation so we have the climate change adaptation framework which is you know not only a response to climate changes but also you know feeds back in and helps with mitigation as well um when it's seen all the way through and we have um you know more than a dozen I think it's 18 or maybe 21 state agencies that worked on this together um and and as have and has a really nice series of recommendations in it so maybe a featuring that or presentation on what's in there might be helpful as well but I think it goes to not duplicating effort and making sure that we've gone back and picked up some really good ideas that are already on the table my cat has joined the meeting I'm sorry um you know one of the discussions that's come up from time to time from that staff interagency staff group is you know is the global warming commission a place to kind of hear that integrated and identify needs because there might not be one other One-Stop shop to kind of do that but I think it'd be great to better understand what would be value added to that uh really important interagency work that the commission could um could provide and so maybe that's a question that we could ask about as we go through the development of the draft proposal and we could either talk about it generically and look at the broad set of recommendations or we could even come through the door of one very specific implementation piece which is the um climate change social vulnerability assessment that we're doing right now and speaking specifically with um local communities on what they're seeing on the ground and so that might be another way to hear a little bit more about that project absolutely great great Point uh um thanks chair McDonald and I uh what I want to say dovetails very well with what director Bateman was just flagging um I don't know if I hate to to um dilute a focus on Equity by itself but I a lot of there's a lot of overlap between health livability and equity and um how tying back to the one line in in the global warming commission statute about recommendations about the effect of climate change on people in Oregon you know how do we have as a focal point um things that tie into many of the other topics here certainly for the cprg for the climate pollution reduction grants there's a point that I wanted to flag I don't think you mentioned it Colin that it is very strictly focused only on mitigation it explicitly prohibits a focus on adaptation but as you know director Bateman was saying a lot of active actions that um are about mitigating greenhouse gases also really help with adaptation and with building resilience in our communities and so how do we in that context in the context of implementing the the framework the adaptation framework um and also in the work that was flagged in the commission's report about kind of phase two of the the the recognition that there needed to be more um analysis and and data collection to be able to better analyze the co-benefits the health co-benefits of mitigation Investments there's a whole kind of connected um set of strands from all this work that boils down to what you know what is it doing for the state for people in Oregon how does it connect with Investments that our legislature is having to make um especially if it reduces expenditures Health expenditures or other expenditures so I don't know how to capture that that the best uh and and it really ties to equity right um so the yeah Equity is certainly the environmental justice mapping tool is great but there's a broader Equity health livability portfolio there that is a good lens to look at many uh many of these elements that isn't a very coherent crisp um item but I just wanted to see if the great brains uh on the team there at Odo could come up with something that would be a good vehicle for for the commission going forward to keep a lens on that and and lift um lift those issues because it's where it really connects to what people in Oregon feel and experience absolutely really good point and um and does pick up that thread that we talked at length about in a subcommittee um when we were thinking about how how these different the different recommendations and programs we were thinking about might might provide how we might design them to make sure that they're Equitable and enhance the livability of all oregonians um commissioner apter yeah thank you um well I just first want to just really appreciate that we're having this conversation now and commend you and Zach for laying this all out and just having a clear starting point for us to Think Through in terms of how um we'll work together and and focus in the coming months um I definitely agree with in particular the road map as as kind of a guiding Post in terms of how we're thinking about considering these different policy areas right we already have that laid out so we're thinking about updates and tracking and hearing um you know getting information from agencies and other entities as processes move forward in parallel I think you know the roadmap that you already put so much time into um makes a lot of sense to to work from as a guidepost for prioritization um I do certainly agree with commissioner Sheeran that we don't want to duplicate efforts or confuse existing processes but I think especially reflecting on you know the role of the Commission in the Years coming out of EO 2004 and just making sure that we have a place for shared for information sharing and coordination I think we all recognize that's going to be all the more important in the Implement implementation phase um coming out of all the progress the last two years so um I think continuing to think broadly and in particular and appreciate what Gabriella just brought up um how we can use this as a place to maybe not get additional you know input not confusing processes but at least have that information sharing as another place for stakeholders and decision makers to know what's going on in a number of different areas um around the state related to to climate and policy implementation um I think the one piece that came to mind that I'm not seeing or haven't I don't think explicitly heard that's related to that coordination that will be really important is the the federal funding conversation we know there's so many opportunities new grant opportunities being announced every day that's you know both at the state level competitive grants but also um related to funding you know tribal funding opportunities communities local um I think that's also really important to our continued EJ and Community engagement but also just again thinking about how do we get that information out there and really coordinate and identify um what seems you know what should be a priority for the state to be going after or otherwise this could be a venue over the coming months to just keep track and strategize together on that Federal funding piece great thank you commissioner after we've kind of Blended clarification with um thoughts on how we go forward what's missing how to best approach it um does anybody want to go back to any of the other um preliminary slides or any other thoughts that can come up with the discussions discussion questions uh commissioner Ford thank you um just one quick comment about how much flexibility we should build in um uh chair McDonald I know you're a very um you know you you like to uh keep our schedule full and active let's just say uh which is great because we are we are making progress uh but I do think it is important that we we do uh keep some time available for things that we're not aware of we're coming down the road here um it is a little uh a little bit um uh the list of things that we could put ourselves into um and I just want to make sure that we do leave a little space for us to be able to respond and react um as necessary particularly as the legislature uh moves and or agencies might be looking for some additional thoughts or guidance from the global warming commission so just something to keep in mind I think is important yeah absolutely commissioner Ford I um I mean I like the idea of being able to kind of forecast to the greatest extent because I think we do want to coordinate um a number of different agencies that are and entities that are doing really important work to implement aspects of the roadmap to you know Advance the work that we'll be needing to do depending on the results of the legislation uh and so I like the idea of being able to forecast it but I think because I think that will help those other entities you know know that we might come to them in February or you know sometime in the next six months on a topic but at the same time retain that flexibility to shift things around and and I think we can find a good balance um you know signaling our interest but um trying to be responsive and adaptably manage our our agenda just one quick additional thought which um commissioner Sharon's comments that was with will will take a nice supporter comments about inviting folks in but I I also think it's important for us to look outside our state boundaries and spend a little bit of time and energy you know understanding and evaluating what's going on um in other locations that may inform us and and so I do think we need some time in our agenda to um to hear from others and or get reports out about what but what what might be happening with our neighbors uh or across the country for elsewhere um that could help inform us so because you know it's we don't want to reinvent the wheel either on things that um good ideas that are coming elsewhere from elsewhere so just another thought on that yeah absolutely we've had some really good prison in the past from Washington and California on work that are happening in those two states and those are the ones that are coming to mind that I I remember us digging in on but I'm sure there are a lot of other presentations that we've had in in past meetings from time to time that I have been I think really beneficial we have a couple more minutes for this any other reactions to these kind of broader discussion questions commissioner rietman uh here I guess that uh I'm wondering how to incorporate the comments that I'm receiving from the commodity organizations and and it's related to the Natural and working lands uh committee work which has done very well I might add and I'm very pleased with what they're doing so I I just want to make sure we don't alienate uh you know a whole sector of of",

        "text": "ites in a small area on the lakes west shore near the dock most of the park's 204 acres are natural forest and grasslands first time visitors are stunned by 360 degree views unmarred by man's judge webster said that idaho power had considered the morgan lake plan they're great at considering not so good on carrying through in her opinion she stated the project would not be inside the park boundary idaho power has repeated that so often that she seemed to think it was relevant the recreation rule is that the area two miles from the project site boundary should be evaluated she ignored the fact that one tower will rise only two-tenths of a mile from the wetlands of little morgan lake and that will be only one of 13 130 foot towers visible to the south and west describing its proposed mitigation idaho power refers to lower towers but in their exceptions they have never mentioned that four 150 foot towers they first proposed will be replaced by 13 130 foot towers the historic group who wrote the revered morgan lake plan as well as current hikers and murderers who value the park's completely undeveloped areas would be horrified by the industrial intrusion of 13 130 foot transmission towers marring their views from the park's protected natural areas obviously the project will result in a complete reversal of the morgan lake and judge webster's decision should be and i'll use the rest of my time to answer your question about methodology that provides information about significant impact on viewers of these areas under discussion since 1995 the forest service sms has been used to evaluate forest properties that will be impacted by a project it contains a 13 page chapter on constituent information and how to gather it you miss barry any questions from okay thank you good afternoon for the record jocelyn peace for idaho power company uh about a year ago the council considered an interlocutory appeal in connection with issue r2 in that appeal the council already determined that idaho power is not required to demonstrate compliance with the morgan lake plan because no project component is proposed to be located within morgan lake park that is a jurisdictional issue the project is proposed to be located entirely outside the park however the council determined that designations contained in the morgan lake plan are still relevant to demonstrating compliance with the recreation standard because the council's definition of significance requires an assessment of impacts to the importance of a resource and the council considers any special designation or management of the location when determining whether a recreational opportunity is important as a result of the council's order explaining the scope of r2 the remaining issue in this contested case is narrow idaho power must demonstrate that the company adequately considered the values and objectives of the morgan lake plan when assessing whether the impacts from the project will be significant based on the importance of morgan lake park consistent with that direction from the council idaho power assessed the values and objectives of the morgan lake plan to determine whether scenery was a valued attribute of morgan lake park and incorporated that assessment into the company's analysis of potential impacts therefore idaho power properly and appropriately considered the morgan lake plan in the context of determining compliance with the council's recreation despite the council's order that idaho power need not demonstrate compliance with the morgan lake plan ms berry continues to argue that the morgan lake plan governs the sighting of the project simply put it does not ms berry suggests that because the morgan lake plan is within the analysis area for the project within the two miles that idaho power must comply with the morgan lake plan ms berry is incorrect the fact that the morgan lake park is within the analysis area for the project simply means that idaho power must analyze the park in connection with the development of the project and not for compliance with the morgan lake plan it's the recreation standard that governs not the morgan lake plan ms barry's assertion that idaho power has not provided a complete analysis of impacts to morgan lake park is also idaho power has provided a complete analysis first through the company's asc then it refined the analysis in response to dpo comments and again in the contested case process at each turn idaho power considered the input from the dpo comment comments and from the limited parties in this case to expand the scope of its analysis and in fact idaho power proposed substantial additional mitigation to reduce impacts in morgan lake park such that the project would not be visible from approximately 84 percent of the park based on the foregoing idaho power provided evidence in the record that the impacts from the project would be less than significant and request that the council affirm the hearing officer's conclusions regarding issue r2 thank you miss pease any questions from councillor condon cindy condon um quick question on the 16 that it will be visible do you yeah can you give a feeling it seems like i read it in here um is that used uh like are there trails through that 16 of the my understanding is that area is um that there are some trails and that it is primarily undeveloped dispersed recreation and we understand from comments that were provided in the dpo comment process and then in in the contested case that that is a valued attribute of the morgan lake park which is why idaho power also analyzed that area in the initial analysis the company was much more focused on the developed areas of the park where there are camping sites and a boat dock and around the lake where it's used for fishing based on that analysis it was determined that there would be hardly any impacts at the park because the project wouldn't be visible from those areas however when we expanded the analysis we did recognize that there would be a certain amount of impacts in those areas where um there is dispersed recreation and just a quick follow-up on that so just with respect to the 13 lower can you just give some idea of um how much that really do do do you most of those to be screened by trees i know i know there will be some certainly so in the um as part of its rebuttal filing idaho power had submitted a video simulation that's that can provide a sort of a representation of how much you might but to i guess to to back up a little bit um the idea with reducing the tower heights is that it would be the entire area you where the towers might be visible in the vicinity of morgan lake park and so it's now a three mile stretch that will be changed to h frames and then those towers would be visible in only that 16 of the park there's a significant portion of the park that's forested or where the views would be obscured either by topography or by trees thank you what do you say jeff we really need to be keeping this to the exceptions that have been filed and the responses to those so any other questions of miss p's council row assist on behalf of the department of energy again i'll repeat the issue that was before the hearing officer because that's what we're here for an exceptions the issue that was before her was whether the visual impacts of the proposed facility structures in the view shed of morgan lake park are inconsistent with the objectives of the morgan lake recreational use and development plan so are they inconsistent with the plan and if they are should visual impacts then be ms barry takes exception to the hearing officers finding that idaho power is not required to demonstrate compliance with the morgan lake plan because there are no projected proposed project components within the park we believe that lj got it right the hearing officer correctly held that the morgan lake plan is intended to apply to management of recreational opportunities within the it does not establish specific criteria that would apply to construction in operation of a transmission line located outside of the park boundaries so this proposal is not inconsistent with the morgan lake plan so as ms p's really what you need to look at is the recreation standard not the plan it's not inconsistent with the plan now you ask well is is what they're proposing inconsistent with the recreation standard that essentially is beyond the scope of what this exception is the recreation standard though looking at that does not automatically require compliance with plan requirements within the analysis area ms barry doesn't contest the finding that there aren't facility components within the boundary of morgan lake park uh or that the applicant didn't adequately consider the goals and objectives of the plan we believe for that reason it was appropriate or the exception should be with regard to the mitigation that's been proposed in the closing arguments on issues sr2 sr3 sr7 applicant proposed an additional condition to expand the use of the shorter h-frame towers as has just been discussed specifically that condition would expand the use of the proposed mitigation the lower towers to mile posts originally was from mile post six to mile plus 6.9 and now they're suggesting it go from mile post five to mile post in the proposed contest the case order the hearing officer doesn't appear to rely on that proposed amended condition in reaching her conclusion the department could recommend that council or i'm sorry the council could include that proposed amended condition as an applicant representation hold them to it in the final order and modify you know modify the pcco to say okay we'll find compliance with this condition based on your representation that you will include the shorter h-frame towers in this expanded area retiring their apologies if i did counselor jenkins did you have a question i think that's appropriate yeah okay this is hamley any other question or any questions we're to the if we do what we've been doing on in the past we won't continue we'll go ahead and do a a straw poll on r2 it's just this part of r2 right yeah just this exception right yeah i think i i'd like to do that keep them okay so i did better talked about the uh expanded distance for the age frames was there uh agreement that council wanted to include that and make that a representation of that condition yes i'm seeing enough head done okay so then agree with finding the fact conclusions of law and conditions of approval in the proposed contested case order pertaining to issue r2 with the following again general concept hold the applicant to the representation to require the expanded distance for the shorter h-frame towers adjacent or in proximity to morgan lake and then we'll get",

        "text": " land use planner um as a planner I'm um wary of NIMBY arguments against proposals as a general rule as I think that neighbors should be prepared to give a little for the general and larger benefit of the community um you may feel that a large part of what you're hearing tonight is uh reflects Nim concerns but I think that the proposed project actually poses a number of legitimate concerns it's a rather complex issue a few of which I want to touch on tonight um two issues or two questions stand out in particular to me um one is will the project displace current users and I have to agree with a previous speaker here tonight I think it definitely would there's a large number of Hispanic uh groups of people who use the park the south end of the park um on a daily basis and um a large um proportion of residents in the Northeast Salem area that is grossly underserved by parks are are Hispanic um members and I feel that those people are going to be uh squeezed out for lack of parking uh the second key question that stands out to me is is the project consistent with existing City policy and and um from what I understand it appears not to be consistent with the Bush Park um plan or um the wishes of the Bush family and I think it's imperative that any proposed uh city project be found to be consistent with existing City policy um before it's approved thank you thank you all right that concludes public comment councelor Stapleton the consent calendar I move approval of the consent calendar with one exception item 3.2d pulled by councelor Hoy motion by Stapleton second by Phillips counselor to your motion thank you the consent calendar tonight consists of items 3.1a the June 10th 2024 draft city council minutes item 3.2a the internal borrowing from the city's

and that concludes the consent calendar thank you councelor is there further discussion will the recorder please call the rooll councelor Barney I councelor Stapleton I councelor nioka I councelor Phillips I councelor Gwyn I councelor Gonzalez hi councelor Hoy hi councelor nordik absent mayor Hoy I motion passes all right we are now on to public hearings uh so item 4A on our supplemental budget the Salem City Council will now hold a public hearing to receive testimony pertaining to supplemental budget 3 for unanticipated City expenses in the emergency services fund the hearing will begin with the staff presentation individuals testifying are limited to 3 minutes thank you thank you and I see we have cie lenbach from the budget office there at the podium be sure and hit that button so the green light comes on and we will open the public hearing good evening mayor and city council my name is Callie linenbach and I'm the budget manager with the city and I have a few brief slides this evening to walk you through supplemental budget three in order to assist Faulk Ambulance with Emergency Medical Response the fire department has been operating City medic units since the covid-19 pandemic due to this increased activity actual expenditures are expected to exceed exist existing budget Authority and as a result a supplemental budget is needed to maintain budget compliance in the emergency services fund for school year 2024 these increased expenditures are offset by an increase in program Revenue so a little bit more detail about the action additional revenue from City ambulance services is estimated to be just over $2 million unanticipated expenditures associated with the program include $45,000 for salaries and wages approximately $1.3 million for for bad debt write-offs and $750,000 for transfers to other funds for a total of $295,000 of additional budget appropriation for fiscal year 24 um bad de write-off occurs when Ambulance Service when ambulance services are provided and the full cost charged is not able to be recovered from a patient or their insurance provider many health insurance plans including both Medicare and Medicaid set a maximum amount allowed which is the amount the plan will pay for a service anything over that amount allowed is that is buil um is not reimbursable by the insurance and also cannot be buil to the patient so it has to be written off um a little bit more about the transfer to other funds this just creates budget Authority for the general fund to be reimbursed for the cost of the employees who are running the city medic units so in order to stay in budget compliance staff recommends adoption of resolution 2024 33 thank you we have nobody signed up for a public comment on this item do we have questions for staff I will close the public hearing councelor Stapleton do you have a motion yes I move that city council adopt resolution number 202 24-33 fiscal year supplemental budget three increasing resource and expenditure appro appropriation Authority in the the Emergency Services fund I'll second that motion by Stapleton second by nishioka counselor to your motion um I don't have much to add um Cali did a great job of explaining it all to us and thank you for your time on that further discussion will the recorder please call role councelor Stapleton i councelor n yoka i councelor Phillips hi councelor Gwyn I councelor Gonzalez I councelor Hoy I councelor nordik absent councelor vanney I mayor Hoy I motion passes all right we are now on to item five special orders of business item 5A and we have Rob Rob this is an amendment and restatement of an agreement between the City of Salem and Willam University for use of spec Kean Stadium molik stadium and Bush's Pastor Park good evening mayor city council uh my name is Rob rnach and I'm the city's Park planning manager uh this evening I have a couple slides an introductory presentation to introduce this this item start rolling through here so the the what the issue to the in front of you tonight uh its purpose is to update and amend uh a long-standing agreement the city has with Willam University uh the agreement outlines responsibilities for use and maintenance of the various facilities that are located in Bush's pasture Park as well in in the city or the University's property which is shown there on the right outlined in white so that's the property they own fee title to um the amendment also addresses Public Access and future improvements to their facilities so those are the components of the amended agreement key terms of the agreement the start list the list here is integration so we're consolidating several agreements that have um been struck over over a period of time beginning in the 70s bringing us to now uh those Agreements are T are all dating back from the 70s and 80s but all the that all those components are being Consolidated into this one agreement before you this evening um as I mentioned before it does address the use of facility that would be the use of University facilities for both the city programs and for the school district's use uh as well as um a a fee waiver um for the city's program which is the kids relay at molic stadium and so that's why that compon stadium is now a component of the agreement is because of the speed waiver aspect it also addresses maintenance uh the current agreement we have with the uh University requires the city actually to mow the baseball field which we we don't actively do I'll admit that um but that's just a sign that the agreement needs to be updated to reflect the current reality of the situation and so it clearly delineates the maintenance responsibilities between the two parties um a lot of discussion this evening already but it does uh pave the way for some improvements to the baseball facilities including Synthetic Turf New Field lighting um adjustments to entryways field netting at all at the baseball stadium um Additionally the university has agreed to maintain the wind screens on Bush's pasture Park tennis courts they'll they'll put put them up and then maintain them over time um the agreement continues to provide for public use of the University's uh facilities in exchange for the encroachment of their facilities onto Park property and it does include a termination Clause so there's an opportunity for either party to terminate the agreement on an annual the proposed improvements again include improvements they include new Synthetic Turf installation on the baseball field New Field lighting adjusted entrance way field netting and new fencing all those new improvements the area of additional encroachment into the park is identified in that image in the pink shaded area and the blue pink shaded area is the current uh encroachment that is allowed under the current agreement we have with the university Rob could you you just clarify you're not talking about anything related to the football field where it's also kind of pink yeah no just to clarify the the pink shaded area here as well as a very area the mouse can there's a little lag with that Mouse yeah I'm real close to it there the corner so there's those two small areas yeah can you tell us can sorry to interrupt you with questions already can you tell us what's this Square footage of the new area you know I don't have that um that tonight for you but I'll tell you that the University's Total Property there is 11 and 12 acres to give you a sense of scale um so we're talking about a Rel several hundred square F feet at most we're not talking about a significant area okay I have some images I'm going to show that might be helpful as well so the largest pink area in my previous slide is the back side of their stadium and it's pictured here so you can see this this is what the park property condition is today these are some renderings of what the university is proposing um here you can see um the net net I mentioned as well",

        "text": " Lisa and I have reached out to about 65 external reviewers nationally with the abundance of them in the Pacific Northwest but some key individuals on the East Coast who have been doing this kind of work for a considerable period of time and we've asked them to provide written comments to what the technical teams as well as Lisa and I have conducted numerous one-on-one conversations that we've recorded with these individuals as well we're compiling all of that in a document so what we hope to present to the Oregon global warming commission at the ex you know with the at the end of the project or toward the end is this draft document that describes what the technical teams produced gives you that flavor and layer and perspectives of what the advisory committees believe and think should be practices in Oregon and then gives you the flavor and perspectives of external reviews we think that that rich presentation of information will give you Oregon global warming commission what it needs to move forward with activity-based metrics for Oregon Lisa just also acknowledged oda's um leadership on the technical team as well yes absolutely thanks for that so the third uh key deliverable for the project is community impact metrics and so what we did is uh instead of going straight to metrics we thought about the framework for the state of Oregon and what type of framework the state could potentially adopt and then from there sort of the tendrils would lead down into Community impact metrics as you think about all of the different types of communities that could be defined in the state of Oregon whether those are geographically based demographically based we can Define communities in a number of ways and so we wanted this framework for Oregon to be as Broad and representative as possible but then allow for some of the local more finite details to be able for for a community to be able to use those more subtle local approaches so thinking about the framework and developing that draft framework was actually the biggest part of this piece of the project once we developed that framework and we did an international literature review looking at all the different types of frame Frameworks that other countries Etc have used and then thought about it in terms of a state scale so what we came up with is the framework and then a menu of opportunity that communities however they describe themselves could use and so they've got this huge Suite it's hundreds literally of community impact socio-economic metrics and here's just an example of some in different buckets so here's some example of Education socioeconomic metrics you know things like the percentage of third graders that read at that grade level or perhaps some food Security based ones like the percentage of population that is food insecure or those that have Equitable access to healthy options and so by looking at all of these different buckets a community as they describe themselves could pick and choose based on which of these buckets might be important to them it might be a community in Corvallis Oregon that's really done a lot of work on sustainability like it's done in the past so they might gravitate more towards some sustainability metrics and there could be lots of other examples as to interrupt where we are in the processes we've developed the draft framework we've developed the draft menu of opportunity metrics in the advisory committee is now looking at all of this and they're coming up with a smaller list a subset of these that they think would fit the majority of Oregon communities and so it's it's an interesting exercise to think what all of these State Co or all these advisory committee members that represent a broad geography in Oregon how they how they might think of a smaller bucket of these for all of Oregon go ahead Kathy yeah thank you Lisa uh Lisa has kind of been emphasizing the way communities might use this broader framework to drive you know sustainability and and other programs too which I think will be a really good resource for communities the main intent in the natural working lands proposal was to develop these Community impact metrics to help inform how at the state level you know local um municipalities would would design programs and and track the the um present you know how how programs are are doing towards a set of of goals so that's and and specific to mitigation so that's the primary but I I think that INR really has done um above and beyond to kind of assemble all this information that can provide really uh helpful information to communities on a broader set of um ways of thinking about setting Community impact metrics yeah thanks for that Kathy and you you could see as you look through a number of these examples many of the state agencies can definitely consider some of these as far as their as far um well for their programmatic look at things as well so it definitely has a multiple purpose and for some reason I forget that agency piece of it I'm not sure why but it's definitely applicable to both so thank you for reminding me the um fourth deliverable for the project is the Workforce Development and training needs assessment in gap analysis of natural in working land sectors in Oregon this was a really cool piece of the project because it allowed us to look at Workforce Development and training needs assessments all over the country in a couple in Canada and pick and choose what we thought were the best pieces of those and then draft draft uh an assessment and GAP analysis scope of work for Oregon and then what we did is we went out to a bunch of experts in Oregon that deal in Workforce Development and we had focus groups one-on-one conversations we had back and forth with our draft scope of work and we created what we think is a pretty rich scope of work for the state of Oregon to put this out there and have someone describe how much it would cost to do this across these different land sectors for the state of Oregon and Kathy L pumped this piece to you to describe where we are in the and I'm going to pundit to Zach or him to describe that thanks Zach yeah absolutely so we are very close to publishing the request for information and again this would just be um a request for information not a request for proposals to try to help get information to further refine the scope of work um and also get a sense as Lisa was saying of how much it would cost and there is some overlap with um Senate bill 530 that we talked about earlier in the meeting that there may be some resources coming to be able to do the work that's outlined in the scope of work and so there's a lot more to move on but when this request for information is published it will likely be out there for about six weeks folks will have an opportunity to ask questions and then be able to provide some information on the questions that are in the request for information and then again Lisa and her team and the advisory committee and others will work on we're finding things thanks Zach and thanks for all your work and helping us get that out the door and you know one of the coolest things we thought about this piece of the project when we had these one-on-one conversations with Workforce Development folks around the state they were so Progressive in their thinking about how this could be done for the state of Oregon in a way that's not been done in Oregon before in terms of creating efficiencies filling gaps not creating you know a new program but taking the best of what Oregon has in current programs filling any gaps in in just in doing this in a way that's Oregon hasn't seen seen before so we're pretty excited about some of the language that they helped use in the design of this proposal it'll be really interesting to see what happens in the next steps and then the last piece of this is the natural and working lens inventory so the goal of this is to create proposals for greenhouse gas inventory again consistent with the ipcc framework and so the way we're thinking about it having a basic one and having a more advanced one so the basic one um you know has some of the more basic elements and the advanced one takes it sort of to the next level so the questions we're asking are what are the recommended methods to determine the current carbon stocks in net sequestration how do these stocks emissions in sequestration change Through Time what are the causes of these changes and how do we track those differences so where are we at on this one we've got a background and objectives for the inventory we have identified greenhouse gas inventory definitions and this is really a key piece to this project and it would be for any state that does something like this you have to develop common language and get informed consent on that language or else you end up with a mess on the other end and so after we got draft inventory definitions we work really closely with the advisory committee they added tremendous value to those definitions and we finalized those with the technical teams with with the work that the advisory committee did um and then the now the drafts of the basic and the advanced methodology have been developed the next step is going to be for the state and federal agencies to review and then we'll share those with the advisory committee so one of the key things that Kathy and I talked about prior to today's presentation is and this is the last slide it's just to share with you some issues associated with this project just to give you a feel for kind of how the project is gone and and how things are going so in terms of the advisory committee you know the goal was to create a committee representative of the diversity of oregonians as an Oregon global warming commission you did a really good job of that put out a couple of calls for people in different parts of the state representing different demographies to participate in one of the issues we ran up against probably a third of the way through the project today is integrating tribal perspectives in the Statewide process and it is it is because of the government-to-government relationship that Tribal Sovereign Nations have with the state of Oregon that was difficult to incorporate to date from our perspective in level on this process there was only one individual at the start of the project that was representing one element of a tribe and as a consultant to that tribe and not a tribal individual themselves that we're not comfortable in terms of representing tribes um and didn't feel that that was an appropriate function for the advisory committee so at some point the Oregon global warming commission is going to need to engage at the state level with the tribes in on that process but one of the things that we've struggled with a little bit throughout the process is the confounding of political and policy processes with our task which is science based",

here to talk about opportunity for approval of an application for the rural industrial property tax exemption program for a company known as everfab Inc in Aumsville so Marion County we implemented this program in order to support our businesses that are making a large capital investment and adding on additional employees and really supporting our community our program allows for a three-year exemption on property taxes for any new improvements to that business so we're not talking about property taxes for already existing we're talking about additional property taxes for those new qualifying the intention this program is really to give those businesses a chance to get that big capital investment in get their business up and operational before they're required to pay those property taxes on those improvements so really it's allowing those businesses an opportunity to get some return on investment before they have some additional funding requirements so the application for everfab was submitted to our assessor's office it's been reviewed and it meets all the requirements of the program if granted everfap will be required to follow up with all of the taxing entities that are that they're subject to and then they'll be required to receive support letters from at least 75 percent of those taxing so for 2023 the project site of 4050 Porter Way in Aumsville had estimated taxes of 11 800 so should the project commence at what was included in their application at 3 million in additional value the property tax exemption for the building and machinery would be about 30 000 for each of the three consecutive so that means at the conclusion of the exemption program the property taxes for the site are estimated to be about 42 000 a year so as part of the application everfab has indicated that they're going to be hiring an additional 28 employees at the site and that would make an estimated final total for that project of 68 full-time employees for everfab Inc in Marion County works with said core to help support our businesses and I'm happy to turn it over to Nick Harvel he's our said core's business retention expansion manager for Marion County and he can talk about everfab morning Commissioners Nick Carvel said if you have any questions about everfab it's great and I love that they're expanding and also Mr Cameron do you have any questions yeah thank you Mr chair Nick what's this expansion gonna I mean I know what they currently do what is this going to allow them to do yeah doubles their production capacity it's a great story because they started from nothing and over the last few years they've needed additional production because they've struggled to keep up they have a backlogged and this will help them reach their potential and they produce surround tub surrounds other things like bathtub shells like apartment complex bathroom shower tub shower yeah thank you Nick yeah Mr chair I just want to make a comment I believe we're still the only County that's implemented this um property tax credit and and the history of this for those that may not know I remember well I'm at Valley Vineyards did an expansion some years ago and uh Jim Bruno called me out for lunch and said hey I got this huge tax bill here we just finished the expansion and we haven't increased any revenues and at that time Tom and I and I think Bill cross went to work at the legislature and it took us about two two years to get this thing right and it's Nick you could probably tell better than I how many businesses and how much money is has been actually allocated towards expansion and this property tax deferred obviously those places are paying that property tax today in this case you'll see uh it'll be about a thirty thousand dollar savings if if I'm reading this right and yet that'll start to flow into schools into Special Districts after this three years goes by and it's it's a great incentive and I think it's for our existing businesses and I've always said this in the restaurant business that's where I come from is that it's easier to keep a customer than it is to go out and get a new customer and I think that's what this is all about is keeping our existing businesses and allowing them to expand and giving them an incentive to do that so thank you for your work and said of course work on this and Kelly thank you for helping to administrate this process I also like to remind everybody that there are Enterprise zones in cities and there's no Enterprise zones in rural areas so rural areas are always at a disadvantage when companies are looking to invest in capital projects especially like in a place like Marion County you can always invest in the city there's 20 cities you can always pick a city to invest in right in the rural areas and you can have a situation where the rural areas get hollowed out if if all the incentives are for the investment to go to the cities and not to the rural areas then over time there's fewer and fewer investments in the rural areas there's fewer jobs in rural areas and you can see it in some places like in eastern Oregon other states where they really get harmed over over time so my view has always been this sort of level of the playing field so it's you can the businesses can decide where they want to invest there's not a tax incentive to leave the rural areas and I think that's important for our rural uh no I'm just you know they're like he said their backlog we have a housing crisis in Oregon and you need a shower and a tub to live peacefully and I'm thrilled that there's people to produce them all right let's go I didn't have any backup of soap this morning Amazon okay I'll take a motion I move I moved approved and moved to approve a resolution approving a rural industrial Improvement property tax exemption for everpad Inc I'll suck in the motion do a motion a second is there any further discussion there's a lot of words there's a lot of improving in that sentence sorry got me hung up uh okay is there any any further discussion seeing on all those in favor signify by saying aye aye aye all right promotion passes okay thank you both thank you appreciate thank you uh Brian Nicholas is here and we're going to consider approval of amendment number one to the contract for services with AKs engineering forestry LLC to add 189.53 cents for a new contract total of 189.53 to add Federal and American Rescue plan terms and conditions and increase the compensation for consulting services for restoration projects in Marion County Parks to December 31st 2025. good morning good morning Brian Nicholas Marion County Public Works director standing in for Brian May this um yes so I'm here to uh seek board approval for an amendment to an existing contract awarded to AKs engineering and Forestry so um Public Works issued or awarded a contract to AKs it was a competitively bid contract and the contract allowed it was for engineering to help with our Wildfire recovery of parks plus some other work Parkdale Park here in East Salem is uh is one of the parks that's included in this contract obviously that's not a fire affected uh Park but uh it's one of the parks that it's included in the contract so the contract allows uh AKs to provide support services Engineering Services on any combination of seven parks in our Park inventory and the initial award was for a hundred thousand dollars we're seeking contract increase so I'll go I'll go through a little rundown of the services that we're looking to get completed under this contract um and uh and so you can see where that dollar amount comes from AKs uh we'd like to have them do some work for us in Salmon's Salmon Falls Park they've already actually done some work there um topograph topographic recovery survey the the budget for that would be thirty thousand five hundred dollars that provides a design base for the entire property for use in in our design work to redevelop the park also I would include resource study so Wetland delineation plus compliance documentations for threatened and endangered species we do have uh uh well we're using we're using FEMA funds for Recovery of Salmon Falls Park so we we have to comply with NEPA requirements um those are the two items of work uh that we're looking to complete using consultants in the Salmon Falls Park Bear Creek Campground there we're just needing to complete a topographic recovery survey again so we have a design base for that Park um the the budget for that would be twenty nine thousand dollars and then Parkdale Park is really the large one the the budget that we want to finalize there is ninety four thousand five hundred and twenty dollars in that scope of work would be uh the topographic recovery survey so we again have a design base for the entire park Parkdale being a Urban Park it's a little bit different than the uh than the rural parks and we can talk about that in just a minute in the scope would be that topographic recovery survey also resource studies there's a wetland in Parkdale Park so we complete the Wetland delineation there plus we also need uh threatened and endangered species surveys and compliance reports those sort of things in that budget is also a 30 design to provide like a long-term vision for how that Park would be built out and uh plus some public engagement support AKs has already supported us on two uh Town Hall meetings neighborhood meetings to get neighborhood feedback on the uh on a development plan for the park and all that tallies up to about that 177 thousand dollars um and I uh one thing I do want to point out that's a pretty good chunk ninety four thousand dollars is a pretty good chunk of money out of the 365 thousand dollars that the board allocated in arpa funds for Parkdale Park but with that because we have the 30 percent design and we've got Concepts to present uh to Grant agencies we have already used that 365 thousand dollars to get a 50 50 match from Oregon parks so we invest a little bit of money the 94 000 that's about a third of the funding or about a quarter of the funding that the board allocated for Parkdale Park but because we have a concept to present to Oregon parks so they understand what the vision for that",
