        "text": " sort of crazy period before we move into subsequent rounds we're actually going to move into trying to look into that providing some clar ification uh on some of the items based on what was required in Statue because this was actually a statutory requirement this consultation that made it into the rules but there was never any specified guidance of how that had to come in and we've done a lot to go to go deeper into our other required items to create that guidance and based on this round and and subsequent rounds we definitely see the need to go and try to re uh try to respell this out a little bit better for applicants on what we're looking for vers what the utilities can even provide at this point in time in a project cycle as when it comes to the feas yeah and we're happy to do it and it's actually pretty useful on our side to receive information ahead of time but maybe um like a a form or something like that to just kind of guide what is me what information is wanted from you guys because um they're not doing a full interconnection review that's not something but we are definitely taking a hard look at system protection and making sure that if um somebody receives a grant we are not going to decline the interconnection application because nobody wants that to happen but to do that system protection review is kind of what I'm talking about is um depending on the size of the project could take longer or shorter could be more complex less complex and there were some very large ones that came through okay yeah I think um as we as we dive deeper into this this feels like something that we might want to get a few of our U of our utility reps uh together try to find out sort of what is that process for you what is the from you know even the cus to the I what are what are the process and what are you really providing versus what we really needing at that time as well as what information would be valuable to you from an app from a project that's being a proposed project not an actual at this point and then formulate some guidance cuz I I know uh all of the utilities are going to have separate they're going to have separate pieces about what this really means what it entails what we're asking for what's good for them to have at this point in time uh as it's in a proposed state so I think that's a great I think it's a great example we were looking at doing that guidance but that'll even be more beneficial if we are able to touch vase with our with our utility reps and yeah happy to help with um our thoughts on our side if it would be useful wonderful thank you Audrey yeah that's something that's been in there it's it's it's on a it's on one of my famous post notes on my desk actually we need to address this yeah thanks for bringing it up and I think it's a rule thing it's a statutory and Rule thing yeah statute has something but it doesn't have like a letter it's like loose on what it looks like so remember us trying to figure out what even rule doesn't have rule says that that's one of the options is a letter U but the the it's built upon consultation with the utility and stakeholders for feasibility yeah great well with that I don't see any other hands up for me um oh wait Shannon's back hi Shannon come on back hi sorry being in a pest here um I'm trying great I'm trying to unpack and better understand and I Know It This is a whole other long hour and a half conversation but about what that BPA restriction is to the cus we're working with a couple um and we've definitely come up upon their own 25kw metering limits but this is clearly something else that you're talking about no it's the same thing they can only have a certain percentage of Renewables on their system so it's not just net metering it's like just a certain amount that they can have um and I back when this was first when this program was still first being built I could tell you like the percentage or the amount they were allowed to have but because of residential solar many utilities are like at their cap with BPA and so they can't add more Renewables without being in violation of their contract and it's something we actually have on our list a some of our staff are doing like a let's ask BPA questions sort of thing good on our list because they're doing their new provider of choice contract process and we're just sort of curious if there might be some movement on that because we get calls from I mean kind of unrelated to this program and hopefully this is useful information for others on the line and of interest but we'll get calls from like I remember specifically the Dows we've had a few calls that like have kind of accidentally Fallen my way in the years past um and it was the Dows specifically where there was a solar provider doing a lot of work to like get interest and then the homeowners were calling us to be like our utilities as we can't um like what can you do to fix this like was like an organized campaign to like call us to try to like fix the law only it's not us it's BPA it's Federal um so uh so yeah so it's definitely like an issue not just for large well in this I'm not saying LGE these are these are large compared to a a rooftop solar on a residence projects so these larger small scale projects like in CP um versus like residential they're even bigger right so then it's even more of a challenge for them to fit into the resource mix for some of those some of those um localities thank you that's that's really helpful I guess you just um Unearthed another priority policy yeah it's definitely an interesting interesting issue thanks yeah and those contracts last a long time and the one that is currently in place has been in place for a long time too so it was like you know back when that didn't see when that seemed like a lot of Renewables if that makes sense yeah yeah exactly so right so we need to get grol to P BPA and into shape got it peasy yeah no problems thanks Shannon and now I really think I'm happy to come back if anybody has any other comments or questions and I'll put my email address in the chat if anyone wants to reach out that way too wonderful all right well we'll uh go ahead and uh if you think of questions about the the legislative change concept uh we will we can jump back into that uh in the comment perod a little bit later on as well um but for now I'm going to go ahead and jump in as a a quick summary for our first two rounds of c um and this is just a really really big overview is that uh in our planning projects uh the ones you see on the left side of the screen these are the planning projects that have actually gone all the way through uh the grant process and have gone their grants are completed with their final dispersements uh have been paid out um and I believe uh each of those except for one uh is also a round three construction applicant uh clth community college did something a little different in round two uh or they would be included in this one uh and then we have a couple of construction projects that have completely wrapped up we're just basically pending uh inspection and a little bit more on one a little bit of documentation uh but they have notified us they are complete and we're setting those up so we'll be into grant complete and uh project completion on our first two construction projects from the program uh a lot of our projects are a lot more extended in time so that's why you're not seeing a lot more of the construction projects coming into uh completion uh and then one of the items that James will be talking about with our proposed rule changes will probably wind up We Believe are going to accelerate uh the timelines on a lot of the cup construction projects but we'll get to that in a bit um and uh and then of course along those lines about 11 to 13 uh grantees have started or near uh completion and as I said uh James will cover that second payment option uh that's probably going to present faster Cycles if we go to the uh next slide please and uh as many of you know on May 10th we wrapped up the third opportunity round for the C program uh it was we had 75 applications submitted which equated to about 47 million in funds requested uh the bucket we had available this round we actually bumped it up uh 6 million from 12 million in the first two rounds to 18 million uh in this round um which was a good thing because uh this was the highest number of applications for a c round uh as as well as uh overwhelming amount of the construction projects that came in which were a total of 55 41 of those uh are resilience projects and actually we're in the process of doing some information requests and we had a couple of projects select the wrong category on their application so we're very likely looking 43 uh potential resilience construction projects that would be moving on to a competitive review along with that we had 20 planning applications and as I said before with a couple of those round one planning grants that wrapped up another really really uh piece of exciting news for the program and really showing the efficacy of the program is that 22 of our 33 current planning uh grantees submitted for construction funding uh in this third opportunity round that represents 67% of our current grantees uh some of those have not completed their planning they're in that final stage of doing their project reports and their final documentation so that's how they were in a position uh to have the information necessary to be able to move their projects into construction so that's uh very very exciting it has also Amplified the competitiveness this has always been an excellent competitive program um but the uh competitiveness for the projects moving into competitive review has really gone up another notch and we're really excited for getting into that process for this third round if we could go to the next slide please and so as just a quick breakdown uh construction resilience recommends or uh uh equals out to 35 5.2 million in requests construction Renewables sits at about 10.1 in requests uh and then planning projects combined uh represent just a little over 1.5 million uh in requests and I'm going to go ahead",

        "text": " be measured on a portfolio basis and it has to already have that site certificate in place even to play and compete meaningfully in the rfp next slide in the end in this particular rfp the company received approximately 98 oregon bids that doesn't necessarily mean 98 completely separate oregon you know different bids can look like different configurations of essentially the same project and even that 98 number is sort of extrapolated from a report that was produced by what's called an independent evaluator in the regulatory process so it is fairly approximate but it gives a good idea of how many played and many were forced out even just by the interconnection process and this is also a conclusion of the independent evaluators report so the reason for that is diane referenced a move to cluster studies you know the company's irp had sent this strong signal that they wanted a bunch of oregon solar so a bunch of oregon solar projects all put in interconnection requests to be studied together in the cluster study that was ongoing in summer 2020 and essentially when pacific warp's transmission function looked at all of those solar projects together in a cluster they said we're going to need a ton of a ton of expensive and lengthy upgrades in order to accommodate interconnecting all of these projects um the those studies that i referenced said for some of these there would be a 60 or 72 month timeline to complete and that didn't meet with the required commercial operation dates that the company included in its rfp so these bids were excluded essentially just by virtue of getting a an interconnection study that said we can't meet your your online date so in the end the company's final short list the projects they selected in their rfp included just two oregon projects totaling 210 megawatts of solar plus co-located storage which again was less than half of that 500 megawatt number that their irp had had indicated would be beneficial for their customers next slide and now our second example here is pge's 2021 all source rfp which is ongoing pge is seeking about 150 average megawatts of renewable resources uh given the capacity factors of the resources on their preferred portfolio that's probably about 450 megawatts of renewables plus sufficient dispatchable capacity to meet uh some additional capacity needs so sort of a question what that dispatchable capacity resource might be could be pumped hydro could be batteries could be hydro slices you know something else but in any event they're out there looking for um for these resources and they're also going to explore uh an additional uh 65 average megawatts of renewables in order to help them meet that 80 emissions reduction requirement by 2030 that's in uh house bill 2021 um so again the company's preferred portfolio includes about 160 megawatts gorge wind on the oregon side so i'd probably be f-sectional projects and next slide this is probably a little hard to read on your screens but you don't need to read the whole thing the only piece i wanted to highlight there is that the rfp requires permits to be in place by the time of selection to the final short in order again even to be considered for selection in the rfp a project has to have a site certificate by the time the rfp is done which on the next slide is next week so the site certificates due by the final short list originally that was proposed to be april 5th uh there's been a little bit of a schedule adjustment so the current date for determination of the final shortlist is april 27th again this this rfp was launched last year a project had to be far enough along in the site certificate process to be confident that they would be able to have that site certificate in place this month in order to participate in the rfp at and i think does that take us back to you diane yes thanks max um so after they've gone through all this complicated rfp process um if they are selected then they would go through a contract negotiation and so even after all of this there is the potential to not end up with a contract and some of this can be attributed to market drivers maybe they find that they're not able to get those final permits or there's some sighting barriers or other things have come up and we will i will flag one important market barrier um that's happening right now later on and also just the different aspects of the risk that's there can be a barrier to finally constructing the project but all of this is really or i would like to flag that if it's a good project i have been told if it's not successful in this first rfp developers might try again for other ways to secure off-take this could mean that they need this would mean that they have to keep their site certificate valid so even if they secured the off take with this particular process they might try again or look for other so i think max highlighted this really well but just the takeaways on this piece is that just to participate they have to simultaneously pursue site control permitting interconnection transmission and all of these pieces are complex and risky um and it is increasingly competitive and so developers are trying to find ways that will give them a competitive edge in this bidding process which could mean being further along in a permitting process or having something else buttoned up that maybe others haven't it's worth remembering that utilities really are selecting projects based on unpredictable future economics and even selected projects can still as i mentioned before there's a lot more to this process and we aren't going to dive necessarily into it or we're not going to dive into all of these today just for sake of time and also really we wanted to highlight the interconnection transmission and off take pieces but i would be remiss in not taking this opportunity to talk about materials um partly because uh it's always had a big impact on projects especially solar but right now in particular there are some global dynamics that are really impacting projects across the u.s so of course with um the pandemic there have been global supply chain issues that really are impacting developers abilities to get what they need and materials on site which can delay uh startup construction and there are ongoing tariff investigations including one that was just initiated about a month ago so whether it's supply chain issues or other things impacting it there are changes in prices that can have cost with which if big enough could have uh impacts on existing contracts and just lead to more delays uh when they're trying to iron those out so i mentioned ongoing tariff you might have seen this in the news a lot of people are calling it the oxen investigation but essentially the commerce department has opened up an investigation into solar panels coming from four southeast asian countries which make up about 80 of the imported solar panels in the united states as saying that these manufacturers in these countries are actually using parts that should have a tariff on them but because it's coming from these four countries they're circumventing this tariff so there's this is an ongoing process but we are already seeing impacts on uh current projects and development and it could have continued uh ripple effects um pretty pretty significant ripple effects on projects and their ability to to start construction or even be uh since its earth day we thought we would end with um one of the pieces from the most recent um report that came out a little over a month ago um and this was an interesting one because they've come out with uh um an interesting how much solar capacity we'll actually need to do in order to limit ourselves to the earth to 2c excuse me let me back up i got lost in that sentence um in order to limit the warming scenario to two cent to two degrees celsius uh above pre-industrial levels the report is uh suggesting that we would need to increase our solar capacity by a factor of 15 by 2050 compared to 2020 and also a 10-fold increase in wind with 87 phase out of coal just to stick to that two degree scenario so that makes it uh that's a lot of work and a lot of site certificates for everyone involved but with that i would like to say thank you for your time and i hope this information has been uh useful for you and if there are any questions we'd be more than happy to take them and again just recognizing the importance of the work that the council and fsex staff in making these projects possible uh you're a really important piece of this puzzle of figuring out how do we get to the best case scenario for climate change and converting to renewable to do that so that i'd open it up for any any questions yeah thank you very much to both of you this is chair grail does anyone have any questions for max or diane this is cindy yes cindy um thank you and thank you both for being here today um i just have a couple of questions i'll start with my first so max i think you um started your presentation by mentioning you're not a trade association you're something um can you go a little bit deeper into that um and i'm familiar with trade associations and don't quite see the do you lobby do you what's the uh just if you can describe the yeah i'm happy to do that um so we're designed to be um an independent 501c3 it's in our bylaws that our board has to have coming from outside of our um developer and for profit membership so our board is uh dominated by our our ngo members you know there are certain pieces of advocacy we've taken where we try to be extra careful to um you know actually run work product by for-profit members to make sure that um being thoughtful and trying to balance their potentially competing commercial interests but a lot of a lot of the work we do we do entirely in-house and we report out to our membership um and um you know that's i think the main difference is the the the level of independence and staff drivenness of the work that we do so think if i can follow up on that um so do you have any um make any efforts to communicate with the public where your members are certainly looking for property security property do you have any of that public participation again do not do any work like that on a project specific basis so we certainly don't you know help developers identify landowners or communicate in that way we're not a grassroots organization we don't have",

        "text": " manager that protected area is a reviewing agency and will be asked to provide and recommendation at all the times that reviewing agencies is asked to provide comment and uh and then three requiring that public notice be giving to the protected area managers at any time i wanted to give you all just an idea of what the universe of protected area managers are most protected areas in oregon are either managed by one of four of the federal land management agencies that's the national park service the bureau of land management the forest service or the u.s fish and wildlife um state protected areas are typically managed by one of three state agencies the department of parks and recreation uh department of state lands in the department of fish and wildlife um there's a small subset of protected called state natural areas or as the rule currently refers to them state natural heritage areas that are designated by the oregon parks and recreation commission but they're actually owned and operated by other and some of those are operated or managed by private entities uh including the nature conservancy or another land trust and sometimes private landowners as well we heard a lot of support from stakeholders that some sort of notice should be given to protected area um managers and that you know i think most people agreed that early coordination with those managers is important and would uh help improve the citing process um but there wasn't a lot of consensus about what the right mechanism was um but when we had the the conversation about potentially appointing those federal agencies as reviewing agencies there was com some concern that we would be you know obligating them to participate when they might not have the resources or staff to do so um and that we may be kind of burdening the applicants with the job of uh you know doing that consultation when it may not be necessary we talked to our federal partners as well and you know most of them thought that a public notice would be sufficient as long as it happened early enough in the process that they could get their comments a lot of the concern is just involving the long lead times that federal agencies often need to participate in public processes outside of their jurisdiction so we are recommending that that public notice alternative be the one that is we have some kind of tricky stuff with implementation one because there's about a dozen public rules scattered throughout uh oar chapter three four five and um while we could go through and each one to say that a protected area identified in nia or application should receive public notice we actually think it may be better to just consolidate those um in a future rule making and that's how we can address some inconsistencies between some of the different noticing rules as so in the interim we're probably just asking the council to provide us with policy direction uh to add those protected area managers to a special mailing list and that way they'll they'll get the public notice for now and then we can make the formal rule amendment at a future rule making one of the concerns with this recommendation that came up was that it's hard to track down appropriate contacts at some of the property uh protected area managing agencies particularly during covid you know if we send a hard just a paper notice to um the national park service regional headquarters or something you know there may not be staff in the office to route that to the person who would be able to respond to it you know it's hard to track down specific individuals at the actual offices for the protected areas themselves um it's not impossible though so we are recommending that to to address this that we uh do to amend the information requirements in division 20 and 21 uh to require the applicant to do a little homework and get us reasonably available contact information for the protected areas managers many of the developers and other stakeholders thought that the council or the department uh more accurately could help this process along by publishing some of this information or at least kind of giving a source of you know here's where you should start or here's how you should go about getting the individual contact um we think that's worth considering and it's something we could possibly provide in the applicant guide in the future or at least get the headquarters information that's readily available in one single place to kind of give applicants a head start that's something we'll look at further but probably outside of the rule making process and so yeah in a nutshell that's our recommendation is to to just make sure that the protected areas managers get a public notice at any time we send out public notices other interested persons uh and that we would be changing the information requirements to collect the to to get the contact information from the applicant like i said this is really your opportunity to weigh in if you have any questions or deliberation or further direction to us we welcome it i won't belabor it too much though if you don't thank you christopher does anyone have any questions or comments at this time this is back to the options christopher yeah being councilmember oh thanks i thought somebody else had something to say i guess i'm a little bit concerned about if we're talking about protected areas i mean who who better um i mean i i don't quite understand uh the second alternative uh wouldn't be better and maybe i don't understand necessarily the reviewing agency i presume if you get a notice and you don't you don't respond as a reviewing agency that just wouldn't be considered in the mix i mean there'd be no comment to but it seems to me the manager has the most information and if they're mentioned in the site application why they wouldn't become important for input ongoing input into the project especially as they go on for years and years and years you know as they the the certificate is issued can go on for years and years and years so as opposed to just that one you know the one notice with the notice of intent i don't know why we wouldn't want to um have the area managers included along the way councilmember conan i i i can't respond to that there i think there's pros and cons to saying your reviewing agency or like you are just being asked to provide comment as you know any other member of the public um but under either alternative they would be getting notices throughout the process so a public notice for example goes out at the noi and then it goes out there's not as much involvement in the completeness review um but once the complete application is received we send out a public notice we send out a public notice of the dpo of the proposed order and there may be one more public notice that i'm not thinking about for the citing process but they would continue to get notices throughout the process they just wouldn't be um asked to one participate in the completeness review and they wouldn't be uh they wouldn't get the memorandum that like kind of gives them a specific request for input that a reviewing agency would okay sorry i misunderstood i i thought that the managers were just receiving that first note that there's a notice of and so it's at the very beginning of the process which i think is good um but after that they wouldn't receive ongoing notices so thank you for that claire yeah and that that maybe we had another alternative that we would basically just do an early consult with them and say you know at the noi phase two you want to be a reviewing agency and we decided that was untenable i think exactly for the reasons that you projects can go on for years uh personnel changes uh projects change so we thought whatever alternative we pursue it was important that it be carried out throughout the entirety of a project okay thank you other questions comments yeah this is hanley i think just general public notice rather than a reviewing agency because their their comments are going to be specific to their protected area you know i think the notice to them you know needs to be specific enough so that they but i agree with cindy that they need to be kept in the loop as we go through the at least initially thank you other questions comments to conserve time i concur with both councilor jenkins and councillor condon as well thank you well christopher um i don't know if what else you may need or you want to share at this point i might make an additional comment um specific names for agencies or you know organizations that's going to be tough i know that in the b2h process for blm we had managers that changed annually or even more frequently than that so i don't know you're you're asking the applicant to provide those names for you but um i think it's more important that it gets to the right place in the right council member jenkins thank you for that yeah and that was that was the comment we also heard from like the stakeholders both both the developers and the protected area managers themselves and in some cases you know they were able to say that there is a specific position but um i think kind of heard that if we could send a notice to the headquarters or to a generic inbox it would be routed uh to the right person and that would be good enough um and if we were able to identify the correct individual within the agency um that we could you know maintain that relationship and that the citing analysts would be able to work with them the level of specificity is unclear the way that we wrote the the rule was to just require reasonably available contact information hopefully that that strikes a balance but um we'll keep that in mind any other questions comments this is kent and i just say another excellent presentation by mr thank you thank you kent well with that um so sorry just we're uh only issue two on the presentation yeah two of two of twelve uh uh i might go back to my summary slide and actually just ask you uh if there are specific issues you'd maybe like more information on rather than going through them all one by one um i first of all i want to apologize when i thought you had kind of wrapped up when you said here we are and i just totally didn't even look at the agenda anymore so i apologize you do what you got to do i'm so sorry so i apologize as well so if i can chime in it's i know it's already been a long meeting and the the last agenda item really took it out of us so i mean i think you know if you do have sort of the mental capacity to continue on i think it would be valuable to for us to get feedback you know today on this but we could also um you know revisit this at a future meeting if you felt you were you're done today council what's your pleasure well",

        "text": " very easy to see but um there are are more than 107 yellow dots representing turbines on this map and that's because there are some alternate locations so not all of the turbine locations would be um constructed uh you can see the proposed transmission line carridor um reflected by a red line covered with uh little triangles going through the center of the site um and this is kind of helpful to see where the final alignment was proposed on the western side um it has been rerouted I think to avoid um both some agricultural features and then other energy uh facility development associated with the other wheat rdge um and uh you can't see it very awful but I do have other slides showing where the proposed substation sites are um so actually yeah if you can give me the next slide Nancy great uh yeah so uh as you can see there the site with the proposes change in RFA 1 would include two substation sites uh one on the the left side of the slide is north of uh of butter Creek uh sorry and uh that would include a the expanded battery energy storage system Capac uh storage of 30 megawatts instead of 20 um and then on the right side you can see the other proposed substation site which is adjacent to little Butter Creek more in the center portion of the site slide please great um again the site on the left here shows the Terminus of the uh transmission line Corridor at the Blue Ridge substation um which was constructed as part of Wheat Ridge 2 um one of the changes in RFA 1 would be to utilize the existing onm building at weat Ridge 2 as well instead of constructing a separate own and building as part of Wheat Ridge East um and that location would be adjacent to the um substation site uh and then the certificate holder also requests authorizations to add a new temporary construction yard with up to 60 Acres of temporary disturbance area um off of Meers Lane uh close to B and but which I think will come up a few times in this presentation um that a temporary construction yard would be in addition to previously approved construction yards of 15 to 20 acres which were previously authorized to um be constructed anywhere within the micro corridors um so this new site certificate that we're proposing in the DPO would re would allow for those to be built with throughout the the micro sighting forers as well uh slide please okay um so that's an overview I guess before I go on are there any questions just on what the actual changes to the facility are sound like it okay um so because this request uh both proposes to add areas to the site boundary and proposes to ex in the construction completion deadline for the facility um the council must determine that the preponderance of evidence on the record supports the following conclusions before you make your final decision uh one that the portion of the facility within the area added to the site by the amendment complies with all Wes and and Council standards applicable to an original site certificate application that after considering any changes in facts or law since the date of the current site certificate was executed the entire facility complies with all laws and Council standards applicable to an original site certificate application and that the amount of bond or letter credit required under um the financial retirement and financial Assurance standard is adequate um and that's just to say these three things combined really do uh account to almost a denovo review of this facility so you'll see throughout the DPO that we've um done extensive analysis where council's previous findings related to the facility are still um applicable and accurate we've we've referenced back to those and and recommended that the council continue to rely on those were appropriate but um this was a pretty extensive review and is still a pretty exens extensive review before you so that out um oh and I guess the only other thing I'll say on that is that also means that you all are um more than welcome to provide feedback on anything um in the DPO uh any of the recommended bindings although I won't be specifically mentioned to them I can um bring them up and can hopefully respond to any of your comments or questions uh so at the March hearing uh we did receive uh four public comments in person um um most of you were there there are transcripts in the uh meeting minutes uh and those will also be I think summarized in your or were summarized in your staff report um we also received 20 written comments before the public comment deadline those included um 16 comments from just members of the public uh three comments from reviewing agencies including Department of Aviation a department of fish and wildlife in Morrow County as well as um comments from the certificate holder asking for clarification or minor changes to some site certificate conditions in the DPO and then we also got more formal certificate holder responses to the public comments on April 8th all of those are included in your packet um and attached to your s report for this agenda item slide please um the significant issues raised in comments are shown on this slide uh we got several comments related to Wildfire risk uh and both uh related to the assessment in the RFA 1 and the Wildfire mitigation plan that was um attached to the DPO we got comments related to noxious weed control um related to impacts on emergency infrastructure uh comments related to visual impacts of turbines specifically turbines proposed to be cited on G and but um we got a comment from ODFW and the certificate well just ODFW I believe are related to Raptor Nest buffers um other comments related to Wildlife Monitor and mitigation and Lawrence milk M milk fetch mitigation um we also got several comments uh in support of the facility related to economic benefits and Workforce Development opportunities that come with um the sighting of the facility uh we got a comment related to um prop loss payments for transmission line sighting um codes and standards Reed on for the facility design uh one comment related to visual impacts on the organal Historic Trail uh and then comments from the county about Road use agreements and then several comments from the public about the accumulative impacts of traffic on um communities in the vicinity of the project um I just want to point out now that I am really going to be discussing the items on the left hand column of the slide in detail now uh so if there are any questions or comments on the right hand side um or if you want me to discuss any of those in more detail I can do that but this would be the the time to do that Qui question councelor Byer on the road use agreements with I presume both counties or particular Ling County when do those have to be um implemented before or uh council member Byer thank you for that question yes uh Road use agreement is required for both counties um this site certificate does uh contemplate phasing so uh if there and and right now I will say what we are expecting to see is a phase that consists of components in Moro County um and then a phase later phase with the Umatilla County components um but the condition does require that the road use agreement be in place before um construction Begins for that phase um as far as implementation of the road use agreement uh it's kind of throughout construction because there's a requirement to do a a pre-construction evaluation and then um I think go out and and make uh repairs if there's damages rad um so so I hope that answers your question and followup question are are the roads subject to the um sediment and erosion control 1200 to permit thank you council member buer um the erosion and sediment control plan um to my knowledge really applies to constru construction activities so it will apply to private access roads within the site and does require bmps to be implemented along those I do not think that it applies to public roads which are really what's addressed by the road use agreement um but I would have to verify that thank you for the clarification councelor HS thank you um will the sediment and erosion um plan that DEQ um evaluates and puts forth um will that be available um before construction and will the council have an opportunity to review all or I mean I know that's out of our realm necessarily as far as but reviewing it I guess is council member I'm uh yes the erosion and sent control plan they the certificate holder is required to get their uh nifty's construction storm water management permit prior to construction um and the plan is attached to that permit um as far as an opportunity for Council review and approval that's not specifically built into the process um that's something that normally the department would be looking at as part of its preconstruction compliance process um although I believe there is um uh language in the draft proposed order that contemplates the department um and I don't know if the word the council was in there but I'm assuming because it's the department the council would have the ability to give us direction as your staff um ability to impose additional bmps or require enhanced bmps if we feel like uh erosion and other soil impacts aren't being adequately addressed at the site um and that would usually be based on something that we see during an inspection um I hope that answer okay yeah I just bring it up because of the um the site boundary has changed so much right and so going off of 20 whenever it was originally approved um I think it's important to evaluate that thank you thank you council member I'm and I'll just respond further that the um the new permit and the new plan will be spefic specific to the site and and more specific to the phase of construction and the layout that's specifically being moved forward with um and you'll see that there are is also some language that allows for uh the certificate holder to amend their plan and and that's just to address things like if there's micro sighting changes that occur or if um DEQ I guess or the department determines that or the certificate holder themselves find that bmps that were proposed aren't uh working as they were intended to work and I just said BMP is like five times that means best management practices and includes things like yeah uh um straw Waddles and and those sorts of things that you put on the site to control soil for moving well just uh real quick since you're moving to the left side um a quick question on the codes the standards for facility design does a recent Supreme Court decision affect any uh",

        "text": " this is because there are Grant funds but also I am always impressed by how you are able to find so much grant funding and how we take advantage of it in such a fantastic way I know how hard it is to get and maintain grants and I just want to say once more how much I appreciate the work that you guys do to maintain our budget to the best of our ability and to do the most with what we have so thank you thank you we have a outstanding finance department that they work magic for me other discussion I'll just I I feel compelled to say that I'm unsurprisingly very excited about this I'm excited for the battery electric buses that's not what I'm actually saying but I I wanted to say that I'm very excited for this pilot I have every expectation and hope that this succeeds that this is a wonderful success but I also want to State publicly that this could fail and it's okay Pilots fail and that I want to State here on the record that if it does fail or if there are more challenges than we were expecting though I was very happy to adopt a new vehicle acquisition policy setting a goal for 2040 battery electric bus or zero emission vehicle adoption I will be the first person to make a motion to modify that vehicle acquisition policy if it sacrifices the level of service that we owe our community and so I am very excited to have cleaner and quieter and less polluting vehicles on the bus but are on our streets but first and foremost is the level of service every diesel bus is still cleaner than a single occupancy vehicle so uh just felt compelled to put that on the record there so uh with that all those in favor please say aye any opposed see no opposition although motion passes unanimously thank you next up uh security and emergency okay I'll ask Karen Garcia to come up our security and emergency management manager to present the report and members of the board this evening shall the board authorize the general manager to enter into a contract with PPC Solutions Incorporated for the delivery of Transit Security Services and approve a project budget of four base years with three option years for a total of 11 million dollars so as I'm sure all of you know we have contracted for many years now with private security providers to provide a security Presence at the transit centers and throughout our system to improve the Safety and Security for our staff and Riders and members of the community that are engaging with our business we currently have a contract with Allied Universal Security Services we've been in contract with them for a little over five years and that contract is due to expire May 31st of 2023. so as we prepared to pre-procure re-procure excuse me the transit Security Services we really did a thorough dive into the current scope of work it was written many years ago and things as you sure I'm sure you know our communities change our services changed we really wanted to make sure that we included in this scope of work everything that we would need for a security provider now and for the foreseeable future in our customer engagement surveys with riders the community and with our staff everyone spoke to the importance of Safety and Security while engaging with the system so this is important for all of the folks that are involved so with the review of scope of work we made decisions to increase the security Staffing at both of the transit centers to improve the presence of security at both of those facilities with that additional staff we will also be able to put security officers out in the system every once in a while to ride the buses which is going to be great I think we do experience problems out in the system now sometimes with behavior that we're Limited in being able to address because sometimes those individuals do not come to the transit centers where we have an active security presence the other piece that we added was a Mobile Patrol component and this unit will be able to patrol the service area in the urban growth boundary and help monitor Park and Ride lots and respond to problem areas like shelters that we have within our system so the final scope of work was written into the request for proposals that was released November 30th of 2022 the closing of that RFP was two months later January 20th of 2023 we received seven proposals that were all deemed responsive and in the packet it outlines the categories for scoring and the scores of each of the proposals that were determined at the initial scoring by The Source evaluation committee at the end of the initial scoring there were three proposers that were selected to participate in our interview process so in the packet also is the second and final scoring which includes the review of proposals after the interviews were conducted with those three proposers The Source evaluation committee determined that PPC Solutions Incorporated was the successful proposer for financial impact on this project we have accounted for security services in the approved fiscal year 2022 and 2023 budget and we will account for subsequent years in future budgets the total cost breakdown is in your packet it outlines a per year cost if we exercise all of the services that are in the scope of work I did not break it out in the packet but each level of Officer comes with a different billing rate obviously the supervisor is a different billing rate than just the average security officer and then with the Mobile Patrol unit that is yet again a different billing rate because of the vehicle service that's involved in that service but overall the grand total for the four-year base contract with three option years is 10 million nine hundred sixty five thousand three hundred and Seventeen dollars so the source evaluation committee recommends that the board authorize the general manager to enter into a contract with PPC Solutions Inc for the delivery of Transit Security Services and approve a project budget total not to exceed 11 million dollars Over a four-year base with three one-year options and I'm happy to answer any questions that you have at this time any questions for manager Garcia director Duncan thank you so much uh yeah I have a quick um the part you talk about including mobile security patrols and response to shelters and park and ride Lots when you say response what would something like that look like is that something that a transit officer would put in the need for a response or is that something that writers would request thank you for your question director Duncan typically what we see are the transit operators noticing people loitering in the shelters or Behavior like camping happens a lot in the wintertime it rains and people that are experiencing shelter problems you know they want to stay in our shelters because they can stay dry and warmer there so it does interrupt the service though so technically when The Operators see that they'll report that into our Dispatch Center and today because we don't have that mobile component our operations supervisors are typically dispatched and they are great skilled people but don't necessarily have a security background or have a lot of security training and so to reduce the risk to those staff members and really get the properly trained folks out there to respond to have those conversations we wanted to include a security component to be able to do that we also work closely with law enforcement because even our unarmed security staff are not going to engage the same way that law enforcement would so if it rises to that level of response we definitely will be calling for Salem Kaiser or Marion County to help support thank you very much for that clarification you're welcome director holmstrom thank you very much so you know one of the I think practically the only kind of concern that came out of the district's study or survey of folks to you know customer satisfaction survey the additional one came out looking just really great you know obviously one of the key the key issue was the Transit Center shelters and and feeling safe there and you know I think part of that is is what you've identified here is that we need to kind of beef things up a little bit potentially and so I really look forward to hopefully having folks who are trained and able to interact with folks in a positive way ideally when possibility not necessarily needing to use law enforcement when that's not necessary I think that's great this is I think it's critical for the district to be able to be successful to have safe places for people to be able to access our services so I really I think that's important so I just wanted to highlight that for folks um one thing I didn't see in here and I I you know it goes seven out it goes out seven years I imagine it's seven years from now we'll have the South Salem Transit Center up and running is there a way to make sure that we're going to be able to have stuff in there Beyond just what the mobile Staffing or things like that like to the same level that we would do Kaiser or is that not part of the plan or talk a little bit about what you think for that in the future Director Holstrom I agree if we have the South Salem Transit Center especially a place where there are a number of services there and especially if we have any kind of facility there for staff to lay over or for customers like a Lobby we're definitely going to need a security presence there in my opinion because we don't know exactly what that looks like yet I felt like it was premature to include it in this contract but we have the ability to do amendments we've been able to do that in past contracts so as we have a clearer picture of what the South Salem Transit Center needs are I think that we would work with the provider that we have in place at that time to to get the right services and coverage from security in place thank you yes you're welcome manager Garcia Could you um maybe talk me through PPC as a as an organization I I saw as I was reading about them a little bit they offer a whole variety of Security Services they're you know as a regional security provider they're fairly large they offer a lot of services I did not see any instance of them working with Transit districts necessarily and I just want to state that you know what we expect of our security officers is a little bit different than what a security officer for a different organization might operate and I just want to make sure that PPC is equipped to hit the ground running right from the get-go I think that's a great Point president um we actually were excited to see in their references that they did have a number of Transit districts that they do work with they're primarily in Washington they do not work",

        "text": " the facility taking into account mitigation that it's not likely to result in significant adverse impacts to soil now here i'm going to just kind of highlight and we have some things listed it's we have erosion and i'm just going to kind of skip over and then say chemical spills right those are kind of the big ones that we're going to talk about the proposed order and the asc talks about but it does also say including but not limited to meaning that it could talk about other things i do want to point out that the language here for the standard does correspond with the information requirement under division 21. so that the the application requirements say hey provide information about these things um and so that's that's the so that's what is generally provided however in this application it's exhibit i there is a wealth of information because this is a it's a long facility and there's lots of soil types etc the temporary impacts to soil um are about 4 300 acres and then the permanent impacts are about 757 acres um the temporary impacts or impacts that are associated oh we next slide please nancy that are associated with construction we're kind of familiar with talking about that so these are temporary roads the multi-use areas the pulling and tension tensioning sites and the activities that would impact soils are are the clearing and grubbing the vehicle compaction from going in and driving on these roads the temporary the areas temporarily impacted associated with the construction of the facility in restoration would have to be decompacted and and re-vegetated and there are conditions that address both of those um the permanent impacts to soils are kind of make sense they are uh like the permanent tower structure the permanent uh infrastructure on the ground are those permanent impacts and then uh next slide this is just i have a map here there's a very large map set um that maps out all of the the soils the analysis area for soil protection is just the area within the site boundary so that's what you would see on those map sets so there's um several soil protection conditions kind of inadvertently rerouted to one that we talked about earlier under structure again i'm just pulling and highlighting some conditions but there are more than what i'm pulling out in here the staff report summarizes some too them too but there's more conditions than what we're providing but we can talk about anything but soil protection condition one council is probably used to seeing this this condition this is that um prior to construction the applicant will obtain and provide to the department the the nippy's permit the national pollution discharge elimination system 1200 c general construction permit typical of that permit or required in that permit is an erosion sediment control plan so this is kind of this is a federally delegated permit that is not a permit that council's making a decision on but the department requested you use this information to demonstrate compliance underneath the soil protection standard and a lot of it is that erosion and sediment control plan because that has those best management the bmps about how the applicant's going to reduce runoff soil erosion dust control and then up on the slide here i have the soil protection condition five has that the certificate holder shall inspect the facility components for impacts as part of its regular transmission line inspections which this is more of the operational aspect of addressing impacts to soils and that's what i have do you want to add anything okay okay so um thank you callum so we have one um issue under soil protection that was raised by dr fowdy she filed exceptions and uh great and the issue is whether the soil protection standard and general standard of review require an evaluation of soil loss of soil structure and infiltration and loss of stored carbon in the soil and loss of soil productivity as a result of the release of stored carbon in soils hearing officer's opinion talked about the the structure of the standard language and the use of the phrase that uh um kellen had mentioned the including but not limited to language um and uh um read that to say that the you know there are certain enumerated things and again those appear in the uh the council's division 21 application rules as well in terms of what needs to be submitted for a complete application um that are specifically enumerated so we have the erosion application of chemical substances but the hearing officer's view was that this the included but not limited to doesn't necessarily require that an application for site certificate evaluate um things that are um you know uh perhaps of a different kind than the uh the list had uh provided so um the issues raised by dr faudi including the soil compaction and structure etc the hearing officer also ruled that neither the application for site content rule nor the standard itself require that the applicant use a specific methodology to evaluate soil types or characteristics or require a presentation of the highest level of detail from the most current um the standard does not require the applicant to establish a specific time frame for restoration or recovery idaho power correctly evaluated soil types within the analysis area and evaluated impacts based on potential locations of temporary and permanent response to issue as it was initially presented by dr foughty and then supported by her idaho power during the contested case provided an updated table that presented soil information by county with the soil order id name percent and acreage of disturbance area and soil properties soil production conditions two and three would minimize erosion and spill impacts during construction efficient wildlife habitat conditions would also ensure that temporary soil impacts are restored post-construction through vegetation and noxious weed control within a reasonable time frame to as close to pre-disturbance conditions as possible so that's the the issue as it was framed in the contested case and the hearing officer's ruling and uh um and so um now is the time for dr faudy to provide oral argument hi my name is carl newt i represent stop and for purposes of tonight i'm assisting dr fowdy also stop b-2-h concurred in dr faudy's materials and her presentations and so i'm going to cover both her materials and stops concurrence and do so briefly and then hopefully answer any questions you might have i want to start with the key points which are that the proposed contested case order omitted any findings related to dynamic soil property changes there's a lot of data put in about but that's not the only impact compaction dynamic soil makes a huge in addition the administrative law judge made an evidentiary ruling at the end of the process where she improperly excluded documents that should have been in the those are both fundamental errors in our part in our view doctor foughty is a phd she's a soil specialist and a hydrologist since she lives here in negrand she knows her materials her testimony was that ipc had failed to the impacts from the proposed facility in sufficient detail she used best available science in her her testimony was in our view and if you listen to the recordings i think you would agree never really credibly when dr fowley foughty outlined in her closing remarks fact that there was a host of failures by ipc's expert in particular to address some of the basic documents that ipc's own expert relied ipc asked that those documents be stricken from the record the alj mistakenly agreed and as a result gave less weight to dr faudi's testimony any document that ipc and its experts used should have been part of the record because without that the applicant could claim anything was true and the public wouldn't have the opportunity and this council wouldn't have the opportunity to review materials and determine if they agreed dr fowdy outlined how ipc had failed to demonstrate compliance with the standard there was a lot of discussion about how i and the condition you saw a few minutes ago on sp1 was that the department was relying on the npdes permit from deq that permit as was outlined by dr faudi only addresses erosion it does not address compaction it does not address dynamic soil changes it does not address any of those other issues reliance on that is inadequate there were a number of fundamental problems with the ipc analysis i encourage you to read dr faudi's exceptions they're very detailed and very scientific and thank you secretary clinet as i was going to point out that i'm using both her time and um doctor foughty also outlined how the proposed mitigations by ipc were not consistent with the stated goals they weren't peer-reviewed and they didn't follow the literature she noted that ipc used the wrong nrc soil database when anal resi that resulted in planning level analysis rather than project level analysis that's important when you're doing ipc use the wrong analysis for soil impacts because it used a larger soil rather than a smaller soil impact area thus incorrectly minimizing the nature or the magnitude of the soils impacts ipc misrepresented the longevity this soil impact by stating that the impacts would be temporary and then defining temporary as the life of the project which you have already heard is forever not what most of us would consider a temporary impact she also noted that ipc failed to provide a soils restoration plan instead relied on vegetation restoration plan as a proxy for soil productivity ipc also failed to identify major soil in the analysis area incorrectly discussed the soil order the broad highest level soil category and they failed to identify all current land uses on productive soils that's also important the fundamental problem here is that the uh dr faudi's testimony should have been given more weight the hearings officer disregarded some of the literature she cited and we think that this under the circumstances should motivate this council to send this issue back for further analysis by the administrative law just in a further hearing on these detailed scientific issues i'm happy to answer any questions if you have any thank you carl i didn't get your last name anuta anuta any questions of mr okay thank you uh thank you again this is jocelyn pease for idaho power for the record dr foudy raised many issues in her exceptions filing and idaho power fully addressed these issues in its responsive all this focus on several of the key arguments that dr faudi had made in her exceptions filing and attempt to address in in the short time the number a number of the issues that mr anuta had also first in her exceptions filing dr fowdy argues that idaho power should have addressed additional soil properties in its analysis regarding the soil protection standard in support of this argument dr fowdy emphasized language in the standard regarding impacts to soils including but not limited to erosion and",

just another thought on that yeah absolutely we've had some really good prison in the past from Washington and California on work that are happening in those two states and those are the ones that are coming to mind that I I remember us digging in on but I'm sure there are a lot of other presentations that we've had in in past meetings from time to time that I have been I think really beneficial we have a couple more minutes for this any other reactions to these kind of broader discussion questions commissioner rietman uh here I guess that uh I'm wondering how to incorporate the comments that I'm receiving from the commodity organizations and and it's related to the Natural and working lands uh committee work which has done very well I might add and I'm very pleased with what they're doing so I I just want to make sure we don't alienate uh you know a whole sector of of uh producers in the state because we didn't listen to them at the get-go so just just a reminder that and I thought the comment that that Lisa made about every everybody wants to be recognized for what they're doing and what they're contributing and I thought that was important to keep in mind too absolutely and I I you know we we have through the process included commodity groups but um certainly that's that's something we want to do on an ongoing basis and and make sure we're being responsive to those concerns to any concerns they might have or just a knowledge that they're aware of that would would benefit us and I I've assured them that that the Oregon Global commission wants to be inclusive of everybody and that we don't intend to alienate others including the the mainline organizations absolutely yeah thank you other reactions I guess the the one last thing uh you know working on this work plan and developing the draft might be one of those things that a subcommittee could really help with um so I I'll confer with Zach but uh might be you know let do let us know if you would be willing to be on a subcommittee I think we'd be looking at trying to yeah a draft or a subcommittee to review early in July in order to be able to post it early enough for a mid to late July Commission meeting to um to review it and so I don't want to commit to a um just in case that puts uh Zach in in a bind in terms of uh being able to kind of take what he's heard and uh and develop it out but um but do let us know and and then once I confer I'll reach back out to those who might be interested in participating and uh developing that draft which I would anticipate would be maybe one follow-up um to be able to kind of dig in and react to some some of what Zach and I might put together okay with that I think we need to go to public comment and so um Stacy and Zach uh can you give us a sense of how many people want to sign up um public comment I'm just looking at the list and I don't see any hands yet so if uh just as a reminder if folks want to meet public comment uh you should see a smiley face down at the bottom and then a hand next to it and so if you just raise your hand uh hit that button that'll help us or if you have something in the chat uh or if you put something in a chat that you'd like to uh jump in and discuss that'll help us um hear it from the Public Utility uh yeah um I figured I'd take this opportunity to kind of jump back to the climate pollution reduction Grant discussion and I wanted to emphasize that I think uh Colin engineering did a great job with a kind of presenting their overview of the plan uh the PC just really wanted to to Second what they are in this case maybe third uh what they were saying with regard to the need to uh Focus initially on making sure that any funding kind of gets directed towards existing plans um and and achieving kind of the existing state goals that the um that Oregon already has that are really intended to to move uh towards decarbonizing the economy um you know as has been noted um here by a number of parties uh there's a lot of work that's already um you know the PGE as was noted at the beginning of this meeting uh just submit their cep and as part of that they have a number of goals around community-based renewable energy energy storage and those types of projects are going to be critical to seeing the state kind of achieve its decarbonization goals and as was noted by commissioner after I think another key area that's going to require a lot of collaboration and proactive work is really and ensuring that federal funds are secured wherever possible um whether it's transmission renewable energy development new technology development there are a number of different elements that will need to be invested in in order to achieve uh the state's broader policy objectives and so yeah the PC is looking forward to both creating venues and working within other agencies and parties venues to really communicate around this and um develop kind of comprehensive plans that can be implemented in in Foster further decarbonization going forward great thank you Garrett has anyone signed up for public comment yes Terry McDonald uh Pat delaquil is great other hand welcome Pat welcome can you hear me yes oh great um with regards to the policy topics I think your guiding principle really needs to be uh creating a state vision because unfortunately many of our Regulatory and even legislative processes get siled and we have one set of activities for our electricity sector one for gas and I think the importance of the commission is to be able to look across the sectors and and try to create a state goal a state plan build consensus around that help coordinate those activities and I think if there's one specific area that you could really dig into and and to help create some some consensus is to is to dig into this area of the full social accounting of our climate impacts that not just the health but the community benefits the economic benefits of addressing it properly Etc and I think that stronger accounting going Beyond just the um you know the social cost of carbon to try to quantify it for oregonians would really be a big step forward so thank you thank you very much for your comments Zach are there others that have signed I don't see any other hands at the okay well then I will ask a question about the um I Colin you mentioned that um Metro did not have the same deadline for submitting uh proposal do you know the deadline that that Metro is under what if any process they're using to get input from the public on what they propose are you still with us caller Janine can you jump in on that uh thanks chair McDonald I think Colin had to jump off um and I don't recall the uh deadline for Metro maybe Zach does but we can certainly get back to you if if he doesn't remember yeah sorry I think it's the end of this month um and I see that uh Whitney's hand is raised and she may be able to provide a bit more detail on this question so if we can unmute her that'd be awesome can you hear me yes okay great welcome yeah I stopped hinting for her calling he had to he had to take off for a second but um I wanted to share that we've been in yeah close communication with Metro um as they've been developing their application and it is due on the 31st um and there is a plan moving forward to stay connected to the work that they're doing and align with their engagement so ensuring we aren't asking folks to try and engage um you know both on the state's plans separately from Metro's plan but rather uh the state will you know go to and participate in engagement opportunities that Metro is planning to host and so conversations have started there and we will continue to update you all um on that front too great thank you and I um I I hadn't realized that the metro area would include Vancouver as well so is it can I assume that um there's good coordination on that front between the Oregon side of the metro area and the Washington side yeah that's a good challenge for Metro to um and they do have uh you know know their their networks already existing in close partnership but um I know that they are as well reaching out to the Washington State um leads on the cprg grant because there's just so many levels of kind of coordination here and um it's a little bit of just a sticky way that um the the boundaries were drawn I think for the MSA and how to navigate this so um they are looping in with Vancouver great thank you I was really pleased to hear how many states submitted Grant in work that I've engaged in with my day job with the US climate Alliance it seems like most climate action plans have been focused in states that are part of the alliance um and so being which is 25 and taking that out to 46 uh you know it shows kind of the power of being able to make this kind of a grant opportunity available for states that might not otherwise be able to participate or um motivated to participate without it so that's that was very encouraging to hear yeah and there's one other piece I'll share which is that there is a climate innovation and team aspect of this grant where EPA will be facilitating conversations nationally and regionally just to align the states who are working on specific pieces within their priority climate action plan and comprehensive so um it could be a really great way for us um yeah just work alongside others and learn from others as we are all navigating this together great I know there's been a lot of value in that with the US climate Alliance states of kind of comparing notes and figuring out how to go through this together so that's great to hear that EPA is going to do that any anyone else from the public stack brace your hand I don't see anyone at the moment okay any other comments from commissioners for the good of the order today I see Tom jumped on camera do you want to make a comment uh uh just quickly uh I I think moving forward you have a very aggressive work plan if everything comes through and especially if the legislative bills get passed where the global warming commission would be involved and so I I think it just need to recognize when",

        "text": " can awes glad you guys are able to take care that is there any questions for progression on that from anyone okay well thank you for that thank you Gretchen and also thank you lular for your input in there so next I'm going to move forward with the city council presentation like an update on that so I'm going to hand this one over to Kelsey and Lisa since you guys were both in attendance whichever one of you wants to go I wasn't able to go either okay oh no so it was fine um there wasn't a full house um I don't think all the I think some of the counselors were working remotely or were absent but I think that the presentation itself I felt the vibe that I got while I was giving it giving the speech was that they were very much paying attention that the audience the counselors the mayor the city staff and the audience were all paying attention to the context and uh I felt really good afterwards when um one of the counselors approached and really you know expressed interest um in attending one of our future meetings as well as the gentleman I had mentioned before so I think that I think my feeling walking away from it was that it was a lot of dense material and I think it's something giving folks something to um reflect on and I don't think it would be necessarily a um a bad thing if we invited you know had an open invitation to the counselors to attend as they're able or to review one of our um meetings but overall I think think it was um I think it was well received so how about you gret and do you have any comments or any feedback no I agree and I think that would be just fine we've um it'd be very easy to share with the city council the date and time of the meetings and and extend that open invitation on your behalf uh Jackie used to be in that position of being a city counselor I don't know if she'd have any feedback on you know effectiveness of that approach or other ideas and I know Robert also attended the meeting Monday night as well and might have thoughts to share too yeah my my suggestion would be if like if you feel like there are certain counselors that weren't like present like they weren't like in person that you feel like they should have been like that's one way could definitely reach out to them and ask to have a meeting and um taking consideration to like you mentioned that was kind of dense so it's like there's any key points that you think would be most important for the uh counselors to be aware of or to hone in on and like if there was like even like a suggestions or recommendations page in terms of what can the counselors do um within the next say two or three years depending on the length of their um time on Council oh that's great stuff I hadn't thought of that you know especially if you know something is specific to their geographical area or their area of expertise to highlight that and you know we'll be doing action in your you know in w you know whatever um but yeah I think that's a great idea thank you for that um some other suggestions I'm thinking of offand it depends on capacity at this point you know there's how many neighbor associations now I lost the number I want to say 17 so there's the opportunity if you're willing to go to the different neighborhood associations and share the report within the communities especially where you're having let's say a larger number of people who are responding so you don't necessar have to go to every single one but to the ones that make sense to attend um my other um thought or um suggestion um around this um specifically and I just lost a thought but if I remember it I'll get back to you yeah it's great thank you for those yeah Robert did you w to speak on your opinion on what happened or how everything went yeah no I think the presentation I think present went well um personally I was a little disappointed I was kind of expecting anything to be like there to be um a few more questions or a little more um engagement uh from you know from the city councilors um you know kind of just I was hoping for them to kind of like promote you know kind of like that you know exchange and discussion or dialogue um at the meeting I I did notice that you know a lot of people were taking notes and you know I witnessed the police chief on you know like a lot of things were mentioning I saw him actively taking notes which I thought was you really great to see um and you know it's been witnessed anything by the police department's you know seriousness as well um in their engagement with service providers to you know want to connect more with the unsheltered population and you know make sure those uh that discrimination isn't happening and so it was really great to see him there um present and taking notes um I did kind of uh just recently appreciate um you know Jackie's um you know kind of recommendations and kind of taking that report and the material that we you know gathered from that and kind of having some more of those you know like one-on-one conversations or you know some of those smaller group discussions I'm just to really get that um just really get that data out there and the message of what we're trying to do and Achieve no thank you thank you for sure and then and then Jackie like your Insight is invaluable like I mean like I like we'll be leaning on you quite a bit when it comes to things like that if you mind that's fine with me I will try not to put you on the spot but I can't guarantee that because I will put people on the spot on the side have a question well a comment um I I also watched the meeting and um I was impressed with the presentation and the engagement and the seriousness that city councilors were giving the presentation but also wished for more engagement but but then there was you know sometimes when when we talk about people who are experiencing homelessness and we're looking for safety for the people who are home sheltered um and it's a hard balance of course you want safety for everyone um but I don't know if this committee would have any kind of role in educating I mean I'm going to try to do it very softly from the sidelines but um I've I've been seeing some City and County Commissioners sharing pictures of people with the trash around them and talking about you know we can't have this this is not safe this is not okay we you know we can't put up with this anymore and I feel like of course we need to say that we need to do better than this and of course we need to say you know let's find more creative options and solutions but when you couple that with the pictures you're take you're you've got pictures of people at their lowest low of of life and when you also add the trash it's so easy to dehumanize fellow human beings and those are the situations that lead some people to feel like it's okay to beat the crap out of someone because they're homeless and they're slobs and you know they're not contributing and they're just making dangerous situations for everyone else so what I would wish for is if there there's a way to kind of educate people you know share your opinions share your creative ideas share you what you're not going to put up with and also what you're going to do differently but to couple that with pictures of people at their very low and the trash you're making you're you're othering people and as soon as we other people you make it easier for violence to happen and when you're busy you know talking about the homeless guy with a machete or something you're not noticing how many homeless individuals are being beaten up and killed by other people who have shelter so I don't know if there's any Avenue for this commission to kind of do some education I mean as an advocate I'm going to try to do that but it's so hard to see the pictures that some people are posting in very good intents like you know this is not habitable this is not safe but it's really painting a picture that others fellow human beings and shows them at their lowest and I feel like if we can do something to educate so that that piece doesn't happen have your narrative and have your Solutions but please don't show pictures of people at their very lowest with all the trash that makes it into like these are other less than human beings because we're having more and more situations of people beating up people who are homeless um some of it by teenagers and I I can't even fathom that but when we add those pictures to the narrative we're creat creating more otherness and that creates more risk of violence thank you Lena I really appreciate um sorry no no worries I was just GNA say thank you for that um I I think that the number one thing would be just for us to as we talk about you know the situation to not I mean to maybe actively encourage it you know you might not want to pict put a picture of that it's really not appropriate it does not help the narrative whatso ever and then just keep going like that and also just thank you for even speaking that because this is you know it does go out on YouTube people do watch it so you know anytime that we can bring it up and make it known then we should and and that that in itself you speaking it does that so we just continue to push forward with it um I wanted to add worries no worries lenel um I really appreciate again your um advocacy especially for our unsheltered um populations you know when was it just was it two years ago you and I had walked um parts of Downtown Salem together um visiting with some of the unsheltered community having brief conversations huning out sandwiches just trying to check in on them seeing how they were doing and the reason why um I had asked um lenel to do this with me was I wanted to hear from folks like you know what were they experiencing were they experiencing any um violence specifically at the hands of let's say police officers or from anybody else who happen to be in the area and those were whether it was like a short one minute leave me alone versus a few other people who were willing to talk and one person who talked for almost I think 15 minutes and just sharing like within that 15 minute time frame how they became unsheltered why they're still unsheltered and you know how is",

3:07 p.m. the public hearing is being held online and all attendees are remotely this is the time and date set for the public rulemaking hearing uh the purpose is to take public comments on proposed permanent rules which would amend the Oregon solar Plus Storage rebate program uh the filing caption for this rule making is Oregon solar Plus Storage rebre program so brief summary of the proposed amendments to the rules um the 2023 House Bill 3409 amended the definition of a paired solar and storage system to allow greater flexibility for solar contractors participating in the Oregon solar storage rebate program the proposed rule amendments align the rule definitions with this language change change um Odo is also proposing allowing contractors to split the payment of a paired solar and storage rebate into two one payment for completion of the solar portion of the installation and one payment for completion of the storage portion of the rebate the proposed amendments outline that a reservation where the rebate payment is being split does not change to a rebate request until the total rebate amount has been requested meaning the reservation would still count towards the contractor's reservation count until the full rebate amount has been requested um the rules also detail information required when a rebate payment is requested to be split uh another amendment uh being proposed is the reduction in the rate at which a rebate is calculated for those residential customers who are not eligible for utility incentive and do not qualify as low or moderate income um that changes from 50 cents per watt DC to 30 cents per watt DC are the proposed amendments include increasing the number of reservations for low and moderate income customers and low income service providers any one contractor can have at a time from 20 to and uh another proposed amendment is uh extending the time a reservation for low-income service provider can be extended by by an additional six months um other amendments included in the draft language are being made to provide clar uh Clarity to the rules such as removing old dates from uh the section relating to how Odo will make funds available um or to correct reference es in the rules so the Oregon Department of energy appreciates the information and feedback the stakeholders have provided through the rulemaking process um a notice for today's hearing was filed with the Oregon Secretary of State on November 2nd 2023 and published in the December 2023 Oregon bulletin uh this hearing will be conducted according to the Oregon administr administrative procedures act uh or ORS chapter 183 and the Attorney General's model rules in addition to the opportunity to present oral comments this hearing anyone May submit written comments by email or mail until 5:00 p.m. December 22nd 2023 which is the close of the public comment period for everyone comments received after this date will not be reviewed or considered by the department unless the department decides to extend the public comment period for everyone after the close of the comment period the Oregon Department of energy will review issues raised during the public comment period and prepare a hearing officer's report the Oregon Department of energy will make the ultimate decision regarding these rules um if anyone's joined since the beginning and hasn't introduced themselves um I'd like to ask you to please state your name Affiliated organization and whether you wish to offer comments during the the rule hearing and then we'll move into the testimony from participants so I stated earlier this hearing is being recorded to maintain a record before you begin your testimony please state your name and affiliation with uh an organization if any um when you introduce yourself um if you happen to have written statements you can email them um to me so it can be made part of the record my email is on on the slide it's james. cogal energy. oregon.gov are there any questions before we begin uh you can raise your hand or pop them in the chat okay so um we'll begin in the public comment section now uh currently I see Angela Crowley um say that she would like to make comments um those have introduced in the chat um thank you for putting your names there if you do wish provide comments please just pop that in as well otherwise um yeah uh it'd be great if you could just indicate if whether you want to provide comments so that we make sure that we can uh get you unmuted to so you can provide those um so we'll start receiving the public comments now um if Patricia you could unmute uh Angela that would be great this is Angela Crowley cook Angela hi the executive director of AA the Oregon solar Plus Storage Industries Association I'm not sure how to turn on my camera or if you want me to but don't know how yeah we can't uh see your video so uh audio is good okay great well thank you for having this hearing and spending time with stakeholders and oia putting together the Draft rules oia is in general in support of the rules the Draft rules um we appreciate that the language has been updated to allow storage and solar uh solar and storage to be purchased together but installed separately and give uh the rules give good guidance about how to claim those rebate payments uh we're very supportive of reducing the rebate rate for systems not eligible for another utility incentive from 50 cents for watt to 30 cents um we also we we appreciate all the other clarifications and the additional extension provided for low-income service providers and then lastly I'll talk about the the change to the cap we do appreciate the cap being changed for low income service providers and low and moderate income residential projects from 20 projects to 25 I will say that there are at least two oan members who have a different view um who would like to eliminate caps completely um that's the majority of ocm members prefer to keep some sort of cap and so uh you may be seeing comments from other ocm members before the comment deadline that reflect another position um a request to remove the Caps entirely I wanted to make sure that you're aware that um there's not 100% agreement and that more comments might be coming um but in general we think increasing the cap on the low and moderate income and low income service provider projects up to 25 is a good idea because we hope to see more funding coming from the federal solar for all Grant into Oregon with a focus on lowincome solar projects and potentially storage projects too um that's all of my comments on behalf of oia and I'm happy to answer any questions or just pass the Baton to the next person thanks thank you Angela appreciate your comments I we go on to larara was this uh what from an Sol um Nicole uh just you haven't put in the chat whether you'd like to um provide comments if you want to just indicate whether you do that would be great um but yeah we'll take comments from Lara now yes thank you James thank you everyone hosting um I just wanted to Echo and um yes us to at an anr solar um echoing Angela and oia's statement um we uh support any attempts to lower the rebate amount in the hopes that it extends the money as long as possible to as many oregonians as possible we want a rebate program that's stable and durable with less dramatic Cliff events where the money Runs Out quickly um and we uh we hope for a rebate program that's designed to be durable and transparent um and and very much appreciate all the the changes that have been made and um thank you thank you Lara appreciate your and thanks Nicole for mentioning that you have no additional comments um so we do have a Callin user on the line um want to make sure we give them the opportunity to State whether they um want to provide comments or not P sure you able to unmute",

will intuitively know where where to go except when he get gets the wrong screen up yeah that was that was um it just showed some of my political ignorance um okay so you know this is showing you sort of with words what this is going to cost and I want to be really clear about what we're asking communities to pay for we are not asking communities to pay for every cent of what a new resource is going to cost we are just going to ask communities to pay for what percentage of that new resource is above what pge's cost would be otherwise so you can sort of think of us as having a baseline cost which um all customers are going to pay and then the increment above it is what residential and small commercial customers in the City of Salem or anywhere else would pay um so Steve let's go to uh slide seven I think that's the the cleanest pictorial example of um so that that chart on the right shows this with um it's a bar graph basically so you're going to want to know how we figure out what pge's cost would be without this program answer is it's a forecast um so in our integrated resource plan or our clean energy plan which was recently acknowledged by the Pu um we have a forecast for what energy is going to cost and what capacity is going to cost and and collectively that's pretty much what it costs to customers energy is the total amount of megawatt hours that we're going to need to sell to all of our customers and the capacity is the ability ability to meet instantaneously um you know historically it's something we've done by turning on our gas plants as we look into the future it's something we're planning on doing with batteries for example um so that amount and again this is just ballpark numbers or not even ballpark they're just indicative numbers um or demonstrative I guess um you know if we say that's going to cost $60 per megawatt hour um but then you all are choosing resources that collectively cost $90 per hour people in Salem are going to be on the hook for only that $30 this is the hardest thing to explain in this program so I'm just going to be quiet for several minutes while you all think about this and ask me can you repeat that last line one more time please so if pge's forecast for serving all customers over the next 15 to 20 years is $60 per megawatt hour and Salem is signing a contract or having PGE sign a contract on Salem's behalf that cost $90 per megawatt hour we are only going to ask people in Salem to pay on an incremental basis that $30 between 60 and 90 because that first 60 from 0 to 60 is a benefit to all PGE customers because we needed to do that anyway it's that last 30 bucks from 60 to 90 that we didn't need to do so that means but everyone pays the first 60 correct for Salem residents and your example would still be $90 yes but in terms of like you know if if if there's going to be a line on your bill that says you know Salem Community green tariff or whatever you want to call it it's only going to show that $30 divided by whatever number you're going to divide it by so are is there any thought to any of these projects like like grouping like let's say Salem Milwaukee and Portland all decided to sign in I'm ass sign on to this I'm assuming that there are efficiencies that are created by bigger projects is there any way that we're going to capture that efficiency and cost savings by grouping these together does that make sense uh potentially yeah I I definitely think that's a a conversation worth having uh both um just between different local governments um and then also with p as well once we're at that um uh participation agreement stage you know where we are right now and I'll get to that in a minute where we are right now is getting approval at the commission for this overall tariff to enable all of this to happen um but then yes once we get to a spot where communities are thinking very seriously about doing this um I absolutely think it would make sense for um communities to work together to try to get you know a better deal more or less thank you are there any questions about this are people comfortable with this concept so far conceptually yeah get it I didn't mean I wasn't asking weigh you like I vote Yes right now sorry I just me are we are we at kind of an understanding level where we're ready to on yeah I'm seeing a lot of nods so I think I think where're your pause was effective so we're ready to move okay great um Steve you want to go slide eight so that there are um a lot of I would say some open questions and then some logical questions where there are answers already either because PGE has made a policy decision or more cases where the law just is very clear on what we can and cannot do um the the biggest thing to highlight is that this is a program that a local government is choosing it's not a PGE program it's a City of Salem program um we of course Partners in that and designing the program um and explaining to our customers because they are and will remain our customers how it works um but communities will have significant control over the program design resource selection and therefore cost um so it's going to be first and foremost the responsibility of local governments to explain those benefits to their residents um and also to sort of you know be politically accountable for What's Done um because at the end of the day you know a city council will be voting to increase costs on utility bills um for everybody for small commercial and residential customers in the City of Salem OR or whichever municipality we're about um the other thing to to to clarify is that um whatever amount of energy we decide collectively you need to meet your climate goals that doesn't decline over time even as PGE system gets cleaner and um that's simply because there's no way to sign a long-term contract for you know a new Wind Facility for example that says you know we need 50 Mega today and only 5 megawatts in 2038 that that sort of contract doesn't exist um and even if we could make it exist it would be prohibitively expensive because of risk allocation issues um so it's going to be really important to Define upfront what you need and that's in large degree based on you know when those climate goals kick in um that's a discussion we can have at a later time but you know sizing the program appropriately is going to be really important to um meet goals at a cost that is you know as low as um you know and then also I want to mention about how how we are looking at this in terms of um helping out customers that are um that have lower incomes I hope you're all aware that PGE has an income qualified Bill discount program that can reduce bills by up to 60% um for our lowest income customers but then by other percentages I think from 10 to 60% depending on income um this program is designed to say that customers that qualify for iqb income qualifi built discount will not pay more because of this everybody else in the community though will pay um you know their amount their percentage of the bill basically um I don't know what that's going to be because I don't know what percentage of s on customers qualify for iqb um but I believe that that was um in the law um as but it's also something we think is fair important because we know that utility bills are a significant burden for a lot of customers and we want to make sure that um programs like this don't increase their bills even further so if I could back up for just a moment not not about the income qualified customers but what you said earlier about uh whose program this would be it it I'm not sure you intended it but I how I heard this is if you want to do this uh you're on your own it's your program good luck that's how I heard it and that doesn't feel like a partnership and that doesn't feel like something that we're interested and I mean we're not experts on energy and and this sort of thing um and so it I I'm not sure if that was your intended message that's kind of how it came across to me and I'm not sure that you're going to get any jurisdiction particularly interested if they if they're going to have to take this on themselves I mean so I'm wondering if I did I misunderstand you or is that really where what your what PG's position is like this is just something you're offering as an enhancement that we might choose or uh you're really entering into a partnership with us that's a really I I appreciate that opportunity to clarify that and I I don't know if if I misspoke or if if there was a misunderstanding but I'll just say if that's the message that I communicated then I did a bad job um because this is a partnership um we really value our relationships with the communities that we serve and if anybody if any city or county in our service area chooses to go down this path we will be there to help make good decisions what I'm what I really want to communicate though is that um if Salem OR Portland OR Milwaukee or any other community chooses to do this it's the community choosing to do this PGE will absolutely support you as you make decisions you know even like in the Tariff that we've drafted um we say very clearly that there will be a PGE Steve what's the word we use representative I think um somebody that can sort of serve as a consultant to help you um understand the issues that you're facing um we will be there the whole time my message is just that like you know this is a decision that only a local community to make um and we will support the communities that we serve regardless of the decision that we make you know if if you say no then we will continue to be the partner that we have been for very for many many years and if you say yes then we will absolutely be partners to um make this program successful thank you are there other questions about five or six questions but",

        "text": " the application so that because in our experience you need to sort of like draft everything in a separate document to like have everybody review it that needs to review it and all of those things before you just kind of put cut and paste it into the portal in the end so the portal it's there's nothing there that you don't already have and the idea is really just so that we don't have to delay getting the money out the door to you all to do the projects that we know you want to get going as soon as possible because our it folks are not able to get to opening the portal right away so hopefully that makes sense and you agree that it it seems like the right approach to here's everything you need and then in the end the thing you just need to cut and paste to will be open and hopefully that will all um open in time for you to do it but we didn't want to like slow everything down right that's exactly right CH see the only thing is we won't even have any cut and pasting it this will be strictly document uploads like a Dropbox a few check boxes and you know attestations and a digital signature you know submission button and you'll get a chance to to make sure all your documents are uploaded um and then you click submit and that's basically it on this it will require um a log in a username and login to the Odo customer service portal um and we'll have full instructions to that um at the same time that we do open the portal great thanks Clay uh then Joshua Reed I wish I knew you're from Joshua um what about projects that do include new re new renewable generation can the cost of that component be excluded and the resilience component still be eligible for the program the reason I'm asking because if you're from a consumer owned utility I feel like we've got a different program for you but yes the answer to that is yes um again all of the details will will be be looked at and stuff before you know I give definitive answer on any particular cause but the short answer is yes um as long as those resilience components are for um you know reducing frequency and duration of grid disruptions great thanks so much and then um finally we have a question for you in case we get more questions in the um in the chat or any hands raised so we are just curious um you're on that's so great are you planning to apply we're just curious if folks are planning to apply this round um we know there will be multiple rounds and just curious if anybody has started pulling together application materials just kind of wondering where folks are and what folks are thinking a little finger on the pulse if you will and you can put it in the chat you can raise your hand you keep it to yourself if you want but we'd love to great tan great to hear Idaho Power great hope that yeah we know how we know how capacity issues go too so good luck on that Lisa good well we're glad some people are thinking of applying and it's a competitive application process so you know my help guess for the first one if we don't have so many maybe um great otch and G planning to apply that's potentially with tiger cool great well um we can just we'll plan on sticking around and see what other questions come up we can sit here in awkward silence all day but um at some point we might just say we'll let everyone go and then usually a couple people stick around and ask us questions oneon-one which is totally fine too um for those that that are done and and take off even though we're going to stick around for a little while thank you very much for coming um we appreciate your the time and your interest in this program okay for those of you still on too feel free to come off camera and talk with us it's a small group now it's mostly just Odo have all right clay we can probably call it if you want in my experience or we could just hang out together for a okay well we're we're past 30 minutes so if somebody was really late I I would think that johnner John Warner asking how to come off oh perfect we can if you raise your hand then we can unmute you Patrica can you unmute John Warner I've been unmuted um hi hi everybody sorry I was trying to figure that out I couldn't on my end so I appreciate the assist there um you know I um if we have a moment and I know we're after the half hour so cut me off any we have time we were planning an hour so you're fine okay so my my question about PGE and um really is getting to a question about collaboration um in terms of your competitive scoring um would PGE benefit demonstrating um collaboration or or cooperative strategy working with um either private parties um perhaps um someone who is proposing to finance the development of a batter battery energy storage system um and then um through a PPA um uh have PGE be the off-taker for use of that that could be for um you know under Blue Sky conditions used for um load shifting and you know reducing the need for uh fossil Fel fuel peers um in the um in the evenings let's say but um through through through further collaboration let's say with the city of tiger wanting to pursue a grid um a micr grid resilience strategy that that best was a p a portion of than have that system be able to if there's a grid outage be islanded and um um support critical infrastructure such as a community resilience Hub um the police uh emergency response Command Center a public works facility so it has a you know has a a benefit under blue skies but in terms of resilience it's um it kicks into high gear a black Skies event okay so um yes is the short answer I mean what I'm imagining is it would be a a PGE project PGE application because they would they're the utility they would be um you know providing the micro grid Services right right in the in the event of A disruption of their um of their grid and so the the improvements are the reduced numbers of customers that are out in A disruption or um reduced amount of time um things like that based on that on that micro grid scenario that is you know connected to PGE um on you know Partnerships are allowed but only one Grant subgrantee or subrecipient of of Odo of us um can receive the funding um you know but they could have agreements or Partnerships and how they distribute that um you know outside of our agreement with with the subgrantee or the subrecipient um you know would be would be under their own rules and in procurement guidelines and things like that you know so we we've seen similar things in the community renewable energy grant program with Partnerships and and Partnerships are certainly allowed the only thing I've seen in the US Department of energy on Partnerships were um a discouraging a small utility and a large utility from partnering because the cost match would end up being the large utility at 100% on the cost match on that kind of a partnership um and so they want um you know they were recommending that if there are Partnerships that they be of like kind you know that that large utilities would partner together or small utilities would partner together great that that all Mak sense um and like clearly PGE would need to be the um the applicant but um I'm just you know reading the the um OA it's pretty um that just a large scale battery storage system you know um in a vacuum isn't isn't eligible but if it were if if it were instead embedded in the context of a of a micro grid and a resilience District um that the city of tiger um wants to pursue and in in obviously in collaboration with PGE since they are the grid provider and would um you know be overseeing um uh uh and and and you know operating um uh this facility certainly under Blue Sky conditions but and having supervisorial control but you know under a black Sky event I mean there need to be delegated or some kind of autonomous control for the micro grid so it could run in Island mode and support uh the critical Community facilities in um within the uh within the resilience District such as that Public Works police facilities resilience Hub out of which the community Emergency Response Team could be operating as well as other um you know loads that are um within the island District but those would be the key ones um uh from the perspective of um you know assuring um that U structures or facilities that are essential to the public welfare and that energy dependent critical Public Services have continuity under a grid outage scenario no absolutely and you know that is a uh a sort of priority criteria for this program and so as they would B PGE customers normally MPG would be involved in this project then those customers are the ones that are benefiting especially the Emergency Services emergency preparedness aspects of it um definitely seem to fit under the guidelines of the program also want to point out the the the community the the community grid resilience grant program which has aspects um specifically for up to a million dollars toward um you have to have some some renewable generation connected to you'd have to have like a solar with the battery backup but that is a standalone project that the city could apply for and get up to a million um for uh solar plus micro grid project um so I would definitely take a look at that program if you haven't already which which program I'm sorry I was distracted for a moment yeah go ahead CL no it's the um Community the community renewable energy program the exactely program yeah we're looking at that as well a question for in that regard and I know that's way off topic so just waved me off but um the expectation in this district is that it will be built out over a series of years and as vertical um facilities or infrastructure are built with that would come rooftop solar carport solar so um the the the the the PV generation will come online over time um and um you know so I think that uh being able to demonstrate the expected full PV um generation upfront isn't realizable because of the incremental nature of the buildout of the district but you you know you got to start somewhere and you need a micro grid you need a large B which could be in the near term um substantially fed in the evening with clean power and then be able to used by PGE under a PPA to do load shifting you know during the daytime to",

        "text": " say you know thank you for what you're doing and Sarah I don't even remotely understand how to to scope out the extra help but if any way that you know I don't know if it's our place to say but you know if there's I know we've had to do something for contractors for other thing if we could offer that up if that's an option then whatever because ultimately I think the balance is going to be we become very mindful of what we're saying is you know make sure you whether it's something that goes in there so because it's got to be tracked but then or will the public or someone else say now you're making it too easy now you're not protecting us so you're going to be walking that tight rope forever yeah yes S I don't mean to take over this agenda item you know but I just I keep thinking these sort of valuable points and another valuable point that I want to make and and and I've said this many many times before but you know our program a lot of the focus is on applications than amendments that's where we have more staff resources that's where you know more of the kind of focus is but you know we're functionally three-legged stool you know applications and amendments are one leg Ru making is another and compliance is the other and unless all of them are being you know worked on with the right amount of effort and the right amount of resources our system doesn't work if we're not updating our rules we can see you know such as the carbon standard you know when things don't get updated where there are problems later on so that's why we have such an aggressive rul making schedule this is also why you know as Sarah has spent a lot of time recently digging into you know not only what are we doing but what are we not doing and how can we do those and trying to figure out what the resources are needed you know our our value is only good as our ability to implement what has been approved by the council so this is why you know the focus of this presentation is a little bit different than prior um compliance presentations to kind of reflect you know what we've learned you know over the past couple of years you know with some different thoughts and efforts on compliance it's big program it gets bigger every year we've said that all the time but you know we need more resources and and we're trying to get more resources because of in these different phases and you know if we're not out there ensuring that these things are done you know we don't know if they're being done correctly hopefully they are but we need the resources to verify that through all phases of you know pre-construction through retirement thank you for record it's Dwayne killock again uh um so what I have next uh I want to show you is kind of a kind of uh in compliance not in compliance so um you all probably often wonder what I inspect when I go on site um for a wind farm you know there's a certain set of things I look at for sure you know um one of them is just like we show here the apron um I check for Locked Doors I check for lock doors at substation sometimes there a condition that says the cabinets have to be locked so I check those as well I check the overall facility for weeds and kind of the condition of the um string roads as well um so there's a few things that you know quite a few things that I actually look at on site their Waste Management uh program and things like that but I wanted to show you a couple um kind of what's in compliance and what's not in compliance so this slide here you know the condition uh the certificate holder shell cover the turban pad areas with gravel or other non-corrosive material immediately following exposure during construction and shall maintain that pad you know throughout the life of the facility so it's what I see so what we see here is so we have a picture on the left with a really nice neat um um apron um sometimes it's called a beauty ring sometimes is called a turban pad area there's kind of you know different um names that some of the uh the facility or the certificate holder or the you know managers um call it but you can see in the left side left hand side that you know the gravel's nice it's smooth there's no weeds in it so you know to me that's a nice looking turban pad you know and then you look to the right and this is actually a newer facility a newer turbine which is um um not very wasn't constructed very long ago and you can all you can also uh you can already see right by the picture is like you know the gravel's starting to thin out it looks like there' be a bit of a the dirt that's getting into the gravel so you don't want you don't want that dirt in the gravel because that system means of if something can U basically go through that and into the ground some oil or stuff so um so that's the that's the turbaned ones turban pad ones that I look at and I'm going go on to the next one so these are this is simple stuff right when you go out and inspect and uh so this you know you can read the condition but basically you have to keep the doors um locked so uh people can't just people can't just go in there and you know go up on top and have a beer or something you know that's known to happened in the past but anyway so we have you know a locked door on the left of course and then we have an open door on the right and you know sometimes it's um kind of a manufacturer defect and that's kind of a manufacturer issue and that's what they found out about these is they actually got locked out themselves because of the manufactured defect of not adding a single bolt to it to make sure it stays in place because is what happens is that bolt loosens up they go to open it and nothing can open it's just locked so there when we found this um they were actually active in trying to fix that and they already had um uh systems set in place to uh go through all of them and fix them and then this uh this issue here it's pretty easy they just added a locking bolt um to the um turn mechanism of the door handle we have a few uh instances where uh uh people have workers have left the doors open when they leave at night you they're probably busy getting out of there maybe it's getting dark and somebody thought they shut the door all the way and they didn't um we've had a few call One Call of that way so um you know of course I have the numbers of these managers so I called them right up and said hey we need to get something out there to shut it and that was um reported by a local farmer so landowner reported that door being open so you keep tur I need to like I know I like to look at my audience so so um yeah so that's what we have with the with this slide um so let's go on to the next slide so here again the condition the certificate of hold shell enclose the facility uh substation with appropriate fencing lock gates to protect the public from hazards so on the left here you can see this is a Shephard's flat um substation you can see um you know the signage you can also see that um there's these uh kind of wires that are running through there so those are sensors so if anybody breaks in or somebody uh tries to get in they know that somebody's trying to enter that and so and also this the facilities are checked by um U the facility operators of substation operators once a month once a month they walk around them and also I walk around around them as well so if there's a substation I walk the whole substation all the way around because I'm looking for like Critters trying to get in or entryways that somebody something may have happened so sometimes we find like you know U so one time we've seen at PGE there was a dead bird um in the substation and then there was some animal trying to get to it so he dug a pretty good hole underneath trying to get into the substation uh for that so we see things like this and then you know for this one here uh this is not a standard kind of uh Locking System it's kind of Mag Magnetic Locking System with a key card so um I have found this um gate open twice the first time I found it open it was because of the they said that was because of the wasn't latching all the way so they'd go through with their key card to walk in and it wasn't coming back and locking in tight so that was uh we discovered that and that was followed up by a correction action measure then it happened again um just recently um but the the caveat to that is so that was I found that open which is in right next to the um Bigalow maintenance operation Maintenance building so they have that actually enclosed now so you have to go through that gate to get into the operation building to talk to people there and then once you're in that gate there's this gate so it's more to keep you know everybody out but mainly for this uh incident for only uh designated employees should be going to that substation you have to have training to go in substation you have to have the you know the protective uh clothing and all that stuff so this condition is H during construction operation of the facility certificate holder shall Implement a plan to control and introduce the spread of noxious weeds the certificate holder cell develop a weed control plan in consultation with the weed control district and Department excuse me so non-compliance with this uh plan so you know this is an example of non-compliance natur of non-compliance with noxious weed the noxious weed control um plan requirements in year two um in year two the photo there uh documentation demonstrates that noxious weeds are not being controlled to um equal or less than reference sites for this location assume that the reference site is weed-free egg lands um which you uh would see in the background if you see in the background there's some bare open spots that's what you're supposed to see so is what we have in the weeds there we have uh Russian thistles and also um a Coen um uh weed which is sometime referred to as rag weed and I",

        "text": " this offshore wind in oregon can connect to the broader western interconnection um really the whole system for the entire western connection act works together so we have to model all that at once and we'll look a little bit further afield from oregon um so i'll just give a like a one or two minute overview of the study itself and then dive right into the transmission takeaways and then hopefully leave as much time as possible for questions so i hope to be talking less than 10 minutes just myself so great yeah so diagram on the upper left shows our workflow for a lot of our large-scale grid integration studies so this is similar to how an integrated resource plan will work for just kind of your run-of-the-mill integrated resource plan for utilities where you start with the capacity expansion model that finds the cost optimal build out of a few for a future year and then you translate that into a production cost model which finds the cost optimal operations of that infrastructure so this just similar to travis's study this was a production cost model at the hourly level for the entire western interconnection and just on the bottom here shows a typical output for for study like this where we see a few days dispatch stack and showing what technologies are making up what percentage of the load so if you move the next slide jason i talk about a few of the scenarios that we modeled so generally you know we have a base system and then what's interesting about the study is various scenarios and seeing how those the broader grid operations travis's study had already looked at you know swept through one zero through five gigawatts in one gigawatt increments so they really dive dove down into different capacities we chose a few offshore wind capacities and then changed other things about the system and to show how those interacted with the offshore wind energy injected into the western uh the key one i want to call out here is actually number three upgraded and by upgrade i just mean increase the thermal limits of these trans coastal lines so these are the lines that connect the coastal communities like coos bay and new and uh oregon to the willamette valley where much more there's a much larger load centers there and then of course connects the points of interconnection for the offshore wind to the broader to the broader grid in oregon and then to the rest of the western connection so the this trans-coastal range is sort of like the the gate that nx offer went to the rest of the system and there isn't really besides a few key paths which i think i show on the next slide there are um there's not really anywhere else for the offshore one to go so in order to to look at higher penetrations we we increase the the limits of these lines to allow more of the energy to get get to the rest of the system uh so next slide please i think the next slide is just the the grid version of these scenarios oh i skipped that one okay um so we had eight key findings and there was kind of a variety of topics related to offshore wind and it's its value to the grid but because this is a short time and there's a lot to talk about uh and because this is focused on sort of the transmission value benefits of the offshore wind rather than just the technology itself um we're gonna i'm gonna just call it three key findings so the first one is that the existing system and this is referencing the existing oregon grid can support just about 2.6 gigawatts of offshore wind without leading to large-scale curtailment so when we say support we mean most of that energy is actually being used instead of being curtailed and you know not being useful um finding three is that this kind of goes along with finding one which is that if once we go past 2.6 gigawatts of offshore wind we hit some major curtailment and up you know above 10 of the energy just can't find a use in the system and this is mostly due to transmission congestion on those cross cut across trans coastal lines that i was talking about so lines going from the coast over the coastal range into the willamette valley and then finding seven skipping down a bit has to do with some transmission farther afield so we found that offshore wind increases the oregon to california transmission exports which makes sense right so we're seeing some of that offshore wind injected down to california and it's it's a little bit more nuanced you know as travis said you can't track individual electrons but we see that when we inject more offshore wind we see more flow on that line so suggesting that it might off displace some uh generation somewhere else in maybe eastern oregon or washington that was being sent down to california now there's actually more energy going down and that energy can be used more locally okay so skip ahead please the next just have one slide in each of these findings so we'll just go through them one at a time pretty quickly so here's another map that we've all been excited we've seen seen a bunch of these now uh but calls out the high voltage transmission that exists right now along the coast so you see those more bolded lines represent the higher voltage lines that can actually handle this this level you know hundreds of megawatts of power and injection and traditionally power has flown only from the east to the west across these lines so there hasn't been hardly any native generation along the coast so this will change that balance significantly to the point where the lines will be overlaid overloaded once we go above 2.6 gigawatts of nameplate capacity so i'm happy to go over the kind of method that we chose for distributing capacity and finding that but we essentially we use an iterative and kept bumping up the capacity until we started to see curtailment along those lines and we tried to put as much of the capacity as possible as you can see the wind speeds get significantly higher so you wanted to maximize those sites uh but we were still limited by this particular transmission topology and so this is this is the best we thought we could do without upgrading lines okay the next slide shows that once we go beyond that 2.6 gigawatts we we start to see curtailment oh right sorry some caveats to this um this is not a detailed power flow analysis and i actually think i saw a question that maybe i could just knock out right now in the chat um related to right so this is not a copyrighted power flow or resource adequacy analysis so it does not capture line outage contingencies or assess the reliability of the system give you know a a robust capacity credit metric to the to the offshore wind so it's really more a production cost it's most the production cost model is more measuring what happens in sort of everyday steady state operations to to minimize cost it doesn't model severe outage conditions or unexpected outcomes we do have things like forced outage rate and maintenance rates built into the model so that generators are forced out for a certain percentage of the time but we didn't model explicit line outages a few other caveats uh there's smaller scale transmission that would be required to integrate the software wind which we didn't look at because we figured that's all kind of built into the cost of the lcoe and it might not necessarily have a huge impact on the grid itself also because this isn't a capacity expansion model we our representation of transmission upgrades was relatively simple you know just increasing the thermal limits to allow the lines to carry more energy but we didn't get into the cost of those upgrades or what else might be required like reactive power support or you know other other complicated yeah so and and i think that will actually feed nicely into what jason will talk about next with the northern northern grid study but um they they're of course more responsible for the comprehensive power flow in really looking at what exactly these lines can handle and what exactly would be needed to upgrade the lines to allow this to be pushed through but we're really just looking at thermal limits saying if you can bump it up by a few hundred megawatts you know however that needs to happen this is how much more offshore wind could be injected and this is how much that would benefit the grid so i think that leads nicely to the next slide if you'll go ahead right so this shows curtailment in four different scenarios uh along the five different points of interconnection so going from north to south so cloud stop in the north near astoria and then fairview further south towards the california border you can see here that so the first two the blue and orange bars represent scenarios where we did not increase uh transmission the the thermal limits of the transmission lines but all of these four scenarios have five gigawatts of i'll throw in so we're seeing the max curtailment um in situations where we don't increase that those lines that you can see that we're seeing you know significant curtailment to the point where it wouldn't really make sense to add that much offshoring without upgrading those lines method of course for producing curtailment is to shift it to shift energy from periods of lower demand to higher demand using storage and we did study that a bit so we added storage in a couple scenarios it was only 10 of the max power but 24 hour duration and so it wasn't a study of storage by any means it wasn't you know meant to say this is all that storage can do but in this particular scenario in the way that we set up storage it did reduce curtailment by about 15 even without any transmission upgrades um but we're still at levels that are pretty unreasonable for for the investment of all that uh generation so we would still need to see transmission upgrades to make those worthwhile um so that's what's meant by the furthest the next two bars um the brown and darker red are near zero um across the board so you can see in claptop there actually are zero and then in toledo it's less than about five percent so that shows that in the transmission upgrade scenarios we avoided most of the curtailment there um okay next slide should be the last one i think finding seven um right so this is showing how offshore when we inject more offshore wind we also see higher imports from oregon to california and that these happen to coincide nicely with their peak net load",

        "text": " that um council members chak and neelin can um hear us and can speak yes great thank you excellent I heard it I heard that yes okay Tom the floor is yours okay again uh Thomas Jackman for the record uh and we are now here on agenda item C the 2024 s certificate Amendment rule making so uh go ahead and go to the next slide here so again the background slide but you'll notice we are now at the start of the process with the initiation of sort of informal rulemaking as we call it um the formal rulemaking process being when you filed the notice of proposed rule making so as uh part of the 2024 2026 R making schedule uh Council directed staff to prioritize work on the 20 24 Amendment rle making and it's called the 2024 Amendment rule making because five years ago we had another amendment rle making so we just threw a year number on here so that it would be clear in the future when you're referring to an amendment rule making which one uh you're talking about so this project is sort of timely as there is a 5-year of the previous Amendment rule revision is due in January 2025 as the previous version went into effect in January of 2020 uh and that rule that revision doesn't have to be very extensive but it was sort of Cons considering the scope of that that rulemaking and how many things were changed uh you know staff felt it was a an appropriate time to sort of take us you know an assessment and as you'll see there's quite a quite a few things that we hope to sort of clarify and address with this so let's go through and just yeah so if council's agreeable with the proposal today what would come next is the creation of Iraq uh and the development of a draft set of rules so let's kind of go through a little bit of the scope of what staff is proposing we Tom at yes before we get too far in I just want to say that um I'm GNA ask you to pause regularly so we can check in with council member chaku and council member delin since we can't see them now we know we hear them but we just want to make sure that we take a pause periodically okay all right I will any question pause thank you okay hearing that let's go to the slide oh that no okay uh all right so the scope here is it's everything really but uh to just break it down into three sort of categories again we want to improve the clarity of the rules by resolving ambiguities that have sort of revealed themselves over the application of the rules as written over the last five years um and as part of that we're also potentially going to be proposing substantive changes to improve the amendment process based on Lessons Learned so so not just not just you know clarifying the process but potentially changing the process uh to improve the you know the outcome and third is sort of always a sort of um staple of the ru making process but updating the rules to ensure you know while we're doing a review of them all are they in compliance with any new statutes any other revised rules and any recent Direction we've received from the courts regarding our amendment process any questions about the scope and objectives nope all right so I just have a couple of slides here that sort of touch on possible areas of focus this not uh sort of the entirety of the list but this just should sort of flag anybody who's potentially interested in this Ru making these are the sorts of things we're going to be looking at and so if you care about any of these things definitely pay attention to this Ru making uh potentially sign up to or let us let your voice be heard and and let me know you're interested to be a part of this uh this rack even uh as it has not been formed yet we'll discuss that in a second but so we have issues around uh partial retirements of facilities um so only part of a facility is up for retirement you know there's 100 turbines and they decide to retire 50 of them what does that look like the um return you know returning sites to a useful non-hazardous condition site changes that trigger an amendment process how Amendment types are determined pre-amendment conference issues uh information applicants need to submit in the preliminary request for an amendment uh any thoughts about those possible all right let's go to the next slide so this just continuing on issues around notice requirements how the public comment perod is structured uh during an amendment how to properly raise issues uh sort of matching the changes we've made with sufficient specificity sort of I should say matching the additional Clarity there is some changes with the standard uh for an amendment with raising issues so there's a reason why we didn't just copy what we uh proactively this sort of needs its own lens uh to examine what how exactly the language should read uh for the amendment process but sort of matching how we clarified it for the contested case generally and then just any other issues identified by Council staff or or rack members so it's pretty broad this is a this is not a sort of we identified one little issue and we want to fix that this is a um uh kind is going to be a what sort of what we did with the contested case RS where we're going to start on you know and we we already have internally just sort of look look at each rule in the amendment process one by one and ask ourselves does this make sense uh can we improve this uh so that is what we're going to be doing with the rack and going forward as part of the draft uh creating a draft proposed rules any thoughts or feelings uh the amendment Ru making any areas that you already are concerned about that you don't see reflected on those slides that you want staff to look at and of course you're this isn't the last time that you'll be able to you know raise any issues or concerns but you know if something was already in your mind can you click back a slide please the site changes that trigger this is chair Grail the site changes that trigger an amendment process are the things that I feel like we G that people look for or find Opportunities to expand perhaps what the intention was so that's one that I think as we keep seeing changes we've had a lot of conversation about uh people changing own ownership and when we need to be concerned I think earlier when we talked about the battery storage so that's what I'm just super curious about myself definitely definitely counc cond um thank you the uh next one on that same side the amendment type A B has been questioned a lot and so that is H to me an important area for us thanks for and we're going to check in this is chair Grail council member choor council member delin do either of you have any comments uh no Madam chair thank you thank you I heard them though I got supers Sonic mom hearing all right let's go two slides I guess go to the yep so again we are asking for uh or or recommending that we form aack and requesting that uh Council uh approve staff to create a rack consisting of again roughly 12 members and just sort of based on how the last of you have gone this sort of seems like a good number uh sometimes we get interest matching this uh I think with the contested case we had eight but you know sort of matched the distribution that you see here um but uh if anybody has any questions or thoughts about rack makeup for this Ru making council member Condon I I just I I really a comment about it I I appreciated the um Bri the diversity of this group but also just want to mention that um you know the SL SL suggest there are two members of the public here and really as I look at it the reviewing agencies certainly represent a public view of it they have a constituency as well obviously the two members from the Public Public and the two resource interest groups and environmental justice groups are members of the public to me I mean so there is quite a bit of public representation there um and sometimes I think the maybe the racks aren't looked at that way but this one particularly um I think it's a a good grouping of both stakeholders uh that are the investor owned utilities and the independent power producers but also members of the public and diverse Todd sorry Mr secretary thank you madam chair um for the record Todd cornette and just a reminder you know and we will make these you know we'll provide the notice about these rulemaking advisory committee meetings and we encourage any council members to you know either show up person or show up online as long as we don't have a quorum of council members we think that's helpful you know we appreciate you know all the council members who have done that in the past we think being part of that or just listening to those conversation also helps really inform you later on when we provide the rules to you when you hear other comments you can help translate that to the rest of the council members as well so it's certainly not required but we we encourage it and we will provide that information to you thank you and I would just say this is chair Grail when I look at this list um and we say to investor own utilities well in the state of Oregon you can pick how you want to do that but where would the co-op so imtil Electric Cooperative is huge and it continues to grow and where would they fit on your list if you just were plugging them in yeah I would say that we would put them in that category as well and kind of depending upon the ru making you know they may or may not be interested typically like a a public utility district or a consumer owned utility wouldn't really be part of our process you know and UMO electric is kind of a weird one because it's sort of in between um it's certainly gotten a lot bigger you know and it's not a Pacific core it's not a Portland General Electric but it's also not a consumer own utility and I don't know exactly what category it's in it's kind of in that sort of um in between category between those but but it's a good reminder that I think they're a valid um uh one and and while that may not be a perfect categorization we would I would see that they would fall within that thank you for that I just I want people to recognize that the emphasis on guidance like we have the ability to make change and",

        "text": " maybe they didn't technically qualify because they have other subsidiaries that for each particular project however that's the it's the same company it's not as if a large company like pacific core then formed a smaller company it's the same folks that run these companies it's one small business that has individual corporations for particular projects and many small businesses are actually impacted by these rules and unfortunately it looks like no small business concerns where you know that that formal review about small business concerns wasn't completed before coming to you today so um again while we appreciate that there were slight improvements to the rule over the past year um because of the big issues that we're facing as a state as a as a globe we ask that you delay this so that we can reduce that uncertainty those delays and costs and make sure the review happens first before we expand other rules at the at the through the aspect process thank you that's members have any clarifying okay hearing none thank you miss carly um next we have uh mr brian kelly uh mr kelly if you'd like to provide your testimony please go ahead great good evening everyone can you hear me okay can you hear me hello yes mr kelly we can hear you great thank you uh wishing everyone a good evening uh my name is brian kelly i am the restoration director for the greater hells canyon based in le grand oregon we're a non-profit conservation organization formed in and we are located here in the blue mountains in the greater hels canyon we plan to detailed comments on the proposed rule making today i just wanted to give you a little verbal context i appreciate the opportunity to speak to you this evening you know personally i've lived in legrand here in the northeast corner of the state for over 40 years my career has been as a forester as a conservationist and as an arborist i'm proud to be a certified arborist for over 26 years during that time i've done a lot of field work in the wildlands in this corner of oregon the thing i want to emphasize to you to sum it all up is please take these uh rules for protected scenic and recreation values please take them i agree that climate change is a huge concern it's perhaps the biggest concern we have we need to take steps to deal with that uh for sure i'm personally disappointed that we haven't come further than we have but there it is as a result though i'm seeing results on the wild lands in this area that comes from climate change but it also comes from development from increases in population in this great state of oregon and uh it's all kind of a cascade that has negative effects on wildlife what may look like open space is to various wildlife species their habitat we're seeing a lot of impacts and a lot of challenges to wildlife because of of their habitat energy developments do impact the open spaces and the natural world some of that's inevitable but we want to make sure that any impacts are minimized and i think that's where where these rules for protected areas values and recreational values come in um i i will tell you an anecdote that's real life experience uh for over 10 years i did a volunteer project where we pulled invasive weeds down in the hells canyon national recreation area in uh collaboration with forest service around a federally listed threatened plant species called mcfarland's four o'clock it's a beautiful beautiful flowering plant only grows in a dozen spots and they're all down in the maybe a smarter guy than me would have figured out earlier than i did that the weeds were all coming in from the roads that were built to service the power line towers coming out of the dams in hell's canyon those roads because they're scraped the top soil is basically scraped off so the main plastic grow there are the invasive weeds and the livestock down there are happy to use the roads for access and they transport the seeds for the weeds so when we're down there digging weeds finally i'm going where are all these hard weeds coming from well they were coming from these roads any energy development basically has roads associated with it to some extent these are not things that you know we normally look at at the top of the list but they are an impact that comes with an energy development so that's just one experience that i've had with how these kind of things can degrade habitat not only for threatened plants but for wildlife that depend on plants as habitat so thank you for listening uh like i said earlier we will submit detailed comments but i just wanted to provide the context that we are very much concerned about potential impacts to protected areas to scenic resources and recreation in the state of oregon thanks for your attention and i wish you all a great evening mr kelly do any members of the council have questions all right thank you um i'm seeing that uh mr jake stephen still has a question mark up and that may just still be up but if you do have a comment on this rulemaking please go ahead um well i must have hit some button that i don't know exists um so sorry about that todd um the uh i do have comments um again happy to wait for others but um i'll uh i guess i'll just roll with it since that didn't go very well last time so thank you uh council and appreciate the opportunity to make comments on the these these rules this is jake stevens for the record the ceo of new sun energy and nissan energy invests in the development of renewable particularly solar energy non-emitting development in oregon and northwest but especially oregon and i appreciate uh angela crowley cook's uh comments and we support those comments by ocea in their entirety and i would highlight that we are also a small business under the definitions that were defined and we are affected by this and the rules of um that fsec adopts have high impact to us in terms of the potential um business standards you know business endeavors that we implement in our investments um and heavily affect us and and the um you know the burdensomeness of the f-sec process which is essentially a process to do what counties you know generally accomplish for um thousands or tens of thousands of dollars relative to pretty clean standards uh in most cases um you know is it is a significant threshold and the rules uh moving in the wrong direction only you know creates additional challenges with that in terms of sex efficiency uh and on that front so obviously that is a concern and i would add to osiya's comments um you know in addition to the uh i think it's governor brown's executive order 20-04 and what it asks the state agencies to do um you know hb 2021 has its own standards and as per the prior under hp 2021 we have 100 clean energy standard by 2040 um i'll note that under hp 2021 section two the policy statement is that it is the policy of the state of oregon that retail one retail electricity providers rely on non-emitting electricity in accordance with the clean energy targets set forth in section 3 of this 2021 act and eliminate greenhouse gas emissions associated with oregon retail electricity consumers by 2040. it then says in paragraph two that that same electricity that electricity generated in a matter that produces zero greenhouse gas emissions also be generated to the maximum extent practical in a manner that provides additional direct benefits to the communities in this state in the forms of creating and sustaining meaningful living wage jobs promoting workforce and increasing energy security and in short as representative helm the vice chair stated as part of the legislative intent is well understood that that meant that these facilities would be built in oregon and to provide benefits of labor in the state because the construction and operational jobs associated with them the maximum extent arguably and i think demonstrably entirely uh possible within the state boundaries of oregon certainly the close proximity where oregonians can work and benefit from these these uh benefits you know enumerated in that paragraph so as such as um angela alluded to the or describe the you know the burdens and challenges and concerns and potential risks and extra complications with the proposed rules and for these rules and all the rules that f-sec is considering related to permitting facilities in the state ultimately it is charged with implementing the policies of the state of oregon and facilitating the success of that and i think all of the rules that are by asset going forward need to put them in the context of uh the executive order and hp 2021's requirements and and evaluate whether those rules on item by item basis as well as a cumulative basis facilitate the success and effectuate the ability of the state to succeed in those policy states and policy and obligations that it's imposing on the state so i think as such you know agreeing with angela's recommendation that this be delayed i think the review process for this needs to systematically evaluate you know whether that is occurring or whether additional burdens are being imposed and to what benefit and conversely we would recommend in this case and others that fsec be reviewing the rules that apply and the standards that apply to determine you know where they are achieving and facilitating those legislated statutory policy positions of the state of oregon and the uh the compliance obligations that it's and so forth you know for these purposes um i guess i'll just close with with saying that um you know oregon is a obviously uh unquestionably beautiful gorgeous state and there's a lot to protect here um but we are engaged in a battle um you know we we are in the ecosystem collapse prevention business now and the renewable developers um those that are seeking to facilitate decarbonization are are in the effort and engaged in a pretty challenging incredibly challenging effort to facilitate the decarbonization to present prevent entire ecosystems from collapsing and it is a sad uh truth that in oregon um but due to you know other land use laws that fsec did not write um but that you know limit the agricultural development of land and other states you know reduction of water use and development of farmland is favored and supported but in the state of oregon there are habitat impacts that are undeniably and unavoidable in achieving these other objectives which pains us to no end but is an unavoidable truth of the bigger job at hand and and these you know has memorialized in the statute and it's complex the gentleman before you know described these these issues um no doubt accurately and simultaneously",

        "text": " before we wrap up it too is local local reliability and local resilience so people can learn a lot if they're interested on these energy topics at the april meeting so just doing a plug for that and i guess my short answer is um we just don't really know we just know that we need a lot of clean energy and california is doing some work on this and and oregon is following close with our utilities they're eager to do some modeling on this as well so we'll get a better picture kind of as time moves forward and then a timeline plug might be good too just for offshore windows it will take a long time for this to come so i wouldn't expect anything too soon which is why we need to talk about it one other area of context that jason covered in the kickoff meeting which had sort of big picture energy context that may be helpful that there's a lot of technical analysis that's been done to understand what the pathways might be to meet the various clean energy and climate change targets in oregon and across the west those targets um kind of go to 2040 and um so putting like the three gigawatts in context um to the efforts policymakers have made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change in some analyses it calls for about 80 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2050 in the pacific northwest just to give you some context to what three gigawatts might mean compared to the transition that um some of the technical analysis is suggesting may be needed um i saw that shannon had her hand up but then lowered it but has a great comment in the chat so let me just go through the chat here and check to see um renfies has a comment about echoing some past statements setting apprenticeship goals allows for opportunities for oregonians to be trained and work on these projects setting goals for women black indigenous and people of color and coastal communities ensures further localization of economic benefits shannon has a comment about investments from industry resulting in direct benefits to fishing communities the pacific fishery management council's climate and communities core team issued the 2040 scenarios for west coast fisheries and she's added a link to a pdf in the chat climate change and globalization of the market aging infrastructure fleets and workforce instability are all factors threatening our pacific coast fishing communities i'm just wondering if there might be a holistic approach to our port facilities that might include not only direct infrastructure investments for the support of floating offshore wind but also strategic investments to ports like port orford designed to strengthen our sustainable fishing communities and families it's actually reminding me of a comment um ron piece made earlier about thinking about what other sort of port investments might be helpful to the ron piece also added the utilization of community benefit agreements could create harmony with multiple key communities and further ensure local benefits thanks for that comment i'm just keeping an eye on the time here we have two more topics to cover and so i'm going to um just check to see if there's any last hands or comments then i might move us ahead to the next just going to take a quick pause you're not seeing any hands we'll really appreciate the discussion on this topic and look forward to any additional feedback through the written process by march 25th um go ahead to the next topic jason thank you okay as i mentioned um kind of keeping it local to some extent here with the topics today local reliability and resilience this um you know it is an energy topic um but kind of a local energy topic and so a refresher on the questions we were interested in is um transmission power supply reliability i think i have a picture in the next slide that can help explain what what we're thinking with that but that would be like the local reliability and then power system resilience and resilience and reliability are a little different concepts resilience is more for like extreme events that are completely out of like the maybe forecasted expectations local reliability are still kind of brown out or outage events or power quality issues but are more more common to some extent um and so the map you know it's probably bigger for for some folks it looks a little small for me but the main takeaway here um is just to kind of put up a picture of of how the coast kind of currently gets um really the lions share almost all their electricity is supplied to them via these transmission lines that cross not only the coast range but then a lot of the bigger generating projects um are even further east of the cascade range so you're kind of going over really long stretches of transmission lines um i'm not sure what the best analogy is off top my head but at the end of the line you're getting a weaker weaker you know there's a lot of uh power engineering that helps boost that and ensure um you know power supply is as best as it can be um but there is some some thinking and some feedback and some studies that have looked at this at a high level that suggests um offshore wind you know coming in interconnecting to the coastal grid would supply you know some pretty power and it would be coming you know via a shorter transmission pathway and so that could help kind of increase the power quality up and down the coast to some extent um so that's kind of the feedback we got related to that it would it could help reduce um reliance on those transmission it could help um avoid inland transmission constraints let's see what's the last year yeah and all these uh all these benefits could be kind of um of increasing importance and heightened so to speak if the loads on the coast increase like projections are forecasted across other parts of the state with electrification of buildings um everybody's pricing a lot of commercials more recently for the electric vehicles that are getting getting made by our auto manufacturers so as those get get bought and as more people drive those and more charging infrastructure gets put in loads could increase and so anything to kind of help bolster supplies and power quality what could be beneficial for that the other common themes were related to this resilience that i tried to give a really high level definition of so wildfires would be a great example of something to think about when it comes to resilience like um i'm not sure if there were any outages that affected the coast in 2020 but this was a snapshot from back when we had those labor day fires that were pretty bad it looks like there were some smaller fires that did impact the coast and i guess the takeaway is um there's lines that get de-energized when these wildfires happen and then that that can just kind of limit the amount of power that gets transferred to the power grid and across the power grid and so the coast is kind of um vulnerable with this so a lot of the feedback we had was related to um you know kind of bolstering resilience for the coast with offshore wind giving it um access to a new resource from the west which you know currently is just a wide open ocean um with no power and then i think we'll talk about next next month in april about how this could also even spread some benefits beyond just the coast and help help the power grid as a whole so also some references to storage um you know the more the more storage you the more resilience you're gonna have um the time scales you know are different um but it could really be good for um shorter term events micro grids at home storage community center storage and that can also help integrate offshore wind and kind of help maybe balance a little bit of the need for transmission so that was kind of the feedback we had um and we're doing pretty good on time we did carve out some q a time at the end it sounds like we've kind of been front loading a lot of questions which is great um and then i'll wrap up a little bit with next steps so let's spend a few times hearing about reliability and resilience great thanks jason so this is that time to just think about the um themes that jason synthesized from the comments we've heard so far on this topic if you have information or perspectives that might differ from those themes want to elaborate or emphasize something if you have thoughts on topics for more study or engagement or just some brand new thoughts this is the time to do that um next slide please and then here's sort of a summary page of what jason talked about and in the chat i've put the same questions i read out loud pause to see if there's any hands raised while i look at the chat um i see a comment from mark freeman big difference between power quality and power capacity and resiliency no issues with power quality on the thanks for that comment mark i'm curious if the power quality issues comment there is something that's based on your uh your experience or if you if you might have some data or studies to share on that if so we could include that in our report if there are some studies to reference we see a hand up as well um from harvey so harvey we're going to call on you next um uh i are you i i just i just retired from bottle of power administration uh i'm a mechanical uh years ago back in the 80s bonneville had an experimental uh superconducting magnetic energy storage study and that that device is you got a cooled about nine degrees cabin and they used that to store electricity and also it also was a good way of cleaning the the power uh the experiment was ex it was it was dismantled but i think the technology has improved over the years because of this wind energy you know that one of the problems is there's a peak demand and those low demand this might be one way of providing storage electricity while there's a low demand the electricity be uh pumped into the not pumped but uh stored in this uh door or there's a there's coil super gutting conducting and then when you need the power you just tap it and then yeah you can put through a inverter to convert it to ac i'll just say maybe uh the other way is large storage batteries of lithium batteries i'm just suggesting maybe you ought to do a study on that see what the benefits there's also hydrogen uh converting the electricity to hydrogen then converting back to electricity through a fuel cell i'm suggesting maybe you ought to do a study on maybe on storage methods for electricity and see what is most uh economical or what uh you know they've got to look at maintenance uh a reliability and",

        "text": " for people interested in adding stories to existing we had heard that there were delays associated with the the shipping and installation of storage and want to hear whether they are still occurring and which of the options would be most effective at reducing the impact of those delays the options being considered include permitting the solar incentive portion of the rebate to be claimed separately from the storage portion following installation of the solar system and proof of its completion this would include passing inspections from The Authority having jurisdiction this should also mean tweaks to how the rebates are processed in power collect the software contractors used to place reservation requests the reservation would continue to count as one of the contractors reserved projects and put until completion of the storage portion of the the reservation another option would be to extend the time that the reservation for paired solar and storage is valid for uh this would allow time for the storage to be a third option could be to increase the number of reservations a contractor can have at a time for systems for residential customers who are not low on moderate income this could allow a contractor to have reservations waiting on installation of storage and have greater capacity to reserve rebates further systems are there any uh questions on this potential rule change looks like Angela has a handout and she is now off comment um really appreciate other thinking through these three possibilities um and in thinking about it since the last webinar I the first one um seems like the best idea to me followed by I guess a seems like that's the idea followed by V I think could make things pretty confusing for contractors because there are already caps and um and there's concerns about funds running out in that non-income restricted bucket so I just wanted to let let you all know about how she is feeling about those options thanks thank you so much for letting us know Angela and one thing I just wanted to also flag we had a comment here regarding printing a coherent about getting a coherently principal list of the contractors we have that list in Excel and so if you don't have excel in your computer I can see how that could be an issue so I did put the link that's in Excel but um it's from C Daryl in if you don't have Excel maybe we could explore getting into a PDF or something so feel free to send a direct message to me in the chat with your email address and I can get a two PDF or something Audrey hi Audrey from PGE is saying that she'd love to see the ability to allow rebates for adding energy storage to existing solar that would require a statutory change so just a flag on the limitation there unless I'm I'm like 100 sure I'm right so not something we can take care of during the rule making process um and then and then yeah I see your notes Airline on the PDF so um we'll see how if we can find you and then I don't see any other hands up or any other comments in the chat right now related to this page okay thank you so other proposals um that we're putting forward uh include the increasing the number of low or moderate income residential customer or low income service provider reservations a contractor can have at a time from 20 to 25. we're also proposing to increase the amount of time a reservation for a low-income service provider can be extended currently it's one year with a possible extension of 180 days and we're proposing doing um change that to one year reservation with a possible extension an additional this was due to feedback that low-income service provider projects have been delayed due to supply chain and Workforce constraints an additional rule change being proposed is to reduce the residential rebate rate for customers who are not eligible for utility incentive and are not low on moderate income currently it's 50 cents per watt and we're proposing to reduce that down to 30 cents per watt we would maintain the current rate of 20 cent per watt for those eligible for utility since homes established the average utility incentive received by a residential customer has reduced by more than one thousand dollars so resulting in the need to kind of adjust those rates offered to customers who are eligible for utility incentive in comparison to those that are not eligible for a utility incentive Odo is also proposing to remove language in rules that was written when the program was first established and related to the original budget timeline and replace it with more General budget language that removes dates but maintains the same allocations any questions on this rule change and um ways to implement it while people are thinking about that and um we did get a chat on the last slide a little bit after I told you to move on um and the question that I'm getting is what's the purpose of having solar and storage purchased at the same time versus just having storage paired with solar and I think it kind of gets at Audrey's question from PGE as well so I think that is the the program was kind of set up as either kind of the energy solar electric system or pad system we've heard that the the delays are in terms of kind of that supply chain issues and so kind of maintaining the the initial program form while accounting for those delays to the supply chain yeah I think underlying premise of the program that you have to have solar and storage installed together you can't just add storage to an existing solar um and we do have some of the build proponents are on the line and might go ahead and raise their hand if they'd prefer to answer this question after they hear my attempt but I think that oh she's just raising her hand now so maybe I just won't even um but the solar contractors um who are led by the Oregon solar and storage Industries Association they're the ones who are working with legislators uh proposed this legislation and they can maybe share why it's drafted that way thanks Angela yeah this is Angela probably cook from Lucia the reason why we proposed having the incentive only go to those who are purchasing solar and storage is to really incentivize those folks who hadn't been able to kind of get into the solar and storage um area at all without these incentives and people that already have solar are most likely more financially available to get Solar without this added incentive and I know that kge and hopefully soon Pacific Corps will be working on storage incentives so and I think those are available to anybody so I think that's a good good pairing um Audrey from PGE asks of Energy Trust counts as a utility incentive it does um we are sort of imminently expecting the Energy Trust of Oregon to announce that their non-income restricted solar incentives will be sunsetting in the near future or in the future so that utility incentive may not be on offer for Energy Trust consumers that aren't low to moderate income that makes sense and I think this time we do have Energy Trust of Oregon on the line which I should have I wish I would have known in advance I forgot that we just didn't have you all last time so if you wanted to speak to that feel free to raise your hand at weekend talk about that but just wanted to share that that's why they're reducing the um the making some of the changes is what makes sense to some folks so uh we got a question about where does one go to read the new rules my understanding is that they're not posted yet they're not final we're just giving a preview today so that we can put together those rules having heard from our contractors and other members of the like an outline of a quote the proposals not the actual draft rule language uh but the proposals uh on the um Odo rulemaking web page um and I can find a link to that and pop it in the chat and then James if you I don't see any other hands raised um or yeah somebody already took care of the finding the rule making docs for you thanks Angela and we don't have any at this point oh wait when the rules are ready to be read what is their address the the link Daryl and I think has had Daryl in the link that you are asking about is the one that Angela posted that's where they'll be all right but I think with that you can go ahead and at this point you don't have to ask make ask questions or make comments related to kind of exactly what we were just talking about on the slide in front of you you're free to share um comments on anything related to the program ask questions um whatever uh whatever you would like to bring up here during this kind of open comment period let's see so we got asked what's the purpose of the reservation cap and why are we increasing it do you want to share that again James or maybe go into some more detail um so yeah the reservation cap is just like uh a cut on contractors to that you know you have 20 reservations for one contractor at a time within non-income restricted um residential customers and then 20 more for low moderate income residentially customers and low-income service providers um and it was um maybe the initial intent behind those caps was to ensure that not no one contractor was kind of monopolizing the the the program um and that we were able to kind of dispute funds across the state so that's kind of where it is and we're looking at trying to increasing that cap in the low moderate income side of um the the program just to kind of increase access if there was a limitation based upon the to those contractors we don't typically see a lot of contractors capping out on the low moderate income side of the the reservation and we want to just kind of ensure that that isn't kind of a limiting factor for um low moderate income customers and low-income service providers accessing the program Thanks James hopefully that helps with the answer to that question um so we uh you're off mute I know you also went ahead in the chat but go ahead you're off me awesome thank you so much I think this is a really great program in terms of solar and storage and I was really excited about when it was first released a couple years ago um the unfortunate thing is you know I I took a deep dive into trainings I'm just a resident in southwest Portland I try to get solar and storage installed at my house in southwest Portland and um at that time Tesla had been a contractor in one of the approved contractors but since quit at the time that I was exploring solar in storage and what I found was that all the local Portland area contractors were anywhere from 25 to 30 percent higher than the most price competitive bid which was Tesla and when I",

uh you know on the local land use application and then are they going to be in a position to make a determination of compliance with lane use goals versus say a county or city who in their language decision effectively has you know made that determination of compliance because you know assuming that they approve a transmission line you know their lane use ordinances you know if not you know specifically then indirectly um are already in compliance with the goals so but we can address that a little more clearly and specifically when we come back in may and do that presentation all right and lastly is the may council meeting so i'd already brought this up a couple of times but the next council meeting is may 26th and this will be a hybrid meeting meeting it will be both in person and webex so as i mentioned that we'll be conducting the draft proposed order for the nolan hills project by statute there is a requirement that that hearing must be in person and in proximity to the project so that's the main driver for the location and why we're going to be in again it will be at the red lion inn in the public hearing will begin at 5 30 p.m on thursday may 26th and then the regular council meeting will begin at uh on friday may 27 at 8 30 a.m i know nancy has been in contact with um so i think we have an understanding but i just wanted to make sure that everybody who indicated that they would be available are still available and that we have a good understanding of whether you're going to be participating in person or remotely we haven't done an in-person meeting for some time so we just have to make sure that we have that all figured out so we can get the right number of rooms and and do all the logistical um requirements that that have to be done for an in-person meeting so um we don't have to do that now but but certainly please communicate with nancy and let her know and then i would also indicate that if anybody wants to carpool you know we'll be leaving out of salem and so we can you know get a van and anybody wants to go with we can certainly make sure we you know you can meet us in salem to go or we can pick you up on the way in portland uh if you would like so certainly not any requirement but if anybody's interested in not driving we'd be happy to take you this is kent and i'll plan on catching a ride with you guys thank you this is marcie and just a reminder i will probably be sitting on the side of the road thursday and i can dial in i will be flying back from florida for work that day but i will drive straight to pendleton to be there for that actual meeting in person for great so you won't you'll be in person but you won't need a room for thursday night i i do need a room yes for thursday i just won't get over there in time i don't think for the got it thank you um and since we will be in person um i just want to throw this out as an option sarah came up with this as an idea and i think it's a good idea if anybody is available there's a lot going on right now in until county in terms of applications amendments and and projects that are undergoing construction so if any council member has a little extra time wouldn't mind going either earlier either on wednesday or earlier on thursday and would like to do a site visit to one or more projects please let us know and we can start working with the applicants and site certificate holders to try to figure out a good location that works in relative proximity to pendleton this is cindy um and i would be interested in that and i can be there either wednesday or um thursday i won't be able to write in the van because i'm coming from another meeting but i i would make tiny for that this is hanley marcy and i'd be happy to do a tour on the afternoon of thursday thanks hanley okay well i think that's uh that's good right there and so we'll we'll try to set something up all right well that concludes my secretary report unless any council member has a question excellent thank you does anyone have any questions for secretary cornett all right well hearing none thank you very much for that report i think that helpful and we all seemingly have a good handle of where we are um and i too want to tell christopher thank you for his efforts um he tends to keep us all find out while i feel pretty good about where we are so thank you and i'm glad you're not leaving just doing something different uh so the next agenda item is um public comments web portal update this is agenda item b this is an information item and we have wally adams operations and policy analysts to present to us wally the floor is yours thank you chair grail good morning members of the council just bear with me while i get my screens arranged here so i can share all right hopefully everybody can see um i'm going to be talking to you today about our new system for capturing and displaying comments on citing projects uh i have just a couple slides to go over the background and the purpose of the project uh the scope of what we're covering and then i'm gonna show you a couple demos i'll do a demo of the comment portal and then also a demo of what we're calling our docket for displaying comments that we get on citing projects when we went into this had a couple of things that we wanted to address first of all we although we have many ways to get comments on projects we don't have an online system currently or we didn't have one i should say um i think the biggest issue that we had was a second bullet point that the comments that we received were not readily available to view by the public in fact we got a comment on this during the public comment period in our december meeting somebody came on and you know was saying that they really wanted to be able to see comments that other people submitted on citing projects and um so what i'll show you today we are able to address that now and then lastly it's kind of a workflow issue where internally when we process comments most of our projects we don't get a large number so it's it's not all that difficult but from time to time we do get bigger numbers and you know they have to be cataloged they've got to be put into a single pdf file and so in addition to writing a way for people to enter comments online and to view comments online we also have a way to produce a report at the end so that the citing analyst doesn't have to do that that extra step so a little bit of a time saver for them as well so objectives i i bolded the ones that i thought were the most important primary objective of course was create an online portal to that were submitted by the public we also wanted if we could to use software platforms that the state already has licenses for so there are software programs that are out there to do these kind of things frankly they're they're geared more cases where you would get hundreds or thousands even of comments and they're more geared for just kind of sorting those large numbers of comments which wasn't really what we needed and uh the systems can be a little expensive as well so we wanted to do something in-house if we could with our own it resources and keep the costs low we wanted to provide an email acknowledgement to people once they submitted comments i already mentioned generating an index and a list of comments and then lastly like i say i think the most important thing was providing this docket so people could comments that were received so just wrapping up here through the web-based form we wanted commenters to also be able to associate their comments with specific citations to council standards so we we didn't want to just give a form for people to enter a comment and submit it our our process can be complicated as i think we all recognize and so you know i know todd felt strongly about this that in addition to providing the way to input a comment give people a little bit of guidance kind of guide them through associating comments with council standards or sections from a dpo without crossing that line of providing legal advice so then lastly as far as the scope we wanted to cover noi dpo including for both types of amendments and also formal and informal rulemaking projects so this is my last slide and then i'm going to flip over and do the demo but i just wanted to show that the links to access both of these portals are included in this presentation and i'm going to show you how to get there from our website so with that i'll switch over we'll start from here so when you go to main webpage if you go to the get involved it says customer service and comment and then once we're here submit a comment and you'll see actually when you click on this there are a lot of different programs where you can enter comments so all of these are using the same type of platform that i'm going to show you here which is also an advantage that rit group has been able to leverage this we watched a few things can i jump in real quick so yeah so you know you're showing where you can kind of navigate through this but just so council knows and anybody else on the line anytime we issue a notice there will be a direct link to that specific um comment portal so you know somebody doesn't have to kind of go through this and kind of navigate and figure it out there'll be a direct link that they can just click on and it'll access that relatively easy for them that's the spot on time thanks for pointing that out and the link would take them then to this page and um so this is kind of the first page you click here to select the project and only projects where we're actively taking comments will display here um you can see nolan hill's wind as an example is in here which just went to the to the dpo phase i'm going to click on the citing test so that we can just enter you know a dummy comment i'll say so once you've picked your",

        "text": " a no-go decision from from our management in preparing for the in the second phase we go through the drafting of that which is where we develop whatever the project plan may be the narrative parses pieces of the application and whatever projected metrics or impact outcomes may be required as as part of that application to the federal government this is also where we begin drafting the budget in conjunction with what our plans may be and in the short phase there's often multiple rounds of in the final phase is when we seek our legislative authorities in order to proceed for the grant application because our legislature may not always be in session we can we can access this approval through the joint ways and means committee or the state emergency board and there are various processes that we can use to reach that authority and in order to be able to submit this grant and seek additional approval for additional positions that may be necessary or additional spending so if you're wondering how this fits into our overall agency budget it's rather through this emergency process that we're able to apply for these funds outside of that overall overall process for building our agency budget which we're in full swing right now um in this last and final stage there's also the requirements to proofread and make sure that all of our application documents line up with what we really intend and meet all the requirements of the federal and all this typically happens in just 40 to 60 calendar days and after we take out weekend and holidays you can see how quickly the entire program um gets planned in this sort of process and so it's the scheduling challenge of why we're asking for your input today we want to hear your thoughts early and broadly so that we can plan accordingly for the needs of the state and take advantage of these here we have a chart that describes some of the different opportunities and odo's ability to direct the work based on their at this point in time this is based on high level estimates of what we think the funds will be when we think we might see an application open up and how large they may be in the in the scale of things we also have some indicators for what we anticipate will be formula funded versus programs that will be competitive applications where oregon will need to prepare an application and compete against all the other applicants out you might also see that um we have a number of circles that indicate that there are many unknowns and that's the circles that are labeled and for those we we put them in the september box but there's really a lot that is is not known at this time of when those opportunities will become available and the size and scale and exactly which entities may be eligible for funding so we'll be watching that as information continues to roll out as the federal u.s department of energy puts together their plans and releases information as you can also see one of the programs we anticipate to be highly flexible the state energy program is slated to be one of the first ones to be released um either this month or next month is when we anticipate we might start to see some of the application materials so with that um i will see if there are any questions that have been compiled in the chat that we might be able to answer at this time thanks jen i see one question in the chat is oregon contemplating any multi-state collaborative efforts and um i'll start by saying yes one of those collaborative efforts is is ongoing right now and that is a potential response to apply for hydrogen hub funding the state of washington is really taking the lead on that so far and as jen mentioned at the beginning we'll be convening oregon stakeholders to better understand how the state of oregon can leverage those dollars but i think there are a number of other efforts that would benefit from some collaboration including energy security most if not all of our petroleum comes from washington state so as we're looking at how to make sure we have fuel for our needs especially after a disaster working with washington state on that is going to be key so energy security definitely will involve multi-state collaboration and i see we have a question will odo be considering priority funding for categories that do not already have other funding sources several opportunities that have been mentioned have a lot of existing funding um yes i i think that that is uh definitely gonna come into play looking things that we can't already fund under state dollars and actually that's a requirement of the state energy program is we're not allowed to shift things that are currently funded funded under um by the state to federal funds but i'll see if jen has any response to that question as well yes i think as we assess what the needs are we'll be looking at what the available opportunities are and trying to match up the specific funding streams and the in the landscape of what already exists in our state and so if there is significant funding that exists in an area and it appears to meet the need then it would make sense to potentially invest those dollars in in other places and so that's some of the information we're we're speaking from from everyone today of if uh basically help helping us to set those priorities for how we use these funds so that we're using them in the areas where they're most thank you another question does oregon anticipate that we'll need consulting assistance in developing programs or deploying funds or will it all be done with an odo we're looking at all of the applications as they come in and making that assessment for each one um for this uh energy security plan required which is part of the state energy program so we know part of those state energy program dollars will need to be spent on developing an energy security plan we are we will be putting out an rfp to get some consulting assistance um and other um programs when we know more when they when they go from their little unk boxes there to with more details then we'll be able to better assess where we can uh using this existing staff and where we might need to bring in some outside expertise there may also be some requirements that come along with those plots of funding about whether or not we can do that there's another question can you speak a little more about the large pot of funding that will be available for many types of projects i think uh the the questioner is probably referring to the state energy program which unfortunately is not 100 billion dollars but 6.5 million dollars um which is still a lot of money but um and jen i think you um spoke a little bit to that program and richie has put more information about the state energy in the chat and how that funding will be distributed that's what we're currently thinking about and hoping to get some feedback from you all for programs like that where we do have some discretion where there is some flexibility what should the priorities be for the state so i hope michael that answered your question jen is there anything else you have to add on that no i think that covers it not seeing any more questions let's go ahead and move on okay and i think this slide is mine right um so as i mentioned at the beginning uh and was just talking about our goal today is to seek input so we can draft those guiding priorities based on what we've heard and those guiding priorities will help us decide one whether odo should put staff time into preparing applications for specific funding opportunities particularly the competitive ones because there are many and we are limited number of staff and two how we should shape our program designs to best meet oregon's need needs where we have the flexibility and discretion to do so within the federal funding requirements so within that state energy program for example um the the guiding priorities that we glean from today's conversation and the portal input will help us figure that out next slide please so as we think about this how to spend and prioritize this funding we're not starting with a blank slate there will be a lot sideboards on the funding already when it comes to us from the federal government and the administration has shared their priorities with the state which are on this slide so these are going to ground us and i won't read all these but you can see that they're focused on avoiding waste buying american high labor standards equity resilience and climate change and and governor brown has also made it clear in standing up an infrastructure cabinet at the state level which the oregon department of energy sits on that she wants agencies to demonstrate how they will meet these national priorities in a way that addresses oregon's values of addressing climate change equity and racial justice she really has indicated she wants us to make sure we're including the voices of marginalized communities that have been left out of decisions in the past so layered on top of what you saw in the previous slide with the federal and state priorities in terms of where odo does have some discretion we'll be starting with our mission what are the priorities in our mission that you saw earlier in the presentation informing oregonians making sure we have a resilient and affordable energy system transitioning to a clean energy future in an equitable way protecting public health in the environment and balancing the needs and and next we can also look to our authorizing statutes which for those of you who follow along an oregon statute is and the priorities that we can glean from that language are renewable and sustainable diverse energy forms efficiency state leadership prioritizing human needs preserving environmental quality energy efficient transportation cost effectiveness and providing impartial and objective information and then finally we have our strategic plan which i think ruchi put a link in the chat to earlier our strategic plan has five areas of focus which you see on the right hand side of the slide so as we're looking at this federal funding and where to invest it we're keeping in mind our priorities to expand and improve stakeholder to build practices and processes that achieve more inclusive and equitable to enhance our organizational data capabilities modernize our programs and really optimize efficiency at the agency luckily all of these seem pretty consistent with what's coming out of usdoe and the guidance documents around the iija including justice 40 and climate change and i will here pause for some questions from you all before we're going to launch a series of polls and ask some questions for you so remember to raise your hand or put a question in the chat if you have one about what we've talked about so far and i see that we have a question from sela i'm sorry if i didn't get your name right but i'll let you know when stacy's been able uh bring you off new there you go you",

        "text": " power was uh founded in 2017 under a different name it was acquired by Blackstone one of the largest uh asset owners across real estate energy and and other Industries globally uh in in 2020 um and we have been developing utility scale uh again battery storage wind and solar energy facilities and and hybridizations of those different Technologies uh across North America since that time uh we're currently 114 uh people strong or heading headquarters are in Austin Texas and uh I'm based in in Portland uh Matt who I'll turn it over to in a in a minute um is based in Idaho um but our sort of majority headcount sits sits in Austin uh IPA is a very credible developer owner and operator of these types of facilities um most of our team came from other independent power producers and have been working in this space for 20 plus years um we're currently operating uh 150 megawatts in Texas we're under construction on another 150 megawatts in Texas 100 megawatts in Los Angeles and California uh and then we just achieved notice to proceed meaning we've just signed our construction contracts and uh have sent some some large checks out we'll be imminently starting construction on 150 megawatt battery storage facility in Cuna Idaho outside of Boise um and we have a lot on a lot on the way we have roughly 2 gws uh so 2,000 megawatts of what we called contracted backlog um meaning projects that have uh achieved a power purchase agreement with an ultimate buyer uh and therefore are in the late stages of development and will be entering construction and operations over the next uh two years um we're operating across uh operating our development business across 16 States all major power markets in the the US um and uh for a relatively young company um again only having been initially founded in 2017 and then acquired by Blackstone in 2020 um are are are moving quite quite well along um Matt's gonna talk about the project in detail um Kate uh I think you did a good job of maybe heading off some confusion around um why why we're here today for for a notice of intent for a project that many of you are familiar with and has been under development for a long time and uh in a slightly different iteration um previously held as site certificate that's currently in the process of being terminated um again you're you're welcome to review the notice of termination on FSX website it'll give you the full color on why we're doing this um the very short version is that you know we as the the applicant and the developer felt it was most prudent to terminate that application and start fresh uh we have the time to do so um Matt will get into the project schedule in detail um but in short Bonville power who we are interconnecting our facility 2 currently estimates an earliest um uh or I shouldn't say earliest an expected inservice date for the interconnection facilities of the fourth quarter of 20127 um and uh well we will work to accelerate that with bonnaville in order to just drisk that element of the project um the project will not be built until 2027 and so we have the time to see through through a new application to simplify the process um clean up the the project record so it's all Consolidated within within a single application for site certificate and and hopefully eventually a successfully granted uh site certificate for the facility um so um with that said I'll I'll turn it over to to Matt Hazard who again is the the PM for the project to talk through details and look forward to answering later thank you again for your attendance uh so this is the project area map um the area kind of outlined in purple is is basically our project area that we've done our surveys on and and will be the area that we'll develop um again the project will be up to 201 megawatts of wind and solar um we may do with also what was called the best which is an AC coupled best uh with with the project um and that will be located on approximately 10 acres within the project area uh interconnection we're again interconnecting with Bonville power Administration and it will be on their 230 big Eddie to moop and line and they'll have a new substation that they'll be building which is called boy Ridge and if you're kind of looking at the project map if you look towards the west of it and it kind of hooks down that's kind of the location of of boy Ridge proposed substation and that's there's an existing 230 kV line that runs through there uh BPA will be um permitting that and constructing that and designing it that will all be on Bonville power Administration um and again like Sam said their proposed inservice date is 2027 project studies um again the purple area that that's outlined on that map is the area that we've studied um and we'll continue to study um with with the relevant studies that are um we'll update our survey results that have been done in the past um to account for uh new Aven studies and things like that that are needed in in biological studies um and then site control again it's 4,601 acres under lease and uh the pro proposed land uh use out in the project area is mainly Dryland wheat next slide please um this is a little bit more of a detailed map of the project area um if you can see the yellow dots those are proposed turbine locations um the yellow a area uh down in the Southeast corner of the area that's our proposed solar area and uh storage um and then again the purple area is that heads to the West that long line um of eight miles is our proposed genti route to the proposed boid Ridge substation um next slide please uh this is a tenant of project um again the Environmental Studies will have been done in the past and they'll continue in through uh 2024 um for refreshes um our agency Outreach will continue all the way up construction um as uh we are here today with the noi we've uh submitted for that and with our application for um site certificate will be coming up um and then um late in 2025 we're sus expecting or approving going to have our approval for site certificate and then engineering uh will proceed through 2026 with construction basically occurring in 2027 and then a commercial operations date in late 2027 um as far as estimated homes uh to be powered by the project to be around 52,000 um operational life uh for the project is around 30 years again project acreage is around 4,601 acres and then estimated capital expenditure is around million next slide please uh Summit Ridge renewable energy facilities project uh will be designed to align with the Wasco County's Vision um ensuring environmental Care Community safety and economic viability um we're committed to doing this right respecting the neighbors and contributing positively to Wasco County's future uh with a submitt of the noi The Summit Ridge renewable energy facility project uh will proceed through multiple uh permits dependent process um ensuring a timely process towards renewable energy generation and then just on the far right just kind of the steps that we'll be going through uh with the noi um the submitt of our site certificate um and then into engineering um then um eventually into Construction and building permits next slide please that's about all I had um so thank you for your time okay can you scroll up Nancy to slide number 16 no this one okay so now we have reached the public comment period um I just want to go over a couple of things as I had noted before the public comment period is open it closes on May 3rd so a month from today um at 5:00 pm there are multiple ways to submit comments you can submit them via email you can make comments orally you're not limited to comment one time you can do it again um you can also use our comment portal we have comment cards back there on the table if you wish to make a public comment oral comment tonight we do ask that you fill one out so that we have your name for the record um again this public comment period is not a public hearing and participation is not required to uh establish standing in the contested case process so if you can scroll back down we'll get to the open public comment so the way this is going to work is we are going to open it up for public comment or questions you can ask questions too um to the people in the room if you do want to comment or ask a question we do ask that you come up and use the microphone so that people on the webinar um can hear as well and state your name and the spelling of your name would be super helpful if you're with an organization if you can tell us the name of the organization that you are with or represent and then once we're done with the commenters in the room we go over to Nancy and she will tell us if there are people that want to comment on the webinar or on the phone and we'll walk through that as well so there might be some webinar participants that want to ask questions or make comments but our first priority is the people that actually came to the meeting in person and so we wanted to open it up to you so is there anybody in the room that would like to make a comment or ask a question okay please come come up have a seat speak into it good evening I'm Phil Brady and live in the Dallas Oregon and I am a wasow county commissioner so y got a couple question questions first uh as a comment I find it interesting and a good thing actually that the applicant kind of drops out of the process or takes a backseat to the process in that latter half and why I would say that as a good thing is um from the public understanding it's you know the it's now the uh OD representing the applicant to the FSC and so it's not like the applicants can't push in there am I is that the way it's designed am I over interpreting this take okay all right I'm going to do my best and if I am wrong Todd will quickly correct me but we are we are support staff for the council so our role is not to represent the applicant it's really to give an objective review of the application and whether or not it meets Council standards and that is our role from Once the application is submitted the compl application is",

        "text": " fall hi again uh so as the role making coordinator i will be working to kind of um take care of the various steps in this process just looking at the attending list it looks like many of you are very familiar with state agency rules and the rulemaking process uh some of you may not be um but basically uh state agency rules are the way that state agencies fill in the details from uh from statute and bills that are passed by the and often set up guidelines and processes for four agencies to follow and participants and programs to follow so in this case uh as andy mentioned we are doing our best to preserve continuity for participants in the program so we do have a number of changes that will be need to need to be made to the rules but in many cases it will be kind of adding some of the eligible uses for uh diskid or distribution system connected technologies and just making sure um that we're very clear about uh kind of the definitions and then the names of the different uh portions of the public purpose charge and also for the cost-effective energy so as we have our three main bullets here uh the purpose of this rule making is to revise our processes to implement any changes that were made by house bill 3141 to the program most of those will be relatively minor but we are uh trying to do our best to keep things uh uh to provide continuity for current participants and the process the steps in the process will largely be the same with pre-certifying and then making sure that the expenditures that are made were our eligible expenditures and then providing credit for the self-directing sites there will be some housekeeping that we'll need to do to the rules as well we do have some language that's obsolete and we'll need to um we look at the program administration fee for this program uh we will have i think uh maybe some database work that tom or andy could talk about if people have questions and you'll note there's a link at the bottom of this website uh on our agency rulemaking webpage where we we have information about all the rule makings that are currently or recently underway at odo we can post the recording of this slideshow are of this meeting as well as the slideshow so we will get that up there as soon as we're able to but on that rulemaking webpage you can also see the draft rules once we have draft rules you'll be able to see when the public hearing will be and all of those other happenings so uh andy if you could flip forward to the next side and i'll talk a little bit about that schedule thank you wendy great so we are as andy are fairly tight time frame we need to get rules into place by january 1 for 22 january 1 which is the operative date in the bill uh so we are trying to build in as much uh opportunity for stakeholder input as we can and also as uh andy mentioned there there's also some work that's going on at the puc that is scheduled for this fall so i've put a couple of items into this timeline that are highlighted in kind of a greenish bluish color that some of you may be very interested on october 21st there's a discussion of the puc of distribution system connected technologies and definition uh and i uh we do have a couple of people from who are in this meeting if any of the attendees have more specific questions but as far as i know they will have a staff memo that will be coming out sometime later this fall and there will opportunities to look at the memo and to give input and the puc the and that's the public utilities commission will have information on their website now skipping over to odo's process uh november 1st we will have the draft rules and hearing notice published that's our plan and that is published by the oregon secretary of state as part of the official rulemaking process november 1st to approximately december is when we plan to have a public comment period so that is an opportunity for people to read the draft rules give us comments give us any advice on how to make the rules easier to use or if there's anything you see that we may have missed or other changes that you would recommend this is an opportunity to to let us know around december 1st we plan to have a public hearing and at the public hearing uh participants can give us oral and as well as written testimony up through up through that date uh november 30th is the planned uh date for the puc for the commission itself to adopt a provisional definition of distribution system connected technologies and the plan is for that uh definition to be in place for 2022 and uh at some point later uh i think in maybe later in 2022 there will be a process to put in place a more permanent definition will take all of the input that we get in our public hearing and through our public comment period and uh take any of that into account with our rules and then we plan to actually file the rules december 22nd is our target date just before the holidays and again it will be effective january for those of you who have worked with a room making process before hopefully this sort of timeline is very familiar to you that all agencies need to follow certain state procedures for rulemaking but if you're not as familiar with rulemakings please reach out to us and we're open to hearing input and will with any guidance you might need to understand the process so please reach out to us thank you wendy we will have some contact information uh wendy as well as tom elliott our self-direct program lead at the end of the slideshow which again can be accessed on the odo website at the end of this presentation andy can you hear me i can thank you for joining us tom will you please introduce yourself to the the audience yes good morning tom elliott i'm the self-direct or let pep program manager apologies had a little technical glitch this morning so i'm joining by phone and actually that moves kind of in the next the last phase here is actually perhaps maybe the most important part which is to gather some input from you answer any questions you might have and then if there's follow-up items then we wanted to be sure and capture those but as wendy just mentioned there's the rulemaking process that we're kind of at the front end of now and this is really your you know one of your chances but you know one of the good ones to be up in the front end and we showed you or showed and told you kind of conceptually what's going to happen and we'll need to translate that into the actual rule but what we wanted to do now is make sure that you understood kind of how the program works and what the changes are so we'll entertain any questions and input that you might have now thank you tom i'm not the most familiar with webex but might be beneficial for folks to chime in in the chat if we don't notice uh a raised hand or other ways of trying to signal us and andy you're gonna have to give me the chat because i can't read it i'm i'm audio only okay great let me rely on on stacey to do that she's running our excellent thank you any questions for tom our subject matter expert or wendy on the rule making side of things and again we have some some folks from the puc here as well if questions need to be directed towards them this is christy i don't think i see any hands up i see a bunch of people with exclamation points next to their name i don't know what that means but i don't see any hands up i don't think so definitely if people are raising their hands and not seeing it do post in the q a and let us know that there's some sort of problem because i don't see any hands up to make things easier i might stop sharing the slides and go back to the normal webex version splashed the contact info for both tom and wendy on the screen now again this can be accessed on the oto webpage if you don't capture those emails right hi andy this is stacy hey stacy hey um i got a chat it was just sent directly to me it's from robert hart he's asking what does it mean that conversa uh conversation is covered through raids i'm sorry conservation conservation that's a great question and thank you for asking that i'll let tom uh take a swing at that one yeah that that is an excellent question so the same intent is to to collect monies from all of the electric consumers and to use them for conservation energy efficiency it's more really about the mechanism now and so whereas before it was a separate component within the public purpose i believe it was what 56.7 of the three percent of the purpose charge and then there's other monies it's all been sort of consolidated rates and so the utilities will include some portion on everybody's rate schedule to to capture and or capture to to fund it so um some small incremental amount will be added to the rates and then when you apply those to everybody's usage and then you know collect all of it across all of the customer bases then you'll will collect all of the monies needed for the energy trust to to administer the energy efficiency program so i'm not sure if that kind of answered the question so effectively it's the same end goal with a little bit different mechanism and i would also invite the bc colleagues to make any corrections if i didn't get that exactly right but that's i think generally probably correct great thank you tom andy again i see a question now from tyler and i'm going to unmute him um so he can ask that great thank you stacy tyler what's your uh it's not really a question actually it was just a note following up on that question that public purpose storage had a three percent cap for customers over one average megawatt um energy efficiency being moved to recovery through rates um that cap remains that's actually a 3.2 percent gap now but um i just thought it would be worth clarifying that that cap still exists through 2025 even though part of the cost gets recovered through rates great thank you tyler that is an important clarification appreciate you chiming in any other questions for tom windy or our friends at the puc stacy do we have any remaining hands up or chat messages i don't",

we had budgeted an an hour for this but um certainly if there's good questions and discussion um we can we can go as long as we need okay maybe another 10 minutes poppy would be good okay well that would be great I think the main thing is that um if we're thinking about kind of for the rack members to get their head into what these objectives are thinking about what how we define success it would be great if we could get some input from everybody or as many people as we can I'm not I'm not going to call on everybody so I won't put you on the spot but um if there's maybe even one key thing that you're thinking about that you think is either a real opportunity the thing that you think will define success for these eui targets or if there's a concern or maybe some particular ular driver that you think is more significant like the timeline is very important to you I'm just going to open this up for um Everybody kind of chiming in on this and just again to note this is just to develop this first draft of the target setting and then you'll all have an opportunity to look through something that has been written out likely in the next um slide deck and then you can provide more detailed input then or between the two me meetings but let's open it up now and um let's see sepa are people um kind of should they just should they just put their hands up or raise your hand um and unmute yourself Clark you have your hand up please go ahead I will monitor if people raise their hand and if there is anything that you want to put in the chat we could also read that out or take that away as well okay I would I guess I'm just going to State um a principle that I have in my own mind around this which is we already by starting with mean as the most stringent we can make it um knowing that Washington has already set theirs at more stringent that given the other requirement of the law that we're supposed to maximize green gas emissions reductions as possible within the law my inclination would be to assume we're going to go with the meme unless we have a really um exception snowflake to use your term uh reason to do that can you explain why that wouldn't be a valid operating principle given the goal that we have to hit maximum greenhouse gas reductions well thank you thank you for that input I think that's um useful framing to think about it as a principle um I think there's certainly a lot of different perspectives on it I think that there isn't anything really that would make me think that isn't um relevant within the context of organs uh emissions reduction goals but um but I definitely like to hear from others to think about uh how we might approach that or if there's any other kind of angle on that that might help um support the process I do see a question here um I'll be curious to know how the office building mean euis from preco apply to postco changes to occupancy so I guess it's less of a question but that is that is an interesting uh point and uh maybe Santiago is there anything that you have to add there that might to how we would think about the targets yeah um so you know anecdotally if if we were to you know follow the the logic that higher occupancy means um you know more uh more energy used um then that would suggest that you know lower occupancy postco 19 with more people working uh flexible schedules that that would suggest that the eui uh would actually be lower uh what we've observed from other stakeholders uh you know who who have talked about this is that uh that's that that may be true you know anecdotally but it's it's very hard to draw you know a a strong correlation to what that reduction should be um you know if you have a 200,000 squ foot building the difference in occupancy you know shifting downward say 10% might not really show much uh you'd have to see something you know on the order of 50% reduction to really you know make a a very notable difference that's that's just an extreme example um so it's not to say that there is no impact uh but it's not an impact that's been uh heavily studied uh you know uh benchmarking data from cities that collect this year-over-year can point to this but again you know a common thing that happens with commercial and Industrial buildings is anytime you know load is reduced you find some other way to uh you know extract revenue from your resources and that that can include converting to a higher eui use like a data center you know or adding other energy users uh in this place of people so um you know it's a great question but it's it's very very complicated to address in in this limited data Seto I'll just um also add that noting that VIN is from City of Portland and I'm curious Vin do you work are you involved with the data yeah hi um so we actually went on pause from 2019 calendar year reporting oh sorry 2020 calendar year reporting through calendar year 2022 uh because we knew that there was such a big change happening partially that it wasn't really represent ative of where the market had been uh or Energy Efficiency um and then we just started again the initial results it's very clear we have energy star scores as well through portfolio manager it's very clear the energy star scores are much higher so we're connecting with EPA to understand of how that uh how vacancy could be impacting energy star scores but um we haven't done a an average our analysis actually happens in the month of August every year so we haven't done an analysis compare the average like it's not just office building but other building types too like hotels that might have been affected by high vac cancy rates during Co I'm curious to see our own data too see yeah yeah I mean I think the timing of that um can fit in nicely with our work if you if you get the data and have some analysis in August early September and I can also say in Seattle we did some of the work when we were developing the green house gas targets it was based on their 2019 benchmarking data and we did they continued with benchmarking and so we were able to look at 2020 and 2021 was the latest uh full data set and we were definitely seeing some differences and some key building types that you would expect like um lodging hospitals offices that you know you could definitely see the impact of the changes in occupancy um we haven't done the analysis again you know in the last uh based on 23 or 24 or 22 or 23 and so yeah I think it'd be interested to good to stay in touch on uh anything you're seeing there that sounds great yeah if you want to follow up like last week of August we should have something to share great so does does anybody else um on the meeting today have any thoughts that you want to contribute on these key drivers you can also put it in the chat if you kind of just want to share it and mention it and then you can also um follow up and provide it after the meeting if there's you know something that comes to mind when you start kind of processing the discussion we have few hands up so um yeah uh so Ben I I see you first I don't know who raised the hand first but um I see your hand is up um yeah so yeah on the last topic I'm just kind of curious um is it seemed like in that initial assessment that uh Office Buildings with higher occupancy had lower euis or higher higher utilization hours did I misinterpret what I was seeing on that chart few slides yeah that that was kind of an interesting data point maybe that ties that um but yeah I'm curious to see what Vin data says as well and then uh in in terms of you know meeting the goals of the of the bill and and meeting our goals here I think you know I I wanted to concur with Clark's assessment that you know if we're really trying to maximize our emission uctions I I can't think of any solid reason that we wouldn't go with the the averages um with the most stringent that that we're allowed to um especially since you know in comparison to some of these other bills they are not stringent wonderful thank you for that feedback and then let's go to Cara and then JP and then Carrie thanks so much um yeah I just wanted to support I actually raised my hand not knowing that Ben was going to as well but support Clark's comment and Ben's as well and uh just you know hearken back to the language of the statute which does invite us um puts a sort of a cap on what's the most we can do and so I would just urge us to be as ambitious as possible unless there's something more that we ought to know um that makes you know that is persuasive or compelling evidence for why we wouldn't try and both meet the uh answer the invitation while also um uh responding to the requirement that we maximize emissions reductions thank you wonderful thank you um I'm I'm assuming poppy that we don't need to respond to those we could hear them since um if there is anything please um jump in but let's hear from JP um and then Carrie please yeah hi um I raised my hand when we were talking about the the euis um from preo postco um I just have some experience looking at a private data set so it's not a public data set so I don't really know how relevant it is but anecdotally it's kind of interesting I've looked at data sets around commercial buildings um about 16,000 16 million square foot and the difference in occupancy has been drastic you know across Seattle um what Oregon Denver different markets it's gone from you know like average around 80 90% occupancy down to you know at the height of the pandemic and it hasn't really recovered it's it was around 10 to 20% of actual occupancy and that affected the total energy consumption of those buildings by about 20 per which is quite interesting uh so it's not a one toone correlation but it definitely did decrease the intensity of you know the the the",

        "text": "oh and we are good to go all right I'll order this meeting of the city is this time and I can find money for Monday September 11 2023 to order wasn't our later all right and absent is Gonzalez and our alternate is not available so um I'd also like to just go around the room and have other people do introductions as well sure I'm Jeff Johnson I'm uh resources planner in public works I'm Bobby Kidd I am the Strategic initiatives administrator from chariots welcome I am Ted stonecliffe I'm a Transit planner at chariots okay sorry uh and I'm Robert Chandler assistant director of Public Works okay city manager hi another dimke Public Works welcome everybody did you receive any anybody for public comment I didn't receive any public comments okay and nobody's here to speak uh so we have our minutes from the from three six and five eight any comments or all right Perfect all right we will turn it over to our desk thank you so much that's right I looks like somebody's annoying there oh thank you also from Chariot okay lots of moving Parts there sure is all right thank you so much I'm Bobby Kidd as I previously mentioned I'm the Strategic initiative administrator for chariots I've been with chariots almost two years and uh okay I'll just oh yes there we go thank you dive in return it's almost two years and uh two of my main initiatives that I've been working on so far is I'm the project manager for the organizational strategic plan and then my second main initiative that I've been working on is I'm the champion of sustainability across the organization it's a lot of moving parts we have you know operations with our Maintenance and Facilities our Fleet and then we have a lot of behind the scenes admin work and so I'm just kind of coordinating those efforts and today I'm here to speak to a brief update about the the various initiatives or projects that charius is currently working on or has accomplished around sustainability and then what we're looking to uh forward so future climate action plan and things of those sorts so thank you so much for having me today please let me know if you have any throughout and after so I am going to briefly go through our four services and uh the first one is our chariots local and that is um the service within the Stephen Kaiser Urban growth boundary we have 21 local fixed routes with 64 buses and it operates seven days a week all of the buses have an extensive list of accessibility features all are Ada accessible and currently we just implemented the electric electronic Fair system for payment in August so that's really exciting I rode the bus here and it was one of the first times I was able to scan with my app I used to be since I was an employee I could just use my badge but now everybody's using the app internally or the card so exciting stuff and and with that comes Fair capping so individuals or writers who can build each day pay if they would like to for a day pass and then at a certain point it caps for the month instead of having to continue paying um for uh the whole month at caps at the 30-day rate so that's exciting and then something else I'd like to highlight is a youth ride free program and that is a partnership between the City of Salem thank you and in the city of Kaiser and uh the school district and Chariot so that has proven to be very successful and the ridership for youth has increased tremendously and so that's just a feature I wanted to highlight around about the local service so the second service I would like to highlight is the Chariots Regional so that the public transportation that provides service to our 17 rural areas surrounding Salem and Kaiser and then our chariots Lift Service uh if the Paratransit transportation service for the Salem Kaiser area chariots lift is an origin to destination shared ride public transportation service and it's for individuals who are unable to use a regular Terry's local bus service due to functional limitation an application process helps identify those individuals and they are scheduled over the phone through a call center and then finally we have the Chariot shop and ride this has two arms um which first of all shop and ride is for senior 60 and over and people with disabilities and all Chariot shop and ride buses are Ada accessible as well and unlike chariots list no applications are required for this service so the two arms is the Dial-A-Ride service and that has resumed post covet and that picked you up at home and takes it to any destination with Salem kinds of urban growth boundary medical appointments have priority and again that's for sixth year or over and people with disabilities and then the second arm is the writer uh right Shopper shuttle service which is not resumed post covet but that's a a grocery store um system thank you I'll be coming back anytime uh that is something that our executive team is weighing the pros and cons um at this time we're sticking with the Dollar Ride only but uh we'll be reviewing the shop and ride soon I I don't have a time for when we might be implementing that again but um all I can say is that it's going to the executive team for consideration soon next couple of months okay thank you Chad and this is Ted can you introduced himself earlier but thank you um and then uh so those are the four Services local Regional Paratransit or um lift and then our dialer ride so another uh uh service I'd like to highlight is the commuter options program so the the main purpose behind the commuter options program is to reduce traffic congestion pollution dependence on gas and oil energy consumption and stress and so why reduce better air quality to save money community livability and conserve resources so how does the program achieve this uh they provide information and connecting and help around uh carpooling vanpooling bicycling walking there's several challenges throughout the year to promote this and then also there's uh group best past programs where businesses can um buy a some passive at a discounted rate for their employees so the commuter options program is this is that's where this is housed in it's a great program so on to talking about sustainability once we kind of have the you know the Baseline the bread and butter what chariots does so some sustainability highlights I'd like to start with the battery electric bus project and there are 10 battery electric buses that have been delivered in our own sites chariots will be the second Transit Agency in the nation to have both Depot which is plug-in charging for the battery electric buses as well as inductive um on the same bus they're going to be compatible with both and uh so we have 10 on site and we have also grant funding for 10 more that will be procured uh Depot Chargers will be installed at the Del Webb maintenance and then inductive Trojan construction has started at Kaiser the transit center and uh this month so just a couple weeks ago or a week or so ago and if you haven't been out to Kaiser tran center I'd suggest taking a look it is a construction site so it might not be the most beautiful site in the world but to me it is I think it's gorgeous because that means the battery electric buses are coming uh and then all of the stakeholders around the infrastructure meeting uh meet bi-weekly so there's it's been a process to get the infrastructure going and now it's going and we're hoping to get the battery electric buses on Route shortly or as soon as possible and you might be wondering well where is the route going to be that's going to be electrified it's route 11. it's our largest route it serves both Salem and Kaiser and there's diversity so the first 10 buses are slated to Electrify in Route 11 which serves Lancaster beginning at the jail traveling through business districts residential communities Chemeketa Community College and all the way to our Kaiser Transit Center uh and then because the Route 11 is our busiest uh service both Salem and Kaiser so we thought it was going to be a a great route to Electrify and again this is where we're starting so this is the first 10 buses but with the other uh buses coming there's going to be more routes electrified but this is where we're starting at the good a good spread and uh very densely populated so the um benefits of the electrification with the zero tailpipe emission is going to be wonderful in a condensed area like so the battery electric bus benefits these are just a few um I don't have all day to kind of talk about all of them but just some highlights of zero tailpipe emissions it's cleaner air the battery electric buses don't have tailpipes so there's nothing coming out of them uh because there is not one and there's also very uh quiet uh you can hear a soft purr if you're on the bus or directly buy it but in general it's a quiet uh vehicle and it's also reduced maintenance time so although it's costly for parts uh it doesn't require as much maintenance and then once you get the parts it's easier to fix that's what the the findings are and let's see here hello how often we have to charge uh daily just once a day well some will be on Route charging so depending upon the route um it will be when it stops that kind of Transit Center the inductive so I'll be pulling over a charging infrastructure and I'll just be charging automatically once it's hovering over it so that's called on Route and then of course at night time it's going to be charged at our Dell web Facility by being plugged yeah a very fancy yeah an electric bus after the warranty period is expected to have the same overall cost per mile of most other buses so it's more expensive to procure them but the long range benefit is for graders any questions that I could possibly answer about the battery electric bus program before I move on to a few other initiatives I have just one quick question uh it looks like now we can use electric cars in emergencies as house backup has there been any discussion on any sort of resiliency aspect for the bus battery which I have to imagine a pretty large yes I'm unsure do you know about that 10 or Chris I don't know uh all the details but it's similar to an electric vehicle car uh yeah the battery banks are much larger than the car so obviously yeah so it's like have many Tesla walls available and so yeah the energy is able to be like an",

        "text": " we will ultimately use and whether we'll build those 112 turbines or something less than that ultimately a mitigation plan will be will be implemented to address any impacts that our project has next slide please so additional impact assessments that were done relates to cultural resources not only identified sites that are outlined within our application but indirect impacts such as visual or there there's some sensitive sites and cultural sites around the product that we've worked with shippo to um to minimize decommissioning um there will be a decommissioning bond or letter of credit that will be posted to account for the cleanup of the project when the useful life is over we generally plan for 30 years on the on the wind farm upwards of 35 or 40 on the on the solar facility but a bond will be posted to when the site is reached the end of its useful life we will uh there will be funds available to clean it up and finally on the on the sounds you know we will comply with the oregon noise route noise rule uh regardless of the array of turbines that get built and the last slide has to do with agricultural impacts you could skip to 36 thank you um you know this is an important aspect while the majority of the site is grassland there are agricultural interests in the area and so while none of the site is irrigated so there will be no impacts to irrigation or water rights and there's no wells or ponds that will be impacted particularly on the uh arable land where the solar facility will go we've worked really hard to uh and will continue to work on on addressing some of those agricultural impacts which you'll see in exhibit k of the application and so i think one one key aspect of this entire project is that it's it's taking land that is you know perhaps less productive um and it's allowing the landowner to to realize some an additional revenues out of that so it can put towards some of its other operations in the area the cunningham sheep folks have do have a lot of agriculture culture in the area and what this will allow them to do is kind of reinvest on those other facilities and on more productive ground and the next slide is uh brings us to the questions and so there's you know phone number here an email address here if anyone's you know feel free to ask questions i'll turn it back over to kate in terms of managing that process but if you don't feel comfortable asking them in today's meeting please reach out to us via either of these methods okay well thank you matt last slide just like to queue it up um we're gonna open at this point in our meeting for public q a public comment so in the webinar you should be able to see how you can raise your hand to ask a question if you raise your hand the host call on you unmute your microphone and allow you to if you're on the phone um i'm not sure that we have anybody that's calling in on the phone i also have um just so you know we have todd cornett and sarah esterson with the sighting division who are on hand to answer questions for the sighting division and in addition to me so the way we're going to set it up is if you have questions regarding the facility the proposed project we're going to direct them to matt if you have questions regarding the f sec citing process and the application process for sarah and i can can handle those so do we have any questions i don't know does anybody want to raise their hand there is a question in the q a kate about battery storage and what's the duration of that that i can see and so the expectation is that it would be a lithium ion facility with four hour batteries so that 120 megawatts would be discharged over four hours thank you we're gonna leave it open to see if any of our web attendees want to ask a question or make a comment i am not seeing any hands at this moment is there any special instructions to give them on how to to raise their hand just be a hand in their icon there like that nancy just so because it doesn't look like anybody's got their hands up but just in case can you go ahead and uh unmute everybody just to give them that option in case somebody is having some difficulty in getting their hand raised oh thank you tom that's a good idea hey there is that this is cindy there is a question in the q a i am not able to oh there it is okay i was like where is the q a sorry folks i did not see that so let's see okay okay i can help you out okay so the question is is there a specific plan for disposal of spent windmill blades and solar panels landfill or recycled and what percent of each yeah that's a great question i can i can take that one so there is a you know decommissioning plan and and i would ask you linea if she knows what the exact exhibit is for that but um there isn't there's a decommissioning plan that kind of estimates what um the cost would be and part of that is salvage value of you know most of the salvage value on these things is within the metal themselves so it's a great question in terms of what happens to the blades in the solar panels because that's a you know that's a hot topic these days like where does fiberglass get recycled i know they're coming up with new and new um uses for it every day but that's not specifically outlined in that decommissioning plan decommissioning information is an exhibit w thank you linda and if anybody is wondering down in your right hand lower corner it says q a if you click on that box and you want to type in a question if you're if you can't raise your hand you can use that feature you can already mute themselves um what you want to do is unmute all of the attendees and we're going to try to unmute you all so that if someone's trying to speak yeah and while he's doing that i just want to reiterate you know when they had talked about exhibit w just as a reminder if you go on the project website um the entire application including all of the exhibits are already there and so they're available for your review and then there's a description of what those exhibits are kind of on the right hand side of each page to help kind of you particularly again encourage people to go look at the application that's already out there so wally nancy you guys are still trying unmute all of the uh so i'm uh i'm unmuting the attendees now unfortunately i have to do it one by one just bear with me a moment and if there is anybody who would like to make a comment if you could just let us know that and if there is more than one person we'll sort it out and get you in order we have a few more on that list that are still muted yeah well some afternoon muted them they're muting themselves too again all right so is there anybody on the line that wants to make a comment or ask a question this is dan doran and i i just want to say thank you thank you for the oh well thank you thank you for tuning in we appreciate it all right i think you can probably do everything back again i have everybody muted again now all right thank you for helping with so the last slide i'm going to show you for the evening is just my contact information um as the signing analyst that's leading this review um i want to make sure that you know how to get a hold of me so my email and my cell number which is my work number are um listed on this slide i am the point of contact for odo on the project as far as the application and the dpo if you have any additional questions or comments um about the information that we shared tonight about our process i would encourage you to reach out to me and i will make sure that i am able to answer your questions or get you your answers you know in closing i would just like to thank matt and capital power for presenting the information that they did tonight on the project um and encourage anybody who's tuned in to to continue to participate and engage in our process and and stay tuned for the issuance of our draft proposed order which will be coming soon um and it will be going out in a public notice and and it will get posted on the website as well so i don't see any more questions in the q didn't sound like we had any more questions or comments on the i would think that this concludes our meeting unless we want to hold it open for a few more minutes to see if anybody wants to comment just one more ask and then i think after a minute or so i think we can conclude okay i think we're good all right well thank you everyone for your time and your interest in the nolan hills wind energy facility and the epsic signing process so thank you thanks nancy for your help thanks wally thanks todd thank you capital power for for your presentation this evening thank you again thank you good meeting thank you good night",

        "text": " tabs on this this year too and um you know it could be something that the legislature might hear from people and want to take up um making some changes there just because of the supply chain or something so um just know that there's that legislative session coming and we don't necessarily have any plans to do that i'm not suggesting that but it might be just given how this year goes that it does come up there too all right thank great um so um alex um from corvallis had a question that i always like to try to answer and then like let rob and james correct me if i'm wrong so this is one where they can do that um the question was can a project be just for renewable generation without being paired with the resilience aspect and that's absolutely that's absolutely possible we have sort of four categories of projects and so one of them is what we sort of called pure renewables as like shorthand and then there's the renewables plus resilience the issue is that um the the bill is set up and our program is set up to give preference to those projects that are renewables plus resilience so that's the only thing you can absolutely apply we can absolutely accept those applications and um and and put them through the competitive review and they might you know turn out just fine but just want to make sure it's clear that that's the issue is that there's the resilience ones we have to spend a certain chunk of money towards those projects they also get um they can be up to 100 reimbursed versus um only 50 for the pure renewables does anybody want to add to that or correct me if i said anything wrong all right i'm learning every day any feel free the chat you can raise your hand um someone is wanting me to just make sure that i make it clear that there's um i can go back and show the dollar amounts just so it's clear um we can't fund necessarily a hundred percent of all projects so there's so many more slides now okay um but this is um the amount that we can give as a maximum grant award and the maximum percentage of the cost so it's up to a million dollars 100 percent for resilience plus renewables and a million dollars up to 50 for renewables only um we got a lot of questions just to give you some ideas on the first webinar we had about like specific project ideas that people had in mind that led to some good conversation so if you have anything in mind you're thinking and just want to know if it'll fit the project or question any other questions let us know i did see another one in the chat though which is great thanks joshua um this is a fire station it sounds like this could be an appropriate grant for the design phase to develop a renewable energy component what was the amount we could budget up front if awarded i'm gonna let that seems like one for but i think this slide is is helpful right so designing a five station renewable energy components so if it was just um kind of renewable well planning uh is it initially so yes planning renewable energy only you would be eligible if you're just in the planning stage uh up to like 100 100 000 dollars up to 100 if uh it was just and then moved on to construction renewable energy only a million dollars up to 50 of the total project costs and then if uh included the resilience it could be up to 100 of the project cost um and in terms of resilience versus energy uh own renewable energy only um it they'll be kind of reviewed competitively reviewed so um we have buckets set aside so at least up to at least 50 or more of the funding needs to go to kind of resilience projects it's not that resilient will get necessarily points above a renewable only but they have there is like we have to spend an amount of money on the resilience projects and they will be competitively reviewed and then we've got the renewable only they'll be competitively reviewed it's just kind of you will be able to get less uh money less less percentage of the total amount of the budget cost you'll still be able to get up to a million right right so in the end they could have that for the project for if you're doing the fire department construction i think this is right that you could during the design process get a planning grant from us and then have a hundred thousand dollars toward hiring a consultant who could then sort of pencil out what that renewable energy or renewables plus resilience project could look like for your fire department as well so just to i think that one of the things that um staff from our department flagged early was you know what do we do for places that aren't ready to apply for the project yet and then enable them to hire a consultant to make that plan essentially build what will become the application for the project and so that's what the planning grants are meant to be so um i'm gonna sorry to interrupt but as far as the upfront costs go we can award up to 30 of the grant funds um before the project is completed so that would be 30 dollars on a planning grant and three hundred thousand on a construction grant assuming they came in at the full grant values uh but yeah thirty percent up front is what the bill allows us to do um prior to construction or planning of the project great um i see michelle has her hand raised before we go to michelle i think we had just a quick um follow-up from alex if including resilience triples the cost of the project would it still be more likely to be approved over standalone renewable and i think james just kind of got into that a little it's really just a matter of like what the mix of who applies is just because we have to spend 50 percent of the funds on resilience renewables projects so renewables only projects it would just depend like if it was if we had if we had um that 50 criteria met then then it would be easier for us to approve that i don't think for us rob you can correct me if i'm wrong but does it matter for us if the resilience increases the cost of the project in our analysis of approving it is that anything in the criteria we have some general criteria around the kind of financial and technical viability of projects however we recognize that adding resilience is going to add a lot of cost and that accordingly brings a lot of points to an application in the competitive review so you know like christy said it's going to depend on the nature and number of applications that we get but we do have the carve out to spend at least 50 percent of the funds on resilience projects and those will earn more points in the competitive review and then final follow-up from alex and then i see now we've got we'll go to michelle next then we've got a lot in the chat so we'll get to you in the chat don't worry but alex just asked to follow up about would it require a separate application and my understanding is that it's yes you would have to apply separately even if you weren't sure which avenue you were going to go is that correct um i think if you were in the kind of the planning stage it just says would it require a separate application for renewable with resilience versus standalone renewable if both options are possible um so we would only be able to grant uh what uh one grant for the projects um i would say if you're kind of in the space and you are thinking about what your project is going to be we recognize the projects aren't going to be fully formed in the planning phase and if the development project that results from a planning phase isn't like kind of the criteria we're just hoping it results in a a proposal for developing a project in the end um so i would say if you're in the planning stage you might not necessarily feel like you want to put in two applications but if you're in the kind of construction kind of side of things um to get make sure you kind of have all the information in an application that will be needed to be covered in both uh applications you'd possibly want to um kind of submit both but i can kind of follow up on that as well yeah that sounds like a good approach michelle we're ready for you someone will get you off mute in one i used to be off meeting himself one of the projects we've been considering um after last summer so we operate the tillamook airport as well and for we needed we need new fuel we have fuel tanks over there for both hundred low lead and for jet a there was a fire up highway six we were caught in in a conundrum um with we worked to get with department of energy for an emergency fuel uh for air support for the fire um our tanks didn't they barely met the minimum of ten thousand gallon delivery um that was required for that um we're in the oregon resilience plan as one of the top airports for that would that type of project fit into this as far as rob i'm gonna direct that one to you so the cost of the storage tanks and would not be an eligible cost however if you wanted to have a pumping station for those tanks that were powered with solar and battery backup so that you could still pump the fuel in the event of a disaster those components that were associated with the batteries solar and pumping would be eligible costs so we can't buy the storage tanks but we could buy um the infrastructure to make sure it's operational in the event of a power okay perfect i just didn't want to spend all the time on something that wasn't didn't fit in the proper definition so thank you perfect yes and that's exactly i am we were pretty close to that jedi issue over the summer um as a department and um we actually are kind of looking at federal infrastructure dollars to be able to uh that that could be used for things like that so i'll um make a quick note that it's something you're interested in and if we see something going down the pipe that could work for that we'll let you know because it's definitely thank you i mean it's just looking at probably about a million dollars um before that updated system and it's just it's not in our budget anywhere and we were at least really stuck with the fire support for that yeah yeah and the same exact thing happened in southern oregon just before you two was two places over the summer with really similar issues so thanks for the flag",

        "text": " and so the so-called belly of the duck is the middle of the day when there's so much solar that it's meeting almost all of the demand for electricity and then we get to 5 p.m and the sun starts going down and people at least in the before times would get off work and would come home and would turn on lots of things that consume electricity and then we have this ramp and to meet that ramp california has traditionally relied on what are called pure plants which are natural gas plants that can spin up quickly as soon as they're needed increasingly batteries are also being used to address peak demand and as i said that's where lithium-ion batteries can really shine providing those shorter bursts of energy for minutes or just a few hours but it's expensive to build enough batteries to replace all of the flexible resources we had or phasing out that could meet that peak demand and so hydrogen can play a role here in two ways first it could help replace some of those natural gas peaker plants either combusted as a fuel or via fuel cells um which would allow you know a resource to meet that ramp quickly and then second electrolyzers producing renewable hydrogen as i mentioned earlier are a flexible load that can easily be turned off or down they're not critical functions so that's load that could easily be shed during times of peak demand and what i mean is that for example if you have electrolyzers on your system as you start to hit that 5 pm peak um you know that's that's demand that you could shed at that moment and so that ramp is easier to meet but really as i said long duration energy storage is when we talk about energy storage this is really a competitive advantage for lithium ion batteries will be able to take a lot of that peak demand ramp um and peaker plant replacement but as i said they're really only good for about four hours and after that they start to get fantastically expensive so when it comes to the grid where renewable hydrogen energy could really shine is in providing long duration or ener seasonal energy storage storage for days for weeks even months and this becomes increasingly important with our grid populated with variable renewable energy because there will be events when those resources don't perform for long periods of time say when we have a really long cold snap in the winter with low wind um you know we wouldn't be getting as much solar um you know we wouldn't be getting as much solar radiation um so we wouldn't be getting as much from wind either with the low wind and we could be having really high demand for heating in our increasingly electrified buildings and so here's a diagram that shows some of the available storage technologies and kind of where they fit on this access we've got storage capacity here and then release time and so you can see you know some of the batteries here um you know really makes sense for some of those shorter periods when we start looking at longer duration uh that's where we start to see compressed air pumped hydro and hydrogen as the most viable options and those are the three that nrel identified as most viable for that long duration energy and then finally transportation um and this is a slide that i sold from evan ramsey at the bonneville environmental foundation and these delectable claws give an idea of the role that electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles can play respectively in light duty and heavy-duty transportation for light duty you see that the medius part of the claw here is given over to electric vehicles with lithium-ion batteries what we all really think of when we say evs that's because these evs are great for light duty um you know the weight of the batteries isn't a huge issue and for many uses these vehicles do not need to be driven hundreds of miles every day and so the time to recharge the batteries isn't um you know a huge concern daily and there may be a role for hydrogen vehicles in the light duty sector and that's represented by the smaller part of the claw and over on the other on the heavy duty side you see the bigger part of the claw is give it over to hydrogen and this is because there are likely to be a number of use cases where the potential weight of um lithium-ion ev batteries could be a problem um as well as how much space those batteries could take up that could otherwise be used to carry more goods and some of these use cases will require the vehicles travel many miles a day on schedules that don't really allow for long refueling times so thus hydrogen um would make more sense and renewable hydrogen as a transportation fuel there so hydrogen is also being considered for a lot of ground equipment at ports and it's actually already in use for forklifts at many warehouses and so there are also some new pilot hydrogen fairies and other marine vessels though it's still unclear to what degree hydrogen might be deployed in the marine sector so here's the schematic from the usdoe and that shows a many number of end uses for hydrogen and renewable hydrogen um you know this is essentially a representation of the hydrogen economy and there are niches where in here where renewable hydrogen makes sense today like i said long duration energy storage it's hard to decarbonize sectors some transportation these are places where we're just really not spoiled for choice for other options and that's where we're likely and frankly already seeing hydrogen and renewable hydrogen deployed now whether or not we come to this kind of economy hydrogen economy-wide deployment in the graphic is a question and that will depend on a number of factors including what choices we make in our decarbonization journey and in plotting our path to it is important to remember that we do have choices we have options there is no one true road to decarbonization and every single one of those options is going to have trade-offs you know be it land use or materials use or cost and so on and so it's up to us to determine which trade-offs we're willing to make and so this schematic represents one of our possible decarbonization futures last slide wrapping up it's been a wonderful audience um what's happening with renewable hydrogen today and honestly there's so much going on and it's all changing rapidly and so i'm just going to give a generic update here um globally there are a number of countries that have announced renewable hydrogen strategies and targets the eu also has announced targets for deployed megawatts of electrolyzer there are demonstration projects in europe to inject renewable hydrogen into natural gas pipelines there's also been some work pairing offshore wind with electrolyzers here in north america british columbia announced last year its renewable hydrogen strategy pardon me and the usdoe recently launched its hydrogen shot program with the goal of getting down one dollar per one kilogram of hydrogen in one decade um though to be clear that this program applies to all pathways for hydrogen so but this does mean that there is a lot of research happening around renewable hydrogen and we also have the federal infrastructure bill that passed in august and that provides billions for renewable hydrogen through a number of with respect to projects in the pacific pardon me um there are also there's a project in washington at the douglas county public utility district and there are also some potential projects planned um or announced as possible in oregon that's nowhere near the universe of what's happening but that's enough for today so we made it and now for the discussion portion of program um i'm really looking forward to your questions and comments about renewable hydrogen um and the study that we're undertaking um as i mentioned earlier there are a number of required elements but we'd really like to hear from you about anything that you might think is missing from that um anything you'd like to see us add um and i'm actually going all right sorry i'm just trying to navigate a number of windows so i'm gonna go back to slide nine with our study requirements okay so um do we have any questions in the chat that um that i did not answer through the course of this presentation yes i think we have one that we can um probably clarify i think there was a little bit of discussion around it and i would say um to the rest of the folks if you have questions or comments start getting ready start thinking about it feel free to put your hand up and my colleague linda ross will start unmuting and calling on folks also feel free to continue to use the so rebecca we had a question and a little bit of back and forth starting with skip sponso and i apologize skip if i said your name around slide 20 you noted that trucking hydrogen is more expensive than pipelines and so the question is how do costs of tracking hydrogen compare to the cost for trucking and propane is the cost per hour of the truck on the road about the same and then ken dragoon responded saying that the trekking cost of hydrogen has a lower volumetric energy density about one-third that of natural gas so in short it takes more trucks to deliver the same amount of energy so uh what what do you think about that um i think thank you ken dragoon that is uh definitely a huge part of the cost as he mentioned as ken mentioned because uh hydrogen does have that lower energy density you're going to need more trucks to get the same amount of energy than you would another fuel um for class beyond that you know i have not looked into that yet um but the distribution costs of hydrogen are something that we will address in the great and there have been some uh helpful comments in the chat and just to let everyone know we will be exporting the chat so we'll have this recorded rebecca will have it as she continues with the study and with that uh linda any hands up yet i haven't seen anything new come in the yes there's a steve ellis that's going to be uh that we can unmute steve you can speak now hello yes steve okay sounds good hey this is steve ellison with uh first element uh true zero brand uh that's uh building hydration stations in california and first and foremost thanks for putting this together and a lot of good work here there's a lot to and certainly you know you're taking on a i'll call it the top of the funnel uh where as you pull through it you have opportunities to move some things along faster than others so one of my comments was when i hear the word study and i heard it a lot often that is uh often too often a excuse for delay and i don't mean that in a",

        "text": " the content requirements of House Bill 3630 um just give us a shout and we can have a conversation about that together um there is no match requirement for this program and it is a non-competitive program for counties our application window opened on May 22nd 2024 and will be open through February 28th 202 5 and our program deadline is August 1st 2025 so in terms of the plan requirements as Matt said um the requirements for plan content are stipulated in House Bill 3630 and we're going to go over each of them just so we can really be clear about what we're talking about when we're talking about the requirements for this plan content so the first one is that plans need to be based on and planned for short-term medium-term and long-term power outages these terms in term in terms of uh what they mean um they're not defined in the statute but our guidance for shortterm is hours medium-term is days and long-term is weeks you don't have to hold to that but that does fit within um the broader State approach to resiliency and really when we're thinking about things like Cascadia that potential for weeks long outages um so something to consider there plans need to identify and map existing energy infrastructure in the county including transmission lines distribution lines substations and energy storage systems natural Hazard risks and communities that experience social vulnerability um and social vulnerability if you're not familiar with this term um refers to a a group or a portion of the community's level of resilience in the face of external stressors such as energy disruptions or disasters it's a composite measure um comprised of different socioeconomic demographic factors so thinking about things like age access to a vehicle housing type um a level of English proficiency things like that that can either increase resilience or uh lower it and increase vulnerability uh counties need to consult with representatives from environmental justice communities to identify and map socially vulnerable communities uh environmental justice communities are defined in Oregon statute and 4077 so not in this one um but what that term what that definition comprises um it's a it's a significant definition rural communities um communities experiencing lower incomes communities of color tribal communities uh we have the full definition in our FAQs and we can definitely go over each of that but just wanted to give you a sense of what that term means so reaching out to representatives from these communities to identify and map um where social vulnerability is occurring in your county identify potential locations for Community resilience centers and communication zones that the public can access during a power outage um so as it might sound the intention of a community resilience Center is a place that members of the public can go during an energy disruption during an emergency um you know likely intended to be uh provide services and resources for broader emergency needs um but specific to energy you would be thinking about things like heat ing cooling air filtration um and then charging of devices charging of mobile devices um there might be other communication tools there ham radio satellite phones things of that nature and counties need to use locations of communities that experience social vulnerabilities to prioritize uh where these potential locations may be so thinking about where the communities with the most social vulnerability as priority places for some of of your community resilience centers plans need to inventory the energy consumption needs of critical Public Services facilities so you're seeing that term that is in our definition of what community energy resilience needs it's really Central to achieving it central to these plans um and what is a critical Public Service facility this is defined in House Bill 3630 it is a facility related to law enforcement fire protection Health and Medical Services Sanitation Services Fuel and fueling Public Works and Engineering public information and Communications and emergency response and while that might sound like a lot if we're thinking about an emergency those are the essential services that you know to have Community um response happen in an emergency are are really critical and to make sure that folks stay safe um plans need to identify critical Public Service facilities where the development of alternate energy generation storage resources will meet local energy resilience needs so the image shows U some wind power and some solar power um but there are a lot of different ways that counties can approach um alternate energy generation and storage resources it could include these other renewable sources of energy it could be um backup fuel fuel resources uh generators microG grids battery storage um lots of combinations and it can really be driven by your County's needs and your County's goals identify plans need to identify opportunities to coordinate and locate energy infrastructure development to align with and support critical Public Service facilities plans need to identify time schedules priorities and potential funding sources for developing energy resilience and plans need to identify other actions and resources needed to implement the energy plan so you can really see particularly in these bottom two uh bullets content requirements that these plans are put pushing towards implementation um the idea is really to Think Through what are the community needs and then what are the ways that your county can move closer to getting these really important projects put on the ground um so thinking through time schedules thinking through priorities and funding um and that is a really important benefit of these plans they really do get you so much closer to being ready to take advantage of those funding opportunities and project opportunities when they arise um and so those are the plan requirements and you know within that there there are quite Broad and I think there are a lot of ways that your county can shape these plans to align with and meet other similar goals whether it's for energy or Emergency Management um or Economic Development so you know within meeting these plan requirements we really encourage you to shape these plans to best meet your local community's needs and goals um the applications are available up on our website right now now we have two applications one for counties that are applying um individually just for their County and another for counties that are applying in a cohort and I will go over what does a cohort mean and look like in this program in a moment um if you haven't checked out our applications please do um if somebody from Odo could drop our program page in the chat right now that would be awesome and we'll also have it linked on another slide um but the applications are quite simple you know we really tried to keep them as streamlined as possible we don't want applying to be a burden for you participating in this program um so encourage you to check them out simple fillable PDFs thanks so much Odo team you're the best um so you apply you submit it to us we'll oo staff will review it for completeness and eligibility if we have any questions we'll just Reach Out directly to you to go over those um and then we ask that you submit to our program email which is um shown up here on the slide we'll use that programmatic email for formal subm of application performance agreement reporting forms things of that nature so other program requirements um so following the application process in the performance agreement we will do a one-time funds dispersement Our intention is to get funds out to your to your county so that access to funds is not a barrier to you getting going on your planning so we'll do that onetime fund funds dispersement after the performance agreement is complete eligible uses of funds include County staff time hiring technical assistance providers Outreach travel and other costs as necessary for plan development if you think you have some costs in other we can go over you can reach out to us and we can go over what um those eligible costs might be uh we do have some interim reports during the program the first will be in October 2024 the other in March 2025 these are brief reports and really the intention is just to check in and say what have you gotten done what are your goals for the next um time in the program and are you having any challenges or are there any ways that we can support you help you through those challenges the deliverables for the program are a copy of your completed plan and a program completion form by our program deadline of August 1st 2025 that program completion form um is a self attestation form that you've completed your plan met all the content requirements and then you know the other major component is asking how did you use your funds how you used them all approximately how much in which categories um and if you reach August 1 and you have not completed your plan we do have some flexibility in the program Ted tedline and um ability to have an extension until December 31st 2025 that's laid out very clearly in our application documents and FAQs and I'm happy to go over it in our question and answer session or another time um if you have further questions about it there are two other uh components and requirements of our program counties need to formally adopt their plans go through their adoption process within their County and they need to incorporate these plans into their natural Hazard mitigation plans um these are two requirements that are in House 3630 however we do understand that um the county adoption process is a public process and might have its own timeline in that natural Hazard mitigation planning processes happen on their own fiveyear timeline with FEMA and OEM um so these requirements don't have to be complete by the August 1st 2025 deadline your plan needs to be complete your program completion form in um but if you're still working through your county adoption process or your natural Hazard mitigation update isn't going to happen for several years that's okay you can incorporate it um in the next round of revisions so the cohort option that I mentioned um in this program counties can decide to work together and pull their funds in a cohort uh we don't have a minimum or maximum size requirement for that it's can be determined um by your group of counties counties who are working together in a cohort need to identify a lead County so this county is responsible for program processes and paperwork they'll receive the funds Distribution on behalf of their cohort and they'll be responsible for upholding program requirements on behalf of the cohort so as I said there is a cohort specific application um don't be intimidated by the length it really is the same as is essentially the same as the single County application we just asked for information um from each County and ask each County and the cohort to sign it once your cohort is moving forward to the performance agreement process um that will just be complete with that lead County and Odo um so if your counties choose to move forward in a cohort",

        "text": " its requirements to recognize specific risks presented by each project but as a matter of law the council does have that flexibility and as a matter of policy the council should exercise that flexibility in this first as a matter of law the council's rules quite clearly allow the council to exercise its discretion as to the appropriate amount of the bond the rules state that in order to issue a site certificate the council must find uh that the applicant has a reasonable likelihood of obtaining a bond or letter of credit in a form or amount satisfactory to the council that language satisfactory to the council plainly indicates that the council is to exercise its judgment as to the appropriate amount of the bond it's also consistent with mandatory condition 8 which repeats that the bond must be in a form and amount satisfactory to the council ms gilbert's interpretation would require the council to completely ignore the critical language in the rules which is inconsistent with basic rules of statutory construction as a matter of policy b2h's application confirms that a phased-in bonding approach is reasonable and i want to quickly say the bond doesn't stay at one dollar for the entire life the bond is designed to increase up to the full decommissioning amount by 100 years so it starts at year 50 increasing on a regular basis the cost to the maintain a bond is high and as mr ratcliffe said would be borne by rate payers moreover the risk that the company would ever retire b2h before 100 years is extremely low high voltage transmission lines are designed to operate in perpetuity and the company couldn't find any example of a 500 kv line that was ever additionally it's well understood that one of the most daunting challenges to achieving the greenhouse gas reductions required of oregon's electric utilities is the need to significantly increase close to doubling the amount of transmission capacity that we have given the urgent need for this capacity it's hard to imagine that b2h would be retired before the end of its useful and finally even in the unlikely scenario that the line did need to be it's highly unlikely that the company would default on its decommissioning obligat obligations given its financial financial strength and its status as a public utility that's been in existence for a hundred years and i do want to briefly mention ms gilbert points to the fact that the council did not allow a phased-in approach for the bake oven solar project but that decision isn't on point because bake oven wasn't similarly situated as was pointed out by the hearing officer specifically in that order the council stated that the developer is an independent power producer and not a public utility which would have access to rate recovery authorization from the state puc to dismantle and restore a facility for those reasons we ask you to adopt the hearing officer's recommendation to adopt a phased-in approach thank you hey miss rapner any questions from councilman condon member condon um thank you for being here today for so long and something tells me the next few days just a question for you um as you have done transmission lines in other states i think i'm allowed to ask this um do you have security instruments on any of your transmission lines so before we do answer this question uh we do need to stick to what is already in the evidentiary record if i don't have the full record in front of me right now so i can't um you know completely assure that that's the case but i would ask that we do stick to what's in the record and i am really sorry but there is nothing in the record on that question all right thank you very much thank you miss raptner thank you if i may i'll quickly share the department's position with regard to this contestant case issue patrick rowe with the department of justice don't want to repeat too much uh we do ms rachner stated we disagree with ms gilbert's position that uh this is that council is bound to require uh a bonding more than what has been proposed as ms rachner pointed out the rule gives council discretion uh it's essentially what council finds to be satisfactory to uh to comply with the standard or to provide assurance the department believes that the proposed gradual of financial assurance is appropriate because it recognizes the low risk that the proposed facility would be retired in the first several decades of operation and the low risk that the applicant would not be able to pay for decommissioning and restoration if it were to be retired early this facility is distinct from other energy facilities that come before council for the reasons that ms rachner noted it is just an energy facility it's a transmission line being proposed by a utility with a long history of operation and inability to recover costs from rate payers if necessary a couple comments that ms gilbert made in her oral testimony uh she referenced and it might have kind of slipped through that council is precluded from applying a balancing to the retirement financial assurance standard that is correct and i'll remind council what the balancing determination is the balancing determination says that if an applicant comes to the department of counsel and says we don't think we can meet this particular standard they can ask council to apply a balancing determination and assess whether the overall public benefits of the proposal outweigh the adverse effect on the resource that's protected by the standard so for example if it was the fish and wildlife standard they say we can't meet that well council could deter to balance and say well do the benefits of this proposed facility outweigh the impacts on fish and wildlife that's not happening here the applicant has not said they can't meet the standard and the department has not uh applied a balancing determination to this standard uh ms gilbert also mentioned court decisions that say that say council is prevented from waiving again that's not what's happening here the department is not recommending that council waive the retirement financial assurance standard it's to the contrary the count the department has recommended how council can find compliance with the standard see i'm running low on time so that's all i have for now thank you any questions after condon uh council member condom for the record um mr rope um i think i think this question is appropriate um in the material um it the uh cost to rate payers is um included and as far as f-sec is concerned that does not come under per view or it's not within our jurisdiction how much it's going to cost rate payers is that correct that's correct that's a that's a public utility commission issue yeah thank you okay so um once again now that we've heard from everyone um you are free to ask me any questions that you might want to in terms of uh legal issues and this is open for deliberation as far as the contested um case is concerned i i don't have any um questions or concerns about that but i do have some concerns about the proposed order and so i are we going to wait we want to wait for that discussion or excuse me for the record todd cornett so we can either consolidate and make one sort of straw poll like i talked originally but if you're concluded that you have uh you agree with the hearing officer on the proposed contested case order and you just want to deal with that straw poll right now we can deal with that and then you can move back to the proposed order it is entirely your choice it'd be nice to check that off okay so i don't have any objections to the contested case order mrs hanley sorry it's the council member content for the record thank you uh the contested case order is taking into consideration the proposed order as we see it right i mean she's the administrative law judge has made a decision on the contested cases i don't have any issues with that so as long as it doesn't touch as long as we have an opportunity to question the proposed order you're good to go okay so you want me to call the cholesterol poll so i have the council agrees with the findings of fact conclusions of law and conditions of approval in the proposed contested case order pertaining to issue and if that sounds good i will call cindy condon jordan truitt and buyer hanley jenkins yes harry choctoot ken howe yes thank you so we're back now to the proposed order retirement and financial assurance standard one counselors have comments counselor condon and i'm i'm i'm telling tardy weather here i'm uh passing the ball and i'm to the extent there's a little bit of lag but i'm trying to pull it up here excuse me this is the court reporter um yes chris yeah i wasn't sure if um council member condom was saying anything because everybody was muted okay thank you um what was the what was the last thing you have recorded it said so counselors have comments and then it went to you so i'm saying if ms uh or council member condon said anything it was not recorded thank you this is councilmember condon and i will repeat it i would like to turn the attention to recommended retirement and financial assurance condition five and i think it's now brought up on the screen with respect to that i think what we as we've discussed this project is very different than some of the others we've discussed in the past but i also think that 50 years is a very long time and obviously 100 years is even longer i question dollar for the first 50 years uh this is a changing industry i think we're going to see more change in the next 20 years than we've seen in the last 70 and so from a financial perspective it strikes me that we by conditioning this project as we have suggested here we are putting oregon taxpayers as the should something happen it might not be likely but it could happen and certainly given the changes in energy per generation um just everything that's going on in in energy and what i would like to see here right now the added language what in red in the document is the department shall review the five year idaho power would be obligated to do a five-year report and i would like the report to be annual or i'd like to see it as an annual report and in addition that um or at any time required by the council should something happen bankruptcy some event that would um cause us concern in terms of the the conditions we put on that thing they obligate taxpayers of the state to be that backstop i'm uncomfortable so i i would like us to retain the ability to always um come back and say we need a bond to speak to the wrist risk cindy i'm i'm not clear",

        "text": " final project equipment might differ uh slightly from what was proposed in the application uh however I do want to point out that because these projects are competitively reviewed uh if you are awarded uh we will be looking at uh that final uh during a performance agreement or that final assessment of a project that the project and the components are substantially similar to what was proposed in the project if uh if it's not then that is something that could have impacted your competitive review in an earlier stage so just wanted to make quick note of that I don't clay I don't know if you have anything to add there um no the The Fallout of that could come up in the final determination of eligible costs for your reimbursement for your Grant distribution so that's the warning there right right excellent point uh as we uh keep moving through on these key app questions in section six uh we come to another one that's a bit of a compound question um this is uh please detail a resource assessment demonstrating adequate resource supply for the proposed system operations the resource assessment must describe a the type of resource or resources available B explain how the applicant evaluated the resource and see how the system will access the resource and again just as a quick tip you're writing this to reviewers who are assessing this the easiest way for them to disseminate this information from the question is in that compounded format the a through C in addition for this round we have also produced uh the resource assessment guide which you'll find under the applicant help tab on the crap webpage so definitely use that as a resource prior to filling out the application I think it'll give you some details of what we would be looking for and uh clay what would you like to add here yeah so another this is a great place for us to remind folks because normally this is a question that will have supporting documentation with it um you know assessments of of the power produced and things like that so put put all the information in the text box in the online application and then clearly name and reference your supporting documentation so also in that text box and then you will upload the document that has that matching name that you put in the text box as an uploaded document so that way all the reviewers can quickly match an answer in the online application with the downloaded document that you've provided and the names match and the question numbers match and things like that so it makes the review possible they cannot review information that they cannot find and that can affect your score um this resource assessment is lumped in with the strength of project so it's part of all of the things that that have a maximum value of 45 out of 100 points on the strength of application all right uh and I want to put one additional note here is that within that resource assessment guide uh the pro this our program does not uh specifically require any specific type of documentation to support that uh we know that within each uh with each industry or sub-industry of Renewables that there are multiple ways of providing this type of information from different uh different companies different software Etc uh what we're looking for is that information that you can provide there but we're not requiring a specific type I just wanted to make note of that and we'll go ahead and continue forward in the presentation uh this particular question is going to only come up for those projects uh in the opportunity announcements that are for construction of a renewable energy system with a resilience component to it as well and that question is describe the proposed operational use cases for the storage system including emergency power I'm sorry emergency backup power providing grid Services demand reduction Arbitrage or any other planned uses this is another area where for this um we have produced a uh a simple a basic guide that's available in the applicant help tab that's the resilience level assessment guide and the only other piece that we want to make sure we're talking about is when it comes to this resilience component is that we're looking for how this system uh also is supporting a broader local community benefits that are essential to the public welfare and Clay would you like to add anything on on this one well I think we've mentioned that in previous videos that again our definitions are very specific to this project and so make sure that you understand that we repeat it in in the language here on essential to the public welfare that is a key part of our resilience definition for crap that it has to provide grid outage services that provide this essential essential services to the public welfare in an outage um and again this falls under strength of project description um and part of that overall um scoring for for the strength of your right and uh just as as a quick hint um uh what Claire's referring to if you did not watch the very first video on the pro in this series the program overview there is a section where uh clay uh discusses that in terms of our definitions versus what you may find elsewhere uh even in the Private Industry world so if you haven't already make sure to go back and and check that out uh each one of these videos is helpful even the overview video as it relates to your application uh and we'll continue moving forward um and in this project description uh this question is described the community buildings infrastructure or other community assets that will benefit from the proposed system and you know what we're starting to look at here is a question that starts to move into our program priorities and Community benefits section an equity section of or yeah the equity section of the program uh what we're looking for here is to include how the system supports broader local or qualifying environmental justice Community benefits again that are essential to the public welfare and Clay would you like to add anything here well this is an example of where questions sort of overlap um and so that's why I want you to take your time to prepare individual answers for each question before you've read them for the first time because you may get to this question to say oh I answered this completely in the previous question because they are sort of similar and so make that distinction and read the questions carefully out of the application user guides and that way you prepare ahead of time and get the right language with the right question excellent yeah and can't agree more I just want to uh pause or I'm sorry we want to come to the conclusion of this one uh just reminding everyone again uh reading the the opportunity announcements reading the the competitive review scoring criteria going through the helpful information uh the tips and the guides that are available on the website even going through the legislation itself and the rules for the program for your particular project opportunity announcements these are all vital to your success we think with the application uh clay do you have any other things that you'd like to add here as we're wrapping this up nope thanks Jason okay well wonderful well thank you again for joining us for uh this video on Section six and uh we hope you'll keep moving forward our next video will be over the project plan and we look forward to uh seeing you in that one thank you very much",

        "text": " a hydrogen electrolyzer is not a synthetic fuel plant you're not giving anything to anybody they still have to go get a local land use approval they still have to site that facility according to local land use requirements they would still have to have legal access to the volume of water that they need to produce the amount of um hydrogen that they're intending to produce so um and you know as as Michael indicated you know some areas of the state you know we have you know groundwater limited areas and and critical groundwater areas and you know water is becoming more and more scarce so this again that's something that a developer of a hydrogen electrolyzer would have to figure out as part of their process and then I don't remember the first part of the question but see more oriented towards you yes so I I was just going to address so the water that is that does go through the process and and does get converted to hydrogen and oxygen that the water would go away yes yes so you would lose water in that process uh a fair amount of that water is used for cooling and maintenance of that electrolyzer you can imagine flushing it out cleaning out things like that um and so within that process some of that water is um you know uh would be considered kind of Wastewater uh and so you know with that it should be tested and made sure before it goes into a Waterway so but that wouldn't necessarily be at jurisdiction but certainly an important piece to it somebody will mind the I would recommend that thank you if I could just make a a quick comment uh on the water consumption issue that was something that was mentioned in the legislative history but there was Al no discussion of it by the legislature the legislature was entirely focused on coal gasification plants that was all the testimony if you look at it talks about coal gasification and that's why we want to put it as as Todd mentioned in FC jurisdiction the other thing that I want to mention it's on this slide and Todd mentioned it earlier is you're not we're not discussing today whether or not Council has jurisdiction over the facility that produces the electricity that the electrolyzer would use use we're just talking about the electrolyzer itself so if if the electricity that an electrolyzer uses uh is produced by a facility that meets the thresholds for your jurisdiction you would have jurisdiction over that facility yeah thank you Patrick yeah and that's why I emphasized at the very beginning by themselves so a hydro hydrogen electrolyzer by themselves not necessarily you know taking that hydrogen and producing electricity or other elements or their components just the hydrogen electrolyzer um plant that's the only thing that's under that we're asking you to review today councelor Grill I for the record this is Marcy Grill I just in my simple mind I was like through first of all it feels very you know scientific techy stuff but is this in my head the same thing that happened with you're being very specific about by itself about the whole generator thing that PGE present it I mean like that's what I see in my mind is oh if I can get a little piece here then it turns into something more so I appreciate the emphasis on by itself yeah thank you council member gril and I think the important thing is this is not a question of should this be within council's jurisdiction this is looking at the language of the statute when it's create when it was created in 1981 is it within council's jurisdiction so this is not a policy conversation this is an interpretation of Statute um which you know people may have different thoughts and ideas whether these should be or shouldn't be within Council jurisdiction that's not really what's being asked it's being asked at the time that this was created this that that this was put in statute you know can we now say that there was an intention that this type of thing was thought through and and should be included in there you know because of again what their thought was at the time in 1981 now the legislature could come back at a future date and there could be a proliferation of hydrogen electrolyzers and you know we see all kinds of issues and concerns and the legislature may say no that's a significant thing we think that should be within FC jurisdiction that's a policy decision this is not what you're being asked today you're being asked to interpret language um that was established in 1981 that's now applying to something that really wasn't anticipated in 1981 um next slide please so with that um that kind of gets to the you know the staff's recommendation so you know we we've evaluated this and again not whether it should or shouldn't be is whether we believe it is based upon the language and our recommendation is Again by themselves we do not believe based on our research you know of the history the context and then comparing the relative Technologies we do not believe and we recommend that the hydrogen electrolyzer does not constitute a synthetic fuel plant as that is defined or as that is part of the definition of an energy facility um in statute so unless you have additional questions we can step away and allow for a public okay okay anyone in the room interested in making um any webinar or phone interest any commenting so nobody wow that's loud all right I do not see any hands raised at this time but let me go ahead and remind everybody online how you would make a comment if you wanted to do so um if you are participating on the webinar uh at the bottom of the main screen there's a set of icons click on the participant and at the bottom of that window is a hand icon click on that hand that will raise your hand and when you're finish commenting you can click it again to lower it if you are participating on the phone press star three on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and star three again when you're finished with your comments there are no hands raised at this time okay I think we can close the public comment and um next slide please back to so getting back to the you know what your options are option one is as I just articulated in our recommendation um option two would be uh the same as option one but with some additional thought or context or evaluation that Council wanted to include on the record um and then the third option was would be that you actually do believe that hydrogen Facility by itself does constitute um a synthetic fuel plant as that's defined or included in the definition of of energy facility and then you would need to provide you know your reasoning and justification for okay any discussion councelor Condon thank you um Cindy Condon um I just want to be clear this kind of comes from my background a little bit this Council would have no jurisdiction over a petroleum Refinery correct well I I don't want to say correct I would say I would have to go look at the rule or the statute to see if a petroleum Refinery would fall within you know the definition of an energy facility um so I'm not sure of that okay um the Practical kind of reality is you know there's no petroleum refineries in Oregon so all of our all of our petroleum comes in from out of state not your question but yeah well and the reason I asked the question is a petroleum Refinery creates the product that this is doing the same it doesn't produce electricity we don't know what the hydrogen is going to be used for or the oxygen and so in my mind I struggled with this actually um but in my mind it came down to that that we don't have jurisdiction or I don't believe we have jurisdiction over a petroleum or would have uh jurisdiction over a petroleum Refinery for the production of fossil fuels so um I view it similar to that you any other comments or questions do we have a councelor gr thank you for the record this is Marcy Grail Mr chair I move that the council determine a hydrogen electrolyzer by itself does not constitute an energy facility as described in ORS 4693 111 AF for the reasons present it recommended by staff do you have a second second thank you um councelor develin so we've got a motion in a second um secretary esterson could you please call the rooll Marcy gril yes Cindy Condon yes Kent how yes Katie IMS yes Perry chak toot yes Anne berer yes Richard develin yes motion carries Mr chair thank you that was very I think it's just interesting now that we're you know we're seeing different you know Technologies and the proliferation of different Technologies and you know the reality is you know the rules and statutes just haven't contemplated you know like battery energy storage systems you know we're the the world is catching up to some of these you know and it's not battery is not a new technology hydrogen it's not a new technology but the sort of significant increase in proliferation of them is and so we're going to be dealing with these things for a while very good okay let's see thank and we are at the end so uh any comments for the good of order oh wait yes uh we got to go back the letter from um the extension comment period extension request by m requesting um the extension and everybody's had a chance now to read her letter and do we need any discussion of that sharings great anybody have a question or comment after reading it yes um councelor buer excuse me apologies I'm not continu this um just just want to acknowledge the request and understand that um there's never enough time to comment but that the comment period that the department offered um according to our Council was 45 days as opposed to the minimum 21 so I um suggest that the department has offered a robust comment period and um would suggest that we continue with this process as staff has proposed okay that that's a motion uh it's a statement but it could be a motion yeah that's what I'm thinking I just had a question yeah is the mapping the mapping tool that the staff uses is available on the website and is um public to use is that correct secretary cornette no I know presenting this assistant director cor um for today um thank you uh council member IM and so we want to take an opportunity um you know most times we actually don't use use you know sort of a uh argis um mapping we use our own like the the same data that's available on the you know aressa tool we talked about the aressa tool it's a publicly available tool um you know online mapping tool and we include a",

        "text": " so and uh we we had a big hearing about it we had farmers in here and and um you know it's obviously a situation where some Farmers wanted them because they could make you know money on uh issuing their land the challenge was uh really high uh value Farmland was being taken up with these and I think and I'm going to speak for myself I I was the legislature won't let you build a house on 80 acres or less unless you can or whatever the number is unless you can produce so much income but yet we're going to start taking away farmland for renewable energy that um uh you know could be could be a problem so you weren't here yet were you okay so it was Janet and Sam uh yeah commissioner Carlson and and it was unanimous we had a big hearing about it uh and uh we we voted to because the the legislature allowed us to opt out of this okay so we said go put it in efu land on the east side where your trucks or whatever so basically we we stopped it from um back in 2018 and um I don't know that we've had others since then this might be the first one that's gone this far at least I'm sure there's been others denied that just haven't been appealed to us yeah to my knowledge this is the first one that's that's gone this far yeah and I've in my time here in three and a half years I'm not sure we've had an application for one so so much chair for me I mean it'd be up to the the two of you I I'm saying I'm going to deny it but I mean that's where I would go today but if you wanted to uh have somebody come in and go through the facts and do all that stuff you know I'm I'm open to the board's desire I actually agree oh yeah I'm not I totally support the decision from 2018 I just think it's important to have it on the record stated today and then also just for my own information I did do some research prior to today and had conversations uh with different residents throughout Marion County specifically some in North Kaiser who are pretty pissed off about the fact that there is a solar farm just north of the volcano Stadium on efu land that demolished a bunch of um well some long-term crops there I think that it is there's mixed emotions around this sure and I understand that but I agree with you wholeheartedly that if we can't do more practical things on efu land like supporting housing and families and the expansion of farms um I don't know why we would put solar Farms there and there was a a discussion that we had had my first year in 2021 where there was a solar farm that was causing us quite a bit of Havoc it had been code enforced on their you know um the grass and the foliage around it was a fire hazard and it took public works I recall this Brandon probably who was here trying to get us through this enforcement process but because they become quite a burden because they're not you know technically managed they're just out there so I don't I I do support the denial of the appeal and want to uphold the 2018 decision so for me it's less I mean I I support the decision I have friends on both sides who are farmers but for me what this is about is it's a legal interpretation dispute okay and so I don't think we're going to provide any Clarity on this legal interpretation Luba is the one that will do that so I think from our from my perspective as I look at like Marion County interprets the code in the law this way their attorney interprets it this way it's like that's something for Luba so so if we deny this appeal in a pulled the hearings officer decision that allows the applicant if they want to keep going on this thing to go to Luba and say hey Luba who's right in interpreting law here I don't know that us having a hearing is actually gonna do anything other than make that process take longer not provide any Clarity on that so I I would just as soon deny it and if they want to keep going they can go ask Luba what they think yeah Jane were you here when we did this hearing do you want to add anything that there are a whole bunch of conditions that the board added to the solar farms and they were just really confusing and it was hard for applicants to figure out if they applied and that was all part of of all the testimony that's that's what I recall and I also recall that there was some discussion about going to the Planning Commission but that's well I think I think the discussion was I mean there may be some efu land that can't be it's dry land it's Hills out South Salem or something that that we were talking about okay well go ahead and you know put a solar farm on this hill that you maybe you can you can grow some sort of grain on it or whatever but we were just like how do you get to that point where the soils are are not high value in discussing it but the challenge was these things were going in really close here in the valley to the infrastructure where they you know pgd needed them so okay Mr chair if you're ready I'm ready uh I will make a motion that um Let me let me go back here and look at my where I'm at so this is the make a motion that we deny the appeal and uphold the hearings officer decision denying the request of cu-22041 all right second the motion we have a motion a second is there any further discussion seeing none all those in favor signify by saying aye aye aye aye the motion passes okay thank you Austin thanks for your work on that um okay so that concludes our uh agenda for today is there anything else that uh you'd like to share with us commissioners look I went to jail last night and then you got out that's the important part is getting out of jail yeah the sheriff walked me out actually uh and he said this might be the last time he walked me out of jail he might have to come visit you next time yeah yeah as a citizen as a as a citizen uh it was great to see um those people those you know employees that are serving Marion County Citizens and what they do inside that that facility and it was it's always humbling to go and and well when we do our tour and see what's going on in their yeah and the good work that they do to keep the place clean and and treat people with dignity and um there was a couple of the deputies I was talking to and they just said they had a an individual in there that was going through alcohol withdrawals last night and they said that that is the worst it's worse than drugs to and and they describe this individual and and it was like his they know about his life outside and it was really interesting so they they not only do their job but they care about you know people that that come there and they they have a heart for what they're going through so that was a always a good thing to go out and celebrate Corrections and nurses nurses week and uh um to see everybody and they had instead of barbecue they had well they had barbecued like uh smoked chicken with rice and it was it was like Hawaiian right yeah it was like it was like a Smokehouse Hawaiian thing is that what you had yeah for lunch yeah yeah and then they had um drumsticks ice cream drumsticks I missed the drumsticks I hadn't had one in a while yeah it was good yeah it's good to see everybody it seemed like the morale was high and people were you get about themselves when I went so and I was at the Oregon garden yesterday afternoon with uh Oregon Department of Forestry and it was really interesting because I walked in there and you've we've met some of the people that have been at our meetings like up in the canyon and there was a panel up there that was giving their their talk about what they went through in the fire and making decisions and how they've taken one of the guys was talking about how still today he will be criticized because he pulled everybody back in a certain spot and he said you know he's talking about making decisions as a leader and taking the consequences as a result of that but he said all I could think about was people's lives and that's why he made that decision and there there was hardly a dry tear in the place when they were they were doing it and here we are almost three years later them talking about what they went through that night that day um so that was pretty cool yesterday to be over there but the organ that the garden Resort needs some work that air conditioning wasn't working it was hot in there that's not our issue but um well thanks for being there no sir okay done with that we're",

        "text": " in september we're assuming kind of mid to late september uh the final report outline with recommendations will be available for the commission and public review uh in late september or early october and will then hold a meeting in mid to late october and if needed mid to late agree on what our recommendations should and then we'll go back and we'll do final modeling on the scenario that the commission is recommending which just to remember it could be one of the two scenarios we have or it could be taking some assumptions and actions from both scenarios and blending them and then hopefully we'll get the report all wrapped up by mid-december so that it is available um in advance of the legislative session so that's uh our what we what we anticipate happening uh this has been a big and complicated uh project and so um some of this may shift a little bit but uh hopefully we'll be able to stay on and get our our report wrapped up so that we can submit it to the legislature in december any questions on processing next steps not seeing anything in the chat hands raised great well let's go ahead and take a 10 minute break be back at um or as close to that as we can get back and then we'll go into public comment linda if you could send me during the break uh how many people we have that are interested in doing public comments uh and if you haven't signed up yet please do that right away and then we'll come back and have discussion about where we are in the process and where we need to go any preliminary reactions from commissioners about the choices that we have to make and how we should be thinking about all of this i propose we go into a 10-minute break thank you kathy sorry about the technical difficulties in the beginning no worries it took a while for me to get used to the lag yeah it was definitely i don't know whether we should try and always have somebody at odo presenting yeah that we could we could do that it's just everybody can try it actually the odo system works doesn't work as well as the home ones yeah we could uh try we could try and move through though see if we could move through a little bit um i'm not sure if it has anything to do i'll ask it if it has have anything to do with how many people go online too because it seems to have gotten better as we had a little bit of a reduction in um people turning off their their visuals like their their uh video so it kind of got a lot better when we did that so um we did have nora abner and she said hi linda are we still doing public comment periods today i'm just asking because remember the public are chiming in to her asking if they can talk okay so we've had oh go ahead i'm sorry you go ahead um yeah and we had a couple people raise their hand and then they put their hands down because they weren't getting called on so we may want to addre say something to the effect that we've saved for the we save public comment and consider them their attendees i should have said that that was during the public comment period so it's kind of kind of my fault i should have said for the public comment period in there so no that's okay and i think last time we uh let some people make comments so um i think uh and you know if during if we get through the commission discussion you know we could certainly allow a little bit of public comment after that if we have time i'm having trouble finding the place to mute and unmute uh mutant unmute okay not showing up on my screen she said it was down at the bottom at the very bottom of your um information there should be a kind of a menu bar across the bottom yeah there isn't mute start video share yeah there might be go take a break let's see we have we have two currently um we have just a moment i'm sorry uh jake stevens and i will unmute him there you go check your unmuted thank you jake welcome if you could keep your comments to about three minutes and and maybe um before we go to public comment for others um ask after the public comment period we will have um the commission will have a discussion if we still have time on the agenda and there are more questions that the public has that would like to ask questions um we're happy to try and accommodate that but we'll have kind of the commission discussion first and then um see if there's time so with that um jake welcome and i love to hear your thoughts about our work yeah hi my name is jake stevens i'm the ceo of new sun energy and we are an oregon based developer of renewable energy uh primarily solar and battery storage and um so i'm a couple quick comments uh just high level as well as a couple specific ones on that great presentation we are at in the uh you know renewable energy space and incredibly active in a variety of venues throughout the state dealing with the decarbonization effort particularly obviously on the electric power segment it have been for about seven years so i was surprised to learn of the existence of this commission within the last week or so um which is both delightful as well as a uh concerning that um you know there's probably not some sort of connection or back and forth or mutual and i'm guessing that that's probably representative for a lot of the rest of the renewable energy development community obviously a lot of the policies and efforts involved in decarbonization have a bit to do with renewable generation and its proliferation so i'm simultaneously completely impressed with the type of analytics and the body of folks that is gathered here um that we just saw and has been going on um and very impressed uh as well as obviously you have to wonder about what might be falling in the cracks relative to the opportunities as relates the renewable energy piece of things um so i figured that was worth at least flagging and and bringing the folks attention and i'm happy to connect with people in the future and and talk about how that stuff fits in uh we have several thousand megawatts of generation uh under development in the state and recently commissioned the first ever bonneville directly connected solar projects in the pacific northwest four projects built across lake and harney county at four different locations they're probably paying about a half million bucks a year of property taxes across those two at this point we have maybe uh over a dozen permits and a dozen half a dozen counties across central and eastern oregon um and thus a pretty extensive experience dealing with a lot of the issues involved in legislation and as well as the agencies i think at a high level i think it's what seems to be absent in our relative to state agencies is sort of proactive efforts to look at how agencies might actually facilitate the decarbonization efforts as relates and facilitating renewable energy and we've actually seen quite a bit of the opposite from agencies and uh sort of direct counter flow and using precious resources to sort of work against those efforts and i probably should leave it there but you know that's resulted in literally having to take issues to the court of appeals um and so forth to help facilitate and avoid adverse policies that are being advocated by agencies as well as you know dealing with uh many of these things which i think really beautifully have been put forward here in terms of like what are the benefits of the state of oregon at hb 2021 has a policy statement that it is the state of oregon's policy to the maximum extent possible all this new clean energy in hp 2021 i.e 100 of the future for pacific corps and portland result in direct benefits to communities in the state of oregon in the form of labor income creating and sustaining living meaningful wage jobs and reducing burdens on environmental justice communities we've had the public utility commission explicitly state that they don't have to do anything related to that to the point that we've had to now take them to court to get them to potentially give meaning to those words and their procurement policies as they oversee the procurements for the utilities so i think there's a broad base of opportunities to help remove those obstacles in the state and potentially just also look at you know what the agency should be doing to accomplish the major scale goals you know how many thousands of acres do we want to have successfully permitted in these timelines to facilitate the decarbonization that i think all this good work depends on in many cases wanted to flag one nexus recognizing that most of what was just presented really wasn't about power generation um but i you know new sun is particularly expert in the transmission system bonneville in and that's you know that's the fatal flaw in the decarbonization efforts we're massively short and there will be 10 and 15 year delays and the permitting process alone for the development and construction of transmission to solve those problems for you know billions of dollars new facilities are and uh as i've been contemplating and diving deeper and deeper into that um you know the i keep coming back to realizing that the energy efficiency implementations that might occur in the portland area potentially have pretty outsized impacts in reducing the actual new transmission builds required to succeed because they effectively will take the edge off of the peak demands of the entire portland area when energy efficiency reduces the peak draw that'll actually mitigate the peak transmission needs and so there's some other pretty major co-benefits that you know may have decade-long benefits and billion-dollar sort of avoided costs associated with them that i think would be you know worth considering incorporation and some of this modeling so anyways i'll pause there and happy to ask answer any questions or you know sync up with folks in the future but i think there's some some big pieces there that again just continually having become aware of this this group uh hopefully fit in somewhere in this yeah thank you jake uh glad you found us and uh we did uh have a focused conversation around transmission needs storage needs associated with one of our recommendations in our 2020 report to the legislature which was the 100 percent clean electric sector um recommendations so uh we did follow up with some deep dives certainly i think would be beneficial to um to circle back to that uh as we start to look at how we implement these these programs and and understand a little more about what the utilities are proposing so thank you linda i have lost",

        "text": " filter of our standards and come up with what we call analysis areas that are required for each of our standards um that need to be what needs to be included in the actual application because at a notice of intent it's a notice of intent to file it or submit an app for a site certificate no application has actually been submitted or received so the applicant is preparing all the materials to include in their application with at this time and so while I write the project order they're working on their studies and coordination and Analysis coming up with their plans and then we issue the project order and it will tell the applicant what needs to be included in that application and that is you so we issue the project Court the notice of intent is valid for two years so in the time that from the notice of intent phase we received a complete notice of intent on this project on September 28th 2023 they have two years to submit an application now the applicant has indicated they would like to submit it earlier than that but just realized there's a two-ear window that they have to to uh submit that application so it could be as late as September 2025 that they would actually submit but it's up to them and how how soon they they get it all together so the next stage is the actual preliminary application and then what we call a complete application so again they submit information to us for review and the application is quite expensive um they're exhibits documents survey reports everything that gets in there we again issue of public notice we will open it up again for public comment and then we have an information meeting at that point too and that's important there's been particularly a long period of time that's elapsed between the noi and the actual application and again we review with the four naming agencies um reviewing agencies the tries the local governments um for this project because it's located in Wasco both of those Counties have been identified as special advisory groups there are more of Commissioners so Wasco County and shman County had the ability to participate in our process as what we call special advisory groups and they will also provide input throughout our process and then the next step is the draft proposed order the department of energy cting division staff we prepare the draft proposed order and it's our evaluation of the application materials and as we run it through a filter of our standards so we make recommendations in those draft proposed orders we include conditions that need to be that should be added to a site certificate these are all recommendations for our Council we then issue yet another public notice um and it opened up another period but we also hold what is a public hearing and that is after the materials have been made available to the public so that they're on our web page you've been received a a notice there's ways for people to go in who are interested and read all these materials or maybe they just want to read some of them and a public hearing is a formal public comment period And when I had mentioned the contested case proceeding which is built into our process if you want to participate in a contested case or think you might it's very important that you have commented on the record of the draft it's a really important thing to to keep in um we bring that draft proposed order to the energy facility citing Council for review after it's gone through the public hearing we compile all the comments that we received um and they review it and they will make comments themselves and make recommendations to us and things that they might want see change and we take that information and we process it and add it into the document and edit the draft proposed order and then it becomes the proposed order we again issue a notice when we issue that notice there's an a notice of the opportunity of the contest case toing and there will be information on how to request a contested case or be a party to a contested case at that time in that notice the contested case is built into our process if no one requests a contested case we don't have one we don't actually hold one but there it's a placeholder in our process if there's a contested case there is a whole process that goes through before it goes to the final order again Council will review this proposed order they might have additional comments at the very and we take our proposed order and we take it to council for approval it's Council the a council that makes the decision to Grant or deny a site certificate for a facility so if you look at under the the pointy arrows there's different colored uh boxes under each of those and what's that's showing is who's basically the lead on that so notice of ATT 10 it's the applic job to prepare that the project order is the Department of energy I staff that prepare that again the application materials are prepared by the applicant we prepare the sighting division the draft proposed order and the proposed order council is the one that makes the decision on the S so kind of a big overview of our process and what is not on this slide is the appeal path a final fet decisions are appealable directly to the Oregon SU court and they have six months to issue a decision if it is we have a public guide on our website um there's copies of the public notice if you didn't get one on the table back there along with some information sheet and there are links on there and how to get to all of ours um on the internet can you take questions during this or do you want to wait we would like you to hold questions till the end but if you want us to go back to a slide we can do that June so I had mentioned earlier reviewing agency this is just a little bit more information on you know what what are the review reviewing agencies what is their role what how do we utilize reviewing agency input and coordination and the reviewing agency serve a really important role in our process because they provide comments on the proposed facility um within the jurisic or expertise of the agency so if if there are sensitive species then we talked to ODFW about habitat and habitat mitigation plans in the species that might be impacted so it's a really important part of us getting information and like I said these are the state agencies the local governments the tribal governments sometimes it's a federal agency depending on the facility and if it's in you know a federal jurisdiction and all of them help us as an as a cting division to just identify and determine what kind of studies and what kind of analysis needs to be conducted which permits are required any kind of uh specific rules or administrative rules or statutes or ordinances local local zoning considerations things like that that we we really value that input and we look to different agencies for expertise so we have reached out to all of the reviewing agencies when we received the notice of intent and issued our public notice and I am in the process of coordinating with all of them to get input in comments that we then pass on to the applicants so that they can incorporate it into their planning and design and the goal is good site so um and like I said we have two special advisory groups on this per proposed facility which is wco and Sherman County supp isues okay next slide I think I went to the next slide without telling you to go to the next slide yes you did okay for a second so people can catch up and it's basically everything I just said so next slide so I mentioned six General standards that are required for us to to assess and determine um as we review information the state sting process is a standards based review so it's based on these 16 standards um and it's evidentiary so we need to see information that demonstrates the bur approv is on the applicant to provide that evidence to demonstrate that they meet that standard it's our job as the sighting provision to evaluate that evidence and that's part of what we're Consulting with our reviewing agencies on studies that have been conducted at the application Phase and then we make those recommendations in our draft proposed order to our Council the energy facilities citing Council and they are the ones who ultimately evaluate all the information in the record to decide whether to point it's a site certificate because we're at the notice of a 10th phase we're really seeking any type of comment that anyone wants to provide um but it's important to know because I said we are a standards based process if you want to comment particularly on the draft proposed order focusing your comments to relate to our standards is very important so if you're making a comment or you have a concern it is most effective persective is the best way for our Council to evaluate it is to link it to one of our standards so if you're worried about fish and wildlife habitat link it to our fish and wildlife habitat standard and that's how our Council looks at the information provided and so it's it's just a really important part of our process next slide so okay so at the notice of intent phase the applicant is required to do a desktop assessment of what we call study areas and the study areas are basically set by Statute and it's for them to go out and do like a desk what we call a desktop which is what is the available information out there in the universe that applies to this standard and each of our standards has a slightly different or there's different reasons why we have these study areas in the notice of intent and so the notice of intent that the applicant submitted was required to to do the desktop analysis for all of these so as you can see there's 20 mile study area for areas things like the the cultural tend to be limited to the actual site boundary and I'll get to the site b in a minute um fish and wildlife has a half mile endangered species is five miles and one of the things that we're looking for input on at the noi phase whether it's a reviewing agency or the public is what you pick up what should the analysis areas be often times they're the same as this but they can also change so if you think that the analysis area should be doesn't need to be that big or it should be bigger this is a really important part of our process particularly with our reviewing agencies of getting that input on you know does this make SS does it need to be bigger there something we're not seeing here and it's just at the noi comment phase this is one of the things that we're really trying to uh dial in because in the app in the project order that I prepare I'm going",

        "text": " plants will absorb the toxicity and uh make the seeds dangerous consume uh and you've just ruined rued a fire of that size is going to be so difficult to fight because you you're dealing with panels everywhere uh is it would be a a a nightmare if you don't know what a fire's going to do in this array in this area then you have no business discussing this as a renewable energy I was approached by multiple developers wanting to do this and as soon as they couldn't answer that question I said hey I'm I think I'm out not to mention the Absurd subsidies that they were getting this is everybody should know this is just a sham he said what do you want what do you want per acre per year said what do you want I said I don't know I'll take the current current panel dollar figure and I'll multiply it by three so I said $1,200 per acre per year he's like I think I can do that I'm like wow so this is all coming through the Biden administration's infrastructure Bill and I'm like wow what a waste to support something this strong that produces this little amount of electricity and potentially can damage a soil but then have you ever looked at the Oregon Department of EGS website how they're screaming about Acres being taken away from agriculture it's like do any of the agencies actually communicate back and forth they're literally saying this is a wreck we're losing too many acres too many valuable crop land Acres the the odoe over here is trying to get this all thousands of Acres used Sola uh so I don't I don't I don't I I just I don't get it I don't get it I don't understand the push I too thought about this agraval take so hey let's try to con configure a combination of propop land use where you have supported panel arrays you farm underneath it and so you maintain a more balance between the potential for weeds to be out of control you still can generate some electricity but everything has to be very very it's a very uh specific sort of landscape I'm talking about so I shared that with one of the developers he's like I can't do that he goes I know what you're talking about I can't do that I don't I really don't have the it's just it's too complex it's too much money to set up a a field that has rows of arrays but you actually can Farm successfully in between those that's too too far in the future for what I need to do today so I hope this makes sense to you because it doesn't make sense to me how could strip Farmland from producing what the world needs and then we could also put it in Jeopardy of long-term soil destruction from contamination from whatever's in not that I know that that's for sure but that nobody could assure me that there weren't risks with what comes out of and drips down from a fire nor could they tell me what would happen in the hail event that we had what in 95 I believe we had a hail storm that took down uh a lot of props um saw an Instagram post where a destroyed solar array so there you go it's like how short could this 2,000 acre solar farm be lifespan potentially I don't know but I appreciate you guys so much I really didn't come here intending to do this but I have firsthand experience and have thought about this and we're like this is financially more than we would ever make for a second on Dryland wheat but I'm like I can't I can't be the generation that puts something on our soil that damages it I don't want to I don't want to be that I don't want to have I don't want to make that mistake thank you Mr Myers thank you appreciate it um anyone else in the audience wanting to testify tonight come on forward state your name and address please cam don't go anywhere I talk your grazings uh Chris Rous R Au U 72 967 Strawberry Lane lexon Oregon I represent North Lex power and land and Farms so I may be the resident expert here because I do live in the middle of the wagon trail solar farm they're out my front door and my back door and if I had another door would be out there too so uh on the issue of fire first thing I want to say if you're a plann owner get involved with your developer which is what I do I take the first step we've had all these discussions about what they brought up tonight actually and we keep working on them all the time as far as fire at least on the development that's on our place this moment the land the developer has more to worry about fire from me than I do from them be ground doesn't burn but I get wheat fields that R around it they'll burn and we've had this discussion of future development what to do of some things about fire breakes erosion gravel roads things like that we can get in more detail if you need to um the other thing was um God dang it was fire breathing ah weeds so we do work uh proactively on the weeds weeds aren't usually an issue uh unless you let uh grow stuff in there then yeah there they'll be they could become an issue then it comes with a two-edged SW sword if you have a bunch of grass in there not only can weeds get in there they may not if you're doing your job but it also increases the fire risk on both sides of the fence that now I'm not opposed to having Gras into those things but in the right circumstances and I do have places that do that but you can work with your developer uh lastly I say is um as your resident expert if you got questions fine otherwise let's build the son of a and go okay okay thank you for your testimony anybody else in the room wishing to testify okay let's um Nancy could you WebEx uh Miss Kelly hail has her hand raised Miss hail I have unmuted your mic you are ready to comment hi thank you um first of all I want to say thank you to the energy siding Council um my comments tonight are in support of wagon trail solar my name is Kelly hail ke l l y last name hail h a l e we and I am a co-trustee with my brother Russell Kilkenny on the Kilkenny the first year of operation after Dad's passing can you hear me yes okay the first year of operation after Dad's passing in 2016 when we just had Farm ground we basically had no return on the investment the ground is a very fine syty Loom soil we have no access to water nor will we have any access to water the average yield in that area is close to 30 bels to the acre the price to of wheat in 1975 was similar to what it is this year land values are roughly $500 an acre for our ground versus irrigated ground which is roughly 12,000 an acre the first year after the turbine installation gave us roughly a return on investment of about 15% it allowed us to inre acreage as a matter of fact we let our CRP contract expire and that increased farmable ground on our property of another 700 we've seen a net gain in production from our relationship with next era they have been extremely productive Partners they've paid to clean up our property they're incredible stewards of the land also they've been very good to moral County they provided additional jobs and also sponsorships to local events I just want to say thank you in advance for any support you might give to this project thank you Miss Hae thank you let us go through the rest first um Nancy any others on the WebEx there are no other hands raised at this time why don't you check the phone then I have no phone ends right now okay make it quick it concerns the uh money that we're talking about on OSU yeah oh Chris R again Strawberry Lane liing Oregon can was brought up about the OSU goal three stuff yeah and the reason that's hit dry land is because farming because that's where the stuff's being taken out of it's hitting uh to the dryland farming and so all that directed to his research on farming trying to be more productive um and then I think there may be some money actually going towards it could be all I better not say that I'll let you them talk about but there could be some other money directed something else could help farmers there too so that's why it's hit it that way it's on Range ground then yeah yeah look at okay thank you are there any council members that would like to provide comments to the Department or the certificate holder councelor Byer um thank you all for coming out this evening and um just to staff I'll be really interested to see the Marl County letter on the goal 3 exception and I know um Odo staff has worked really hard on trying to understand mitigation for loss and not even total loss but for this change of use of farm grounds so I think we're all working to try to understand what the best mitigation looks like in this situation so thank you all thank you councelor Byer anyone else counselor Imes thank you chair uh Kitty Imes for the record and um I do have some comments regarding the Wildfire mitigation plan um specifically exhibit V attachment V1 on page 11 there's some comments in here about the plan will be updated by the applicant every five years and so I have some concern about that um our last public meeting we talked quite a bit about wildfire mitigation plans and um striving for a more cohesive um approach so that we see these plans becoming um just better I guess in general um and also um better you know more frequent inspections and I did see in this one that they had actually put that information in there so that's um but again um also want to reiterate that um you know speaking with the First Responders in this area is really really important um all those fire districts that are impacted by this project um reaching out to them and um also you know what their capacity levels are and how are they going to respond to the fire when it happens because it will happen um we need to know that they have been engaged um and that and what their comments are because we don't ever get to hear from or from what I gather so far I haven't heard from any local fire responders um to these matters so I'm very curious about that and um also wanted to ask this is",

        "text": " both in europe and it's not explicitly included in the current set of briefs primarily it's primarily through the we we identified the quote hot topics through stakeholder outreach and that topic was included but it was ranked fairly low at the current time when we were doing that outreach um so it's included in the sense that we're and gathering all the literature from it and we plan to investigate how to best implement any research recommendations coming out of type of work but it's not a current part of the the synthesis effort that we have a educational research brief about i would add that as part of the work that we're initiating now which is generate is understanding the data gaps and generating research recommendations is this is a really nice place to information like the wind shadow effect and how that may um coincide with upwelling or other nutrient distribution patterns offshore and if that's an item that is of interest for additional research recommendations whether it's just doing desktop review of past work or actually doing field work or lab work it's something that i think is worthwhile including so um karen i i'll browse through our invitation list for the pacific coast workshop to make sure you're included and if you're not if you wouldn't mind sending me an email marks every pnnl.gov um just to make sure we can connect between our teams and get you involved in some of that work if possible thank you thanks for the question karen i think if you hit star 3 it'll lower your hand again um there's another question in the chat from dave i think it's to andy the gld goes out to 500 fathoms 914 meters and the boem call area go out to 1300 meters can you describe how federal consistency would be handled for a development that occurs between 914 meters and 1300 meters yeah dave thanks for that question um when we were developing our gld we didn't envision offshore wind potentially going out to the depths that the planning area actually included so if an application or at least falls outside of our gld location then we would be required to ask noah for the ability to review that project consistent with reasonably foreseeable effects that the state identified so we would have to uh request in in writing for that to occur but then we would have the the ability to apply federal consistency once noah uh and if noah grants that request which i would expect it to do can i add an additional point in that um within bones regulations that there is not to the gld but in current regulations boom requires federal consistency review at particular points as well so there um even if it didn't come from the state side through the request with with noaa and approved program it is within um bones regulations to have federal consistency review i'm not seeing any other questions in the chat yet but i'll kind of pause to see if others are thinking um just checking to see if there's any raised hands from our host and if not that's okay we have a few more slides from jason on the themes that have been synthesized from the comments received so far on this topic okay not seeing any raised hands there in the chat so i think that we're good to go ahead and then we'll pause again after jason slides for more discussion on this permitting exciting and permitting topic go ahead jason thank you all a little sunny here sorry too sunny you never heard a portlander or somebody from oregon say okay uh turning to um the feedback we received so a refresher on the key topics um the numbers on the slide here correlate to the numbering system that was used for um the entire set of those prompting questions we asked for feedback on so if people wanted to you know follow along if it's helpful guidance to kind of like correlate that that's what those numbers are and you'll see those on the slides for the rest of the topics today too and so in the questions we asked um you know questions about key topics related to citing and permitting so gaps in citing and programming processes potentially that could prevent an adequate assessment of potential impacts we were interested in hearing information on that and these other gaps in data that could prevent an adequate assessment for any potential effects of flooding offshore wind projects whether people have particular concerns they that may not be adequately addressed in these processes we asked for information about best practices that floating offshore wind could use to avoid minimize mitigate monitor potential effects and we asked about specific recommendations that could be useful in addressing potential um so there are many references to the potential for cumulative effects on the ocean ecosystem and ocean users stakeholders with a variety of interests are interested in cumulative development scale of any potential offshore wind development is an important consideration for assessing the potential cumulative effects as well as potential effects oh potential effects to you know there's a lot of different ways these could play out um ecosystems and marine species for example um as well as potential effects for fishing industries and other industries tied to tourism and recreation um and also the effects economies of scale could have for offshore one of the supply chains too so there's lots of different facets of cumulative effects the graphic to the right shows an example of the east coast lease areas and their potential for build out based on state offshore wind goals are known as projects um the potential chemical effects that offshore wind could have is important and more energy forecasting and modeling will help give a picture of the potential scale that offshore wind could help achieve um to me could help that would um cumulative effects um you know we'll get a better picture of that um once there's more modeling and analysis in the energy sector to kind of see how offshore wind could help achieve clean energy commitments of various states we also received references to data gaps so references to the wildlife impact data being particularly data and analysis on the economic value fishery activities and industries including seafood and fishery-related tourism information was raised about a noaa study looking into the full economic value of fisheries across the west coast to support conversations and processes with offshore wind data on sensitive habitats and subsidy geology is incomplete there was comments on that also comments on social economic data and effects on jobs tied to floating offshore wind and potentially negative effects to other industries like fishing depths considered in the bone process so far have been mostly constrained to within 1300 meters and there's interest in learning more about the viability of offshore wind in deeper waters so we heard the depths greater than 1300 meters could also help avoid frequented fishery areas several portions of feedback received raised particular concerns for losses that could be incurred from ocean areas that could have could be excluded from access as a result of offshore wind concern for losses in the form of economic losses for existing industries concern for lost food security and decreases in supplies of seafood and concern for lost recreational opportunities were all examples concerns were raised about the potential for ecosystem effects like impacts to sensitive coastal habitats and seafloor habitats that could be affected by mooring lands and export cables there were height concerns raised heights of new structures could have effects for air traffic for example both civilian and military airways and these could happen both at sea with tall offshore wind blade tip heights and potentially onshore transmission upgrades were to require taller tile taller towers for example um we had that question about best practices so um one of them one of the feedback we rece one of the portions of feedback we received actually several identified this first one extensive cooperative data sharing that data sharing could help fill in data gaps and ensure the best available science is being used there was feedback on fisheries mitigation fund the idea for that i think that has been explored and implemented in other parts of the country or the world um comprehensive permanent permitting to help identify the key jurisdictions processes phases and timelines and to give a good overview of of kind of those those aspects and processes that could be used as a starting point for something like there's also lots to learn from europe and east coast states who are working through many of the same issues that the west coast could face especially around engagement efforts multi-state collaboration and data sharing and best practices for balancing ocean uses lots of atlantic states working on offshore wind the link to the right is an example of the work new york has done an offshore wind with respect to road map and master planning and includes a report about how it assessed cumulative effects we also received positive feedback on the engagement efforts related to the pac wave energy research projects off the coast of newport and wallport and this was pointed to as another opportunity to gain insight and rate and use of the model for engagement with coastal communities on offshore wind there was some common themes around the recommendations that we heard um some of the feedback we received came down on different perspectives there was some feedback about the idea for allowing more time in the in the leasing and citing process to potentially allow for time for you know additional research and data gaps to be filled there was also kind of a different view of that of that same topic more along the lines of acknowledging the data gaps and developing measures for additional data gathering and monitoring around those gaps you know measures that would help ensure future flexibility to develop practices that would help avoid mitigate and adaptively manage potential unknown impacts and then funding to fill data gaps was was was common feedback avoiding rocky habitat i think that has been raised in the bone process as well the bone morgan task force work pursuing floating offshore went to deeper depths i mentioned that and more community engagement consistent feedback the importance and significance of doing community engagement down the coast in other parts of oregon that might be affected from floating offshore wind so i'll turn it to ruchi um i'm going to use user help for um kind of these you'll see other slides like this that are kind of the signal that this would be the time to raise your hand if you haven't already or indicated in chat that you may have a question or some additional feedback you'd like to provide here so i'll turn it over to richie she's great at this thanks jason um we did see a hand raised from mike uh mike if you still have your hand raised about this topic um you can press star six or actually you're on their computer so um we can un unmute you and you can ask your question it looks like you're admitted now mike if you'd like to go ahead okay um thank you for the opportunity to comment want to go back to karen's statement for just a moment or two i",

        "text": " Lisa and I have reached out to about 65 external reviewers nationally with the abundance of them in the Pacific Northwest but some key individuals on the East Coast who have been doing this kind of work for a considerable period of time and we've asked them to provide written comments to what the technical teams as well as Lisa and I have conducted numerous one-on-one conversations that we've recorded with these individuals as well we're compiling all of that in a document so what we hope to present to the Oregon global warming commission at the ex you know with the at the end of the project or toward the end is this draft document that describes what the technical teams produced gives you that flavor and layer and perspectives of what the advisory committees believe and think should be practices in Oregon and then gives you the flavor and perspectives of external reviews we think that that rich presentation of information will give you Oregon global warming commission what it needs to move forward with activity-based metrics for Oregon Lisa just also acknowledged oda's um leadership on the technical team as well yes absolutely thanks for that so the third uh key deliverable for the project is community impact metrics and so what we did is uh instead of going straight to metrics we thought about the framework for the state of Oregon and what type of framework the state could potentially adopt and then from there sort of the tendrils would lead down into Community impact metrics as you think about all of the different types of communities that could be defined in the state of Oregon whether those are geographically based demographically based we can Define communities in a number of ways and so we wanted this framework for Oregon to be as Broad and representative as possible but then allow for some of the local more finite details to be able for for a community to be able to use those more subtle local approaches so thinking about the framework and developing that draft framework was actually the biggest part of this piece of the project once we developed that framework and we did an international literature review looking at all the different types of frame Frameworks that other countries Etc have used and then thought about it in terms of a state scale so what we came up with is the framework and then a menu of opportunity that communities however they describe themselves could use and so they've got this huge Suite it's hundreds literally of community impact socio-economic metrics and here's just an example of some in different buckets so here's some example of Education socioeconomic metrics you know things like the percentage of third graders that read at that grade level or perhaps some food Security based ones like the percentage of population that is food insecure or those that have Equitable access to healthy options and so by looking at all of these different buckets a community as they describe themselves could pick and choose based on which of these buckets might be important to them it might be a community in Corvallis Oregon that's really done a lot of work on sustainability like it's done in the past so they might gravitate more towards some sustainability metrics and there could be lots of other examples as to interrupt where we are in the processes we've developed the draft framework we've developed the draft menu of opportunity metrics in the advisory committee is now looking at all of this and they're coming up with a smaller list a subset of these that they think would fit the majority of Oregon communities and so it's it's an interesting exercise to think what all of these State Co or all these advisory committee members that represent a broad geography in Oregon how they how they might think of a smaller bucket of these for all of Oregon go ahead Kathy yeah thank you Lisa uh Lisa has kind of been emphasizing the way communities might use this broader framework to drive you know sustainability and and other programs too which I think will be a really good resource for communities the main intent in the natural working lands proposal was to develop these Community impact metrics to help inform how at the state level you know local um municipalities would would design programs and and track the the um present you know how how programs are are doing towards a set of of goals so that's and and specific to mitigation so that's the primary but I I think that INR really has done um above and beyond to kind of assemble all this information that can provide really uh helpful information to communities on a broader set of um ways of thinking about setting Community impact metrics yeah thanks for that Kathy and you you could see as you look through a number of these examples many of the state agencies can definitely consider some of these as far as their as far um well for their programmatic look at things as well so it definitely has a multiple purpose and for some reason I forget that agency piece of it I'm not sure why but it's definitely applicable to both so thank you for reminding me the um fourth deliverable for the project is the Workforce Development and training needs assessment in gap analysis of natural in working land sectors in Oregon this was a really cool piece of the project because it allowed us to look at Workforce Development and training needs assessments all over the country in a couple in Canada and pick and choose what we thought were the best pieces of those and then draft draft uh an assessment and GAP analysis scope of work for Oregon and then what we did is we went out to a bunch of experts in Oregon that deal in Workforce Development and we had focus groups one-on-one conversations we had back and forth with our draft scope of work and we created what we think is a pretty rich scope of work for the state of Oregon to put this out there and have someone describe how much it would cost to do this across these different land sectors for the state of Oregon and Kathy L pumped this piece to you to describe where we are in the and I'm going to pundit to Zach or him to describe that thanks Zach yeah absolutely so we are very close to publishing the request for information and again this would just be um a request for information not a request for proposals to try to help get information to further refine the scope of work um and also get a sense as Lisa was saying of how much it would cost and there is some overlap with um Senate bill 530 that we talked about earlier in the meeting that there may be some resources coming to be able to do the work that's outlined in the scope of work and so there's a lot more to move on but when this request for information is published it will likely be out there for about six weeks folks will have an opportunity to ask questions and then be able to provide some information on the questions that are in the request for information and then again Lisa and her team and the advisory committee and others will work on we're finding things thanks Zach and thanks for all your work and helping us get that out the door and you know one of the coolest things we thought about this piece of the project when we had these one-on-one conversations with Workforce Development folks around the state they were so Progressive in their thinking about how this could be done for the state of Oregon in a way that's not been done in Oregon before in terms of creating efficiencies filling gaps not creating you know a new program but taking the best of what Oregon has in current programs filling any gaps in in just in doing this in a way that's Oregon hasn't seen seen before so we're pretty excited about some of the language that they helped use in the design of this proposal it'll be really interesting to see what happens in the next steps and then the last piece of this is the natural and working lens inventory so the goal of this is to create proposals for greenhouse gas inventory again consistent with the ipcc framework and so the way we're thinking about it having a basic one and having a more advanced one so the basic one um you know has some of the more basic elements and the advanced one takes it sort of to the next level so the questions we're asking are what are the recommended methods to determine the current carbon stocks in net sequestration how do these stocks emissions in sequestration change Through Time what are the causes of these changes and how do we track those differences so where are we at on this one we've got a background and objectives for the inventory we have identified greenhouse gas inventory definitions and this is really a key piece to this project and it would be for any state that does something like this you have to develop common language and get informed consent on that language or else you end up with a mess on the other end and so after we got draft inventory definitions we work really closely with the advisory committee they added tremendous value to those definitions and we finalized those with the technical teams with with the work that the advisory committee did um and then the now the drafts of the basic and the advanced methodology have been developed the next step is going to be for the state and federal agencies to review and then we'll share those with the advisory committee so one of the key things that Kathy and I talked about prior to today's presentation is and this is the last slide it's just to share with you some issues associated with this project just to give you a feel for kind of how the project is gone and and how things are going so in terms of the advisory committee you know the goal was to create a committee representative of the diversity of oregonians as an Oregon global warming commission you did a really good job of that put out a couple of calls for people in different parts of the state representing different demographies to participate in one of the issues we ran up against probably a third of the way through the project today is integrating tribal perspectives in the Statewide process and it is it is because of the government-to-government relationship that Tribal Sovereign Nations have with the state of Oregon that was difficult to incorporate to date from our perspective in level on this process there was only one individual at the start of the project that was representing one element of a tribe and as a consultant to that tribe and not a tribal individual themselves that we're not comfortable in terms of representing tribes um and didn't feel that that was an appropriate function for the advisory committee so at some point the Oregon global warming commission is going to need to engage at the state level with the tribes in on that process but one of the things that we've struggled with a little bit throughout the process is the confounding of political and policy processes with our task which is science based",

        "text": " of it it's still the same uh meaning to me yeah so that's fine but with me Brian were you gonna say something I concur I don't think the order changes the meaning thanks Levy okay we have no objections to that any last comments on those we'll go with what we've reviewed here good discussion um I want to move on to start thinking about mitigation actions so the last session we last meeting we went over the past actions which I will pull up here in a minute so we can use them as reference but uh thinking about what can the city do to mitigate the natural hazards or the community to mitigate natural hazards that pose the greatest the greatest risk sorry to the City of Salem this is kind of a discussion just kind of throwing some stuff out there we might continue this to another meeting but want to just get your brains working on it but first we can look at our Hazard vulnerability and where we had the highest rating we had our medium ratings and our low ratings for risk level so we we ranked extreme heat air quality and winter storm is high concern High vulnerability assessment and we've got the ones in the middle and then at the bottom is a landslide and so discussion you know thinking about mitigation items actions I know Austin had I put just an example in here to to get people thinking but air quality I think Austin a couple medians ago talked uh somehow providing personal protection equipment maybe um working with retailers either to sell it for less or make it more available during times of need but we have several we need to have a action for each Hazard I think multi-hazard actions can achieve that goal and the last plan had multiple multiple multiple multi-hazard actions and I will bring that up might be kind of small for people to see so let me increase the font so these are some of the hazards we we went through a lot of these at the last meeting and we're still trying to figure out the status on some of them some of these that we have here we're likely carry over such as this one this number two MH number two coordinate with the capital Planning Commission to integrate natural hazard mitigation into state and city respective Capital Improvements sounds like that might be just an ongoing thing I just put it out there right now does I mean we can go through these again but does anybody have similar to what Austin had a while ago for air quality do we have any thoughts about what we could do for mitigation actions for any of these other actions or any of these other hazards or drought earthquake I mean I think there's something pretty solid in the floodplain um sections but we might want to start thinking about you know we have this new Hazard air quality what other actions might be worth putting in there we also have water quality and Water emergency we've got a great ozone plant now but are there some other things that we can add into our water Water emergency mitigation action plan just open it up to see if anybody has any ideas Austin did you just come off so and I guess I have two thoughts but I'll start with my mitigation action is that potentially one that could cover a few hazards would be establishing or identifying uh resiliency hubs within the community so Community locations where people can find information or um get training or potentially even visit during a hazard event in order to help withstand it I guess so for example if during extreme heat um you could go to a cooling center some some place that had air conditioning was open to the public and that could also potentially address an air quality event and and you know potentially a few other of these like uh winter storms and wind storms and things like that but that would also I guess maybe help create uh Community capacity and and that gets it some of the resiliency stuff this is Heather gymky city of Sam I just want to thank Austin for bringing that up that was kind of my one addition as well that's actually called out in the climate action plan to have a network of neighborhood hubs and I had the same thought in terms of air quality is having basic filtration systems in place I was going to mention that we will probably borrow from the climate action plan and any other plan uh that seems um suitable to put into this plan I just dug into them a lot in regards to mitigation actions um but yeah that's great the other thing I just wanted to throw out was um the idea of mitigation versus adaptation so whether our goal is to create infrastructure so that the effects aren't as bad or um make changes to adapt to some new realities so one of the goals um reference the climate altered future and so what do we do to or do we want to look at changes to what we do now within that context my sister's chairman again um so when looking at mitigation so that's a these things are going to happen and they've happened and now it is what acts have we done ahead of time to make it so that the least impactful on the people that are experiencing it so when I think of um or to reduce their extent so um let's go with Wildfire so now being a firefighter uh it would be like you know set up fire boundaries and protective zones and making sure brushes trimmed back appropriately you know get information out about setting up those barriers um I think there's probably discussion um you know well we have we have red flag days what those mean so people understand that maybe expanding what the red flag means um you know to certain types of uh work around your house when uh we're at a drought level or red flag warnings so that things don't catch on fire and create bigger issues uh Windstorm probably appropriate trees and vegetation and appropriately uh manicured trees or cup trees so knowing where they're at near power lines making sure they're trimmed right keeping away from uh certain areas that will cause problems making sure people are staying up on uh trimming their trees things of that nature that are going to cause major issues um so I haven't read through all of the old mitigation plans but I mean so that's kind of what I look at when we talk about those things what the city can do and then what we can help provide for people um you know in a perfect world for a lot of filtration and be like you know a code that that would require all new builds to have certain water filtration capabilities or the ability to install that into uh their water system uh of that you know things like that those are kind of pie in the sky so um things of that nature she didn't come here so Cynthia I guess my question is when it comes to mitigation what are you looking for are you looking for like what Trevor said are we looking for pre-plan are we looking for Action at the actual incident or we're looking at what's going to happen after the fact you're muted Cynthia thanks I think what Trevin mentioned accurate and and how are we going to make our community the community more resilient when a hazard happens so what have we done prior to a hazard to improve uh the community I mean it could be anything but we're looking at mitigation uh Hazard mitigation so how are we going to mitigate the impacts of the hazard of that uh Hazard event um you know retro retrofitting your having you know I I think Austin's ideas also can fit in there as well uh where you're you're educating the people you're also getting them to know that there's this resiliency Hub and so they have those are established so when an event happens they know where to go and they know what to do uh during a a hazard so it's a lot of what's Happening beforehand but it's going to help you when you're in a hopefully that makes sense and on this plan how detailed do we want to be on the mitigation portion well it can you know if we look at well let's just they can be you know if we I don't know if you recall some of the ones that we worked on you know we reviewed last time they were simple there there are some we can go into more detail there are some forms that we can help and maybe solicit to the group and we can think about this in in more um and it dives into okay does this need um who has the capacity to fund it if funding is required if they don't um what kind of funding options do we um and I don't I didn't have I don't have one of those forms uh but um I'm just trying to think where to get one um that might be worth uh sending out to the committee to kind of just start brainstorming more on that and it goes into detail so the way we list them in the tier on the table is going to be simple but there's there's definitely be more detail behind the scenes and we can include those forms um in the plan and I'm trying to remember if the past plan had those forms included um I know I can't recall and I don't want to bring it up yeah lovey yeah I'm not uh I'm not sure how this would fit in but but I think one emergency preparedness as other others have mentioned I think it's a big key uh uh it would be you know some a mitigation action across all of those crisis but what I've seen in at least with the Spanish-speaking community that that I serve at is the the ability to be consistent with that emergency preparedness it's a if especially if you're if you're wanting to do it in in the language that's native to the community that you're working with like I said Spanish in that case but we have other communities emerging communities here in Salem that are not English speakers and um you will you will undoubtedly get some individuals who in who will step up and say Yes I want to do this or I have the ability to do this I have the time I I have the resources uh but the larger Community will need some some level of take and for and to do it consistently so that it becomes a culture of emergency preparedness um that that takes a lot of work Corey data work and some resources not all over money but but some of it not money time from different partners and that I think could definitely be a mitigation action um and it would I'm just trying to think of how to word it but you you said it very well um but the consistency to develop a uh you know consistent consistent emergency preparedness plan among the entire Community that's going to include non-spanish or non-english speakers uh you know under represented communities and I'm just trying to see if there",

        "text": "thank you for I just really want to take to thank everybody who came out tonight we really appreciate you being here for in put important us my name is Kathleen SLO I'm the senior sting analyst for this project yellow rose Energy Center for the Department of energy so I with the Oregon Department of energy I am a cting analyst that works on behalf of the energy facility ccil and I first wanted to introduce my Odo team that it's awesome here so Sarah esterson is here in the room she's our senior poliy advisor been with Odo for many years eight thenor behind meing out CH MC B Walker he's been with Odo for six Years also a sting analyst and then our administrative assistant is Nancy hat she is our All Purpose go to for all things Technical and we'll be running the technical part of our meeting just so people in the room know we are also broadcasting this meeting live it is available on WebEx the webinar and there also opportunity for people call in so when we get to the comment period of our meeting we'll open it up to the room first the back second and then but I would also like to introduce the what we call our applicants from the yellow rose bush team and savan and this is Jeff Watson he's going to co-present with me tonight he's going to present on the project itself on behalf of the applicant developer and I'm G let him introduce his team team with us yeah hi everybody again my name is the button yeah there you go you're hi everyone my name is Jeff Watson I'm a development manager at Savon energy and the teque developer on yellow rose bush um so I'm going to go around the room here and introduce the Savon team so starting with Mitch Taylor who is our director of development for the Pacific Northwest and and m&amp;a we have ANUK soulsby who is our director permitting we have uh let's see Chris Powers senior director of Permitting Adam Williams who is our BP of uh excuse me our BP of development in the west and Gary Parker to his right our VP of BC so we also have Paul Hicks and Ash Woods who are joining us from tetr who are our permanent consultant and working very closely through the uh photo process with us so I think I got everyone yeah and that is the the sav team so excited to to uh tell you a little bit about the project and and hear whatever questions or comments we have tonight thank you so first couple things I want to go over just general housekeeping there are coffee tea lemonade water there were cookies they might have all got me um out by the door in the lobby and then the rooms or pass the front desk take a left then take a right and see the writing on the wall case for emergency run out the store so so that's just houskeeping um let's see okay so I'm GNA go over a meeting agenda the purpose of this meeting is really to give a little bit of information about the project and our process um but it's really to allow the public to comment if they have comments or ask questions about the facility Theos facility so we're going to keep the presentation site brief so that we can open it up for public comment as soon as possible but there are some things I need to cover one of them is just the energy facility site process overview as I mentioned I work for the Department of energy the state of Oregon we are the sighting Division and we work in support of the energy facility sighting Council it is the council that makes the decision to approve or deny an application forite certificate um so I'll go through our process and how the public can engage and participate in that process and then we're going to go over a little bit on the project facility and then I'm going to turn it over to Jeff who will give more information on the propos facility and then we'll open it up for so as I noted this is an informational meeting um the informational meeting is intended to give the public an opportunity to make comments it is not a contested case hearing and participation in this meeting I'll get more into the contestant C when I get into our process but participation in this meeting and making comment is not required in order to preserve the right to to um have standing or up asked to join into a contested case we do ask that everybody hold their questions and comments to the end of the presentation and then the last part is you know please just be respectful we like to conduct ourselves in a respectful manner um we have a lot of material to cover and we just want to make sure that everybody has time um to make a comment if there are a lot of people who want to comment you may have to put a time limit but um we'll just play by yours we don't want so as I noted this sighting division um we serve as technical staff to what we call it energy facility sighting Council we use a lot of acronyms but we call it FC for short so the FC process is a state process and it's set in Oregon administrative rules and Oregon devised statutes and we have 16 General standards which I will cover in a minute and as I said the sting division staff really works in support of Council and our job is to put applications through technical review um so to make sure that these facilities can meet the requirements of those standards that need to be met in order to have Council be willing to approve a c and then it also has conditions that certificate holder has to to commit to in order to have that set certificate next slide so this slide is really just to explain our role and why we're involved we're not involved in all energy projects we're limited to those that are defined through the OS 46930 which is what defines a state jurisdictional energy facility and there are different rules that um this is basically the the actual reason why we're here tonight is that this proposal falls under the definition of an FC jurisdictional facility for a solar and it's really um defined by either 160 Acres of high value Farmland 1280 acres of land that's predominantly cultivated or at least meets the the capability classes for agriculture and then um a limit of 199 20 acres or larger for in other so we're you know this proposed facility covers 8,075 Acres approximately 12.6 M square miles of private land that is zoned for exclusive F you so that is why it's an asset jurisdiction facility and for that the the proponent the applicant needs to apply for a site certificate and in order to obtain that site certificate they must demonstrate that that facility can meet these standards that we're going to talk tonight and the first step in that process is submitting what is called the notice of intent we issued a public notice on the notice of intents in October and scheduled this public information meeting as part of our Outreach on the no this is kind of my favorite slide because add a glance you can see next like the um process laid out kind of in a graphet so we're SE we have seven major steps in the site certificate process and as you can see with the red box we are at the very beginning we're at the notice of intense phase and those purple boxes they're supposed to be green but our projectors not projecting the right colors um those purple boxes are the areas the ones that say public noce comment period info meeting and across are areas where the public has the opportunity to provide input and engage in our our process so at the notice of intent phase and applicant will submit a proposed project and the information that they submit in that notice of intent is basically a desktop level analysis of the you know the idea the concept of their facility what they want to do where and then the known information as it applies to our standards we then issue a public notice we held a public information meeting and when we issued that public notice on October 10 we opened up a public comment period And so until that public comment period closes on the notice of inent which is DEC 1st the public has the opportunity to provide comments on this project it's the first step of getting public input on this project and our council is very interested in heing what the public has to say so if you have thoughts or opinions about a facility that's under art SE jurisdiction I highly encourage you to to engage in our process um because it it will help our Council make a decision so we are at the very first step of a notice of times um after the public meeting and the public comment period closes and during this time we're also coordinating with what we call reviewing agencies reviewing agencies are local governments local affected governments the state resource agencies like we have ODFW here tonight Oregon Department of ficial Wildlife we as a department a division have to engage in coordination and consultation with all our state reding agencies and also tribal government to trial governments um and again it's to engage coordinate make them aware of the project and get input from all of these entities on how this proposal is being presented any concerns are issues things that we need to consider as we review through our standards so um based on all of the comments we received we move on to the next step and that's the project order I will be preparing the project order so the project order is basically a summary of all of the input we get run it through a filter of our standards and come up with what we call analysis areas that are required for each of our standards um that need to be what needs to be included in the actual application because at a notice of intent it's a notice of intent to file it or submit an app for a site certificate no application has actually been submitted or received so the applicant is preparing all the materials to include in their application with at this time and so while I write the project order they're working on their studies and coordination and Analysis coming up with their plans and then we issue the project order and it will tell the applicant what needs to be included in that application and that is you so we issue the project Court the notice of intent is valid for two years so in the time that from the notice of intent phase we received a complete notice of intent on this project on September 28th 2023 they have two years to submit an application now the applicant has indicated they would like to submit it earlier than that but just realized there's a",

        "text": " visual impacts and changes to the resource but again because it's after we are on a secondary facade it will minimize the impact and I there is no excavation of your proposed as part of this proposals so that guy I'm just not so in some staff recommends the landmarks commission and find that the proposal leads the applicable guidelines in SRC 230065 provided the recommended conditions are adopted so moving on to testimony we've received a number of of the comments and support so just today we received to be on your desk in email and support from Stephen Elmore an email from Jim Lloyd in support and then the Adkins submitted testimony and support from Jamie Fisher through Kaufman who are old on Charles soul and Joshua we've received no formal comments from the Men Northeast neighbors neighborhood the building and safety division indicated that building permits are required and that all of that and guard designs will require manufacturers installation instructions and the windows will require verification of the heat press and all this information will be required when documents are provided the playing division fire department and put the books and we received them with public agency so those will probably be hard for reading so staff recommends the landmarks commission improved the with the following conditions condition one we have potential completed condition assessment of the front porch posts and provided the original material comprising what was retains over 50 structural Integrity the decorative Square post shall be repaired within kind materials in addition to the application will replicate the original material and design of the decorative Square were proposed upon authorization of the post can be replaced at the time of building commits the middle and the historic preservation which shall authorize removal and replacement of the decorative porch clothes should the condition assessment illustrate that over 50 percent of the structural Integrity of the first has been compromise and repair is not feasible and last condition three the replacement is moving down on the primary facade of the Hewitt House show that within the existing 40 inch by 20 inch one inch opening for the original and the Sash and the Brain materials shall have the appearance of wood the proposed replacement window material and specification should be provided into the preservation officer at the so that concludes this time thank you Kimberly uh are there any questions for staff any questions you said that the applicant request is planning on changing the width of the stairs from 19 to 16. there are no drawings in here indicating where in the existing steer location that six feet will be what need to be to the beach side of the existing Studio or to the west side The Advocates actually here you know so we can speak to that when it comes time okay uh so that's that's uh that's one question and clearly in the exhibits that are in the in the packet photos one and two showing these um front porch railing and uh front porch column as well as the uh historical photo from 1978 shows the column and those are character defining elements of the house and that and I think we can do everything we can to preserve the the core vaults and the railings and the post and so on so I think I'll direct my other questions to the applicant to clarify some some issues are there any questions for staff good question um there's a few windows that are proposed here at least was their original Windows it seems on the um Family facade um was there a window assessment um submitted with the application a winter condition assessment so the applicant can speak to this as well and I think the primary reason for the replacement is the weatherization issue so uh the the needs have double pain as opposed to single pain okay um and then just kind of talking about the condition for it to be a wooden post um just to clarify if the post is does not retain 50 structural integrity and can be replaced you know the building specification are we replacing the post with wood or the wood composite so the condition is intended to be and they're they're proposing what can positive customer trivia thank you um so this is more of a general discussion item I I've had to deal with many of these issues myself and like Julia I guess I should have said I also lived in that neighborhood so I am thrilled that the health has been rehabilitated and I've spooked around and looked at a great detail pictures too so a couple of comments I I object um to the requirement to replace it with in-kind materials simply because of the time that that house was constructed the materials available were far below the standard but quite available materials are today for example the moldings that appear on that um are actually readily available from the same Mills that know the original materials but they are made out of much more durable materials now so you know I I mean I think it makes no sense to replace them with the same materials with the original materials a poor choice they were simply the only choice at that time um and they were very very importantly they just don't hold up but the new materials are sandable paintable it's completely indistinguishable from wood um so I would remove that condition if it were up to me and I would suggest that that not be a precedent since I'm going to be doing miles of that stuff on the outside of my house and I've done tons of it on the inside as well and the results are the results match exactly so what was the original I think they just put plain you know so I think it is possible to do it with newer materials and not have to match the emission materials um but to match the look um so that's that's my only objection here from our political question for her staff these are all expenses for right now please okay so I guess the question is can we modify that requirement to make it more feasible um for the owner to restore it in a way that will last better and and longer yes of course so again these are just recommendations for you to consider and I should give a little background so part of um what I did with this particular case as I reached out to the restoration specialist who you're familiar with at the student contribution office just to see what they're recommending for decorative features like this and this is what was recommended to me but again it's it's a discretionary hearing you you can adopt these conditions as written or you can modify them into the previous case so and you can take them clarification and understanding so I did yeah that was a question I asked which is part of the reasoning behind their comment that um the windows are going to require verification of adequate egress especially at that rear but I was told that for presidential property they were required to have a are there any other questions for status all right thank you Kimberly I will now call for the applicant's testimony you state your name and address for the record or your business address if you're representing the applicant and please note that your testimony is limited 15 minutes okay residences in San Diego and then we have another medicine that's important uh either either one of everyone 1500 uh Skyline Boulevard so my wife and I um with the intention of it I'm recently retired from the practice of law I've been watching a TV show This Old House for the last 30 years you know a way to jump in and uh I don't think it doesn't really make sense for the financial standpoint is an intermittal property which is why I think it's never been a fixed up before the uh the cost of renovating the house would couldn't really be justified because it would take many years to repeat it but I have another incentive than that it's a good project so we work more of our kids um the house is in uh extremely important position I don't know how long they do that a team that has been in the house uh the prior renter owned it for 30 years or so they would uh they were active tea landlords and I spoke to their radically and they told me that you know they just had a standing order just don't spend any money on this house and this is absolutely necessary and as a result it's deteriorated over time um I heard your comment I am the most popular guy in my history right now all my late papers are very excited about after after I bought the house I needed for the first time I suddenly we went to Orlando University said oh yeah that's where my fraternity presence uh what I bought it there were there were tenants in the house they were all uh alcoholics and audience you cannot imagine what this place oh my God you know uh you know uh but we're very excited about it but they've seen that they've already been doing a lot of work on the landscaping and uh making that looked a lot better but what questions I think you had a question about the I think that was really honest yeah oh um in the in the report so I said you want to mirror the front because it's only about maybe this High we're just coming at the time that that house has been now building clothes require nothing to be higher uh so people don't fall um so what I had in mind is to have that rail that that rarely match the rest so so what you have is is railings don't look like look like what was it'll come around and then go down the so it'll look really nice and are you going to wear that the building codes are not retroactive I think if you well I'm not an expert lawyer not a builder but from watching this whole house when they address that issue uh they they had to make them notes either well there are a number of ways to to achieve a protective railing height without removing the existing historic railing and that's what I'm what I'm concerned about is the um there are very few features of that house that that haven't been messed with over time and that porch is one of the character defining front elevation features of the house and I think that it needs to be protected and um you know putting back shingles on the Dormers oh that is just wonderful these are things that was my character yeah all of that is great and um you know using modern materials for the flat work on the porches and you know steps all of that that's the Sears that's that's all just great but um but I think there needs to be a balance between preserving those few remaining character-defined features and livability uh longevity ability to render the weather here so the composite composite um horizontal surfaces steers floor material is fine or trailings because you're going to want to have a you know a safe railing but I uh I'm very concerned about keeping that original",

        "text": " been hearings officers who have said well you didn't talk about that that part that how that influences this issue therefore you can't uh include it in your arguments so I think we need to look at that I guess that's probably enough for me right now um maybe more than enough for you but okay let somebody else talk sure and just uh on that note thanks so so much Irene for all of your suggestions uh and thoughts uh um well I'll look at you in a little bit so uh when everyone's finished Renewables uh Northwest if you have any we'd love to hear them thank you um yeah I I think I'd like to start with some context and I won't have quite the same list of specifics with some of the folks who have commented so far um so we kind of come into this rulemaking against the backdrop of having worked on passing and now trying to implement House Bill 2021 from the 2021 legislative session which uh requires Oregon's largest utilities to move to 100 clean electricity by 2040 and also included in that that bill that passed a couple years ago was a general policy statement um saying that the legislature um you know wanted this transition to 100 clean energy to be carried out to the maximum extent practicable in a way that brings direct benefits to Oregon um so there is definitely a hope and and I spoke to this hope in some of my legislative testimony at the time that a significant number of projects uh supporting this clean energy transition would be built into Oregon uh if you look at the first clean energy plans that have come out from both Pacific square and PGE the scale of the need to build and develop new facilities to make sure that we can achieve that 100 clean electricity uh mandate it's really significant uh it is likely that fsec is going to be very busy uh in the coming years in particular you know there's there's not only a 20 40 100 mandate but also a mandate that those utilities reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 80 by 2030. um and getting there which is you know seven seven years away six years away depending on how you look at it calendar wise um that means a lot of work not just over the coming decade but really in the next few years because in order to achieve those Mission reductions by 2030 you're going to be going through permitting processes essentially now that allow the um you know the the project to get permitted and then build and then actually operate in a way that allows the utility to be displacing emitting um all that's to say um there's going to be a lot of work happening at fsec um meanwhile from the perspective of an organization that works with a lot of renewable energy developers has a lot of developers in our membership uh fsec is generally considered one of if not the most onerous permitting processes in the um I have heard not just anecdotally but you know concretely from some of our developer members that they will not build projects here because the process is so lengthy and cumbersome compared to you know the opportunities that exist in other states and I don't bring that up today actually to criticize that SEC but rather to praise you for undertaking this rulemaking and centering uh efficiency in that first bullet point I think that's going to be the watchword that that we bring to this rulemaking process and encourage other participants to do so as well efficiency doesn't have to mean you know it doesn't have to be in direct conflict with robust public engagement uh but it we're going to be looking for ways that the process can become less lengthy and less costly um while still ideally preserving or even potentially um you know ensuring that there are more robust opportunities for public engagement and I think some of the things that we've heard from other rack members so far and that are in the staff memo are probably a good way to do that adding Clarity and specificity to the rules so that people know what uh meaningful engagement in an fset contested case process looks like um so yeah we definitely support the idea of trying to ensure that the rules provide uh more information to potential um you know interested parties as to how to raise issues with adequate specificity to preserve them in the hope both that the sort of arguments that project proponents are going to want to understand and address can get raised clearly and that some of the stuff that's you know maybe less well developed or less clear or less well supported by the evidence on the application gets cold out early because there's no need to spend time on stuff that is kind of a hope as opposed to a real point of contention there are other points in the rules I'm sure where uh connect Clarity that will benefit project proponents and uh intervening parties we'll be kind of looking for those that don't have a list right now um but and I'm sure there are also other places in the process where we can potentially bring more efficiency to um so that's just sort of the lens that that we intend to bring to this and it's again as an organization that does not directly participate in contested case processes I'm not going to have a laundry list um but sort of look forward to reviewing the the ideas that come from some of the folks who do directly engage and trying to help find Solutions um and I did also have one I don't know if this is the right time but question stemming from the staff memo that gave rise to this rack which I think you've kind of alluded to earlier but the bullet that was included in the memo on clarifying what can be appealed to council and what cannot um was not sure exactly what that was referring to um so if at some point in the process um you can maybe share a little additional light on what Steph was thinking there I at least would appreciate it uh that's all from me thank you yeah so I'm happy to just hit that point real quick because we do have time um and also I would like to kind of speak to your broader Point as well because I think it's worth repeating and just keeping in mind throughout this process uh with respect to that bullet um I don't know if Patrick uh is on uh he's the uh staff attorney who represents Council in in these contested case hearings um but oh there he is uh my my take and actually I'd love you for you to correct me if I'm wrong or confirm that I'm right Patrick is that uh essentially certain certain issues uh parties can take straight to council to get resolution and other issues they have to wait until essentially a final order before they can can raise that issue Patrick can you can you speak to that yeah the way it has been uh set up is that there aren't inter it's called interlocutory appeal there are no interlocutory appeals unless the hearing officer has made a decision that would terminate your involvement in the contested case so let's say you have to raise three issues in the contested case and the hearing officer believes that none of those issues should be should go to contested a case for whatever reason you didn't raise it with sufficient specificity it's not within council's jurisdiction if you wanted to bring three and the hearing officer rejects all three the result of that is now you're not able to participate in a contested case so because your participation is completely cut off you can appeal that to council if you raise three issues and the hearing officer just says no one of these we're not going to engage in for whatever reason you're still participating in the contested case on your other two issues so you would not be allowed to appeal that the dismissal of that one issue to the hearing officer that's how we have it has been handled in the past uh and that will certainly be subject to discussion during the course of this rack thank you appreciate the additional clarification there thank you Patrick uh to the broader point I just want to make it clear I don't uh we do have some rule makings that are coming down the pipeline that I think are going to be very uh heavily subscribed to and attended that are going to make it easier or harder for um applicants to get a site certificate in the state of Oregon this rulemaking is not necessarily designed to do that from a standards perspective to basically lower the bar that an applicant has to meet to get a site certificate however the goal would be to make it less expensive and more and more efficient for this I mean there's no reason unless you just you know I suppose there could be there could be constituents who just don't want to build anything and so they benefit from this process being as convoluted and as complex and as as expensive as possible um staff's opinion and and uh Sarah is on the call can correct me if if uh she disagrees but is that you know the legislature essentially determines what uh the council has to consider and uh protect as part of uh you know granting these site certificates and these applicants they either meet these standards or they don't and if they do they should get a size certificate and as part of getting that site certificate and establishing that they've met those standards we should be making that process as efficient and cheap and quick as possible uh whilst maintaining you know the quality that we can we can be confident that that they are in fact Meeting those standards so as part of the process that's going to happen almost every time uh you know on some level it does happen on every time we don't want this contested case process to be any more expensive or onerous than it has to be it should be efficient it should be quick we should be having fights about did the applicant meet the standard or did they not we should not be having fights about I'm a party you know did I argue with this those are going to happen but we should make sure the rules are as clear as they can be to minimize the amount of time that we spend in that process on those kind of process issues so that's kind of my Approach is the rules uh coordinator on this project is you know where can we identify issues of confusion where we create or modify the existing rules in a way that will make them easier to understand for uh this the um the applicant but but also for those who are want to participate in the process so that they can preserve their rights so they know you know for example it has come up and it's going to continue to come up you know what what kind of sufficient specificity and we should maybe come up with the",

again we just want to make sure that we're doing a good job of communicating our concerns before we get to those processes so with that I really appreciate your time thank you for your comment can I just ask a quick question um for you as you know um you know we get both side the the developer and certainly the people they're working with that want the project and others might not so um is the efu issue overriding if we had condition if there were condition suitable conditions to speak to the land use land use water not so much land use I guess uh but the water contamination the end of life of the solar panels those issues conditions were applied that recognize that and possible possible solutions the fact that it's efu conversion is that biggest that's the biggest and the foremost concern of of our community yes we just can't keep taking Farmland away it it is it is what makes Oregon what it is the beauty of the Farmland the beauty of the Timber the beauty of the beaches and that's our largest and most foremost concern of continuing to take this and set precedent uh for the entire wamit Valley would be along that same line of thought um once this is allowed where does it stop and is that up to this committee to make that determination where does it stop 1600 Acres today could be from it could Our concern and I I don't want to come across as as a conspiracy theorist but this could this could continue on up the valley and and take away that that that beauty and our farmlands and a followup um so the and I I'm not sure which group when you said you're representing a group is it the community just community community at large yes um so does the group recognize um a solar facility that may have an end of life and council's requirement that it be returned to usable condition um versus a building versus a you know distribution warehouse does the group kind of consider that aspect of it Vice chair Condon we've taken that into consideration it's a 35e uh lease if you will and our concern there is that that land will not be it'll take a long period of time to bring that and renew that land back to a farmable state if if there is such a word um there's a lot of theory that's going into this proposal and we'll have to I don't want to get too far down in the Weeds on that but we don't see the practicality of what they're proposing this is not a public okay s so to answer your question really quick is yes we're taking that into consideration but we don't see that as a reasonable uh return to where it once was 35 years is that's my my I I live rural because I want my grandson to live rural I'm gonna stop stop and I probably went too far with my question because it's specific yeah I will we'll continue the discussion when it's time when it's proper timing thank you and thank you for your question Vice cond thank time again thanks anybody else in the room to comment doesn't look like it so um Nancy about the webinar and the phone I do see that we have a a hand raised at this time actually a couple but let me go ahead and just remind everybody first of all how to raise your hands so if you are on the webinar um at the bottom of the main window is a set of icons click on the participants and at the bottom of right of the participant window is a hand icon if you click on that hand that will raise your hand if you want to comment and when you're finished you can click it again to lower your hand if you're participating on the phone press star three on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and when you have completed your comments go ahead and press star three again on the keypad to lower your hand so at this time I see that Fuji Cryder has her hand raised so I will go ahead and unmute your mic Fuji you are open and ready to comment H good morning can you hear me okay yes okay great um I just have a I have a couple comments on two different topical areas here public comment period and there is another person sitting next to me that will go after me but we only have one computer hand raised just so you know Miss CER CER could we get your address as well oh yes gotcha um my name is G Fuji k r EI d r 60366 Marvin Road M Grand Oregon thank you so um okay you're welcome um the first one is more just a comment or an inquiry I guess um it's just a followup from last month's hearing on contested case rulle making at that hearing I shared a few experiences going through a large cont case and um at that hearing um I told you at that point I I explained experiences and then I told you that stop B2 Coalition would be submitting much more detailed comments as soon as we had them ready knowing how complex the rules were and the sooner you had the substantive comments the better so I submitted these comments to you a week ago I asked Tom and Todd to forward them to you um I also put them in the portal so I'm wondering if any of you have received them yet um my you know if you haven't that's that's not really the point the point is that my fear is that you'll only get them as an attachment to the staff's analysis and Report maybe like a week or two weeks before your next meeting and like Justin was saying earlier when he was like saying goodbye the the complexity and the in the volume is pretty substantial so I wanted you to know that these are in the portal if staff do not forward them to you they're there and um I have them very outlined by the rules and with examples hopefully clarify and I hope you have time to consider them fully before your May meeting thank you on that one my second um is actually really an inquiry that I would like to know what to do um last night uh earlier Sarah's report she told you that the DPO um public comment period has opened for RFA to for the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line last night I sent a an email to Todd with a formal letter from the stop be2 H Coalition um asking for more for full 60 days for this period and um I had a little Email exchange just now with Todd because you know I realize you guys probably don't have this letter and it's less than seven days but if I wait till seven days um to make make a motion to ask for a Time extension I'm not really sure the process um however if we wait till your next meeting your next meeting is actually the deadline so uh the request is formal in a letter I also sent it to Patrick Ro just a few minutes ago is trying to get it somehow into this meeting to ask you to take a look at this letter um it's just one page we're asking for some more time given the complexities of this DPO how long the staff has taken to revieww it another four months gone by um the developer it's all in the letter how long and all and the problems we've been having with mapping and things that are still not resolved and um I would like to know if you do not take action on this request for extension of time today is there a legal process what do we do um because seven days is Tuesday not today so I don't know what really yet to do to ask for a decision on um so that I guess concludes um what I have to say today I'm hoping I get a little bit of a response here I know it's just public comment period but I'm a little bit at a loss okay thanks for your comments uh Miss kryder uh as far as responses you could take the time to consider it today I haven't read the letter so I don't know your standard for requests for extensions of deadlines as you you've done it a couple times in the past you know one to two years is is there a good cause so you have to look at it and assess is there a good cause to to uh to Grant an extension to a deadline uh so you could try to take that up today or you could take it up at your next meeting keep the current deadline and let them know that the current deadline stands and at the next meeting you would possibly extend it or You' make a decision as to whether or not to extend it now I understand that the deadline is at the next meeting so that they would still have to treat the next meeting as the deadline but if you at that meeting decided to extend it then you would be giving them I think an an additional 15 days so it's this decision is a you know it should be done at a public meeting um May I would you like to read to you councelor Grail uh for the record this is Marcy Grail and I just want to remind everyone that I am refused myself from all things related to bdh due to my former employment pacificor so um I'm going to sit here and say nothing unless uh uh secretary serson would like me to move during this okay so I'm just going to sit here quietly okay thank you for that um so councelor grer or yeah okay I know who sorry this is um councelor fire just um before we take up this matter if we could get some advice from Council on how we consider these kind of requests for extension I have not seen one of these before and I don't know what our rules are so is it possible for us to take this up later on the agenda so again the standard is good cause there isn't a rule it's just a general standard that would be applied in this instance you've done it twice in last 18 months I would say once it was uh on B2 RFA 1 request for Amendment one there was a request to extend the deadline for comment and you denied that request as not as there not being good cause and I'm trying to think I think it might have been Nolan Hills okay uh and that was in July it doesn't",

        "text": " overall land use pattern of the area um the hearing officer concluded that um the uh site certificate application was um consistent uh with the land you stand it here the anchorage on which the facility would be placed um as non-arable and does not have water rights um more specifically um would in order to make it a better quality farmland would require water um and that um the ability to obtain a water right um would need to come through transfer that the ability to obtain that is speculative and then finally that the project area um here comprises a small fraction of the total land within lake county that's within pharmus so once again as with all these i've taken a look at the hearing officer's reasoning and and believe that they are supported by the facts in the law so i'll stop and ask if there are any questions um and uh if there aren't then we can move on to the straw poll on this one so jesse the overall land use pattern of the area is part of this issue also isn't it yes that's correct yes and in order to address that then they did the acreage calculations of how much land was in farm use and in what percentage um this represented a third of a percent of private land yeah so the area is the whole county yes that's um the what was looked at here um and you know um there are other ways to look at this issue um but the county unit is useful in some ways at least because there is a reasonable amount of data to look at in terms of that unit and then again the the determination was based both on that fraction and um and the overall quality of the land is zoned here that would be used for the project um and and particularly this conclusion that without water rights um on the property that uh you were not going to be able to use it for a good quality farmland yeah i think i think the water rights fact is pretty significant in this case given that there are circles on the adjacent lands that's all the questions i have i'm ready for the straw poll anyone else here again um i'll just ask whether or not any member of the council objects to the hearing officer's conclusion that the applicant had satisfied the land use standard on this for the reasons that i just stated okay hearing none we will go on to issue issue three is again related to impacts to neighboring farms of the facility as asserted by the the issue reads whether the application failed to demonstrate the proposed development will not unduly diminish agriculture from impacts of fugitive dust invasive weeds wildlife displacement caused by the removal of native vegetation as well as heat blooms unduly increased related public service in violation of part of the lake county zoning ordinance a comprehensive plan goal so there are two kind of sub components to this issue um the first being the um unduly diminishing agriculture component and the second unduly increasing public service costs and so the hearing officer's conclusion here was that county plan uh comprehensive plan goal implemented through two zoning ordinance application had again as condition demonstrated that the proposed facility would comply with both of those provisions um again diving into that a little bit more deeply the um hearing officer concluded that uh protestants had not provided evidence that the farm use impacts alleged by the protestants were likely to occur um and again that they did not either account for required mitigation um or assume that they would fail um uh specifically with respect to crop depredation by elk the alj found that the required mitigation measures were that there had been extensive work with the department of fish and wildlife and that the mitigation measures that were developed as a result of that were um the hearing officers rationale with respect to the public services was essentially identical that um the app the protestants hadn't provided um that the impacts they alleged were likely to occur um so i'll stop there on that one and see if there are any questions jesse this is cindy i don't know if you can see me a question i i there's nothing with respect to this particularly but i am a little bit concerned um as i went through all of these it seems to me hard on the front end and the mitigation factors the conditions are you know go a long way i think but clearly the limited parties are about what happens in the future and i don't know enough about the process so the site goes through and what the limited parties maintain or suggest in the contested case if it um if there is damage from elk or dust or whatever what's the remedy what is the remedy for that yes uh thank you for the question uh councilmember conan so the remedy for any violation of a site certificate condition there are enforcement provisions both in the council statutes and the council's rules um and so um a you know protestant here or wouldn't even need to be a protestant here it could simply be an interested member of the public um can raise an issue with department staff say explain why they believe that a particular site certificate condition is being violated staff will then look into that issue um and respond accordingly there are provisions for penalties to be imposed or remedy requirements to be you know a violation of a site certificate condition is established one other thing that i'd like to point out here for for everyone who's attending this as well is that um f sex site certificates are of both its own standards and other agency permits if the site certificate violation deals with another agency's permit the member of the public might be contacting both the permitting agency and the department staff and then how that is sorted out between the two agencies is really kind of a matter for to decide um there have been you know discussions in the past um with various permitting agencies and and department staff about how that works precisely uh but from the the public's perspective they don't have to worry about all that kind of internal it's just more saying well this looks like it was a removal fill violation so i'm going to give the department of state lands a call and then i'm going to give the citing staff a call and let them know what happened and then those agencies will carry it from there so just a follow-up to make sure i understand it um just as we've heard about another issue or an issue similar to this with respect to another project so the public their point of contact is the council the council issued the site certificate so something happens that counts the council of the department is the first at you know pick up the call or pick up the phone and call or email or whatever and can we take it from there thank you any other questions okay then i will move on to the straw question here again and to ask whether or not any council member has any objections to the way that the hearing officer disposed of this issue concluding that the applicant had met the uh the land use standard with respect um to this issue as a result of the protestants um not providing evidence um that the impacts alleged were likely to occur okay hearing none we will move on to issue four uh so this issue again has to do with farm use impacts but um it's a little different in nature here because it's looking at an exception goal three of the statewide planning goals and also the lake county's comprehensive plan goal three which identifies a preference for the preservation of agricultural land um and so getting into the weeds in terms of um the the different acreage standards for solar facilities um suffice it to say that the applicant and the department both identified that a goal exception would be required for this facility as a result the applicant requested a goal exception focus of the contested case proceeding on this issue had to do with the reasons that the applicant presented so the um goal three exceptions process is sometimes referred to as a reasons um there's actually more to it than that there are several different components that need to be met to take an exception but again the contested case was primarily primarily focused on the validity of the the applicant presented a number of different reasons proposed order had narrowed those down from the department staff's perspective to look primarily at the the minimal nature of the impacts on agriculture as again conditioned in the site certificate local economic benefits hearing officer's order agreed with the department's conclusion the hearing officer appeared to incorporate each of the reasons given by the applicant and so the hearing officers proposed contested case order decision is is a little bit more expansive in terms of um the reasons that uh that he believed were supported by the evidence so um one of the decisions for the council here is what to do about that that potential discrepancy um when we get to the review of the draft final order um the way that i've suggested this is not the only way of dealing with this but the way that i've suggested dealing with this is um acknowledging the discrepancy given that both the proposed order and the proposed contested case order found that there were sufficient reasons that the the difference in rationale here is is immaterial to the overall decision of whether or not to um grant a site certificate um so the outcome is the same either way um draft final order um it's all discussed later still acknowledges the staff's approach um to the goal three exception and the reasons so that's not erased from the draft final order um it's more just you know putting the two of them side by side the hearing officer's the staff's rationale um and saying that you know that the conclusion reached is the same and i as i understand that this has been um you know the nature of reasons for these applications has been a focus of the council in the recent i'm happy to answer any questions about the hearing officer's rationale at this point and as we get into the draft final of course i'm happy to to answer any questions or about the approach that i've suggested or talk about other approaches as well marcy this is hanley jesse um yes we have had conversations about what is adequate for um a goal three exceptions um and i think this application was submitted in uh um our discussions have been more recently than that um and so it's hard you know it's difficult for the applicant to have addressed our issues i do think that the requirement for reasons justifying why the state body state policy embodied and the applicable goals should not apply needed or could use additional in the exceptions process but i do believe that because of the low value of agricultural productivity for the site and the fact that it does not have irrigation water available goes a long way towards meeting that that is part of the justification",

        "text": " be retired and the assumption is that it's full build out can you go to the slide with the table on it i think it's the one right before this yes and that's impossible to see so um you're welcome i can find the i can find the page on your on your proposed order though okay so the this task oh that that that's kind of helpful it breaks out all the line items uh on our retirement when we do the cost estimating to get the estimated bond amount to retire the entire the facility is at full build out so we're maximum footprint maximum everything um it's on your proposed order page 296 this table is so and and it the discussion of the activities to restore the site are kind of reverse construction so we're taking down the poles taking down the cabling removing an efu land the foundations for the transmission structures and all of those get reviewed and a price tag put next to one of the major components for the facility are the related supporting facilities which are the roads or one of them is the roads roads would be you know reseeded if new soil would needed to be brought in that would happen the road restoration would be a pretty significant component to retiring the thank you sorry for my pause here folks okay so now uh next slide please nancy we council looked at this standard in um its review of the draft proposed order and actually had a pretty robust discussion underneath this standard in the proposed order your recommended financial assurance condition five which is the bond that applies during operation is related to a contested case issue so i'm gonna leave that for for jesse to talk about but just kind of reminding council because council was kind of a different council than that that we did actually some of those revisions that you see in the proposed order for condition five came out of council's deliberation of discussion and direction to staff at its review of the draft proposed order so i'm going to talk just briefly about financial assurance condition 4 so this is a condition that the to apply during construction and it says um because we're kind of going back to the general standard of review condition that said we're going to give them four years to begin construction and once they start they can have four years to complete construction so we're kind of looking at four years to build this um and what this condition says and i am paraphrasing because this is a pretty long condition but it basically the uh the bonding amount to reach which i'm sorry at that table um the the total is up about 140 million dollars that we're saying would be appropriate to um restore retire and restore the site retire the facility restore the site so this condition four says that during construction every quarter the amount would increase getting to that 140 which would then also be adjusted based on you know the inflation factors etc um each quarter going getting up to that 140 million dollars and this is to cover to contemplate that as time goes forward there's more facility on the ground that would then if needed to be retired that it would the yes the bond amount would be commensurate with the amount of facility that would be on the ground throughout the construction period i think that i'm just going to stop there did you have anything you wanted to add yeah i'm going to stop there and i will well i'll pass it off to jesse but we can just kind of take a pause this council have any questions about how we generated that 140 the table questions from council it's like not okay great i'm gonna pass it off to jesse and then um so will you guys go to the next slide nancy nope okay so next one okay thank you kevin um so we have one contested case issue that drew exceptions for the retirement financial assurance the party is irene gilbert the issue um that was raised in the contested case is whether the one dollar bond amount adequately protects the public from facility abandonment and provides a basis for the estimated use useful life of the facility so the hearing officer's findings of fact and opinion on this are that the council rules give discretion to the council to allow an amount less than the full site full cost of site restoration that the rule allows for the certificate holder to have a bond or letter of credit in a form and amount satisfactory to the council um the uh site certificate condition um one of the mandatory site certificate conditions and again we're you know a lot of the conditions that we're talking about um here in these contested case issues are conditions that were added either they were proposed by idaho power or they requested by the council or they were proposed by staff to ensure that the standards are met but there are a set of mandatory conditions in the council's reviews one of these conditions allows for the bond or letter of credit amount to differ during construction and operation hearing officer went on to find that the dollar bond was proposed by idaho power once the facility is operational because of the low risk as a puc regulated facility significant cost roughly eight hundred and eighty thousand dollars a year uh to maintain the bond would be passed on to ratepayers um the hearing officer also looked at um idaho power's credit rating uh concluding that it had access to uh secured and unsecured credit um at reasonable rates and under acceptable for example pointing to a 300 million dollar credit facility with a significant syndicate of large financial institutions in contrast the hearing officer looked at the evidence provided by the limited party and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the claim that the dollar bond for the first 50 years of operation is insufficient or that the facility is likely to become obsolete or that idaho power will become and then the the final conclusion here um is uh related to an argument that was made by ms gilbert uh comparing solar facilities um to the transmission line and the hearing officer's conclusion that was that the two were dissimilar enough that they didn't serve as a useful comparison to a puc-regulated major transmission line so that is an overview of how the hearing officer dealt with that and how it was written up in the proposed contested case order so i'd like to go ahead and have with vice chair house lead to call ms to provide her three minutes of oral argument and again the reminder that uh oral argument and any responses should be limited to information that is already in the evidentiary record am i on am i easy to understand okay irene gilbert here and i've requested an exception to the proposed contested case order failing to require the developer to maintain a bond in the amount established by council to restore the facility site to a useful non-hazardous condition in the alternative i have identified three site certificate conditions which i am requesting be implemented to provide protection to the public and the state from facility abandonment or default from any unplanned event the necessity of requiring a bond is supported by the fact that it is identified as a mandatory site certificate condition and council rules specifically deny the council the authority to use a balancing determination in the valuation of this i identified multiple issues of fact in the form of statutes rules court decisions and examples of bankrupt companies which are being waived or reinterpreted and the event council approves a one dollar bond a reduced bond amount and places the state and taxpayers in jeopardy the proposed contested case order fails to identify the required facts and conclusions of law regarding each of the arguments supporting a denial of this contested case multiple court decisions limit council authority to waive or interpret rules or statutes to rules that are genuinely ambiguous including gonzales versus and the u.s supreme court decision in kaiser versus wilkie which also requires the interpretations to be reasonable and that there cannot be a new interpretation that creates unfair surprise to regulated parties while the department and idaho power will argue that fsac is not bound by u.s supreme court decisions the council should carefully consider whether it is prudent to accept such an argument the council does not have unlimited power to interpret and reinterpret rules and statutes of the agency the oregon supreme court in a recent ruling stated that the council acted quote without a reasonable basis in fact or law you are being asked to apply the actual unambiguous language of the council rules regarding the required bond amount and do so in a manner that is consistent with the council decisions before and after b2h including requiring the bond amount to be the amount the council identified as necessary to restore the site which has always been interpreted as the amount satisfactory to the council for the bond your decision needs to be consistent with the recommendations from your consultant golder and associates and the amounts being required of other developers also the training that you receive from oto's staff the risk of requiring use of the bond is always going to be minimal as with any insurance it is to protect from the unlikely but possible events the file the file fails to document that there is a preponderance of evidence that the rules and statutes requiring a bond are being met i urge council to reject the denial of this contested case site certificate and conditions as the current bond amount fails to meet the requirements that the interpretation be reasonable and not create unfair thank you miss gilbert are there any questions from council of miss gilbert okay thank you good evening again lisa brachner for idaho power in her exceptions ms gilbert argues that the council's rules prohibited from taking a flexible approach to its requirements to recognize specific risks presented by each project but as a matter of law the council does have that flexibility and as a matter of policy the council should exercise that flexibility in this first as a matter of law the council's rules quite clearly allow the council to exercise its discretion as to the appropriate amount of the bond the rules state that in order to issue a site certificate the council must find uh that the applicant has a reasonable likelihood of obtaining a bond or letter of credit in a form or amount satisfactory to the council that language satisfactory to the council plainly indicates that the council is to exercise its judgment as to the appropriate amount of the bond it's also consistent with mandatory condition 8 which repeats that the bond must be in a form and amount satisfactory to the council ms gilbert's interpretation would require the council to completely ignore the critical language in the rules which is inconsistent with basic rules of statutory construction as a matter of policy b2h's application confirms that a phased-in bonding approach is reasonable and i want",

couple days in the comment period and then when we issue the proposed order we'll issue a notice of an opportunity to request a contested case and that will have details about the items that um an

rules um uh secretary Cornett and our communication team have put together a nice short 10-minute PowerPoint presentation going through um the contested case process for an amendment and and how to request a contested case And discussing these thresholds it's available on it's a link to it as in the notice and then it's also available on our web page so if Council does receive requests for contested case the options for counsel um are to hold a contested case on properly raised issues kind of going back that meet those criteria before um Council can also remand the proposed order back to us the department um and um with Direction about how to address um the issues raised in the you know petition for the contested case or Council can deny the request for contested case next slide please and which I believe and so Vice chair how it's going to go through you're going to hear some of the same things that I said but it's um it's important it's part of the presiding officer but we are now moving into the hearing portion thank you I'm going to it's tardy weather not very loud there the public hearing for the b2h transmission line request for site certificate Amendment one is now open the purpose of tonight's public hearing is to provide an opportunity for the public reviewing agencies Council and the certificate holder if they wish to do so to present oral and written testimony on the amendment request and the Department's draft proposed order the 34-day public hearing comment period on the draft proposed order is scheduled to close at the conclusion of the hearing tomorrow night in Pendleton next slide please at the conclusion of the presentation I will call on each person interested in providing oral testimony starting with a certificate holder then people in person then on the webinar then on the phone tonight's hearing is being recorded the presentation's written comments in oral testimony are part of the decision record for the amendment request for the next slide please pursuant to Oar 345-027-0367 sub 5 A and B please note the following a person who intends to raise any issue that may be the basis for a contested case must raise the issue in person at the hearing or in writing a written comment submitted to the Department of energy before the July 18 2023 deadline and with sufficient specificity to afford the council the department of energy and the certificate holder an adequate opportunity to respond including a statement of facts that support the person's position on the issue in the type a review amendment process to justify a contested case issues must be determined by the energy facility citing Council to raise a significant issue of fact or law that is reasonably likely to affect Council determination of compliance with an applicable next slide to raise an issue in a contested case preceding the issue must be within the council's jurisdiction raised in writing or in person prior to the close of the close of the record of the public comment period July 18 2023 raised with sufficient specificity to afford the Council of the Department of energy and the certificate holder an adequate opportunity to respond to raise an issue with sufficient specificity a person must present facts that support the person's position on the issue next slide for any individuals wishing to provide testimony during tonight's hearing for the record please include the following with your testimony full name of spelling physical mail or email address next slide so is a certificate holder here tonight and do they wish to provide testimony okay and I guess they wouldn't be remote for the record Todd cornet um the certificate holder is in the audience just not intending to provide comment at this point in time okay thank you uh public testimony are there any individuals in the room that wish to provide public testimony please remember to fill out a registration card available on the table and submit to Sarah esterson and I have one that she's brought me and Irene Gilbert has signed up so Irene ready for your testimony um anyway I wanted to comment on just a couple General things before I get into my actual uh comment regarding testimony um my name is Irene Gilbert g-i-l-b-e-r-t and I'm here as the representative of of stop Borden into Hemingway The non-profit also I'm here appearing as a person representing the public interest as I did in the initial site certificate and also as representing myself as an individual um one comment just starting out is when the um when the council members asked for specificity it's really difficult to provide some specific examples of some of the issues when the maps don't provide enough details so that you can really tell what's going on I mean when Council rules require things like setbacks and and that sort of thing the maps that are provided uh you zoom in on them and you just get a bigger picture of something that doesn't have any details and and with the technology that's now available I would think that it would be possible to have the maps allow you to zoom in and actually see the details of where these different changes are occurring certainly with things like Road it's really important to be able to see where those roads actually are appearing the um one other thing is I'm concerned about the stated scope of the comments as it relates to changes in the site certificate conditions the it was noted that the changes or the the application the requester amendment one was basically limited to commenting on the area that's changed with the amendment but according to the rules I believe it's rule number three in the ones that Kellen was going over it says that when there is a change in the site certificate condition the public has the opportunity to comment based on the impacts to the entire facility so I am concerned that people may believe that they had to be focused on just the area of the new amendment when in fact the rules allow them to comment just generally and for one example would be the fire fire plan because of it being a change to the site certificate condition the public has allowed full access to the in to comment on the entire facility and the impacts of the entire facility so I'm not sure how to deal with that I kind of feel that people ought to have an opportunity to perhaps send in comments and writing after the close tomorrow if they weren't aware and they I don't know how they would be aware if they weren't reading the specific rules because it does not State the difference in the notice to the public I'll leave that to you folks to discuss so uh getting into my comments here as you know I have had a lot of angst about the treatment of Timber and grazing zones and the combined zones and and whether or not the site certificates are allowing for protection of those areas and actually I had hoped to get that before The Supreme Court but because I'm an idiot I uh I didn't get it in timely so but what I want to talk about now is Forest Practices Act and many of the issues that caused me concern regarding the Union County um failing to provide protection for Forest lands actually are covered under this Forest Practices Act and I know that uh council member Devlin could no doubt give you a much better statement about the sort of the politics of the current Forest Practices Act and I don't know maybe some of the rest of you also are involved but just briefly um the language of the forest Practices Act was adopted October 26 2022 and it implemented Senate bills 1501 1502 and House Bill 4055 and the private Forest Accord report dated February 2nd 2022. the um so this act is in the rules it is officially in the rules and there are some implementation dates all of them have passed with the exception of the last piece is going to be implemented January 1st 2024 so um it's five months from now the um the issue is um you know the the governor was very concerned about the fact that there were some the public was going to have initiative an initiative process to get some of these issues on before the public for a vote and so she I'm talking about Governor Brown here pulled together a whole bunch of people from from Timber and you know resources and Wildlife and and they came up with this agreement to avoid uh having the initiative process um so I wanted to go through some of the requirements of this because the forest Practices Act applies to every force in this state and I'm not going to read the rule numbers to you but I will include them when I send this in in writing prior to your deadline um tomorrow afternoon and many of the requirements of this rule apply to this amendment they also apply to every site certificate every development that's being done that's going to in any way uh involve the removal of trees so uh but I like about this rule is it provides very specific requirements for all Forest activities that involve the removal of Kimber and the definitions and the requirements are very clearly laid out in the statute and the rules and I just wanted to kind of go over what some of those are again I'll include the reference numbers when I send this in but Forest land is defined as land which is used for growing and harvesting of tree species and it says regardless of how the land is zoned or taxed or how any state or local statutes ordinance rules or regulations are applied so it basically trumps anything as far as other agencies and their decisions about dealing with Forest land and removing Timber and it also defines forceland it says any Forest land capable of annual wood",

        "text": " have heard of ammonia being used as a promising hydrogen carrier um and that's due to its high hydrogen content and there's already an established distribution network um ammonia is you know easier to move around and the hydrogen can then later be released on demand from ammonia so that's also considered a storage medium for hydrogen there's also geologic storage um such as feet in geological features such as salt caverns so this is a graphic some folks promoting a an energy storage project in utah called aces or advanced clean energy storage and their goal for this project is to produce renewable hydrogen and then compress it and store it in existing salt caverns and it is being billed as largest um energy storage project in the world the only problem with this is that salt caverns aren't distributed everywhere they are just in kind of narrow areas within the world and within the us with respect to moving around hydrogen um there are kind of three main ways that it's currently distributed so the first is within pipelines and there are some pipelines in the u.s that are dedicated to hydrogen but these are limited um so there's been a push to um add hydrogen into national gas sorry natural gas pipelines so there's been numerous demonstration projects already doing this in europe um there are limiting factors to this however first it's likely only possible to blend you know maybe up to 20 hydrogen by volume into a natural gas pipeline before you start to see problems with how hydrogen might affect pipeline materials pardon me how much hydrogen might leak out or how end-use appliances and buildings might react so this is partly due to just the chemical and physical structure of hydrogen it can easily migrate into the crystal structure of most metals and therefore um steel pipes um for example that are used in transmission pipeline infrastructure can suffer from what's called embrittlement and cracking after continuous exposure to hydrogen so any sort of hydrogen transport pipeline or any metal exposed to it should be resistant to corrosion or cracking compressed hydrogen as a gas can be transported in high pressure tube trailers and these can go on the back of a truck on a rail car on a ship or on a barge this is um fairly expensive and so it's often used for shorter distances and then you can also liquefy hydrogen to those cryogenic temperatures and then distribute it in tankers again via trucks rail cars this is also expensive but it is more efficient for longer so hydrogen has been in use for many many years in a number of industries but as we discuss greatly expanding how we might use hydrogen in our economy globally or closer to home there are some common concerns that we hear raised and i'm not going to go into all of these today but i am going to highlight the first two safety and efficiency some of the other concerns are the costs around renewable hydrogen the potential of using renewable hydrogen to prolong the use of fossil fuels knox emissions from combusting renewable hydrogen in a turbine and then the water use associated with producing renewable so going into safe use of hydrogen and this is a big question that a lot of people have um and certainly no fuel is 100 safe and there are a number of ways in which hydrogen is shown to be safer than conventional fuels and so one of these is that hydrogen is not toxic unlike conventional fuels most of which are very toxic or contain toxic substances like carcinogens um hydrogen leak or spill is not going to attack pardon me contaminate the environment or threaten the health of humans or um hydrogen is also lighter than air and many times lighter than gasoline vapor so what this means is that when released it typically will rise and disperse rapidly and that greatly reduces the risk of ignition at ground level where people and buildings conversely propane and gasoline vapor are heavier than air so they like to stay down on the ground and can increase the risk of fires that could harm people or infrastructure and then finally hydrogen has a higher oxygen requirement for explosion than fossil fuels hydrogen can be explosive with oxygen concentrations that are between 18 and 59 percent um while for gasoline it's as low as one to three percent sorry um this means that gasoline has a greater risk for explosion than hydrogen for any given environment with oxygen that said there are certainly a number of safety issues with hydrogen that must be addressed for example hydrogen can ignite more than gasoline or natural gas um and so for this reason safe design of hydrogen systems requires adequate ventilation as well as specially designed leak detection sensors um and as mentioned earlier hydrogen can degrade certain metals including steel through a process called embrittlement so choosing materials used with hydrogen is of critical importance given that hydrogen has been produced and stored and transported for decades there are there is existing expertise in producing compressed hydrogen fuel tanks for example that are made of carbon fiber composites or for example carbon fiber paired with metal alloys so here's an example of kind of a typical high compression uh hydrogen storage and it has this inner lining of a polymer that serves as a barrier from hydrogen permeating it and then there's an outer layer that's made for impact and damage resistance and there are a number of codes and standards for hydrogen tank performance so when testing to ensure compliance with standards um tanks are subjected to more than i believe twice the maximum pressure that they experience under normal given that hydrogen is the smallest known molecule though it is certainly prone to leakage and hydrogen is what's called an indirect greenhouse gas and that's because it interacts with other direct greenhouse gases like methane and ozone and perturbs them in the atmosphere so thus again the importance of those sensors to detect leaks which are standard on hydrogen handling equipment and hydrogen filling stations but certainly you know as we've seen recently with a lot of the natural gas and methane leak detection um from drones and from satellites leads are a big deal and we should be worried about those but because of the growing interest in hydrogen for decarbonization scientists at national labs and universities have been working on research and development of new options for hydrogen storage and transport that are lighter that are cheaper and that better protect against leakage so that second concern about renewable hydrogen that i wanted to address is if you're using electricity to produce another fuel and then later turning that fuel back into electricity you're obviously going to be less efficient than just using that electricity for your end use in the first place as an example here is a diagram from nrel the national renewable energy lab that shows the round-trip efficiency for battery battery energy storage uh and that's at the top here and and compares it with hydrogen energy storage and even just looking at the pathways you can see that the battery pathway is way more efficient there are fewer steps there's less energy loss and in fact the end efficiency here is something like 95 and then you look at the hydrogen energy storage pathway and it's not great the round trip efficiency comes out to 35 percent and so this has costs and so you may be asking yourself with energy with efficiency losses like this why would anyone ever be interested in renewable hydrogen well there are a few reasons so first off if we want economy-wide decarbonization then we need to figure out what to do with some of what are called hearts to decarbonize sectors and there's been a recent mantra of electrify everything among um renewable energy advocates and we can electrify a lot of our economy but there are just some end uses where electricity doesn't make sense for example there are a lot of industrial processes like steel cement metal processing where electrification doesn't work these need um you know high heat a really concentrated energy source but a fuel like hydrogen could greatly reduce the greenhouse emissions um associated in these sectors another reason for the interest in hydrogen is that as we add more and more variable renewable resources to our electric grid i'm talking about those that don't always produce electricity like wind and we're having increasing problems around resource adequacy a need for resources to help balance at peak of peace times of peak demand and also a need for longer duration seasonal energy storage and that's really one of the places where hydrogen shines so if we if you remember that graphic i just showed you with nrel which showed the difference between 95 efficiency for battery energy storage versus the 35 for renewable hydrogen it's clear that batteries are a real winner but they're really only good for about four hours and so when you start getting to the need for longer duration storage which i'll get into shortly you're going to see that hydrogen can be a much more cost effective option and then finally there's certain transportation contexts where electricity just doesn't work and there are other reasons why there is interest in hydrogen but these are just four of the big ones gonna go over really quickly resource adequacy and peak demand so there's been a lot of talk in the northwest about resource adequacy lately and i pulled these two images from odo's 2020 biennial energy report which you should absolutely read cover to cover and it has a policy brief on resource adequacy and put simply resource adequacy means do we have enough resource resource capacity on the system to meet demand over a spread of years and that's going to include peak demand and then down below here we have yield duct curve and this shows an april day in california and so the light blue portion represents all of the demand for electricity being met with solar and the dark blue is the remaining demand for electricity or net demand and that has to be met with other resources and so the so-called belly of the duck is the middle of the day when there's so much solar that it's meeting almost all of the demand for electricity and then we get to 5 p.m and the sun starts going down and people at least in the before times would get off work and would come home and would turn on lots of things that consume electricity and then we have this ramp and to meet that ramp california has traditionally relied on what are called pure plants which are natural gas plants that can spin up quickly as soon as they're needed increasingly batteries are also being used to address peak demand and as i said that's where lithium-ion batteries can really shine providing those shorter bursts of energy for minutes or just a few hours but it's expensive to build enough batteries to replace all of the flexible resources we had or phasing out that could meet that peak demand and so hydrogen can play a role here in two ways first it could help replace some of those natural gas peaker plants either combusted as a fuel or via",

        "text": " charging automatically once it's hovering over it so that's called on Route and then of course at night time it's going to be charged at our Dell web Facility by being plugged yeah a very fancy yeah an electric bus after the warranty period is expected to have the same overall cost per mile of most other buses so it's more expensive to procure them but the long range benefit is for graders any questions that I could possibly answer about the battery electric bus program before I move on to a few other initiatives I have just one quick question uh it looks like now we can use electric cars in emergencies as house backup has there been any discussion on any sort of resiliency aspect for the bus battery which I have to imagine a pretty large yes I'm unsure do you know about that 10 or Chris I don't know uh all the details but it's similar to an electric vehicle car uh yeah the battery banks are much larger than the car so obviously yeah so it's like have many Tesla walls available and so yeah the energy is able to be like an emergency for example you could actually deploy a bus to serve as a backup system I believe it's possible and Chris did you have any other yeah I was going to say it might be possible but it's something that we have not explored at this time sure okay thank you thank you any other questions okay care the target for deployment spring yes our Target is January okay you should see them on the road soon you looked a little nervous when you said yeah so January expression so January is the date that they'll be fully deployed you'll start seeing them out on the road for training because there's a fairly extensive training process that we have to go through with the operators and also just some real life testing as far as battery use and those types of things on the route so in the coming months you'll see them out on the Route 11 simulating uh writing or in service and then January it'll be full deployment thank you I guess um is it public knowledge like how big are the batteries like Teslas have like 100 kilowatt hour batteries what are these for the buses I wish I knew that off the top of my I don't have that but we could get okay just curious yeah totally in support of this I agree with everything so I'd like to talk about their renewable natural gas program that chariots has as well so RNG is a capturing of orangier renewable natural gas so the capturing of methane from decomposing organic sources for instance landfills dairy farms refining and pumping it into the natural gas pipeline so chariots uses renewable natural gas since 2018 December of 2018 and the program works by having these producers through a broker a partner and certified fleets as an off user of the RNG produced and chariots is an off-user for this and so from an environmental impact or aspect methane is a greenhouse gas and the methane is being captured so it's not going out into the atmosphere and refined and then placed into the natural gas pipeline going directly to so um that is a benefit of capturing that methane and going into our buses so are you getting specific like from a specific Source are you really just kind of paying for this broader program that augments natural gas like with renewable natural gas so we're um I just talked to Greg Thompson our maintenance manager about this the other it's not at the point where we can say we're pulling from this dairy farm right now he's hoping to get there someday but right now it's just from the options on a list and then we're getting the benefits essentially you're subsidizing the program and then right okay yes it's like renewable energy credits yeah that's all right yeah okay exactly we recently with the last few years replaced our bus wash so uh chariots Prides ourselves and having really clean vehicles for riders in our community and the Rainy winter months every bus is washed every day and during the summer months it's usually every other day so clean and well maintained vehicles have shown that increases perceived safety and uh so it is important for us to keep the fleet clean for our writers in our community so this creates a large amount of water since we have you know 64 local buses plus we have our regional and our Paratransit as well so the bus wash the old bus wash was very inefficient and mostly ineffective so the bus washer was replaced with one that has much smaller footprint that does a much better job and especially scrubbing the back and under uh the uh normal conditions requiring less maintenance so with this new bus wash we were able to install a Water Reclamation system that catches cleans and reuses the water we added a reverse osmosis final rinse to reduce class water spots negating the need for our blower to dry at the end on the windshield and through this bus wash the new uh one reduces our soap usage by nearly 70 percent and our water consumption for the bus wash by 80 percent so this is a really exciting feature and I like to talk about it a lot so um but yeah the best water wash replacement has been super beneficial is that a no web also yes so we also have an r99 program so we have 64 heavy duty buses 30 of those are diesel and 34 are renewable natural gas so for the diesel buses we're using r99 we were doing B20 which is a blend of diesel 80 and then the 20 is soy pudding oil and residual cooking oil algae animal fat and canola which is better than just regular diesel B20 was a huge Improvement but then our 99 came to be as an option and it's made much like bio but it's not a blend it is the fuel and uh let's see here uh so we checked we tested B20 by wet feeling a small isolated part of our Fleet to determine if any unforeseen issues that arise they worked well we used B20 we then began investigating the use of either a mixture of biofuel and renewable diesel r99 was experiencing some positive results in the industry so when r99 started to become available chariots was using every chance they could there are some supply issues because Portland took the majority of the r99 but then when uh there was more readily available than uh Downstream we were able to consume after that so uh our sole source of fuel for our diesel fleet is r99 now is r99 renewable diesel are all of our diesel vehicles run on that as well yeah oh awesome in the city great that's cool before was it B20 you know I just know it's renewable okay okay that's why I was asking I've never heard the different letters I'm not sure whichever and there's a lot of letters yeah okay the other program is our re-refined oil program so re-refined oil is a process where news oil like motor oil is processed back to a pure base stock and then the additives are added back in so the oil never wears out but the additives do so instead of getting rid of our oil we actually go through the re-refine process takes out those additives um so it come boils down to a virgin oil and then we re-add brush additives so because of this kind of Statistics chariots have used 62 856 quarts or 15 000 or so gallons of re-refined oil it takes 24 barrels of crude oil to make 12 gallons of motor oil so chariots have saved um almost 3 000 barrels of crude from being produced just from this one we refined oil program our LED lighting project so when our Kaiser Transit Center was being built in 2013 or was built LED lighting was the original option so since that time chariots had conducted three major initiatives to replace the lining on the transit mall at the downtown Transit Center the exterior of our administrative and maintenance facilities and within all bus working areas within the maintenance shop so each time one of these phases was completed reliability of the lighting was increased so Greg Thompson again manager maintenance said that the repair cost and the time before LED took uh I mean you could go down to the trend downtrend Transit Center and there was always bulbs out and since LED it's not the case and so it's been a huge safety um Improvement as well as cost for maintenance and upkeep and then while the project costs varied the rebates from the Energy Trust of Oregon typically saw a return on our investment in 14 to 24 months I would like to share this picture uh the befores on the top left and then this is out at Del Webb so this is our Maintenance and Facilities location we have some administrative offices and as you can see behind our shop is where we store the buses in the evening time and so um top left is before and then after and this is one example so we did it not only at Del Webb but ktc downtown Transit Center and uh there's a lot of positives from it including okay so my last slide is about kind of the behind the scenes so those were really great examples of what charities is doing in regards to sustainability you know public facing and you know what our writers can experience on our buses and and washing and whatnot and then uh we also have an established a sustainability committee our Green Team I'm the chair of the sustainability committee and it was established um I'd say about 10 or so years ago and uh since covid I you know kind of brought it back to life and our committee our three priorities is Outreach education both internal and outside and as well as recommendations and research about various um ways we can improve as an agency and then also um the sustainability Committee just initiated a greenhouse gas emissions inventory over calendar year 2022 we just got the results about a month or so ago and they were presented to our board at the August work session and then from the Baseline information it's going to feed into our climate action plan so we're going through writing of the scope right now and the procurement process in order to bring uh consultant on to help us develop the kind of action plan that isn't complementary to our local Regional Partners including City of Salem and then also the county and the state level organ ODOT and then um so the climate action plan is a huge Initiative for the district it's one of our 13 activities for two fiscal year 24 which we're currently in right now and uh to kind of get started we're also",

postco um I just have some experience looking at a private data set so it's not a public data set so I don't really know how relevant it is but anecdotally it's kind of interesting I've looked at data sets around commercial buildings um about 16,000 16 million square foot and the difference in occupancy has been drastic you know across Seattle um what Oregon Denver different markets it's gone from you know like average around 80 90% occupancy down to you know at the height of the pandemic and it hasn't really recovered it's it was around 10 to 20% of actual occupancy and that affected the total energy consumption of those buildings by about 20 per which is quite interesting uh so it's not a one toone correlation but it definitely did decrease the intensity of you know the the the energy use intensity of those buildings quite significantly and as I said they still it is still we're still in a post pan pandemic state in in commercial real estate um things have definitely not recovered back to the pandemic levels so just I just thought that might be interesting for folks good thank you for the Insight we appreciate it uh Carrie go ahead good to see you K yeah hi um so first off I also support um setting the targets at the mean since that's the most stringent we're allowed um and that's not all that stringent but my other comment is kind of it's a I'm getting brain stormy on key drivers for targets and thinking about some of the Lessons Learned in Washington and just other things we're trying to accomplish in the region and I'm curious I'm gonna I don't know the answer to this I'm gonna put it in y'all's hands or put it out to the rest of the rack um but how could we consider flexibility in buildings and in the eui Target setting I don't know if that's a possible place to take it into consideration I know it's come up in the working group discussions in Washington as well that when building owners are undertaking you know putting battery storage on their facility or using on-site renewable generation and other things how can they be credited um in their ability to sort of flex their load during peak times and support other kind of goals that Oregon might have with grid modernization and um overall renewable adoption on the power supply side um just putting it out there I don't know the answer thanks Carrie I think that's a great um a great topic for discussion and I think that it's something that we could think about how would that show up potentially I mean it may be something that is very valuable to discuss within the context of this process but then it may or may not be able to be implemented directly here but it could have a lot of value somewhere else or or it could be something that is potentially considered in the overall Ru making in relation to the targets so it'd be really interesting to see kind of um where things go with that in terms of how the rack could potentially what types of things the rack could recommend I just want to acknowledge that we're at time if we wanted to stick with one hour Blake to give you time to go through the three or four other agenda items but before we close oh there is another comment in the chat the only emission reduction requirement in the bill is seek to maximize reductions in greenhouse gas emissions qualitative and not quantitative so it's a good comment yes and that the emissions reductions could be within the larger context of uh the state's goals and how they're trying to use the building performance standards to help meet those um larger goals just a a follow-up question for JP and maybe uh Vin has anything to say too and that is a question about I don't know JP if you're from uh sounds like maybe you're involved with commercial real estate but something I remember um hearing about and actually experiencing with our own office building is you know the lease uh requirements are that buildings have to maintain you know the the HVAC system the operating uh set points and those types of things regardless of whether they're um occupied and um so what I'm interested in is is have you are you seeing as leases are turning over any changes in those um requirements um that could be taken into consideration that maybe we hadn't seen in earlier data and not something we have to like you know get down into in discussion now but um just maybe a quick response and we could follow up offline is the question that is there changes in lease language the specifically yes I haven't actually seen that no it's a really good question though I wonder I wonder if that is happening in in in certain markets but no I I don't have any personal experience with that um I I will just add that you're right that even when there you can have occupied spaces in buildings that are still leased so there's a difference between least occupancy and actual occupancy you know you could have a least space but there's like one person in it or no one in it and you still have to run the agback um and that's why you're not seeing like a one to one ratio of like oh there's exactly you know you still we noticed a dip of about 20% in eui at the height of the pandemic but given that we were at like 10% occupancy um you can see that there's not a one to one ratio there so yeah that's because spaces might be occupied by one or two people you still have to keep the lights on and run the HVAC yeah I don't have anything but yeah that makes sense JP like the 20% reduction you're talking about might be more of a plug load reduction um but that it is making me think of some City owned property that uh was deeply affected by the pandemic and maybe it's not as relevant because the um that's it's I think assembly buildings and um like spectator event kind of buildings and how they have I think now they're back to normal so comparing pre pandemic to now it's probably similar but it does make me think about like how the HVAC systems do actually they're aligned with the actual event um so like we have an older building called the memorial coliseum it's agback system goes back to the 50s and it doesn't operate in the deepest of winter it doesn't operate in summer because the hbac system can't handle it so um it I would do really well on its eui compared to a mean for assembly and then we have another building that is very temperature controlled uh is in frequent use um that has a a very different eui um but one's very efficient and like the building's efficient the hbac system is newish the other one's very inefficient all glass has an HX Sy from the 50s but has a better UI so how do you treat those kinds of yes definitely the the pieces to have in consideration we're looking at that at euis okay Blake I think we can hand it back over to you oh we have a couple more slides um Anna do you want to step forward to yeah we a little bit of takeway yeah a little bit of takeaway and next steps um just a reminder of how we're doing this methodology that we're using those drivers of energy consumption which for the most part are building type and square footage but we have those other drivers as well that we will be looking at and we will be considering um and when you get the slide deck later you know go ahead and take a look at them try to think about what questions you have because the input that you give us is really important for the rest of the entire process and then also remember that all of this input goes into that overall methodology of the target setting so the drivers is just a component and the policy linkage is also important and dependent on you know how those criteria get set all lead to the final Target development that we're going to be working over over the next couple of meetings and the timeline for that just one quick reminder is we're going to be doing that mean eui develop and Target setting this month and next month um with the presentations on that uh both to the rack and to the public in August and September and then moving on throughout the fall towards the final rle making so that's all we have thank you very much for your time and attention and please do let us know what other input you would like to provide to the team uh as we go through this process BL back to you uh yeah thanks thanks so much um for spw and team to go over that methodology and thanks a lot to the rack for all the good comments and discussion there um I thought that was a great overview and something to look forward to you should all have all the rack members should have an invitation for another rack meeting that we've scheduled for August 21st on your calendar now um where we'll kind of come back together and uh implement the methodology that was discussed and actually present the average the mean euis um that that are our starting point for our Targets on on August 21st so um that'll be something to look forward to and we'll definitely be looking for more uh collaborative discussion and comments at that time too and leading up to that meeting um and if you do have any other comments on on today's meeting or anything that was uh discussed feel free to send those to me and I'm happy to to forward those on and relay them on to the to the team too as they're going through their analysis so thanks a lot for everyone for that section so uh now we can kind of um I'll share my screen here and kind of go back to the agenda for today's meeting um so that that covered our our first item eui Target development and the next item that we wanted to to tee up for rack discussion or rack input is this uh concept of energy data aggregation so um we've we've started to let me share the right screen um here we go so we've we've started to kind of get to the the concept of and the scenario where we've got a a building that has multiple meters um you know multiple tenants that control those meters and pay the bills uh for those meters and the the legislation started to consider this sort of a scenario um but then directed it to be part of the rul making so if you look back house build 349",

        "text": " go from there the governor's got a big housing package I know Unice has been keeping an eye on that and we're keeping an eye on on what's going on there and we'll wait to see what does come of that yeah if I can just add some commentary on that bill as well it appears that through the staff has really analyzed that bill and it looks like maybe the most uh interesting parts of that bill won't actually apply to the city it looks like we won't actually be impacted by it so we're uh just look we're just monitoring it this point but it looks like it actually won't apply to us so um in case people ask you about that it looks like it won't apply to the City of Salem based on the criteria that are listed in the bill currently uh we won't meet that criteria so any change to our ugb or potential change to our GB won't even be part of the conversation because we don't it doesn't we don't qualify I wonder too if we just may remember the short session is um sort of it creates crazy pacemaking and um so if you do have questions come to you about the city's position on any bill and it's not coming to you top of Mind do ask because we have a whole um a whole Software System that's traffing bills and staff are entering uh City positions based on the policy statements and conversation here so so I have access to all of that uh really fast so just do reach out if you are asked a question um there's often uh we we make a lot of um more pragmatic decisions about which things we want to weigh in on and which we may not want to so that backstory is all works well if you are um asked to make an opinion and there's so there's a lot of activity around that bill there's other interests that you know are really opposed to that bill there's others that the governor's been working with over the course of the last uh Cy interim um and that will be very complex you you'll hear a lot about that bill coming up you'll also hear about major 110 and some of the impacts and I'm hearing a lot of Buzz around okay how are uh the chambers going to work with each other across the aisle to really uh put some sideboards on major 110 this often times happens with ballot measures right it takes a little time and it takes a few legislative Cycles to get it to where it's right and to where it's working uh hopefully with the goal and objective in mind to get people help and to uh help our communities within those aspects so so just for thep is my notes there's a lot of Buzz around 110 got it so and our position is basically we're not getting into the to the Weeds on 110 we are simply supporting reform great okay and then finally um what we do see here again so it doesn't feel like an exercise INF futility for our staff um everything we see here probably has the potential to resurface in 2025 right so we use it as a little bit of a framework going into how we prep our legislative agenda and how we look at measures that'll probably be coming in the long session in 2025 so even though a lot of these things are throw away or I might say to you hey this probably isn't going to fly just expect to see it again so it doesn't hurt to do a little of the back work and it turns out that's just 12 short months away is that it just geared towards the next 35 along that line just um if if the committee's ever taken a position on a bill we also staff have access to that as well so there's a lot of repeat to your point um ideas and we can go back and pull those statements and of support or opposition as well to to feed more conversation next week and the week after week um the only thing we didn't quite uh talk about is Wes the yeah the do you want to talk a little bit about that that's a commuter rail build it's uh it's a study bill again it is getting a hearing uh the I got a call from the mayor Woodburn yesterday or sometime recently asking me to testify so I will be part of a a series of panels testifying on that bill uh coming up in the next couple weeks so there is some energy behind that it looks like it did get a hearing so that's good sign can I ask an off B question so we were at a meeting last night with um s l kaer Public Schools I know that they are their own thing and doing their own thing but I also know that we're not that we want to support each other is there any do we track anything that would impact education especially s public schools and from a supportive viewpoint does that make any sense uh we don't do that today um and I think we appear open if Salem Kaiser had a request for support they would make one to us and and we would do that but right at this minute we're not tracking all the education related um it's outside of the we we have lovely expertise but not in that field so um so I could follow up with siser directly and make sure that they're aware that we're specifically you're referring to like funding yes yes funding what we want to talk about yeah a lot of times those are how that we don't put the city uh machine behind that kind of effort but it could be like on an individual elected official basis to support an effort um they're looking OB they have the same issue that we have obviously we're kind of tied at the HP that way because they're the Capital School District second largest school district we're the capital city second largest city a lot of similar themes they're um looking mostly at the uh at the just the education funding mechanism which is really totally separate from us uh we can be supportive of their efforts but not like we're not going to put the city machine behind it at this point now at some point we may decide that that's we want to do that but at this point it's not part of our priorities um we don't have a council approved priority to do that but always individual uh elected officials can do what they choose we just need to remember that um there is a pot of money in that building and we are all buying for it and we don't want to uh be buying for it over here while we're buying for it over here because it's just one set of legislators um that have to divy that up and so we just need to be really strategic about how we get so answer your question yeah I know that we're tight at the hip also know that like the asks that are going to create the real change for both of us are huge sure and we should be a united front in making I know that that's like a long-term plan but I want to be a good partner I I do as well yeah yeah great that's all I have Mr all right well thank you uh do we I see we have housing and homelessness and then local Revenue options as discussion points I think we covered those I feel like we did too um I know that those two things were of Interest as well as the measure 110 reform which I think we took care of in policy statements that were approved by Council most recently so I think we're in a good position I just wanted to keep these ideas um at top of Mind as we progress through the next few weeks I know it's not exactly on the called out on the agenda but I would like to just go around each one of these amazing staff members and just hear from them I know they each have a list of bills that they're working on if there's like one or two that that really is kind of peaked your interest or do you think that we ought to be we ought to know about or pay attention to or might be noteworthy um would that be okay it's fine um you could maybe even just talk talk about something that you're intrigued by but you don't have all your all the information lined up yeah you don't need like it doesn't I'm not asking for your expert analysis or whatever but just like hey this is something you might want to pay attention to for example I'm aware that there's a p pass Bill I'm curious about it but I haven't read through all of it so I look forward to doing that and Reporting next week thank you maybe I'm gonna Le on Jason so similar to what was introduced uh last year so it's a it's a basically a stud so basically doing studies and keeping track okay that's a big thing do we want to just kind of go down the maybe we'll just start here uh so I only have one Bild that's been uh that's on my my queue something about um battery storage for renewable energy um actually HED that to Juliana our climate action plan coordinator so she wrote up some information on that this morning I need to read through that um but I I end up getting routed through Public Works and she's on that side of the house so okay that's the only thing thanks uh recreational is really important um that that the law that we have around that is it's been challenged a few years ago and then it was Rewritten and now we're kind of back where it got some legal holds punched in it again so I think that's important just anything around the homelessness issue of course is of course important Justin are you hearing anything on that recreational IMM bill I haven't but I haven't been in that building yet so okay thanks Jason you any else who joined out uh Unice and I are both tracking an SDC bill right us I'm assuming they want to raise the sdcs no probably not they want take housing related so it has to do with u with um municipalities deferring sdc's for developers right so essentially it gives them an extra pot of money to work with when they're putting those housing pieces together and the state or the bill it's house $4.99 is proposing to set aside a pot of money that the state would then in turn buy that debt so wow sorry what do you mean what sorry I was asking because I got the same bill and I was going to ask you if you were going to cover it so oh yeah so it's interesting right so so we would defer the assessment the state would then buy that assess or that deferment from us so it would put it would money then has to be come back to us as sdc's and",

        "text": " infrastructure different types of infrastructure how that energy flows through the energy system and we're able to analyze the risk as it relates to distinct threads this is a very data intense process and for the liquid fuel subsector we were able to secure sufficient data to conduct this technical analysis however given the time constraints of this project for the electricity and natural gas Subs sectors we were not comfortable with the the data that we were able to secure that we could conduct a robust analysis so what we decided to do was pivot and we created what we're calling a hybrid survey and what this does is it gives the utilities the service providers an opportunity to conduct a self assessment that gives us the data points we need to come up with our vulnerability rankings and I'll walk through how we're approaching that so for liquid fuels we did do our technical analysis for all the natural hazards but for natural gas and electricity we used the hybrid survey for um human cause threats because of the nature of these threats we can't create a hazard Zone and so for consistency we use that same hybrid survey approach for the natural Hazard for the human cause threats across all three of the sub sectors and so this is how we approached the analysis whether it was through the technical analysis or the hybrid survey we divided our types of information in four categories we start with exposure so this is looking at historical events future projections simulations a combination of those depends on the threat and what type of data is available and through that we're considering the assets that are exposed and how frequently they're exposed to that threat for sensitivity we're looking at the inherent qualities of the assets that would inform us as to how they would be affected by different threats and we're just looking at how many of these system elements are sensitive to a given thread then for potential impact we want to understand the customers impacted and the time it takes to restore service and for adaptive capacity we're looking at a collection of different measures whether they be physical or operational we are using operational in a very broad sense here and then we also considered the maturity of the implementation of those measures and so we can simplify these categories down into a raing system where each category gets its own score falling somewhere between zero and three we simply add those values up and that gives us our overall vulnerability ranking so in a scenario such as this one we have high exposure so we have a score of three High sensitivity which gives us a score of one high potential impact a score of three and then very high adaptive capacity and here the scoring is inverse so we get a score of zero this means in this case um for this region a great measures they've gone to Great measures to adapt to a given threat so we simply add these together and it gives us a total of seven which would fall into the moderate level of vulnerability so with that you guys have an overview of what's going on how we're approaching it and the different um approaches we're taking for the actual risk assessment the next half of our time together is going to be spent with you guys is really giving us a lot of feedback and so again if you haven't connected to SPO please do so um if you need a hard copy in the room U you can take a moment to do that we're going to take about five minutes for everybody to do whatever they need to do or connect to slido and then whenever we come back we're going to start um participating in the engagement through the slider e e can you guys yes but now it's a bad Echo technical difficulties everyone we'll get figure it out okay can you hear online Ronda said take just still get yeah just and by okay I'll just keep talking so it's not no surprise to there we go so it's no surprise to us that there's more fuel storage near population centers and that's what I just wanted to um note on on this slide but sp15 67 does ask us to look specifically at publicly owned um facilities so we're talking about OD do um local airports um gas motor pools and those kinds of locations and so when we're only looking at public facilities then the storage capacity of course gets significantly and um we're talking about now less than um 1.3 million gallons of storage capacity and it's no surprise to us that the private sector owns most of the storage so um and we only have like 222 tanks but we're looking at Public Utilities but earlier this month we met with ODOT Department of administrative Services parks and W Corrections Aviation all those folks that own and operate their own fuel sites and right now they are assessing their sites and looking to see if there's a strategic location where they could actually increase fuel storage again not to replace the fuel Hub these are small amounts of fuel so that we would have extra on hand for emergency response um purposes and at this point you know we do want to come up with a short list for legislators to consider and there is no current plan right now for a funding source to um for this work but that right now our Target is just to get a short list for legislators to can consider and then I don't know if you can tell from this map but the I5 fordor and West you know we all seen these Maps before this is the most uh impacted area towards the coast and so perhaps those locations might not be the best options for increasing fuel storage but we're looking at the Cascades um region here and so uh looking pretty good for possibility to increase fuel storage but even though Studies have shown that the Cascades region won't be uh impacted directly you're going to get extended power outages and you're going to experience fuel shortages so you know we're looking at locations that have adequate backup power or ability to put in backup power so here are your locations and I I think our question to you all in the region is do you have locations that have adequate backup power um that you might want to consider increasing fuel storage and if you do you're going to get an opportunity here in a short while to say yes I do and then our agency will reach back out to you and begin those talks and just want everybody here to understand that whatever locations are being considered will be evaluated against our risk analysis results against dogami um science made criteria with the islanding that we're talking about with the state will look like after a Cascadia event um and then I do want to also say that don't we're not ruling out any location because while we're planning for the worst case Oregon experiences winter storms often Southern Oregon is cut off from the supply chain for a little while so you know whatever Mak makes sense um whatever you think is a good site just let us know we can just vet it and and put it through the criteria we have established criteria for fuel points of distribution for a Cascadia event that FEMA help us put together and that's you know so we have that list of criteria as well so again we're going to evaluate each location and when we get to that short list we're going to be meeting with communities as well because um there might be added health or environmental risk and we want to make sure that they get to avoid their concerns and we're asking them to bear this additional risk on behalf of preparedness and disaster resilience so um that's where we're at right now are there any questions about 1567 all right then I'm GNA turn it over to KY yeah so this is your first chance to communicate with us by a slid out so U we're just wanting to know if you're interested in G with Odo to work on efforts to increase F storage capacity please tell us yes or no if you are filling it out in the room handwritten please make sure that your contact information is on them so that if you do want Odo to follow with you they have a way to do so so what we're going to do now is move in to preliminary feedback or preliminary results and we're going to have a rhythm them to our correspondents now so we're going to start with stakeholder engagement feedback and I will let you guys know who has been giving us this information what they've been telling us what their feedback is and then we'll do a quick checkin from there we're going to move on to our preliminary results for the actual risk assessment and this will be divided across the three sub sectors so electricity natural gas and liquid fuels and we'll follow this same series of content so we'll start with who's engaging with us um give you that those overall vulnerability rankings in the form of a matrix I'll dig into adaptive capacity a little bit to highlight some of the nuances in the data and then we'll do a quick checkin and then finally we'll get into the risk mitigation measures here we've divided it across four categories one is all systems so very high level approach that could apply to any sub sector and then we'll go through each of the sub sectors electricity natural gas and liquid fuels and here we'll probably spend more time with you guys giving us feedback than me speaking to you and so I'll tee up the risk mitigation measures and then our efforts are really focused on you guys telling us how you want them prioritized and so this is the stage that people have found a bit cumbersome on their devices prioritizing them you're dragging and dropping so you're welcome to use the hard copies in the room if you don't have a laptop so let's Dive Right In to stakeholder engagement first who has been giving us information we have 14 44 folks um total that have have been participating thus far their distribution across the state is summarized in the map on the left so each of these circles are sized by the number of respondents they're colorcoded by the region that they're located in you can see that Portland metro and wamit Valley tend to high have the highest representation but we have had responses from across um all six of the regions in the top right you can see that the majority of folks are from the government that's the big yellow box and then we also have a good number from private sector and consumer owned utilities those are the blue boxes in the middle and then a number of nonprofits and and some other categories as well and to our knowledge 15% of the folks who have engaged with us thus far do have some association with environmental justice issues so what have we been asking folks well as I mentioned before one of our primary um pieces of information that we're trying to understand is threats and so this map summarizes the types of threats and the",

is quite important for the notice of intent and it's a part of our Outreach with the reviewing agencies and the special advisory groups as they have the local knowledge of the resources so we're

process doesn't cover doesn't require an evaluation of um so this is why you really need to understand the applicable requirements and this process and whether your issue or your concern is connected

standard or the requirement you believe that issue is connected to for example if you're concerned that one of the routes might impact your farming operation or your farming practices if you could explain how you believe that the project the sighting the construction or operation would impact your farming practice please provide enough information to support that so we can figure out how we can incorporate that in and all comments are provided to the applicant they're made publicly on the comment portal but it's as the the more clear and detailed you can be the better ability we enough can have in evaluating those concerns and considering scoping of an environmental impact assessment or even okay and then the next slide please I'll just briefly cover our complicated land use standard and process as Kate had mentioned there are 16 standards or regulatory requirements that are those of the energy facility citing Council and that every developer seeking a site certificate has to evaluate and demonstrate compliance in order to get approval of the site one of those standards is the land use standard and this is the standard where we're in what we incorporate all of the applicable requirements from the affected local jurisdictions or from the city of Medford and Jackson County we would incorporate that applicable local criteria into the process and Duty evaluation so in our process it's a little unique where our rules allow a developer to say I'd rather go to the county for this land use review they can choose to do that and then bring that review and potentially approval through our process we haven't yet had a developer choose that option to date and for this project the applicant has maintained the land use review through the state process although they have until the time they submit the application to change their minds should they choose to do that um of Interest this facility is proposed to cross numerous zones Zone districts and overly districts you have two jurisdictions City of Medford Jackson um with all of these different zones districts overlays there's numerous requirements that will have to be evaluated which is why we're really intending to work closely with the city and county to make sure that evaluation adequate accurate and consistent with how they might do things here and with that I will hand it back over to Kate to give some details about the proposed facility thank you very much so I have a couple more slides and then I am going to turn it over to the project work moment so okay we're on the right side so as you all know if you're here in the meeting we did as we noted received the notice of intent on April 27th there are two proposed drought Alternatives in that notice of intent proponent specific power has indicated while they have two identified routes in their notice of intent their intent is to construct one of those rounds so we have the West alternative which is approximately 10 miles long and an East alternative which is approximately 12.1 miles long next slide and you may be familiar with this map and we do realize that uh due to the size of the format and also trying to incorporate 12 miles in in a graphic is difficult on the detail level but the orange line is the West alternative route and the purple line is the East alternative route as you can see one is closer to the City of Medford the other one is closer to what is the community of White City and the intent is to connect the line between the existing substation in Lone Pine to the existing substation in and it's a 230 KV proposed line which again is part of the reason why it falls into our review and jurisdiction by our Council next slide so we have two identified routes those proposed corridors are subject to change part of the public comment process and the scoping that the applicant is doing is to inform their final decision and determination of what those corridors might be if they decide to move forward and submit an application they can submit a modified and the applicant must consider public comments and selecting that Corridor and justifying it in their application an applicant for a site certificate for what is a jurisdictional transmission line must provide a corridor assessment as part of their application and as I noted they do have the ability to to make some tweaks and changes in that proposed route so if you're interested in this project and the potential for its design and final groups route proposal it would be imperative to to pay attention and provide input and and sign up for our update so you can find out when we get an application and when the Project's information comes up and I will lead at this point I am going to stop and I am going to introduce John let him talk a little bit about specific power in their proposal and their notice of intent and then when he's done I'll give a little bit more background on on how to provide comment we're going to open it up for public comment and questions and then we'll we'll take it from there and there's some more information I'll provide but welcome John thanks am I close enough can everybody hear me yeah my name is John anello I work for Pacific War we have from Pacific Court here tonight Cooper who is our regional business manager and uh the construction project manager who um where the line ends up being located he'll be out actually on the ground during construction a lot of the time and his name's Dave schober he's sitting over there we also have an army of support from Power Engineers there are Consultants on the project they are helping us gather all the information that what you just were presented on that F6 is going to require for us to justify the existence of the line as far as the impacts that it has on the um go ahead next slide we're a public utility so as a public utility we're required to serve the public we're required to serve the grid and deliver electricity safely and consistently throughout our service and because of the requirements we have planning guidance that are called transmission planning requirements and they come from uh Weck the Western Energy coordinating Council they give us issues and say if this substation were to be brought offline for whatever reason could you continue could you consistently serve power to your community if this transmission line were accidentally knocked off service could you consistently serve power if the answer to those questions is no we are required to come up with some way to serve power in the event of loss of whatever it is that they have asked us uh about the losses of again substations Transformers transmission lines so this project is a requirement because the current system down here if we lost one of our two substations or try Transformers in the substations or the lines that are go between those substations we could not serve the community and so in order to make sure that we can consistently serve the community this is a requirement we have to do something and the project that we've developed is this development of a new 230 line between these two Souls thanks you guys have already seen that there are two routes uh the East and the West um we've done tabletop studies to try to find the least impactful routes that we could offer to the f-sec process as you can imagine there is no route we can come up with that doesn't have impacts there's no routes that don't impact some property or owner or other but we do the best we can to try our best to minimize them and then through the f-sec process we're required to show that we've minimized or met mitigation requirements for the impacts that we still have um this is just a quick slide in case uh people are interested again our power is from the generator through the transmission lines it'll come through transmission substations and get dropped down in voltages that goes down to the community you'll have substations that are in your neighborhoods they drop the power further down and they run on distribution lines to your arm for this project both routes are going to have a variety of different structure types the most common structure type will be what we call the h-frame you can see it's kind of a letter H that's the two wooden holes with the X brace in between them um those are going to range up to about 80 or 90 feet high we have monopole structures and what we have a representation of is a monopole that has only one set of lines on it there is a section on the Eastern route that is called a double circuit the double circuit is going to be a Recon so there's an existing 115 kV line out there that line will be removed and replaced with a line that has 115 KV on one side of the structure and 230 KV on the other side so that structure will be a single pole but there'll be six wires on it instead of three um we've already she's already kind of touched",

        "text": " okay please come come up have a seat speak into it good evening I'm Phil Brady and live in the Dallas Oregon and I am a wasow county commissioner so y got a couple question questions first uh as a comment I find it interesting and a good thing actually that the applicant kind of drops out of the process or takes a backseat to the process in that latter half and why I would say that as a good thing is um from the public understanding it's you know the it's now the uh OD representing the applicant to the FSC and so it's not like the applicants can't push in there am I is that the way it's designed am I over interpreting this take okay all right I'm going to do my best and if I am wrong Todd will quickly correct me but we are we are support staff for the council so our role is not to represent the applicant it's really to give an objective review of the application and whether or not it meets Council standards and that is our role from Once the application is submitted the compl application is submitted then our role is to do that evaluation and prepare that information for Council I guess what I would want to clarify is we're not there to represent the applicant from that process on they have their role as well would they have a role in in later during like the proposed order and the contested case when we go to the public hearing on the draft proposed order There's an opportunity for the app to make comments at that public hearing after the public has commented and they can also respond to comments that are made in that public hearing and then if it goes to contested case there's also a role okay got a couple more questions I'm not Jing here but um so so as Wasco County Commissioner we will be part of this special Advisory Group yes is it our turn to participate stay with that slide this is it our turn to participate in the public hearing there in the middle block you can but also as a as a special Advisory Group you're in those little kind of blue green boxes at the bottom you have we have a responsibility and a role to coordinate with you through out that process and you can provide us comments as you see fit it is important though if you have an issue that you might want to pursue through a contested case that you make those comments on the record of the draft proposed order in that order in noticing that we did get notice today so we're we're on that okay and following up and this was can I can I respond a little bit to that one as well just because it's I think it's important so you know at the notice of intent stage which is where we're at right now is we're seeking public comment you know and that includes agencies um so the the one slide which had kind of the Bull's eyes with the study area and Analysis area this is also something that you know the county um can be very valuable at because you have you know a good geographic information system you know the maps you know the issues out there you could say look your sort of predetermined area for this resource is a half a mile we think you should go beyond that or you know as Kate said can either increase those or Shrink those based upon information that we get on the record but that's what's helpful for us to know what else is out there is there anything that we're not aware of that we could be missing so so sort of at the notice of intend stage you know we're going to be like okay what's what are your land use requirements what are we what do we need to include in the project order from the county then when we're reviewing the preliminary application we want to know from the county they submitted all this information about the local land use ordinances did they get it right is it complete is it not complete and then when we get to the point where we're writing the draft proposed order which is functionally like a staff report it's you know we're looking at the the the project against the standards we want your input as well particularly on the the the L the local land use ordinances to say not only did we have the right list of them but are we evaluating it properly how would you evaluate it if you were doing the review we want your input to make sure that we're getting that right are we putting the right conditions on are we interpreting things correctly that's where we want the County's input you can certainly participate you know kind of Beyond if you don't like what we did if you don't agree with what we did you can provide comments on the draft proposed order you can participate in the contested case but prior to that where we really really need you to help us so let me clarify I and clarify for the sake of the public too so when you say the county I'm thinking of two kinds of things one is are very capable planning department and codes enforcement department and so that they and and for example if this was located a little some slightly different land that would include all the scenic area codes that the county would would be applying because that's what they do but another meaning of the county is the public the people in the County so I could imagine people would come to county commissioner and say hey this is what I think and is that also a route that you invite people to make participate you know the you know a citizen's input being drawn through come through the county or would you pre prefer that to happen at the public hearing or both uh we certainly don't have any preference so if the if the citizens of the county want to Lobby you know you as County Commissioners to provide comment on the record they are you know more than willing to do that or more than able to do that and you you can pursue those as well they can also submit comments through our public comment time frame okay so that's really kind of a local how how the local process is going to work good um does in order to have standings at a contested case does the issue to be contested have to be an issue that is raised previously or can you raise one issue and then learn something and contest something else sure yeah I didn't expect it yeah I mean the the short answer is it has to be raised at the draft proposed order stage so we will um provide a notice um that the draft proposed order has been issued and that time frame which will include an open public comment time frame and a public hearing you know could be here could be in the Dallas but in the vicinity of the project um you know whether it's a oral comment or a written comment that would have to be made within that comment time frame and it's raise it or wave it so you can't then later on um try to participate in the contest a case on an issue you didn't raise it has to be raised during that time frame and it has to be related to a council standard so the standards that we included and it has to be sufficiently specific enough that between the draft proposed order stage and the proposed order stage we can evaluate it you know it can't just be a placeholder you know we don't think you met this it has to be why and that then gives us the staff the opportunity to make changes between the draft proposed order and the proposed order it gives the applicant an opportunity to respond and provide new information in the record and it also allows the council to evaluate that when they're reviewing the draft proposed order and providing feedback to staff so thank you raise it or wave it at the draft proposed order stage I have two more questions but this is for the team here okay thank you very much um first question is so the tie ends the genti will be at 270 uh 230 kilol line what does that look like is that a wooden Pole or is that a bigger power bigger Tower uh they'll either be wooden poles or steel poles okay but it's not it's not the big ones it's the typical ones we have no you're not to see like the big lattice types tow is what you're referring to right that's what I want to clarify since you and then this is kind of a personal question if I can U since you're working in Texas how does Oregon's permitting process compare to Texas which I understand is kind of like Anarchy I guess I wouldn't characterize as Texas's permitting um as Anarchy I would characterize it as sort of ultimate local control for example the project that we're um under construction on now it just achieved mechanical completion meaning it it looks like it's going to look uh we're just sort of tightening bolts and and getting ready to energize um that one was a letter from the judge that said go forth and prosper um so uh you know there's there's a reason folks tend to start their developments in Texas um when when they a new independent power producer you tend to be able to move faster the interconnection process with the utilities is still challenging and and and slow U but permitting is is usually not the the largest hurdle operating there and I mean I think with the organ FC um being a standards based highly procedural process with you know a a a known course of action and responsibilities um yes it's lengthy um and and expensive but ultimately I think it you know provides a ton of opportuni for public input um for the developers to uh respond to that that input and work with the approving agencies and ultimately the the the council um to hopefully get to a successful outcome so um advantages to each um I think that uh those are definitely bookends though yeah wow so we have a lot of good protections here thank you thank you is there anyone else in the room that wants to ask a question or make a comment and if not we'll move on to the webinar and while Nancy's doing that I'll just say we're happy you know once we're kind of concluded and we're starting to wrap up if anybody wants to stick around and ask any individual questions to to Kate or or myself or or the applicant team we'll be around as well to answer any questions you have all right well at this time I don't see any hands raised but let me just remind everyone who is participating online how they would go about raising a question or making a comment so um if you are on the webinar you're going to go ahead and look at the bottom of the main window on the right and there's a set of icons click on the participants and that will raise your hand there's a little hand icon so that",

        "text": " of these work activities up and down the west coast and some of the benefits of supporting or some of the benefits of that port diversification would be you know they were raised here on the side diversifying risk optimizing costs distribute the economic development benefits too so maybe more jobs in different spots coordination of multiple ports in different states you know if it did get kind of distributed more there would need to be a lot of coordination um that was some of the feedback we heard um we've heard some interest i think communities up in the puget sound area who could potentially do this work oregon communities of course um and there could be existing regional bodies that could take on a coordination the nexus of the location and the grid interconnection which is kind of more of an energy component like where the cables come me meet the onshore grid um you know we just asked if there could be any synergies there and we got a lot of feedback saying that there wouldn't wouldn't expect it to be any um and the interconnection could occur away from ports um where away from where the developments of the o m services could be deployed from so and then when we're looking at sea vessels here's an illustration that kind of shows the scale of some of these designs for floating platforms and how they can be delivered to ports for assembly with turbine structure good good kind of visual just to kind of level set everybody on what we're talking about um so vessels capable of supporting the transportation of these components um they have relatively unique shapes and sizes we would likely require specialized vessels definitely hurt feedback supporting that global supply chain is currently limited with these vessels just as you would expect not a lot of demand for for these specialized vessels and then there's also jones act considerations people are curious about it's a u.s maritime law that requires vessels transporting merchandise between two u.s points to be u.s flag meaning the vessel must be registered under u.s laws and so this requirement could apply to vessels transporting wind turbine blades for example or or floating platforms um and from what i've gathered there's a relatively limited number of these that said there was feedback from a few folks on the development pipeline for these specialized vessels and the orders have been placed you know to kind of keep up with the demand seen in europe and other parts of the country out on the east coast shipping routes and port access floating offshore wind could cause port congestion that was flagged as a potential area of arizona potential it was an area of concern that was flagged for potential study there's a us coast guard studying the west coast vessel traffic and port so that could help get a better understanding of that and then there was also feedback that kind of talked about how that could be worked around you know different schedules for different vessel traffic the us coast guard study was interesting i looked into that a little bit more it is not solely related to offshore wind but it's it's on the list of motivations for the study and some of the other motivations were just increases in shipping traffic generally and larger vessels that have accommodation constraints so there's a trend in the shipping industry for larger vessels and then also um that coast guard study cited forecasts for increasing increased development of aquaculture farms marine sanctuaries potential lng export terminals all in addition to the potential for offshore wind developments as well so lots of different motivations that kind of have a nexus with some of the themes we talked about today citing and permitting and marine ecosystems and aquaculture and other energy considerations so that u.s coast guard study i'm not sure when the timing that is but i'm going to keep my eyes out for that that would be helpful and then you know hopefully that wasn't too high level but we got a lot of feedback on this topic and we're hoping to hear a little more i'll turn it to ruchi and i can also um you know we're kind of experimenting here but if it's helpful to stay on this to get the keep the mind on the topic and recap then i'll leave it here maybe i'll i'll turn it back here for a um so here's the time to sort of um think about if you have additional input if you have um other information or perspectives that might differ from the themes and and kind of the the common feedback that that jason synthesized if you have some elaboration on a certain point that he made or wanted to emphasize a point related to port infrastructure and sea vessels um if you have ideas for future studio engagement on this topic or new thoughts and then you can go to the next slide and i'll paste these um into the chat as well so you can see them and here's the summary of the themes that he went over a reminder for those of you on the phone that you can hit star three to raise your hand and then when we call on you you can hit star six to unmute uh yourself just checking the chat here i see there's a comment from janet that i'll read out loud coos bay has very fine sediments channel deepening and widening would adversely impact the estuary the state has already said that the coos bay estuary management plan needs to be updated to comply with the coastal zone management act but coos county has dropped the ball on that is what janet will these projects comply with the czma also the state has already made it clear they don't support channel modification projects and has pulled funding the permitting process has been paused for a long time thanks for that um comment and question i welcome any of the um partners and other organizations that we have on the line to respond if you'd like otherwise we'll definitely note this um comment down yeah richie this is andy i'll just respond to that by saying that this is not a topic that i'm a specialist on so i would need to confer with my colleagues within dlcd who have been working with coos bay and following the estuary management plan update so it's something i'm happy to investigate and get back to you on thanks andy janet if you are comfortable putting your contact information in the chat or emailing andy directly it sounds like he might have some follow-up that could be helpful for your question richie this is representative brock go ahead i didn't hear all of the all of the question or comment and i apologize but uh as far as the channel deepening um i might i believe that we were in securing the 15 million in this last session and in the last friday to go towards that project and in the matching federal to match the federal um i'll just add uh representative rocksmith um the question was from janet it's in the chat if you want to look at it but the um specifics were uh talking about coos bay having very fine sediments and channel deepening and widening would adversely attack the um and then the real question was around sort of whether projects would need to comply with czma and um so you can you can kind of see those other details in there if you'd like thank you jason i think another screen just popped up unfortunately um okay there's another question here from kathy can turbines be assembled along the columbia willamette like in portland and barged or shipped um jason has your literature review um suggested an answer to that otherwise i'd open it up to any of the other state um or other organizations on the line that we're consulting with on this too yeah i can take a a quick shot at that from what i understand um there's bridges and and those have height and i'm not sure you know how far back they come i think i think they start out pretty much down by astoria um and so those are kind of a limiting factor there but other pieces could um get built and transported just that assembly once you were to attach like the tower um that kind of restricts your ability to move it move it from that point to get underneath the bridges all right thanks jason thanks kathy check to see if there's any hand raised while questions or comments continue to come in from the chat um not seeing any hand raised yet but i do see a question from mike in the chat the process of environmental review for citing and leasing without first conducting a programmatic eis is contrary to all other agencies um his first comment it leaves open the question of environmental and economic impacts until the final stage of the process by which point developers may have invested millions further for fishermen and ngos it creates a black hole of knowledge about what to expect for protected or esa species and continuing viability for a large portion of the seafood industry thanks for that comment mike see another um comment in the chat from david brings up a good question at what point in the i think construction is the tower placed on the platform at a moored location or before i think i think there could be very variations to that um and that's just just from what i know i don't know if we have any developers on the phone that might be able to answer that um but as i understand it you know it's just kind of where does it make sense to do that most economically and efficiently well i just if i can add jason it also um it's one of the economic benefits to the region and the in the construction and the jobs associated with the construction of the of the uh the turbines down here that's a great point thank you for that um andy just in case you didn't see it it looks like janet put her um contact information in there about the planning department and dlcd grant deadline i'm not sure if anyone from um the ports or any of the ports are on the line but you're welcome to sort of raise your hand or add to the chat if you have some more specific knowledge about some of these themes from the comments based on your experience working um with a port in oregon checking to see if we have any raised so a bit of a pause here i'm not seeing any raised hands any more questions or comments in the chat that are of interest to share out um just a reminder on some of the prompts that we have on these themes if there's information or perspectives that differ from the the themes that we've seen from comments so far if there's elaboration or emphasis on a different aspect of one of these comments or if you have ideas for future study or engagement based on some of these or you know just some new thoughts that aren't here oh i do see",

        "text": " it can certainly be used for on the ground investments in energy efficiency type programs there are some limitations that are specific to that to that program um but it is perhaps i i think one of the broader applications of of the funding that we see before us as an opportunity under the infrastructure investment and jobs act so i'm i'm happy to follow up with some more detailed information about that but the the list of authorized program activities is quite long all right thank you jen um i think we've addressed most of the questions and feel free to keep them coming in chat um but in the meantime i will turn it back to you to go to the next slide and just as another note um overall the act includes nearly 100 billion dollars for additional funding for infrastructure projects and some of these um are items that we are hearing about from other agencies and other entities that may be eligible to apply or are starting to think about preparing their applications and so these are just some of the opportunities that are presented to to folks that are available under the infrastructure investment and jobs act as you can see there's there's quite a few of them ranging from carbon capture to hydrogen commercialization and deployment as well as programs for smart manufacturing technology and energy codes so moving on to the community engagement that we've conducted so far we've had a few discussions already with our energy advisory work group and the managers of the community-owned utilities and some community-based organizations we've reached out to tribal governments and are scheduling some following follow-up conversations in those areas we had one specific meeting on workforce development which was a priority that we heard coming out of our energy advisory work group meeting in the future we want to gather feedback using the portal so that we can create these guiding priorities that we can broadly apply to many of the funding opportunities under the infrastructure investment and jobs act to the full extent practical recognizing that federal requirements may restrict the uses of some of some of these funds and as far as our future plans we also are planning to convene stakeholders interested in participating in a clean hydrogen hub application with washington and as i mentioned earlier we will have a public hearing on the grid resilience funding later this summer so some of the examples of where we may be able to shape our proposals include focusing on certain opportunities for example we may be able to invest some funds state and statewide activities such as commissioning research or studies or we could use some of the funds for community level planning or or projects that would enable us for example under the the research and studies to potentially do a transmission study to help with renewable energy or funding if it was a community level program funding energy upgrades for public buildings or assisting with rebates for certain energy efficiency appliances however there's likely not going to be enough money to do everything that we desire so we have to set some priorities as to how we use these funds and as you can see um in some cases customer facing programs may be available as well and that could range the gamut of types of programs that are available from energy efficiency programs that affect homes and businesses to renewable energy programs that look at homes businesses and communities or um personal or community transportation programs to address some of our transportation needs that are energy related and potentially other topics if you happen to come across ideas then and think that that's something that we should be considering we'd love to hear about it this is a great time to to get your ideas in front of us so that as these opportunities move forward we'll have um all of the ideas from from the state that we can out of all those conversations that we've had and we've heard quite a few things so far we've heard about a greater need for workforce development and energy related occupations and that ranges from everything from the skilled trades specific automotive technician we've also heard that there is a strong interest in increasing diversity equity inclusion in many of these areas and we've heard about some specific promising programs in certain areas of the state but that overall there's a great need in order to meet the employer demands not only of the present but potentially of the future we've also heard about a desire to shore up some of the supply chain issues that impair abilities to to facilitate some of the infrastructure projects on the ground we've also heard about a desire to increase resilience efforts which includes both the large grid and the community level forms of of resilience undergrounding power lines is of particular interest to some of our utility partners lastly we've heard an interest in programs that benefit renters as opposed to homeowners who've long had the benefits of energy of different types of energy programs and incentives and so we're also looking into the possibility of energy system navigation support that could help both communities and individuals or understand different aspects of our energy system ranging from transmission capacity to the different incentives that may be available in a particular region and also a desire for technical assistance to assist with applying for the funding opportunities and we're we have that in mind as there's a strong desire simplifying the funding process wherever we can so based on what we've shared are there any topics issues or pathways missing from the previous slides and i believe we'll be starting a poll on that question just to get your initial response and feedback from that so just as a reminder you should see the poll up on the right side of your screen and this time we're not asking you to check a box but actually type in a sentence or two or a list or some words in response to the question are there any topics issues or pathways missing from the types of federal funding available and or the previously identified interest areas we'll give you about another 30 seconds to fill this and remember if you want more time can't figure out this polling stuff on webex you can definitely jump on over to our website and respond in our portal and finally after you type your answer don't forget to press the green send we'll leave it open for just a little while longer because i see people are still entering responses thanks so much to those of you who put it who are putting in your answers i can see people are still entering them so we don't want to rush you we'll hold it open for just a bit all right i'm going to give folks a 20 second warning so wrap up whatever you're writing and don't forget to press send great well um thank you to everyone who took the time to respond looks like we got a lot of good ideas here about resilience distributed energy resources smart panels energy safety opportunities for bipot contractors water infrastructure help with tribal project facilitation a lot of good responses here um so thank you so much we'll be collecting all of these uh to inform our efforts um and now i think jen do you want to talk about the next question the next poll yes so our next question for everyone is the second part which is what is the most important thing that odo could invest in to support your energy needs and interests basically want to boil it down to if there was just one thing what is it that you would like to see and we'll go ahead and keep this one open for about a minute or a minute and a half all right let's give about another 30 seconds to put in your responses i see them still coming in thank you okay wrap up what you are writing we'll close the poll in 10 seconds super thank you again a lot of really great comments in here increased training for journeyman alignment willing to work in rural areas projects that support wildfire risk reduction and overall resilience loans and incentives to support residential and multi-family buildings especially heat pumps small hydroelectric renewable generation energy efficiency rural communities great stuff here thanks everyone back to you jen all right so some of you may be wondering why we're having this conversation now especially with so many questions that that linger well um in this case it's mostly about helping us be ready we anticipate that most federal grant opportunities we we won't know exactly the date when the full announcement will be made and we often won't know the full details until that announcement is made but once it does we'll likely only have about 60 days to respond with a full application in some cases it may be as low as 40 and unfortunately that's that's not business days it's a straight up calendar day so it's a pretty short time frame for us and so in in that kind of framework we're expecting that um we may have very detailed information that needs to be compiled in a very short application and we're also anticipating that some of the more flexible funds the ones where your input can shape our plans the most within the confines of the federal rules and regulations may be some of the first opportunities that are released and so we want to be ready for those opportunities that will benefit oregon as soon as we can by collecting your at this point in time and so as we go through this this uh graphic here shows that well 60 days may sound like a long time in the scope of preparing a federal grant it can go by in a blink each grant application basically has three phases one phase where we internally need to review all of the technical requirements about the allowable activities and the spending limits and all of those rules and regulations that that are set um to both fulfill the direction of congress but also make sure that we are using the funds in an accountable and responsible way and so that gives us a short amount of time to make a decision on whether or not we should move forward with a go decision or a no-go decision from from our management in preparing for the in the second phase we go through the drafting of that which is where we develop whatever the project plan may be the narrative parses pieces of the application and whatever projected metrics or impact outcomes may be required as as part of that application to the federal government this is also where we begin drafting the budget in conjunction with what our plans may be and in the short phase there's often multiple rounds of in the final phase is when we seek our legislative authorities in order to proceed for the grant application because our legislature may not always be in session we can we can access this approval through the joint ways and means committee or the state emergency board and there are various processes that we can use to reach that authority and in order to be able to submit this grant and seek additional approval for additional positions that may be necessary or additional spending so if you're wondering how this fits into our overall agency budget it's rather through this emergency process that we're able to apply for these funds outside of",

topics that jump out to you that should certainly be on our list and i think we'll give folks about a minute and a half to enter your responses here and as a reminder if you are feeling pressed for time or you want to think about it more you can feel free to respond to these same questions on our portal on our website okay let's keep it open for about 30 more seconds so people can enter their short responses okay you've got about 10 more seconds to finish your response and press send and stacy go ahead and close the bowl all right thank you we've got some really good responses here aligning and combining with existing promoting these wins for oregon as we finish the projects maximizing climate and environmental justice benefits large building systems maintenance and replacement program concerned about permitting assessment work that will delay projects um encouraging us to advocate for expedited timelines great yep thanks so much really appreciate this feedback okay and with that we actually have a secondary question which is what is the most important thing that odo could invest in to support your energy needs and interests so once again just looking for a short answer that can give us some real time feedback and we'll have this open for about a minute and a half as well but renat is saying the pull didn't open um maybe try popping it out the little square with an arrow coming out of it to the right i think that worked for tim last time and if you can't get it to open renata you're welcome to put in the chat what you think is the most important thing that odo could invest in okay jen should we give them a 10 second okay wrap up what you're writing and we're going to close out the okay we've got some good priorities in there multimodal transportation to support communities investments that our win-win helping companies accelerate their internal decarbonization efforts apprenticeship programs augment the community renewable energy program funding with an eye towards combining resilience and disaster preparedness from a clean energy battery storage efficiency all really for this federal funding thank you for all right so some of you might be wondering why we're having this conversation now why not wait until we have all of the specific details about each federal funding opportunity when they well it's mostly about helping us be ready we anticipate that with most federal grant opportunities we won't know the exact date when the announcement will be made but once it does we anticipate that we'll likely have 60 calendar days to respond with a full application even then it's possible that some technical details about the fund could be modified even within that short application period we are also anticipating that some of our most flexible funds the ones where your input can help shape our plans the within the confines of the federal rules might be among the first opportunities that are released and so we want to be able to respond with the opportunities we believe will um benefit most oregonians in in the biggest way and so that's why we're we're seeking your input today now while 60 days may sound like a long time in the scope of preparing a federal grant it can go by in a blink each grant application basically has three phases one phase where we need to review all the technical requirements and documents to apply to determine if we should move forward on an application the second phase is where the planning scoping budgeting and writing all occurs and um the drafting happens all at once and in the final phase is where we need to run it through and make sure that the documents are all in their final form with proofreading and final executive but this is also where our approval process through the legislative process occurs by notifying the joint ways and means committee or the e-board and if they happen to be in session presenting before then if they aren't in session it has happens through a retroactive letter where we later go and seek approval before the you might be wondering how this also fits into our agency's larger budget which we at odo have been working on within the last few months because the funds uh these funds are difficult to accurately predict and they are not yet awarded or they are um because of that reason they're not yet accounted for in our next agency budget for the next budget biennium that that starts on july 1st 2023 the approval for receiving and expending funds will most likely be granted through those e-board meetings and all of this typically happens in just 40 to 60 calendar days after taking out weekends and holidays you can see how quickly the entire process needs to needs to move and so it's that scheduling challenge of why we're asking for your input today to help us build these guiding priorities we want to hear your thoughts early and broadly so we can plan accordingly for the needs of the state now here we have a chart that describes the different opportunities and odo's ability to direct the scope of work based on our estimation some funds allow for broader flexibility and require very specific and others require very specific types of investments for example the state energy program allows for broad activities such as energy education and planning energy efficiency programs renewable energy programs and transportation initiatives in contrast the energy efficiency revolving loan fund will only permit funds to be used for specific types of energy audits and the subsequent upgrades to buildings recommended by those audits as you can see there's many unknowns uh that we're watching closely as more information becomes available we also have in this chart uh quick little ideas of where we estimate these funds to be and the scale of their flexibility as well as their potential size we are certainly watching all of those unknown boxes as the information continues to be released from the u.s department of so with that um i will pause to see if there are any additional questions jen there is a question in the chat is there a role for businesses or business groups to review opportunities and encourage oregon or oregon communities to apply for them and i would i can start with that which yes we plan to promote these opportunities and make businesses and consumers and other interested parties aware of them and and seek feedback on them as much as possible but as jen said some of them may come up very quickly it may not be super transparent to us from the federal level so that's why we're trying to get a better sense of in case we do have to do some quick turnaround decisions but i think the short answer to your question is yes we want to hear very much want to hear what folks think about the opportunities perhaps my colleague stacy excuse me casey can put a link to the website that the governor's office has put together that includes all of the opportunities and has a great chart of um not just energy but also broadband and health and transportation we link to it from our website but we can put a direct link that should give you a better sense of the all the types of opportunities that are out there feel free to jump in with more jen if you like i i think that's great the chart that is managed by the state is an adaptation by oregon based on a guidebook that has been published by the white house to help communities plan for and anticipate the different funding opportunities under the infrastructure investment and jobs act overall it represents 380 more than 380 programs across the federal government okay well if there's no further questions move on to the next slide all right so back to me for a few minutes as i mentioned at the beginning our goal today is to seek input so we can draft guiding priorities based on what we've heard and these guiding priorities will help us decide whether odo should put staff time into preparing applications for specific funding opportunities particularly those competitive ones and also how we should shape our program designs to best meet oregon's needs where we do have the flexibility and discretion to do so within the federal funding requirements so as we think about how to spend and prioritize this funding we're not starting with a blank slate there will be a lot of sideboards on the funding already when it comes to us from the federal government and the administration has shared their priorities with the state which are on this slide so these will ground us and i won't read all of these but you can see that they're focused on avoiding waste buying american high labor standards equity resilience and climate change and governor brown has also made it clear in standing up an infrastructure cabinet at the state level that she wants agencies to demonstrate how they will meet these national priorities in a way that addresses oregon's values of climate equity and racial justice she also wants us to make sure that we're including the voices of marginalized communities that have been left out of these decisions in the past so layered on top of the federal and state priorities in terms of where odo has some discretion we will also be looking to our mission so what are the priorities in our priorities are informing oregonians making sure we have a resilient and affordable energy system transitioning to a clean energy future in an equitable protecting public health and the environment and balancing needs and when putting together priorities we can also look to our authorizing statutes which show up in ors 4690 for those of you state code junkies the priorities that we glean from that language are renewable and sustainable diverse energy form efficiency state leadership prioritizing human needs preserving environmental quality energy efficient transportation cost effectiveness and providing impartial and objective information and then finally the oregon department of energy has a new strategic plan which i'm hoping casey can put a link to in the chat our plan has five areas of focus which you see on the right column of this slide so as we're looking at this federal funding and where to invest it we're keeping in mind our priorities to expand and improve stakeholder to build practices and processes that achieve more inclusive and equitable to enhance organizational data modernize our programs and optimize efficiency at the agency so luckily all of these priorities seem pretty consistent with what's coming out of usdoe in the guidance documents around iija including justice 40 and climate change now before we ask you a bunch of questions i will pause to see what questions we have from you oh interesting question in the chat what are the attributes or strengths that you see for oregon that will make us likely to win certain grants and thus become a lens for what we should apply for uh i think we have so",

Department of energy and I'm here today to moderate our conversation today we're going to discuss the Oregon solar and storage rebate program this program offers rebates to residential customers and low-income service providers who install solar or solar and paired energy storage systems this webinar will be recorded and the slides in the recording will be posted to odo's website after we talk today we'll start with introducing some of the other staff who work at Odo specifically who work on this program and I'll start with James who will lead today's conversation turning it over to you thanks Christine my name is James kogel and I'm a policy analyst here at the Oregon Department of energy I work across several of the agencies incentive programs aimed at increasing Energy Efficiency or the installation of renewable energy thanks thanks James next I'll turn it over to pandian and then to Dale and Katie pandian do you want to say hello yes um hello my name is pandian Krishna Swami I'm energy incentives manager at Oregon Department of energy uh thanks for joining us thanks pandian and then Dale and then Katie and Dale and Katie are the two folks that are sort of the front lines of this program with our contractors and hi my name is Dale veering I am a solar rebate assistant you're muted sorry folks hi I'm Katie with this solar and storage rebate program and I'm also the assistant thanks so much for the work that you two do and being kind of customer the the customer uh customer service experience that I know you both provide really appreciate it all right so moving on to slide two um in case you weren't familiar with our agency I wanted to start with just some brief information about what we do our agency helps oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a reliable resilience and affordable Energy System we advance solutions to shape an equitable clean energy transition protect the environments public health and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for current and future Generations you'll see on this Slide the five broad focused areas of our work and that includes energy programs and activities like the Oregon solar and storage rebate program next slide please today we'll start with some logistics for the webinar before James provides an outline of the program and an update on changes to the program from the recent legislative session James will then give a quick overview of the administrative rulemaking process before before presenting the proposed administrative rule Concepts that we'll be discussing today and hopefully moving forward in the near future with your input and changes according to what we hear from all of you there will be time for questions and for comments at the end though we're fitting I'll grab raised hands or questions and comments from the chat so we'll go on to the next slide a quick note on expectations today um many of most of the people that are on this call are attendees that's you that are here to give your input thanks so much for being here and then the panelists are all Department of energy staff in case you're wondering how that works and if you're an attendee it means you need to raise your hand to participate in on talk or um uh participate via the chat and I'll share how to do that in in just a minute we also just provide some basic Community agreements because we want to make sure that we Foster an inclusive and respectful meeting so um mostly I guess just kind of the bottom line on this is just being flexible and patient if there's any technology issues being respectful of others and I'll also just flag that Patricia Phillips in the chat will be the person that can help with any Logistics issues um Patricia really appreciate all of your behind the scenes work in making this webinar and lots more at our agency happen with that we'll go to the next slide please we know WebEx is sometimes unfamiliar to folks if you're new to the platform I just wanted to make sure you take a minute to familiar yourself with familiarize yourself with how to raise your hand and interestingly interestingly we found that sometimes people what people see in WebEx is different for each person so we put forward a slide here that's what it look we think it might look like for you mine's a little different for example there's a little sort of raised fist that is meant to be like the raised hand button that's down next to a little smiley face for me some people have to click the smiley face to get the little raised fist hand to learn how to raise your hand and then you might also want to open up the chat so that you can see how that works for me the chat is like a um this on this one the chat's already visible for me I have to open it it's like a little quote box or a little quote like call out on a comic strip so take a second and make sure that you understand how to engage via WebEx as an attendee then you'll have to raise your hand or use the chat to participate and if you'd be willing to just take a second I'll wait 10 seconds to give people a chance to let us know if they're having any issues and then we'll move on to the next slide and before I turn it over to James just really quickly I didn't see any um about how would you let us know if you can't raise your hand or chat and now it stick her to me as a serious fallacy in my plan um but but um but I did just want to quickly say that um we encourage you to put in your questions or comments as we go into the chat and I can come back and share those during the conversation or also grab any raised hands so just know that just feel free to go ahead and participate throughout this webinar and with that I'll turn things over to James thanks Christy um so Authority provide uh beginning of the brief outline of the program um the Oregon solar and storage rebate program provides rebates in order to reduce The Upfront costs to the customer for the purchase and installation of solar electric systems and paired solar and storage systems the program requires evidence that the full amount of the rebate is passed on to the customer and only approved contractors are able to access the reservation system and submit rebate reservation requests for residences the system must be installed on real property in Oregon and for residential customers the customer must be owner the own occupant of the low-income service providers are also eligible these are non-residential customers and include specific affordable housing the owners of systems that benefit affordable housing community service organizations who serve low or moderate income individuals or tribal or local government entities providing services to low or moderate individuals or who provide emergency shelter or Communications in disaster situations examples of organizations that have been received funding include Habitat for Humanity chapters Boys and Girls Club chapters Federal housing House Bill 3409 extended the sunset of the Oregon solar Plus Storage rebate program to January 2nd 2029 uh that's the end of the end of the session Bill also included an additional investment of 10 million dollars in the program existing language in the urban laws required that a contractor purchase construct and install a paired solar and storage system together has both 3409 amended the language and requires that only the purchase need occur at the same time while installation may occur separately the solar electric system and mg storage system still be paired once fully installed this change will go into effect at the start of 2024 and we're doing some rulemaking process right now to kind of update our rules following this change so that um we can be prepared in the new year are there any questions um we do have a question in the chat perfect timing as we head into talking about the proposed rules Angela Crowley cook from the Oregon solar and storage Industries Association is wondering if there's been any changes to the proposed rules since the last webinar uh so no there's been no changes to the proposed rule amendments from the first webinar um we will kind of just provide some additional uh background information um we've had questions so for instance we'll provide an outline of the program and well but um yeah there's no actual changes to that what we're proposing to uh changing the rules from the first I don't see any other hands raised with questions about the program that's designed or with the legislation changed okay okay thanks so a quick uh high-level summary of the rulemaking process so we did we start off with stakeholder consultation and after considering all the feedback and drafting the rules based on that feedback we can we file them with the Secretary of State uh this kicks off another comment period during which we seek additional feedback on these uh draft rule language and its impacts we review and consider all this information and then finalize the rules and then file those final rules with the secretary of state only then uh will the rules become effective this process can take a varying length of time and for this rulemaking we anticipated taking approximately four to six months but that may change so we're proposing changing the definition of paired solar and storage system to align with the recent legislative changes this will just reflects what the the legislation says um this will require only the purchase of a paired solar and storage system to occur at the same time via installation may be done separately the requirement that the solar electric system and energy storage system be purchased together is a requirement established in the legislation the legislation does not allow for a storage only rebate for people interested in adding stories to existing we had heard that there were delays associated with the the shipping and installation of storage and want to hear whether they are still occurring and which of the options would be most effective at reducing the impact of those delays the options being considered include permitting the solar incentive portion of the rebate to be claimed separately from the storage portion following installation of the solar system and proof of its completion this would include passing inspections from The Authority having jurisdiction this should also mean tweaks to how the rebates are processed in power collect the software contractors used to place reservation requests the reservation would continue to count as one of the contractors reserved projects and put until completion of the storage portion of the the reservation another option would be to extend the time that the reservation for paired solar and storage is valid for uh this would allow time for the storage to be a third option could be to increase the number of reservations a contractor can have at a time for systems for residential customers who are not low on moderate income this could allow",

        "text": " questions from the thank you again okay so with that i will once again recess the uh hearing on the 2022 uh carbon standards update and implementation of 2020 hp 2021 and i will move to the protected area scenic resources and recreation standards rulemaking hearing um before i open the florida commons once again i have just a quick background on procedural history and an overview of the proposed rules so as the council knows uh the council must adopt standards for the sighting of energy facilities including standards to address areas designated protection by the state or federal impacts of the facility on recreation scenic and aesthetic values and the council has done so under the protected areas standard the recreation standard and the uh scenic resources standard um the protected areas and scenic resources standards were last updated in 2007 the recreation standard was last updated in 2002 we began this rule making project in i believe 2018 to address issues related to the three standards and the associated information requirements and other rules that are associated with the standards the objectives were to ensure that the standards clearly identify the resources and values they're intended to protect to ensure that the standards are consistent with os 469 310 which sets the citing policy for the state of oregon and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the council's review processes and procedures by resolving ambiguity lack of clarity and inconsistency in the rules so as i mentioned council initiated the informal section of this rule making in october of 2020 we solicited early written comments in november of 2020 uh and received a number of comments from uh various stakeholders council reviewed those early comments on april 23 2021 and directed count staff to go out and get more feedback through a series of rule making workshops which we conducted in the summer and fall of last we brought our a preliminary preliminary analysis and recommendations to the council in got some feedback from council and revised the draft rules and recirculated them for an additional round of comments in march the council considered proposed rules at two meetings earlier this year one in april and one in may and then approved proposed rules in may of 2022. um staff issued the notice of proposed rulemaking on june 1st and today is of course the rulemaking hearing associated with this rulemaking um the last day for public comment on this rulemaking is july 21st to 2022 at 5 pm going to go through uh the summary of the proposed rules relatively quickly and i've kind of organized the changes by the standard so for the for the protected area standard the proposed rules would require an applicant to identify the managing agency of any protected area within the applicable study or analysis area for the project as well as a mailing address and other reasonably available contact information that protected area manager this is kind of coinciding with a policy change that the council has proposed to start providing public notice to the protected areas managers along with any public notice that goes out on the notice of intent or an we do expect that to be formalizing rules and awaiter rule making the proposed rules also amend the protected area standard to remove the effective date for designations allowing the council to consider impacts of protected areas that are designated um after a notice of intent is filed but prior to the filing of a complete the proposed rules would update and simplify the list of designations that are considered to be protected areas under the standard and would remove specific examples to reduce the need for future rulemaking and the rules would clarify the exception for when a linear facility may be located within the boundaries of a protected area for the scenic resources standard this uh the proposed rules would amend the standard to require an assessment of visual impacts to state scenic resources in addition to the current requirements to assess impacts to local tribal and federal scenic and we would also make clarifying changes to exhibit our requirements for visual impact assessments with the potential that that issue would be revisited in future rule making as specific to both the scenic resources and recreation standards the proposed rules would amend those two standards to allow the council to consider evidence introduced into the record related to impacts to scenic resources or recreational opportunities that are located outside of the analysis areas for those without going through the process of amending the project order to amend the boundaries of the analysis and then would also contain a number of administrative organizational changes such as moving the definition of what is a protected area out of the standard itself to division one and specifying um that the applicability that the standards are only applicable to uh the review of a request for amendment or a application that's filed on or after the effective date of the rules so i'm going to go ahead and open the hearing on the protected area scenic resources and recreation standards if there is anybody on the uh webex webinar or on phone that would like to participate raise your hand now if you're on the phone you can raise your hand by pressing star 3 as a reminder just like last time the council may ask any clarifying questions that you wish to during the hearing but the council will not respond to questions or comments during this hearing written comments will be accepted until 5 pm on july 21st so i'm going to put the instruction up here but um we actually do have one person in the room that would like to provide comments so uh angela crowley cook if you would like to come up and you do have a if you want to go first thank you steph and council members my name is angela crowley cook i'm the executive director of ocea the oregon solar plus storage industries and there's a reason why i'm the only person here in the room this is a really important topic and so i wanted to not take the easy way out and zoom in but come and be here in front of you because it's really critical and not just for our not just for my members and for the solar industry but really for all as you know very well we're in the middle of a climate crisis in oregon in our world we see it this year this wet spring increased precipitation is directly because of climate change and even though we had that wet spring 70 percent of our state is still in drought we've seen increased wildfires ocean acidification i don't have to go through them all for you but you know um the place that we're at here um and the effects that oregon is feeling because of climate change and that's the reason i believe that governor brown put forward her executive order 2004 on climate change and at that time the council took action to implement that executive order and in particular the council approved moving forward with a project too and i'm reading directly from the department's plan here a project to better align standards and application requirements and the objective of that of the rulemaking would be to conduct a comprehensive review of the standards and application requirements to create a clear separation of procedural and substantive substantive provisions and rules and to simplify procedures for review where practicable to review application requirements to clarify specific information needed to demonstrate compliance and finally on the one that i'm most concerned about is that to evaluate standards and application requirements to determine if the requirements should be adjusted for different types of energy facilities including facilities which generate energy from renewable sources and so you all have acted and the department has recognized that renewable energy is important to meet our climate change goals and should be looked at and reviewed and so the department i'm happy that the department has finally found someone to do that review of the standards and so for us it makes sense to wait until that review is concluded before moving forward with rulemaking on this topic i understand that there is one i guess issue that some of the areas are out of there are dates in the current rules and i understand that that is something that needs to be addressed if it can't wait until the review is concluded we would suggest that the council move forward on rulemaking only for that particular issue of changing removing the effective dates and making the dates certain of when there would be new protected areas included that makes sense to us we worked with staff over the past year to kind of improve that part and make sure that it would provide clarity and consistency for applicants however the rest of the rules we have great concern with unfortunately they create uncertainty and leave things not clear when the applicant is trying to move through the process as you all know very well it's a long process it's a complicated process an expensive one and part of the governor's executive order and and the department's plan was to reduce costs and reduce delays and so as we see most of these rules although there have been improvements which we appreciate but they do create uncertainty and increase delays and costs and so we're very concerned that these rules might move forward before that comprehensive review has happened and so i'm here to ask you today to delay this rule making until that review is completed in addition we one thing has come to our concern unfortunately late in the that the draft will say that there are no small business concerns unfortunately that is blatantly false there are many small business concerns and it looks like they weren't really and fully investigated in the proposal of this draft rules member oca members that have site certificates are small businesses they have way less than 50 employees and in my communication with staff there was some discussion about how maybe they didn't technically qualify because they have other subsidiaries that for each particular project however that's the it's the same company it's not as if a large company like pacific core then formed a smaller company it's the same folks that run these companies it's one small business that has individual corporations for particular projects and many small businesses are actually impacted by these rules and unfortunately it looks like no small business concerns where you know that that formal review about small business concerns wasn't completed before coming to you today so um again while we appreciate that there were slight improvements to the rule over the past year um because of the big issues that we're facing as a state as a as a globe we ask that you delay this so that we can reduce that uncertainty those delays and costs and make sure the review happens first before we expand other rules at the at the through the aspect process thank you that's members have any clarifying okay hearing none thank you miss carly um next we have uh mr brian kelly uh mr kelly if you'd like to provide",

        "text": " you know inclusive of the f-sec process but not you know ex not just the fsi process so i think that'll be helpful for council and staff to get a broader understanding of what it takes to you know create and ultimately operate these facilities but i wanted to first provide a little context of fsec jurisdictional renewable energy projects so i'm going to share my screen really quickly all right and is that coming up not coming up yet i'm not sure why is nobody able to see my screen yet see your screen but it's not showing content there it is there goes yep that's working now so you can see the staff report the table needs to be enlarged some it looks like it needs to finish loading sorry i should have practices i'm not actually used to doing the sharing i don't know why this is not sharing i'm gonna stop try it again okay so i don't know why it's not working nancy can you bring up the staff report for agenda item g that way let's continue wasting time move control back over to nancy can you see are you working on that thank you can you increase the size of that please that helps yeah a little bit more a little bit more oops gonna lose the page nope it must be uh slow on my end so is that can everybody see that or does it need to be reduced now it needs to be reduced or moved up one or the other um yeah i mean we'll scroll down because then i'll be able to show kind of more of it so yeah so sorry for the delay on that um first of all i wanted to indicate that i was probably in a hurry to get the staff report out so uh using the template it includes attachment one draft proposed order and attachment two comments there are no attachments so that was my error leaving that in so i apologize if that resulted in any confusion by anybody can you scroll down to show the first table they're perfect right there so the staff report includes two tables the first table is just a roll-up of all the energy renewable energy projects oh sorry yeah right there so far so you can see that the number of projects in operation in construction the ones that were approved have been approved and are still valid but have not been constructed and then projects that are terminated or the one thing i didn't include here is any projects that are currently under review just to let you know we have six projects currently under review uh for a total of one uh 1895 megawatts or just about two gigawatts so there's a substantial amount of power represented in these projects getting down to table number two i'm not going to get into any details associated with any of the individual projects but you can kind of see you know what i what i did here is i created a timeline basically the timeline reflects the kind of conclusion of the council's review in whatever way that happened and the color coding kind of relates to the status of projects so the most recent obsidian that was approved is on top and then the oldest is on bottom so nancy can you scroll to the bottom please and there is a key to the color coding um at the bottom i won't go over that right now but i'll yeah if you can just scroll up just a little bit nancy perfect right there yeah what a little bit more up sorry there's probably a delay um so you can see you know we had the first two renewable energy projects that were given site certificates and terminated but those are fairly old ones i'm going to start with the the ones that are in the green highlight and show what this pattern kind of shows the green reflects the projects that were approved that went into under their original approval and so you can see at least based upon what this pattern at least reflects to me is that there was a market for wind energy projects you know between 2000 2001 and about 2010 because every project that was you know approved in that time frame went into construction you know within that original approval so you can scroll up about half a page nancy yeah and so then getting into um the late 2000s the market started to change and so these colors kind of reflect that change you have the green the dark green or the darker green ones are projects that were approved wind projects that were approved but received multiple time extensions did not go into construction within the original time frames and then you know another example of that is even the golden hills project which fairly recently went into construction is only constructing about half of what was originally approved so you know there is effectively another half of that project that could be along those timelines you can see the other color patterns the dark gray or projects that didn't conclude the f-sec process for whatever reason they withdrew so there were you know a fair number of wind projects that started the process and ultimately withdrew you have the helix wind project and then if you scroll up a little bit nancy and then the saddle butte also kind of within that time frame projects that ultimately did receive a site certificate but but elected for whatever reason um to not build and terminated their site certificates so and then you know wheat ridges is one that was a little different that actually went into construction within the time frames scroll up a little bit more right there and so now we get into the solar so you have the boardman facility and the cardi facility those were the two first two solar projects approved by both of those one has already received a time extension for beginning construction and the other is under review right now for extending the beginning construction time frame so we're already seeing a different pattern with solar than we saw with wind because at least for the boardman project they indicated they didn't have a power purchase agreement so there was no market for for that project whereas if you scroll up a little bit we have the bake oven project and it's been split into a couple um that went into construction relatively soon after approval similarly the montag solar which was an amendment to an existing wind project you know that went into construction relatively soon after it was approved as well and then we have these other projects in blue that have received approval they're still under their original approval and haven't begun construction but they're still under the original time frame so we're already starting to see a different pattern with solar projects than we we saw with wind so i just wanted to give council a little bit of context of what we've seen you know with f-sect jurisdictional projects so that when max and diane are doing their presentation you can kind of think about about that within the broader kind of framework that they're going to provide so unless you have any questions for me i took way longer than i expected so my apologies to max and diane on that and i will turn it over to all right thanks todd so max diane the floor is yours welcome and thank you for joining us great thank you it's great to be here um and i will admit uh equal and experience maybe that todd expressed in sharing on webex platform but i would be happy to give it a go if i could get some get the for sharing my screen maybe while i'm working on that i'll um my name is diane brandt and i'm the organ policy manager with renewable northwest and um my colleague max green will start start us out and i will be working on figuring out shared screen in the meantime thanks diane thank you todd for that really helpful context um i i was intrigued to see your your when you first developed and shared them with us and appreciate you're kind of walking through them today and thank you of course to chair grail and the council for welcoming us here today to share some additional context essentially what needs to happen in addition to an f-sec site certificate in order for an f-sect jurisdictional project to actually come to fruition and and at the same time identify some of the factors that might cause even a project that holds the site certificate not to advance and to uh first though i'm going to start with just a brief introduction to our organization renewable northwest so you know a little bit more about who we are as an organization and after that i'm going to pass the baton to diane to kick off the the substantive portion of our presentation so at renewable northwest our mission is to decarbonize the region by accelerating the transition to renewable energy we are a 501c3 advocacy organization uh not a trade association though we are a member-driven organization so we count in our membership a number of renewable energy developers related businesses including environmental consultants law firms the folks that you all see on a regular in considering site certificates as well as buyers of renewable energy and then we also have a number of environmental nonprofits nrdc is a member climate solutions and consumer advocates so the oregon citizens utility board is an active member as well so we really see a lot of strength in our diverse membership appreciate being a 501c3 that you know we talk to our members we try to get really high quality information and come to decisions on our own independently about what the best way forward is in order to achieve that decarbonization mission and as for geography we are a regional organization diane and i are both based here in oregon i'm just outside portland in tigard our office is in portland and diane is in corvallis we have staff in washington and montana and we engage in policy and regulatory work in all four states and speaking of that policy and regulatory work uh regulatory work is really our bread and butter um we do a lot of engagement at state utility commissions um probably the oregon commission most of all but also the the washington utc the idaho puc the montana psc and a lot of that tends to focus on the sort of central regulatory process for electric utilities of doing integrated resource planning where the utilities assess their their needs and come up with plans for how to meet those needs on a lease cost least risk basis then flowing through to rfps where they actually go out and try to get the resources to meet the needs and finally looking for rate recovery for those investments after they've gone through the rfp process um at our organization tend to engage less with the rate processes but the irps and the rfps are a big part of what we do we also do engage",

        "text": " which which program I'm sorry I was distracted for a moment yeah go ahead CL no it's the um Community the community renewable energy program the exactely program yeah we're looking at that as well a question for in that regard and I know that's way off topic so just waved me off but um the expectation in this district is that it will be built out over a series of years and as vertical um facilities or infrastructure are built with that would come rooftop solar carport solar so um the the the the the PV generation will come online over time um and um you know so I think that uh being able to demonstrate the expected full PV um generation upfront isn't realizable because of the incremental nature of the buildout of the district but you you know you got to start somewhere and you need a micro grid you need a large B which could be in the near term um substantially fed in the evening with clean power and then be able to used by PGE under a PPA to do load shifting you know during the daytime to reduce fossil fuel peer requirements um and then um but under a black Skies event it Islands whatever powers in the batteries available to feed um the critical infrastructure within the uh the the uh the resilience district and then over time I'm talking about within a 3 to fiveyear period as um projects within the district are built like like the Public Works facility the police facility a market rate Department building retrofitting an affordable housing project sure with solar that we would incrementally be adding up to three and a half megawatts of solar PV that could also be feeding the battery and could could could Supply it with power in an island mode but but that but the the solar generation will come on overtime incrementally and won't be able to be there upfront day one when you one thing you could consider and I'm sorry for for interrupting but one thing you could consider is the planning grant part of C to sort of flesh out the things that you've just talked about here today and get some funding to to to apply toward the planning of this project that you you seem to have a a really good idea of now and then also consider you know altering the project around the requirements of disr because you know again it could be up to a free million dollar and if you had different projects you know different buildings can be different projects even though in your mind they're phases of a project for the life of c those could be separate projects because they're probably going to be behind separate meters on different buildings and so the other thing I was going to recommend is that you know in the beginning maybe you can do one public building gets through top solar then you do have your generation going with the battery backup in the micro grid right from the beginning um that could be something maybe you could consider to have um you know one building one public building get rooftop solar so you do meet the the generation requirement so I'm gonna we're talking you know John you should really be talking to our Comm our staff for the C program probably um about it it sounds like maybe um currently have that application open it closes on May 10th I know and we are and we're we're working on a planning Grant application under cup now but I couldn't resist the temptation response to um you know um one of Clay's comments to um to wander into cup territory so I I beg your Indulgence in that regard and I'm happy to stop stop now and there are open hours available for with C staff um so we probably got your email address but maybe if you pop it in the chat we can make sure you get those and then you could talk about this with Jason canalon team over there yeah I've I've attended one of those open house open hours and um on my calendar to do so going forward so so yeah I can continue this conversation with them so thanks thanks again for um I really I really was trying to focus on the grid resilience question but it it does have some overlap as as I think we discovered in this conversation yeah yeah and I I have well I don't know I mean I would guess that PG might already have ideas of what they're planning to do with this funding for this round so definitely get talking to them we we have been I just wanted just wanted to assess whether or not they are advantaged through this collaboration in terms of being more competitive in their application um as or not that that was really a critical question I had great well thanks so much for the time we really appreciate you sticking around and getting deep on a project with us fun sounds really I live near I live enough tiger that it would probably benefit me too great all right thanks guys see you have a have a good John well Jennifer Jolly is the only one left on I don't know if Jennifer has anything to say she can raise her hand if she wants otherwise we could probably get out of here for a second looks like she's on a phone so all right well Jennifer if you need anything you let me know all right well let's shut this down maybe think Jennifer Jolly just put in how so I don't know if that means to come off of mute um because she's on you're off mute now Jennifer okay thank you um yeah I'm sorry I am on my phone I I had missed um one of the things you said in the beginning and I was wondering if you wouldn't mind um repeating I know we're at the end of the hour but um you were talking about if someone had applied for a grip Grant I know a number of our smaller C had um collaborated on some applications there and what is what what did they need to do and um are they able to apply in this category for the same thing or or what what was the um advice or or Direction on that um it's supposed to be a a different project or different scope um there is some question that I I don't have the answer for on if they are the same scope but they're in different um periods um I don't have the clarification on that yet so there is some indication that they could even be the same scope if they were in different periods of between grip and grid resilience and I don't quite understand that to be honest I've got to go back to the Department of energy to get clarification on that part but if they are of different Scopes or different projects then you can have grip and grid resilience at the same time is my understanding um but then any time that that we can get details around that and get questions to doe and get clarification from them um we're definitely willing to do that so for example if they had only done a portion of an undergrounding project through the grip Grant presumably they could continue to go more underground or longer length um through this program or or I guess when you're saying a different project I guess I'm questioning what what does that mean I mean that that sounds to me too like that makes passes the common sense to to my thinking that okay you know grip covered a certain amount and we want to continue with the under grounding in it you know even if it's on the same line it's a different project because it's addition you know it's okay further down the line okay um I have I again I have to clarify that with doe but that passes my my Common Sense test today okay so just it doesn't necessarily have to be a different um different type of project different type of hard project it could be the same um types of projects just maybe in a different location or something like that that's my understanding yeah okay yep okay great well thank you so much appreciate it you're very welcome thanks for calling in okay bye-bye bye all right thank you all so much I appreciate your time and we will end it there",

committee for March 8 2024 president aroy Phillips thank you and then we have staff who will be identified as needed uh so here we are about what 16 hours after the end of the session Justin is in his post session um we'll call it that and uh let's go for our update thank you Mr Mayor counselors staff Welcome to our last Friday of the session we'll have a much more detailed report here Mr Mayor with the final report and everything but we'll go over these real quick we'll talk about turning the corner and what we're going to work on a little bit next session and then I'll give you guys a little brief on who's going to be back and who's not and uh let's go right so uh the major 110 fix that everybody was watching including us um pass the house and the Senate it is sitting there waiting for the Governor's signature that was a big piece of this session as everybody saw in the news at set up do we think she'll sign it I do believe so absolutely um moving right along the past stuff stalled out in ways and means uh we were sport one on that we should expect to see that coming back 25 uh electric micro Mobility Vehicles also stalled out down there in ways and meain probably see that come back in 25 representative Anderson's payment L taxes Bill stalled out in committee had a hearing so that is the initial phase of that and as you'll hear uh moving forward we're going to be working on some things related to that house bill 475 which was representative Evans legislation dealing with uh funding Public Safety had a hearing in rules and was in committee upon adjournment we'll see that come back in 25 and I'll work with the representative to see what he's doing there the uh 4103 was the electric assisted bicycles we talked about last week the class one two and three that passed it's sitting uh on the governor's desk now photo radar I don't see Trevon today but that bill did pass it's a waiting signatures but um it'll it'll need to be further worked on in 25 so there's more details around that um strike prohibited employees waiting Governor's signature we talked a little bit about that last week Mark ogc which we supported at a level one p and is sitting around waiting for the Governor's uh signature on that that was the uh ethics commission and staff uh to give advice on the application of the entire public meetings law not just in executive sessions the bill relating to funding Oregon cultural organizations um stalled out in ways and means we had a little bit in there for the parks Foundation but moved to another uh Bill water infrastructure this was the huge package there were like $90 million of requests we weren't in there there were 200 projects in there 50 projects it ended up sitting Ways and Means so we know that'll come back so we'll work on what those projects uh look like and if there's opportunities for us there and then uh house bille 5201 which was a placeholder Bond authorization Bill there was some money for the YMCA of mar P counties that was in there that passed both the House and Senate waiting Governor signature that's the resource center yes yeah 3 million project costs and 335,000 uh of costs for issuing bonds and Debt reserves and uh working on a centralized social service and Resource Center uh next we got a watch on Senate Bill 1519 weight mile tax Julie we went over there quite a bit in committee upon adjournment uh the Governor's housing package Unice yes yeah got anything more on it or any details that we need to know about but lots of stuff in there we knew that was going to fly that will be sitting on her desk the American semiquincentennial passed both Senate in the house waiting uh signatures from speaker the president and the governor uh the West study Senate Bill 1572 did not get funded so um I think we will look along with Wilsonville at what we could potentially do moving forward on this because we know and I think Terry and Cat if they're on today I know Summit knows that there's some uh transportation funding in the future that I know they're working on a couple big projects and I think we will probably see that uh in 25 if not 2527 but we should be prepared because there's opportunities within that had a meeting with the mayor of Wilsonville invited her down the other day we had a good chat I've CH talked to a board member from chariots I think there's some local local just in doing this and getting ready for the 25 session on the local level and then letting the state realize their mistake and all to join us yeah I think it' be wise to be prepared for this I mean what I like about this um you know as we get advanced in age this is a project that we could actually see be completed in 5 to 10 years which was very encouraging you know I thought I ask one of those projects take 30 years I'll be long gone but uh hopefully um hopefully we can get some funding and be prepared for this because I know there will be Transportation dollars coming and uh the more prepared we are the better uh opportunities we will have so it was disappointing that the study didn't get funded but we'll try to do some things to uh keep going down that path and then finally recreational immunity did pass um and under the advisement of Representative crup um he wanted cities to get working on that right away because that will sunset in January of 2026 so then finally 5701 uh lots of stuff in there um since we knew that payment L of taxes was not going to fly this session uh we started having discussions with the governor's office with legislative leadership with legislative Administration on what are some other opportunities in and around that could get some funding to Salem uh so we started working on anou to look at the State Street side that the capital and legislative Administration is really concerned about the safety on that State Street side you've got parking you've got no barriers to building somebody could pull a truck up with who knows what in it and really do a lot of damage to the capital so we started having that discussion they set aside some money for us as essentially a down payment to look at what we could do together to increase Security on that so that's housed in uh a budget report says a retainment of a portion of the overall carry forward amount is necessary to fund anticipated cost for related to security improvements to the State Street side of the capital building so that's great it's in there according to the speaker's office that's a couple million bucks for us and then finally in the budget report it says the need for supporting any of these potential one-time costs will be identified in the 2025 session so we're going to continue work I was supposed to meet with Brad Haynes yesterday there was a big rally going not a huge rally not like the rallies of old there were log trucks out and there were interests uh in and around the capital so we had to push that meeting off till Monday so I will know more on Monday and we'll be able to report back when we do the final report on how we move forward looking at more funding in terms of creating safety opportunities and enhancing Public Safety on the State Street side of the building so just to be clear that it's $2 million but it's not tied to any particular thing it'll just be general fund dollars we have correct I would love to have seen it just in a Christmas tree Bill specific but this is how they did it we know there's dollars there what our path forward is don't know yet but we're working on that and we'll work very closely with legislative Administration Justin yeah so the 2000 theou just basically for the space but any kind of improvement they would also cover cover that in a couple years yeah what we'd be looking at is actually you know giving up a little chunk of that lane there uh and what that would look like in terms of time what that would look like in terms of dollars and I asked for six to eight we got to so yeah this doesn't get us to that body that they're seeking this gets us to the conversation yeah how did you turn it mray on what we could do since we already provide so much to the capital and I think you know that's what we want to talk about in terms of payment and the L of taxes other state capitals get funding from the state we want to follow that path in 25 so those two things in combination I think we could really uh uh get some resources in here to where we could start to make a difference and then continue to look at payment Lo taxes not just for Salem but also Statewide like representative Anderson wanted to do so I me just sorry just one second I want to make sure that everyone knows that we have done the traffic counts we know that we can afford to lose a little bit of vehicle travel through there um and we know that we can do it without jeopardizing the vision of two-way State Street through that Corridor at some point so just want to assure that we've looked at the technical side of it counc pH yeah so thank you guys for talking about this uh I'm hearing that we we can expect two million dollars that will effectively go to our general fund um because of what the state government's going to do in terms of acquiring part of State Street no no rting yeah we wouldn't give it up this is a they're gonna we're gonna get $2 million uh and we're going to have we're going to continue the conversation with how that at some point they might get part of State Street to enhance Capital Security okay so it's the beginning I guess my question is just uh in terms of the funding of 2 million dollars at what point does that actually get into our general fund like what year What's the timing in the very near future this year yeah and I'll be working on that counselor when I meet with Brett on Monday and and thank you and again just to be like our calendar is kind of odd as a city so when we say this year do we mean the the year that ends in",

        "text": " think is throwing some through me too when i was trying to think about answer the question that's just a publication of the 2020 work so it's not a different study there's a study in 2020 which we did in our you we we put out there through boehm and then through pnnl technical report literature and then we took it to a peer-reviewed journal in 2021 and now we have a new study that launched late 21 early 22 on the southern oregon northern transmission then maybe to the the to mike's question about the the failure of um you know any single generator i mean the way floating officer win will have to comply with the the same requirements of any generator so you know if a natural gas plant fails it might be you're right that there are different you know it's not failing in the ocean and maybe it doesn't create a no sales zone so that that piece is different but in terms of the power system um and that piece should should be considered of course but in terms of the power system it's a contingency either way whether it's a natural gas plant that doesn't fire up because it's too hot out and it hasn't been run much or if it's an offshore wind plant that has a mechanical failure or or even even if it's a spectacular failure it's still a loss of a generator and the system has to be designed so it can handle that that's an n minus one condition so and actually it's it's almost less than n minus one because typically these generators there are many generators in a in a utility scale wind plant each turbine is a generator so if one fails the implication of the power system is usually not that large because there are many others on the wind park to compensate or or the or the individual failure is not that much in terms of active or reactive power contributions but either way if there was a failure of an entire wind plant and that that is something that the power system has to be planned for and so there are contingency and reliability uh you know requirements that sean alluded to earlier that have to be met regardless of what the type of generation is thanks travis mike had a really great question about um state by state adoption of renewable energy goals and understanding of how power systems and sources are tied together via a shared transmission system our renewable power being exported and across state lines and how accounting for associated renewable energy targets accomplished and just say want to say mike thank you for that question thank you for your interest there that's like one of the main things that our agency works on and just really appreciate the interest and one of our um parts of our mission is providing education on these very complex technical pieces so just really appreciate the question and wanted to make sure that folks knew that adam responded with how regional collaboration coordination is really important in the power sector it happens now but there's also efforts to increase regional coordination in the pacific northwest and the west more broadly so that you know different states and and areas of states can um benefit from different types of renewable resources depending on what those are um so greater cooperation is definitely a piece of the puzzle um and there's a website that we the oregon department of energy has created and maintained called the electricity resource mix which will break down what resources are used by utility territory as well as information about the greenhouse gas emissions associated with that energy harding in the chat had a few points on showing more carbon dioxide is produced and removed and some uh links to a study um so thank you for for from berkeley and then i'm gonna i don't see any others in the chat hopefully i summarized all of those and i see a hand raised from harvey so i'm going to turn it to harvey thank you i just kind of follow up on that chat about that dutch uh wind generator collapsed uh i i used to work for bonneville and uh i was talking to one of our construction inspectors we were building a substation for a wind farm out in eastern washington i think it was near and this has been a while back but anyway uh the uh one of the uh they were assembling one of these wind generator towers and it collapsed and killed one of the workmen and uh the construction inspector had osha was there investigating it and our inspector went and took a look at what was what was the problem and it turned out the uh outer skin of the uh column of the wind generator was just photogenic it looks but when you looked in an interior it was coldly corroded out uh it was fabricated in different places in asia one was the design was done in ho chi minh city vietnam fabrication of the some of the parts were done in china and other parts were in thailand and that's all again all put together and apparently there was a lot of on the interior of the uh of the uh of that um column you're going to need a lot of corrosion uh i don't know coatings and cathodic protection perhaps but you're going to have to really pay attention to corrosion because that could weaken your structure and cause a collapse and i will have other comments about storage i got an idea but i'll throw it out but we'll do that later thank you oh great thanks harvey not seeing any other um kathy did have a clarifying comment about the um dac the direct air capture um i think for uh chris in terms of it if it turned out to be difficult to or transmit all the electricity that would be generated some could be used for like local hydrogen or direct air which would allow it to be co2 negative okay thank you so much for all of the engagement on this topic of reliability we had actually scheduled a 10-minute break we're pretty behind schedule though so i just wanted to get a sense from folks about whether you would prefer to take up maybe a shorter break and then dive into about 45 minutes of transmission um take a take a lunch break now and then cover transmission afterwards folks want to kind of provide a preference in the chat that would help us to sort of align the agenda give people a few minutes to think about it so the options are to take a take a short break right now and then come back during part of the lunch hour to discuss or to take a lunch break now and then cover transmission after a half hour lunch break i want to make sure marty on the line would be available to to cover transmission after an early lunch break uh yeah that should work for me can you hear me yeah so that'd be in about 30 minutes from now yes that's right so far it seems like people are also hearing my stomach growling so maybe so far i'm seeing more interest in having a lunch break now and then heading into transmission uh thanks for that feedback so jason i think on slide 62 we have it just says break 10 minutes maybe we can change that to say lunch break um come back at 12 30 or 12 25 sorry 12 25. thanks everyone for all of this engagement we had tried to build in a break but it was such a such good questions and engagement sorry for not providing a break earlier um but we will see you back here at 12 25 to dive into a topic that we've gotten a lot of feedback on which is transmission hope you all get a chance to get something to eat and we'll see you i'm gonna give people just another minute here to get back to their hey can you all hear me just wanted to test my audio before everyone gets back and just to double check i think jason will be just handling master slide deck so i shouldn't worry about sharing screen okay great all right i'm going to get us started again hopefully you're back from our lunch break thanks for your flexibility as we adjusted the agenda um so we have coming back from the lunch we have a topic on transmission infrastructure for floating offshore wind and i'm going to pass it over to jason okay thanks everybody welcome back um well first here from national renewable energy lab on this agenda item and then um they'll cover a 2021 transmission study um that kind of built off some of the work travis travis talked to us about and then i'll swing back to me and then um talk about some additional transmission that are under consideration and in the for the region that some people brought those up um earlier on the call as well so marty schwartz is a power systems engineer who works on modeling transmission systems for the national renewable energy lab he completed that 2021 transmission study i which looked at floating offshore wind interconnecting to oregon's grid which is being used to support bohm's call area as well and so marty is going to share a summary of that study highlights of the study's limitations and caveats and share the key findings that he found that relate to the challenges and benefits of interconnecting floating offshore wind into the existing transmission system turn off okay great so yeah i think there's a we have a bunch of takeaways here um but first off this is pretty similar to travis's study from travis representing piano there so rather than focus on the offshore wind profiles themselves and their i'm going to focus more on some of the specific transmission related analysis that we did and how it how this offshore wind in oregon can connect to the broader western interconnection um really the whole system for the entire western connection act works together so we have to model all that at once and we'll look a little bit further afield from oregon um so i'll just give a like a one or two minute overview of the study itself and then dive right into the transmission takeaways and then hopefully leave as much time as possible for questions so i hope to be talking less than 10 minutes just myself so great yeah so diagram on the upper left shows our workflow for a lot of our large-scale grid integration studies so this is similar to how an integrated resource plan will work for just kind of your run-of-the-mill integrated resource plan for utilities where you start with the capacity expansion model that finds the cost optimal build out of a few for a future year and then you translate that into a production cost model which finds the cost optimal operations of that infrastructure so this just similar to travis's study this was a",

        "text": " be there to help make good decisions what I'm what I really want to communicate though is that um if Salem OR Portland OR Milwaukee or any other community chooses to do this it's the community choosing to do this PGE will absolutely support you as you make decisions you know even like in the Tariff that we've drafted um we say very clearly that there will be a PGE Steve what's the word we use representative I think um somebody that can sort of serve as a consultant to help you um understand the issues that you're facing um we will be there the whole time my message is just that like you know this is a decision that only a local community to make um and we will support the communities that we serve regardless of the decision that we make you know if if you say no then we will continue to be the partner that we have been for very for many many years and if you say yes then we will absolutely be partners to um make this program successful thank you are there other questions about five or six questions but I can wait till the end if questions I don't need to interrupt it now all right I think we're ready to continue okay um I believe that's um the presentation um so uh I guess next steps um Steve you want to go to nine we have um internally a very close to final draft of this um Community green tariff um we will be getting it out to stakeholders including Juliana in the next couple of weeks um and we hope to file it with the Commission in the next few months um that's where you know we can really use help from our communities to show up at the commission and say that this is a structure that you know you can support um because again we're doing this because of interest from our communities um and that's going to be very important to the Pu um to see that this is a concept that our communities can support and would like to participate in or at the very least have the option to participate in um you know we expect to have this approved by the commission by sometime before the end of the year if things go well and once that happens you know we can really start having conversations um about what a particular program would look like for a community um we can begin those conversations before the commission approves it um but you know once we get that um that approval from the commission then we will really have total Clarity on you know how the program will and will not work okay I think are we ready for questions then at this point yeah great right hi Riley my name is Mike Slater I hope you're well um I'm not an expert in this area but I've been following it for maybe the past year or so so I do have some specific questions if I can go ahead yeah of course okay so my first question is you said once the money is committed and that money is for the infrastructure to build a green facility is that correct um that's certainly an option we can do a lot of things with this money the the other option that comes up other options that come up pretty frequently are um additional Energy Efficiency um or like tree planting those are some things that cities have talked about using with using um or funding with this program okay so it could be like carbon offsets not necessarily emission reduction uh yes um and the re well well like the reason we've talked about tree planting is because we do know that over time as trees grow and create more shade it does reduce energy demand in a community I don't think we would um want to do carbon offsets in the sense of like you know going to the market and purchasing carbon offsets um but there could be things that the community could do that would reduce carbon emissions without going out and building a new Wind Farm or something like that so if we do need to add capacity by building a wind farm or something who owns that facility um that would likely be well there's two options either it will be a power purchase agreement where we go out and we contract with um a developer I'll use aveng grid as an example because I used to work there um where you know we we we say hey aving grid will you please go build a new Wind Farm or solar farm somewhere and then they just sell the energy to PGE at a fixed cost and we pass that money on we just pass that bill on to you um or it could be a resource that's owned by PGE I think it's more likely that it would be something that's owned by a developer and there's a power purchase agreement but if it's owned by PGE it would be sort of a similar um circumstance where um you know we figure out what that resource costs and we just charge you monthly for it okay that's or I guess I want to say there's a third option too um which is that for smaller things for Community Based renewable energy it could absolutely be owned by this the City of Salem um or by a nonprofit in Salem or something like that um I don't think that um resources of that size are probably big enough to meet you know the city's demand overall um but we do want to make sure that we have options that allow um for a delivery of a community benefit very directly so my understanding is that PGE has um a mandate at some point to purchase 20% of its energy from Community solar is that correct for 20 energy we have a um the what we we have we call it the small scale resource um or SSR um purchase obligation which is 10% of our overall capacity have to come from resources that are smaller than 20 megawatts by 2030 and how did that play into this program if at all that's a great question and that touches on sort of what this program is we um will not count resources that are used for this program towards any of our compliance obligations which means that if Salem chooses to just contract you theoretically only with resources that are under that 20 20 megawatt um threshold um we will not count them towards pge's overall requirement same with emissions you know like theoretically we want to be at we're required to be at 80% % by 2030 um if Salem does this or M County does this or you know anybody we want to be at 81% or 82% or 83% or you know whatever it is we are not going to count the actions that a particular city or county is paying for towards pge's overall compliance obligations whether that's the small scale resource or the h221 emissions targets or a renewable standard so so in this example you typed about 10% and it would be contracted with systems under 20 megawatts that right correct so if Salem were to create a system that generated 20 megawatts how would that play into the green tariff proposal uh well there could be a bunch of options you know if if there's a if if Salem does have a community green tariff and chooses to be purchasing from that let's say 19 megaw resource right um then we simply do that incremental cost calculation we showed earlier where we say how much does that resource cost on a megawatt hour basis what are pge's costs otherwise and you will be paying the incremental cost there so we would be if we if we created a 19 megawatt facility we would sell that power to you and then buy it back yeah that's basically right and then there are there would be a rate that we would establish for how much that we we would be paid for that electricity correct gotcha thank you that those are my questions thank you other yeah from Juliana or Robert how you see this working into our climate action plan so um at that scale of what it can be and the cost I see it being a smaller program where we could do a community um benefit agreement with it and get a smaller scale renewable projects funded through this type of a mechanism and what does that look like what's the smaller scale renewable energy project wonderful question um we actually have a couple that we're looking into right now um the municipal airport was doing a solar feasibility study and um our uh water folks are looking into in pipe in in pipe power generation got gravity feing water down we Fe it through a small turb engine now it's cool it's cool but um as far as these things go they won't be hugely offsetting the total um greenhouse gas emissions um unless we do a really big project but if you're doing a really big project you're going to have really big cost so I I agree with uh one of Riley's statements from earlier that going into it and trying to be like we can do 100% renewable probably isn't a good starting point uh if if we want to look into starting it I think doing a this much reduction might be a better point to mitigate those risks for the city as well so we could do a project like say the the in line whatever generation the turb and which would be I would think relatively small cost so this could be like maybe 3 million okay so I'm just going to pull numbers out of the a like 50 cents on somebody's bill or something like really a relatively small impact something like that could be possible correct as opposed to something it would be like 25 bucks or something yeah okay well there's and the other part to answer the question is how it fits in the climate action plan in many ways this is one of the early opportunities for everybody in but most everybody in Salem to say I'm involved in the climate action plan because I'm contributing this amount becomes an individual participation opportunity less so than what are they doing else which would be an interesting exercise to see how many people do partipate and if I could add one one note on that you know it's it's think about this both in terms of the things that you can do to just sort of Simply reduce the city's emissions on a you know metric tons basis and then also things you can do to benefit your community overall like you know this is there's a combination like does a project where you put solar panels on top of a fire station and also batteries in the basement um reduce emissions absolutely it also provides really significant resiliency benefits uh for your community in the event of a major outage whether it's caused by um a big earthquake or an ice storm or whatever else um you know",

move John if we have no comments we'll give it another moment but we do have a couple in the chat that may be worth great great um while people get their thoughts together maybe we can turn to those that are in the chat okay Tom Bartlett from Ashland said that they have a virtual net merging program that works like meter aggregation and Tom brabsky and expand more and then we can respond Tom solder that's great uh Ray Sanchez muscador are you still around oh okay we may need to take people off a mute and I'm not sure if I can do that uh someone just queued me in are they on mute I'm not sure who has control right at the moment we've been notified that they're not here anymore okay great well let's see um so we'll go on I see we are getting um some questions um in the chat as we're going through oh and it does look like Rey is here um so we will um work with you Ray to try to figure out how to get you unmuted but maybe we can take a different question in the can you hear me interim oh yes there you are great thank you thank you yeah um this was uh towards the uh the grant programs that I think Ryan was talking about with uh energy trusts and other organizations and I think one of the biggest challenges that we have we had when we started when we built our first community school project and now we're going to have again is we're trying to focus on building a 100 low-income Community solar project here in the Rogue Valley the challenge that we have is that all the grants that we apply for are going to be applying for pay after the fact and I can see that for small organizations like ours in small communities like ours this is a major problem because that means that you somehow have to come up with the one two three four million dollars that the Project's gonna cost to to build it and then the grand Tours are going to reimburse you but that doesn't quite work for a small organization like that so I was trying to understand if there is any way that monies could be provided to small projects up front to reduce those those financing hurdles that's a great question I'm going to see if perhaps um Evan would like to chime in if if you have any thoughts on this that's a really good point Ray I think that you're you're absolutely correct that that's kind of a barrier that that doesn't just apply its Community solar projects that's certainly going to be a barrier in the single family space as um we I think that asking a low-income household to make a payment and have reimbursed afterwards clearly won't work um likely will also apply to some of the contractors we're potentially working with so I think across the board um the timing of payments is going to be something has to be woven in and um definitely you you bring some first-hand experiences how that's going to be challenging specifically in the community solar case for Community scale I I would add to that Ryan that you know this could be an opportunity to build in uh some services or an approach with technical assistance to help raise projects or like projects access construction financing now I know that doesn't always help on like the development expense and that's a big barrier that we've seen But providing some uh you know direction or some framework where projects can access you know private sector lending to finance their projects and have that built into your assumptions and your pro forma I mean that's a possibility so you don't have to come out of pocket for that adds a little bit of cost to your overall project but a construction loan is less costly than a term loan that's 10 or 20 years long great thank you um I think that's a topic we'll we'll need to do more consideration on as as we move forward but thank you for raising that okay the next question we have I think is from Toby Toby are you still here well yeah oh okay thank you would solar EV charging placed in disadvantaged community parking lots stations be um that's a that's an interesting one um I the way that I am reading the opportunity announcement it seems like it's not focused on Transportation but is really focused on on households on um uh so I don't think that's an angle we have considered so far um that is certainly something we could take a close look at the opportunity announcement and and see if it would be permissible but um I would just add that well it's solar it's distributed in the parking lots of a disadvantaged community it's consistent to that goal we could structure the finance where a single entity takes care of all the finance and let the people just have it for free and because it doesn't touch a grid or any other utility really small footprint kind of very so we could place these in a very distributed fashion and you just uh maybe Target even level two charging which would be great for people who park for a while people who work or for shopping and that way it's it it doesn't save the world with DC fast charge but it does add really quite extensive value some like even five kilowatts puts quite a bit of range into a level two so those were the reasons why it kind of overlaps I realized it's for residential but with such a distributed parking lot type of approach you don't have to touch roofs or any other complicated Regulatory Affairs but yeah that is an interesting idea my my initial impression is that it most likely wouldn't because we wouldn't be able to demonstrate the minimum um Savings in quite the way that I think the EPA is is envisioning but um thank you thank you for raising that I think we'll definitely um at least take a second look well thank you okay the next one is from veto in regards how the program will handle getting savings to residents of a subsidized household can Oregon get a Statewide waiver from that is a fantastic question I think um if Rob is available I'd love to try to bounce this one over in his Direction that's a good question I'm not sure I fully understand it but in the way in which our programs currently work and the way that we're proposing the single family program the rebates go through a contractor and so they essentially are um upfront reductions in in Project costs and if we do this correctly in the low income space we'll have little or no um Financial involvement with the actual homeowner so I don't know if that starts to get at the question I see that Ryan and Evan are both on screen so if they have a more to add I would welcome their thoughts yeah Ryan if you have something sure yeah in the in the Oregon Community solar program space um we've got a clarification from HUD that the bill credits that customers receive do not count as income and so the utility allowance issues fortunately sidestepped with the Oregon Community solar program so um residents in affordable housing properties any Resident that pays their own utility bill can enroll just as a subscriber in the Oregon Community solar program and receive the benefits for residents that don't pay their own utility bill if the housing provider pays it on their behalf there's also a mechanism for the housing provider to receive the benefits and then pay the majority of those benefits um through a separate payment to the resident so there is kind of a pathway there specifically in the the Oregon Community solar contexts um but for for single for on-site installations would be could be a bit yeah and I would maybe invite Vito to to unmute as I he might be the expert in the room here on this topic but we struggled through solar on multi-family affordable housing for for a few years and it's been a while since I've looked at this topic and my assumption is that it boils down to who the funding entity is of that specific property and so a HUD subsidized property might be treated a little bit differently than if it's a low income housing tax credit property versus if it's a USDA Rural Development subsidized property um and I did get a similar takeaway from what Ryan just said that um if it is a kilowatt hour Bill credit on a utility bill um it is not income but if your rent plus utilities is calculated as part of your total cost of housing and your utilities go down um it could raise your rent in some instances so it's definitely a component to build into a program if we're addressing multi-family and veto if you have more clarification I'd please love to hear it you guys hit on all the issues I I think with Community solar it's easier we found in Illinois that we can effectively work with HUD to to not recognize Bill credits from Community solar as income so that they're not raising rents or reallocating so I think that there's a way to do it just sort of State wide HUD is love to do any kind of blanket statements or rules but they will work with States and programs so far for Community solar so it sounds like you've already had that established for the existing program which should be easy enough to extend to solar for all it does get more challenging though uh if you're if you're working with subsidized multi-family uh with distributor generation there was an example earlier you gave where you were able to do things like shift to a Master Meter and take away the bills which which is great I mean in other states utilities will fight tooth and nail not to let that happen so if you can pull that off I think that's you know that that's a practical way of doing it but you still have to look at the subsidized housing allocations and we're still battling that sort of issue in Illinois so I didn't know you guys had thought about it or you know have any solutions I I think we're going to lean on our year of planning to figure out some of these questions and then maybe as we Loop in Oregon Housing and Community um a little more they may have some uh good Insight you know I will just point out that um you know folks that are in affordable housing are are receiving a subsidy and a benefit already and there is a lot of um organs population that is not receiving that benefit so um you know there there can be an equity consideration to reaching further Beyond affordable housing with this program um but it will certainly be a component Vito while you have the mic do you want to speak to your community owned model as well um that you",

is hanley jenkins and i reviewed the minutes and we have a revised set that were provided on the 22nd of this month we've had some discussions about an additional revision to that so i would move that we approve the minutes with the following amendment on page 11 fourth paragraph at the end of the paragraph we would add content express concern about the time it has taken to to satisfactory resolution of this of the issues identified in the complaints submitted by the farmers the time it has taken for a satisfactory resolution there we with that amendment i would recommend i move that we approve the minutes presented on the 22nd of this month and thank you thank you cindy any further discussion or questions about the minutes and the motion hearing none mr secretary please call the role mercy grill ken howe jordan fruit henley jenkins yes perry choctew cindy conan yes motion carries man i'm sure thank you mr secretary next on the agenda is the council secretary report mr secretary it's you thank you madam chair i will start with project updates on february 2nd perennial power holdings issued a press release indicating they would terminate their site certificate for bernie win state perennial wind chaser station the 415 megawatt natural gas fire power plant in umatilla county just west of hermiston we have had discussions with perennial power since they've issued their press release but they have yet to submit their proposed retirement plan or their request to terminate their site certificate however we do expect both to come in relatively soon any questions on that before i move on okay seeing um next on my list is the bigelow canyon wind farm in the past two weeks we've received notification from portland general electric the site certificate holder that there were two reportable incidences at the bigelow canyon wind this project is located sherman county the first was a blade liberation event at 2 11 am on february 1st a blade detached from a turbine in the phase one area of the project and was thrown approximately 100 yards into an adjacent wheat field there were no injuries or property damage and the landowners have been engaged and informed the blade does not appear to have struck the tower and the other two blades and the turbine do not appear to be damaged pge has shut down all of the turbines within that phase of the project while they investigate the cause of the after the report was in uh the incident was reported to us the department did have a call with lena cope who's the senior environmental specialist with pge on february 10th who walked us through the incident and just a couple of items of note that came out of that is the pg will be consulting with the turbine manufacturer to see what guidelines they have before returning all of the phase one turbines to operation and then their current plan which is still under development is to torque a represented number of the phase one turbines to see if there is movement on the hub or pitch bearing bolts and additionally pge's metallurgist took a new bolt and 50 of the failed bolts that attached the the blade to the nacelle to run the test to determine if the failure had anything to do with the torque or the material so the bearing the damaged blade will be removed and sent to western machine in portland for testing so this incident is still clearly under investigation in trying to figure out what caused the blade to detach from the wind turbine any questions okay the second event at bigelow canyon another transformer failure i believe that would be the 10th that occurred at 10 pm or around 10 pm on february 15th it's estimated that approximately 166 gallons of non-pcb transformer oil has been released onto the surrounding gravel pg is contracted with u.s ecology to assist with the cleanup and the spill has been reported to deq so if you the council requested pge come present the prior nine incidences of transformer failure at the february january council meeting and so this occurred shortly thereafter okay moving to my next update which is cardi generating station on february 3rd we received amendment number three for the carter generating station this project includes an operational 450 megawatt natural gas fire power plant as well as an approved but not yet constructed 50 megawatt solar component portland general electric is the site certificate holder for this project as well and the project is located in morrow county amendment three requests to extend the beginning and ending construction time frames for the solar component by three there are no other additional no physical changes being proposed to the facility simply a change in the beginning and ending construction timelines for the solar component portland general electric has also requested that the amendment be reviewed under the type d the amendment request is posted to the project website we send a notice of our receipt of the amendment request and the type b review request on february 16th okay next is the nolan hills wind power this proposed project includes 350 megawatts of wind as well as 260 megawatts of solar and 120 megawatts of battery storage and the applicant is capital power projects would be located in umatilla the application was deemed complete on january 31st and kate sloan who a senior sighting analyst with the department who is the project lead held a virtual public information meeting on the evening of february 16th in addition to department staff council member condon and the applicant team there were 17 uh sort of non you know department council or people who participated in the meeting so a decent showing not a lot of comments or questions but uh there was sort of at least we had good participation in terms of watching the presentations and since then we have posted the meeting slides as well as the video recording of the meeting onto the project website so even if somebody did go to the meeting when it was live they can go back and review it if they want all right project update is the golden hills wind so this is a 200 megawatt wind project that is currently in construction and located in sherman county on february 16 2022 compliance officer dwayne killsdonk and escp specialist kevin woodhouse conducted a site inspection where erosion and topsoil management conditions were documented as being substantially improved from prior conditions observed in december following the january fsec meeting the certificate holder contacted the department and proposed additional corrective action measures as part of its corrective action plan including offering soil enhancements to all affected land owner and tenant farmers paying for landowner seating if pacific holder the certificate holder seating was not preferred adding a long-term soil monitoring and evaluation component to the revegetation providing to the department documented completion of reclamation satisfactory to the landowner and if this documentation cannot be obtained and executed settlement agreement to compensate for top soil and crop damage due to failed topsoil management excess disturbance and erosion impacts the department is working with its consultant on review of the proposed measures and will continue to work closely with that consultant the oregon department of agriculture and the certificate holder on the corrective action plan components any questions moving on to future meetings so the next scheduled council meeting is march 17th and 18th but unless something occurs during today's meeting that would necessitate having a march meeting uh we will not be needing to have a march meeting so um if unless that comes out during today's meeting the the march meeting is essentially cancelled and then following that would be april 22nd and uh 21st and 22nd would be the following meeting and we will at least need to have a one-day meeting which would be the 22nd in april so currently i have all council members available for that meeting if that has changed or does change between now and then please let either nancy or myself know so we can make the necessary adjustments todd this is marcy i just wanted to i'm sorry i my brain feels so still just acknowledged dwayne's efforts i know we all had a lot of comments um last time and the fact that he continues to",

        "text": " true um those grants are highly competitive The Residency grants uh national competition as you know there were seven to ten Across the Nation so you know one of the strategies that we took you know when we looked at what's eligible for funding under these the resiliency grants and things that we're talking about undergrounding of uh electrical lines and some of these other things are very expensive we put those into a large National Grant award because it we just can't do much for the states on so we're going to get you know exposure to limited dollars if you have 10 million a year um well I think we can do microgrids for emergency resilience centers and and critical equipment and stuff like that with with the funds um so that that's the strategy we're taking that you know what can we do with the state funds and make an impact versus what could we do with the federal funds that make an impact so um you know that's probably what we're going to submit uh for this event that some of our like I said the larger prior qualifier protection things we're doing on a national Grant um so I would like that to be considered you know we're going to review these applications yeah that's um thanks for that comment and yesterday we heard yeah we had a lot of discussion about um focusing in on critical facilities and that being one of the primary Community benefits that you can flow through this program and so um ensuring backup power to those facilities to certainly get a score of the community benefits points that we could talk about yesterday so um we were in The Narrative we adopted as much of the broad Federal language as we could to keep all options open so I would say it it this is the what we hear from folks that we would like to make this uh microbrews especially for you know battery backup and critical facilities part of the program but that's definitely on the table that would be perfectly allowable use of bugs we have one question uh from Thomas elzinga about when usdue is going to respond to Odo about the expanded eligibility criteria I wonder if Emily could jump in on that question because I'm not sure if she may not be maybe just waiting sure yeah like if you if you can hear me yes okay perfect um we're we're anticipating and I say anticipating uh Loosely receiving some feedback hopefully you know by the end of the summer um the U.S department of energy has a little bit of a different timeline and some other things going on that things have been moving a little bit slowly with them it feels like so um that's our hope but we we really don't have any promises from them in terms of exact thank you Emily and Thomas I see you you raised your hand would you like to come up uh off mute and lay in on that can you hear me okay yes thank you great awesome thank you very much I appreciate that thanks for this opportunity to to to to discuss everything yeah so I uh uh uh just like uh some of the other previous comments that have been made in regards to the kind of the national um this National opportunity announcement that came out I know that we had tried to participate with some some other larger utilities on some stuff but but we didn't quite meet I guess what what are some of their some of their thresholds for for uh for some of our projects and I guess I just I just want to understand I mean there there's a lot of great things on here we're we're trying to do a lot of these things that are on this on these eligible activities list but I guess I guess I just really want to understand and I know some of the the details are still in discussion or at least up with USD usdoe for review as well but trying to understand that threshold from from like yes this is going to go and no this is not um and and I kind of saw that that kind of objective list and it sounds like that so that stuff's still getting you know decided or still in discussion but I just really want to understand a little bit more or maybe there isn't anything more now but just really what's what's that threshold that's going to push us over for some of these things because I feel like we're almost right there but maybe we are over the the the Oregon you know doe uh threshold but maybe not the federal I don't know okay can you hear us now okay great we're back on okay okay I don't know that was missed but um yeah just that um Thomas that that's a good kind of precursor into the next this meeting where we're going to talk about the criteria for this program for selecting um right now it's it's a blank slate and we're hoping to get input from all of our stakeholders on how we should select these projects and that oh no for this program will manage all of the federal requirements internally and when we get to the point of the competitive review and the final negotiation of a contract with an awardee we're going to try to make all those Federal requirements as easy as possible for both thank you does that answer the question yeah can we take Thomas off mute again yes thank you can you hear me again okay okay uh yeah no Rob that that actually does answer quite a bit maybe just one one little follow-up question this is a point of clarification um uh so so basically if I understand correctly the we will the I guess we will be submitting projects you guys uh Oda will will manage you know meeting all the federal requirements and then it still is a competitive Grant afterwards to see to make to see if the state net or everyone under the state uh uh Grant is going to be able to or are going to be able to apply and get that is that correct so there's still like a competitive nature to this still yet even though we might be accepted into the state deal yeah we will have all the complete competitive review at Ono and so the state will manage the selection of projects and everything that we select in that review will automatically qualify for the federal requirements if we do our job perfect thank you thank you Thomas we had one uh one question from Martina with renewable hydrogen Alliance um can you elaborate on whether fuel cells fuel cell systems count as new generation under eligible measures you know I was thinking of that question when I heard that she was on the line and I was thinking to myself would hydrogen qualify as a storage technology or a generation technology and I don't have an answer to that but we can dig into the regulations on all closely and see if there's a an opening there yeah so I think we should dig into it but my record from one this came up before was that it depends on how the project is designed like if the hydrogen is being used in the project as stores you kind of have to document the purpose of it but we can um I think we should double check and get back to you too yeah thank you for that Martino are there any other questions from anyone participating virtually or anybody in the room Andy collector columbia-based from live cricket small utility these are when you have listed theirs is everything we struggle with um from a from a cost perspective we have limited funding as everybody has I'm not going to say that people don't have that but but every little bit for these projects um the downside that we have is we have 1300 miles of line uh with 2 700 members in 4 000 meters um so do you do the math on that we're very low density or kind it's low operation so the community benefit of that side of it is is somewhat limited when you when you start talking about hundreds of thousands of people versus 10 people um and that makes it even more difficult because the cost benefit from our perspective is it's it's pretty hard to put in you know 10 miles of underground four and hitting 15 houses along that way and make it to where it's a project that we would end up doing but these funds would be perfect along those lines yeah that um we heard a similar we had a similar discussion yesterday about whether or not the number of people served was a good criteria in the program and then if it's decided that that is a good criteria that it should be also balanced with vulnerability within a system so that it's not writing all the projects to higher population um you know service territories so it's going to be one of the challenges to balance that in the criteria so you can help us through that I don't know question and I'll just base it on a percentage of cost to Consumer at the end if they had to pay for the project in their race you know the allocation is based on that and the rate case or whenever you have to pass a long call so if you got 4 000 customers in your entire system anything that you do is going to impact the customers a lot more than a higher density populated area you know that's a really good point yeah that could help the smaller sparsely populated service territory maybe rise but the other consideration is too is that you can't make it so that you got one guy that's going to get the benefit of the service enhancement you know and then you know because that doesn't make any sense so it's going to have to be uh you know thrown out at that consideration in my opinion because it's a do you certain well one one yeah good points as long as it's not a business customer that's the other aspect too you know some of the desired here though that we like building more room some potential constraints to growth so those communities and future Vitality in this community and then you would make any potentially being more so into the deaf criteria proposition for them doesn't even know I mean just like thinking yeah so you have the Administration I mean that's just yeah you know I mean we see so many communities that are you know their low population that they're absolutely constrained because they don't get the investment that they made in order to be able to do and I especially to see the amounts of the young people in this community so you don't even have obviously based on see Peter Potter it comes into play where you have too much of a matrix right to try to absorb you know so if you're looking at plan growth or anything then you have to start looking at the open Urban growth District or the you know land use commission plans or whatever and then you're starting that okay well how long a process do you want needs to be a simplified template you know",

        "text": "iv to that one was relating to the approval criteria that Mr Bishop talked about in terms special development standards so special development standards are essentially just standards that may not necessarily apply to every property so not every property for example is really Steep and needs to do technical analysis not everything FL plan zone so it just kind of points out some of those specific standards um that would apply anyway those stands would be covered under the approval criteria just meet all provisions of the UDC we received uh comments from the langage committee from scan um which General support is that they did not support changes to the new store process and they requested several changes to mixed use SS and the shortterm r um the new historic process that Bry Mr Bishop explained is optional so the process today to go through the historical landmarks commission is retained under proposed changes but an applicant could choose to go through an administrative process so the usive process is still available as an option the changes to the mixed zones have to do minimum Heights uh of the ground floor and those zones while they were established I think in 2018 and we expanded them through the r project they're just beginning to see see development occur in them so staff will continue to track those to see if there are any um barriers or any you know reasons that we might need to change some of those standards as development keeps occurring so we wanted to take a holistic look at those Mixon instead of just looking at these two that were mentioned by by scan um in addition we are actually we're in the process of have a housing production strategy where we will be looking specifically at barriers to housing production including regulatory barriers so these are regulatory to housing we will come back with those changes um on short-term nals the request was to prohibit them in residential zones um the staff did take a staff report to the city council earlier this year with some policy options around short-term ruls including prohibiting them um council did not direct staff to make changes in terms of prohibiting them that asked us to essentially hire a third party vendor to better track them like where are these short-term rentals so we can come back with some actual information before we have a recommendation to Ching what those are about so staff recommend uh recommend HC and the commission recommend that city council accept first reading of an ordinance to amend the rights excellent thank you very much um do questions concerning the canopies understand Street sidewalk also no it's always Street BAS I've got some okay okay um so I've just been taking down some notes um as we were going through the presentation so I'm just kind of referring to the staff report um I'm wondering about um the adjustments see allowing adjustments for mix use properties in Cate areas um are there any historic districts that exist Within These um zones that you're uh suggesting not have this adjustment standard anymore or we will be allowing adjustments in districts or individual yeah I guess either C Zone and our residential zones and the Public Public exp districts but individually listed resources I wouldn't knower change okay but if there was some sort of um design standard that was under 230 then the historic landmarks commission would be taking that adjustment under consideration that's kind of where that would fall in well so um if it so the the Amendments I was speaking about in presentation they apply only to applications for new housing units are being Creed so if the proposal does not include new housing units then it's just the same process that been you know with the landmarks commission so it's only if you're doing any kind of addition or an alteration or new construction that's creating new that's when this offer type two process comes in and the ability for an applicant to ask for an adjustment to the standard rather than like how it today you go to it'd be a major review because it does meet the standards in those guidelines instead okay great great that makes sense um I think just like kind of a general question um about the presentation could you go into detail about what so I what I understand a lot of this um change is coming from requirements from State law can you tell us what um if anything is kind of above and beyond those minimum requirements well so in terms of um you know the say you know the stuff his store that is you know just the minimum above and beyond requirements nothing you know at this point you know in terms of the criteria that's we were just looking at the criteria for land divisions interview uh there's there could be other things that one people might not but we're looking at the criteria specifically for subdivisions partitions Andy okay so kind of maybe with the except exception of some of these little cleanup items most of these things are specifically being required by the changes in state law uh no you know like allowing veterinary services and animal gring it's just we've heard from this reining process that is you know important state to allow for Investments and processes so I the majority is corre yeah the changes to allow one and two family in a m building in the mid zones that comes out of local concerns questions development um same with allowing adus with town houses that's not a requirement it's just an additional allowance that we've heard okay perfect um let's see I think I think a couple of questions that came up for me about the CB Zone specifically because it sounds like we're doing um some more specific design standards about like canopy and addings is an aing going to be a requirement downtown or is it just if they want to do an an aing It has to be so big so you look at the amendments to the historic you know chapters there's standards for contributing non contributing Comm commercial or districts uh if it is U you know those are to deal with if you are doesn't require like 90% of the has have canes on because buildings might have had back in back in time during the period of significance that much canopies and awnings and the canopies and AWS could detract from the from the historical Integrity ofour same thing with Windows the building might not had that percentage of windows so we don't want to you know say that now changing mad you need to use 65% windows on your ground flow mad the percentage of the requirements 90% of Ked non and 65% ground Windows that's for M Construction so like the home hotel oring brand new building we want that building fit General character you know and I think it's SC to say that buildings downtown did have storefronts large windows and you know so you know having 65% and 90% cand coverage does align with both that and the greater SE Zone but if you're looking at existing resour making modifications this mainly for Windows is maintain the transparency changing you know you're not making them so they're they're not visible anymore and um and then making sure with canes mountings if you were to add one and it can be supported by historical evidence when existed you have the you don't have percentage length of it but we make sure it's at least six feet in depth and 8T the side line okay great so there's some um allowances in the new proposals for like hisor building and contributing teaches if they don't match exactly what is in two standards okay perfect that was one of my questions I don't think I have any other questions do any other Commissioners oh commissioner Morris um so I see this came through as a question from the West neighborhood association and I'm interested in some type of an illumination on how this is going to work as a design professional I'm sure as um as developers would approach this um what is as adjustments move away from award you from a commission and become administrative what what are the guard rails in place so that it is Obed so that we have sort of consistent application of decision making and how is that going to be transparent and put out so we always know we can have kind of a similar response if this is be pursued on multiple project types there be your plan administrator um well there are approval criteria for adjustments found in the code so the general um criteria is that it's equally or better meeting the intent of the standard so for example Landscaping zero Landscaping right so have to go through that um we do send notice and receive comments supports approved and then it is aable so it can go public hearing process um with the adjustments um we we've taken most things out of public hearing review so maybe not for the 10 year Commissioners that are here now but for example used to come design instead of adjustment one stand they could me we have a public hearing um most of our all of our mix before R Salem had standards and guidelines so the only way to have any standard that's planing commission and that was changed um so it's not a new process as for the planning Division and the zoning code you know going to be new for historic but it's really what we've done with the rest of the code as far as if the um hlc wants like a quarterly report on adjustments that have been approved or copies of the decisions or something like that I'm sure we can work something out we can really um pi and I think we already postol the historic administrative decisions on the reir I can't remember what the rule is or why but I know they're there um and so we can provide that information um if the commission wants to be able to see that and see what the trends the adjustment process is is it's not a clear objective process in itself you know is you know under like the framework of clear objective standards you know if you you just either meet it or you don't and so if you can just meet the standard you objective path but projects notel projects can do that so we provide this you know limited land use discre limited land use decision limited discretion process and so um you know because it's it's appealable you know that it's you know I don't know if we can standardize ever it depends on the burden you know what the quot standards can adjust how they're demonstrating you know the deviation from the standards being that likely set they're better um you know through you know loning up for that set back in another creative fashion so so there's inh discreption involved in decision you know to approve an adjust um so there is that element in terms of um having C objective standards you know historic chapter you those standards are chapter 230 and and um you know those you know if you the standard them and appli can",

        "text": "morning everyone thank you so much for being here at the Oregon Department of Energy's public hearing on our application to the U.S department of Energy's grid resilience program for those of you I haven't met my name is Janine Benner and I'm the director of the Oregon Department of energy and I'm really pleased to be here today uh today's meeting is uh specifically to discuss a program created in the infrastructure investment jobs act under Section 40101d and this is actually our second hearing on the topic the previous hearing was held last August and since that time the application deadline was extended by the U.S department of energy we've learned a lot more details from the U.S department of energy and we've been able to receive feedback from interested parties on the initial ideas that we presented back then in August um the uh program narrative and public hearing today covers our revised approach to this program and it also covers excuse me two state allocations providing what we refer to as our first and second year funding all at one time so this means that we are anticipating being able to award more funds in this in this initial year than in the years that follow because of the format of this webinar and the number of people in attendance we have everyone muted currently all the attendees but as we go through the presentation we'll pause for questions and at that point people can raise their hands and we'll be able to unmute you to ask questions we'd also encourage you to use the chat function on WebEx if you have questions you want to put in writing and then at the end we'll have dedicated time for further questions and public comments so in addition to responding during this webinar you can also enter your thoughts and feedback through an online portal that we've set up if you would like more space to respond more time to consider your responses or if you don't feel comfortable speaking out at a meeting like this I will ask my colleague Jen to put the link to the portal in the chat so that you will have it available for you and it will be open through the end of this week we've got a pretty quick turnaround on this particular opportunity so you'll see that in the chat in a moment and I'm hoping Jen can also put a link in the chat to the narrative that we are going to go through today and asking people for feedback on so in a minute I'm going to go over some Logistics on how to use WebEx but at this point I would ask everyone including the Oregon Department of energy staff on the line to please introduce themselves in the chat so if you can just enter your name and if there's an organization you're affiliated with we'd be really happy to see who's here with us this morning next slide please okay so for those of you who are new to WebEx here's a quick guide on how to use some of the features as I mentioned before attendees are off camera and muted but our host will unmute you if we call on you to ask questions you can see the option to raise your hand on both the right hand side of your screen under participants under the participants panel if you click near your name there's also an option at the bottom of your screen where you can see a visual of a hand in the reactions bar as I mentioned feel free to use the chat function to ask questions or make comments and if you do that please send to all panelists or to everyone so that all of the Odo staff can see the question and help respond we'll try to get to as many questions in the chat and through raised hands as we can but we may not have time for all of them today please notice that we will keep a record of that and try to follow up with you where possible I also noticed um I don't if we have people who called in on the phone you can press star six to raise your hand and star three to unmute yourself when we call on you so I also want to make sure that folks know that today's hearing is being and that a list of attendees will also be posted to our website later today I know it's hard for attendees to see the list of other attendees so we'll make sure to get that on our website all right hopefully that is clear and by now people have used all these different uh next slide please so here's the agenda there's a lot to get through today in the first part of today's meeting is going to focus on the grid resilience funding opportunity in the inflation excuse me in the investment infrastructure investment and jobs act the way that Congress and the usdoe structure the program and the requirements that fall to Odo on behalf of the state to submit an application my colleague Emily salmery who is our new federal grants officer will be leading this part of the presentation the second part of the presentation will be information about the state's approach and my colleague Rob Del Mar from our planning and Innovation division will be speaking about the specifics of Oregon's program then finally we will look for your feedback on the state's approach so we'll try to stop and ask for questions during the presentation but please know that many of your questions may be answered as we go through the materials so feel free to hold those till the end my colleague Jen Center our other grants officer will be helping to keep an eye on the chat as we go through the presentation and finally my colleague Linda Ross is our host today and we'll be helping also to keep an eye open for questions we are joined by some team members from a consulting firm called Hagerty Consulting who are assisting Odo with planning for this application and program launch and we'll introduce the project managers for hegarty at the end of the presentation next slide please okay before we jump into the grid resilience fund stuff a quick introduction to the Oregon Department of energy or Odo as you might hear us referred to on this slide you see our vision mission and what we do our mission is to help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable Energy System we advance solutions to shape an equitable clean energy transition protect the environment and public health and responsibly balance energy needs and impact current and future under the what we do section on this slide you'll see the services we provide and how we achieve our mission and this funding opportunity that we're discussing today will certainly help Odo support a more resilient and affordable Energy System in Oregon next slide please so before I turn it over to Emily just to highlight the three objectives that we have for our time together today first we want to make sure that you understand how this grid resilience funding works and the parameters that Odo has to work within when designing the state's program the is a huge opportunity to bring federal dollars to Oregon to help make our electric grid more resilient second we want to share with you our revised approach for this funding and what we're planning to put in our application to the U.S department of this approach has been developed over the past nine months in close consultation with the Oregon Public Utility Commission and it's informed by Outreach with experts working in this we want to especially thank those of you that submitted information through our previous public hearing and comment session last August and our request for information conducted in December consider that feedback and made adjustments to our approach from last summer but even with those adjustments we still want to hear from you on the program design and application and get your ideas for how to improve it today remember the draft proposal that we're sharing with you with you today is just that it's a draft we do want input and feedback to make it better to align with work already being done by utilities and others and to better meet the objectives outlined in the federal funding as I mentioned earlier we will have time for verbal public comment at the end and we also hope people will submit written comments through our online portal if you don't want to or don't get a chance to speak today or if you have more to say again that portal will be open to the end of the week our application is due to the US Department of energy at the end of the month so we are working to get this all wrapped up pretty next slide please all right and now I would like to turn this over to Emily salmery who will share more information on the federal bill that created this opportunity Emily thank you Janine and good morning everyone the program that we're talking about today is specifically funded funded excuse me under the infrastructure investment and jobs act this piece of legislation includes 62 billion dollars from the U.S department of energy to deliver a more Equitable clean energy future for the American people by investing in American manufacturing and workers expanding access to Energy Efficiency and clean energy for families communities and businesses delivery and reliable clean and affordable power to more Americans and building the Technologies of tomorrow through clean energy additionally this program like other Federal Energy programs is covered by the justice 40 initiative this Federal initiative directs 40 of the benefits should flow to disadvantaged communities back to Eugenie thanks Emily uh after the passage of both the infrastructure investment and jobs act at the end of last year and the inflation reduction actually I guess it was that more than the end of last year got my years mixed up but after that bill and the inflation reduction act last summer um Odo recognized that the state would be receiving millions of dollars from the federal government to invest in clean energy Energy Efficiency and resilience among many other important opportunities so through a series of public webinars discussions with our energy advisory work group and other interested parties we developed the principles that you see on this slide to help guide our overall approach to the federal funding for all of the programs in addition to grid resilience so I won't read all of these word for word but you can see that we are hoping to consider Equity at every step and that includes Geographic diversity we want to make sure that the benefits of this funding make it to the oregonians who need it most and are distribute it equitably around the state in designing the programs and distributing funding we will coordinate with tribal governments as much as possible and communicate clearly inclusively and efficiently to ensure that stakeholders in the public are informed and supported where possible and where internal resources allow we hope to provide technical assistance to build community capacity and support Grant recipients there's actually a position funded in the governor's requested budget to help us do this we're working across agencies to leverage expertise and support historically underinvested",

        "text": " 33 current planning uh grantees submitted for construction funding uh in this third opportunity round that represents 67% of our current grantees uh some of those have not completed their planning they're in that final stage of doing their project reports and their final documentation so that's how they were in a position uh to have the information necessary to be able to move their projects into construction so that's uh very very exciting it has also Amplified the competitiveness this has always been an excellent competitive program um but the uh competitiveness for the projects moving into competitive review has really gone up another notch and we're really excited for getting into that process for this third round if we could go to the next slide please and so as just a quick breakdown uh construction resilience recommends or uh uh equals out to 35 5.2 million in requests construction Renewables sits at about 10.1 in requests uh and then planning projects combined uh represent just a little over 1.5 million uh in requests and I'm going to go ahead and toss it to my colleague Patricia for some additional information on round three okay next slide please um for the the round three applicant type summary there were uh the the types of organizations that applied were um tribe there were three tribes two consumer owned utilities Seven Counties 24 cities and 39 other public bodies um of with a variety of of schools community colleges water and fire districts next slide please um energy resilience use cases included a range of responses to energy disrup disruption events such as heating and cooling for Emergency Shelters powering emergency response centers power for First Response responder facilities drinking water availability and cooling food storage meaning food banks and distribution facilities next slide please uh notable Technologies included solar battery storage micr grids hydrogen hydrogen meaning small SP small scale renewable energy production storage and electricity generation for emergency power biomass and inline hydro and geothermal exchange next slide and then several of the applications include grid tide battery storage systems to provide Power for Peak grid demand periods next slide please all right um as as we said we're trying to move it along just a little bit here so we can get into the rule changes as well but uh just wanted to stop for a moment and see if there's any questions uh that our advisory committees have on the third on the first two rounds or our current grantees or round three so we'll go ahead and give that a moment and Patricia you'll have to tell me I can't see see all of the background screens if we have a hand raised or a comment come through no questions well hopefully we can at least get a thumbs up uh from everybody for the uh excitement of round three and those planning projects coming through as well as uh some really really exciting projects that are coming through for that third round um Patricia had me mentioned the hydrogen one which is a very interesting project uh utilizing uh one of our first instances of utilizing hydron as a potential energy storage within one of our projects so uh lots of very very Innovative uh engaging projects that have come through without giving too much away a couple of floating solar uh at wastewater treatment facilities uh and then as Patricia had mentioned um a new influx of battery storage in conjunction with the utilities for demand response during Peak periods so we do have some really really exciting projects that are coming forward we can't wait to announce uh these latest winners when we meet again um but with that uh without having any questions there I want to quickly turn it over uh to my colleague James to walk through our proposed uh rule changes for the program so take good away James thanks Jason all right I just want to start off with a very brief overview of um the previous legislative session um for this program so Senate Bill 1525 from uh the last session amended the program by including partner costs into what is considered the cost to plan construct an installer project uh the bill also further defined what is considered an electric cooperative for the purposes of the program um one of the main one of the main change was to add in the ability for Odo to release an additional 30% of a Grant's funds if the grantee meets certain Provisions specified in rule which we're now in the process of outlining and I'll kind of outline the whole payment Pro um kind of division of payments as well as I go through that rule um so you can see what how that add additional 30% can falls in the uh in the um program um so when incorporating the amendments to the um from the legislative session into rules Odo is proposing additional language changes to assist in implementing those changes um so with the inclusion of partner costs into the definition of plan and project costs um Odo is proposing to clarify the role of a partner as well um So currently a partner is defined as an entity listed as a partner to an eligible applicant on an application for a grant um and a partner may be a federally veganized Oregon Indian tribe public body nonprofit entity private business with a business site in Oregon or uh owner of a rental property in Oregon Odo is proposing further defining that definition by stating that a partner May assist or take a lead role in the acquisition installation construction or planning of a community renewable energy project uh that a partner can have Financial or ownership interest in the project um the definition would also clarify that an entity whose only role is provision of goods and services through a procurement contract would not be considered a partner um also proposing that a written be in place between the applicant and any partner before any release of funds under performance agreement with Odo um for those kind of um performance agreements entered into in the future um the written agreement uh would be required to include certain key Provisions uh from the performance agreement between Odo and the applicant provision such as the ability to photo to inspect the project site or audit do any advisory committee members have any questions about the potential rule changes on this slide and we can Circle back to any um if any questions do pop up okay so the amendment to add an additional release of Grant fund for construction projects provided the ability for Odo to establish requirements for the release of funds in the rule um currently the first 30% of grant funding may be released um if upon entering the performance agreement the applicant demonstrates um having taken meaningful steps to seek site control um and having filed a request for interconnection with host utility um or appropriate transmission provider and met any of the requirements provided uh in the performance agreement such as kind of demonstrated use of funds a need for the funds um and so that's the initial 30% and that's currently what is available for construction projects uh with the remainder um remaining funds released upon completion of the projects and any final reporting requirements so this additional um 30% is going to be the 30% at the beginning uh once they meet those requirements and then additional 30% once they meet these um proposed um and so the current proposals that we uh have come up with are that the applicant or partner has fulfilled all the requirements for the release of the first 30% so that's the filed inter request for interconnection and taking meaningful steps to seek site control and um other requirements in the agreement um and then that the grantee demonstrates that they or a partner has incurred a minimum of 25% of projected Grant monies on eligible costs prior to requesting this additional funding so they've already uh spent some uh uh funds um on eligible costs um an updated project budget that did details eligible inable costs has been provided just to kind of so we can assess um progress on the project and um anticipated future costs for the project um and that the construction or installation of the renewable energy system has started at the project location or will start no later than 60 days after the submission of the request for Grant monies and not later than the required construction start update in the performance agreement so that's kind of um either it started or it's going to start in the next couple of months um so we can see that progress is being made with the pro uh the the project and then met any of the requirements provided by the department in the performance agreement and then the uh remaining funds as uh previously it would be released at the um completion of the project so once it's constructed in uh an operational and um commissioned and done the inspection reports and all the final report requirements have been submitted um so and then that they we then review and uh review those um so do any advisory committee members have any questions about the r changes on this slide um and so finally we're also proposing a few other amendments um these just to outline that um fixed costs incurred in the normal cost of business such as existing staff salaries or overhead uh would be considered ineligible Pro uh costs for project construction costs uh this is already the case for planning we just kind of wanted to outline there would be the cases for project costs the construction um costs and then also to um currently we have a requirement in the rules that um during the application um stage that uh applications can't be amended during an open opportunity announcement we would just kind of um with the online application system uh we able we have the ability to um allow so uh them to be amended so this would um if we remove that restriction we could then allow um applications to be amended during an open opportunity announcement um any questions on this or any of the other rules we've gone um okay I will hand it back off to Jason then thank you very much all right thanks James um if you don't mind uh going to the next slide please uh we will go ahead and start to move in with uh We've we've sort of had uh ongoing or in process uh discussion with our advisory committee so uh we are going to keep that open for a couple more minutes to see if there's any questions that have come up from our committee members and then move on into our public comment period uh just wanted to make sure that uh that for public comments that you raise your hand ahead of time if you want to make a comment um and we will definitely get to that as we move into that section and obvious and then could you go to the next slide please and this one we've already really been doing but as we go through these meetings if when if and when possible uh we'd definitely appreciate it if uh when you are making a comment and you and",

        "text": ". to adolescence So I always like to listen to your comments to guide me a little I think there are very good things in what has just been presented well first Thank you very much for mentioning it out of 50 more and for all the wonderful programs that we have in the city I think There are very good things happening. Is there any other question for Josh about this topic. Thank you, President. I remember seeing at the beginning of the year. Well, maybe in September, that the Edge Rap program was about to disappear. And I was quite surprised we were just celebrating the success. of the program and I was not surprised not to see in the budget Does anyone know what happened to that rap program And what is going to happen regarding its return Good afternoon again Sorry, there is the program made into rap Well, rather when we talk about it disappearing, no It's so much that it left, but that it changed its focus and its form, the budget amount decreased and that is partly because we have had challenges due to covid, locating people, finding places for them to stay in the private market and also because they have there have been resources available through the State different supports that we have received and that we have been using instead of what we used this approach has the objective is now to help people who can participate from earlier stages that they can stabilize and move on to navigation center that they stabilize in that environment and then move on to permanent housing again does not mean that it disappeared simply the approach was Okay thank you I'm glad that we were able to answer very well very good it is a good program any other questions We will have time at the final so if it occurs to you later do not hesitate to say it Kelly could you help us with the atmosphere part Good evening it is a pleasure to be with you as George said I am Candy Line Dembow and I am budget manager for the city it is a pleasure to be before you introducing you the budget for the natural environment area the resources have to do with public works monitoring and education as already said on page 177 the topic of programs begins and you can find more information about services and positions in that same section this area has more of $24.9 million in proposed funding for four major programs the water treatment portion resource management area quality monitoring compliance with federal state permits and working toward action plan goals there are several positions that provide water-related services environment those scheduled about the environment and the changes we have made for this section the fund wants to add new positions in this area one with one limited position and three full-time positions The limited management one is going to support the water permitting department of quality and that consists of a maintenance operator to support with the maintenance needs of water infrastructure and assets of natural areas, one to provide support for the rainwater infrastructure and another operator to support cleaning and sweeping the streets at night. We moved from trustworthy and secure infrastructure for this budget and with that we had seven feet. We see this increase in this budget and we also have an engineering What happened and we reclassified her to a project woman to work on the action plan and the implementation activities and the budget has to do with funds to review stormwater codes and see standards to meet the new permit requirements and this stormwater master plan is going to be approved at the end of this year the projects projects for waste water, it will be mentioned if the pilot has functions, this will be installed in real time and it will give us characteristics of waste water to see contaminants that are added to the water and to see different treatment options for these waters an inventory of parks for the year 2024 to provide information on the condition of the species and in these parks according to the classifications these parks can be managed more closely Including those that are in poor condition and that are susceptible if these inventories have 38,000 action points mainly collecting this data on the rights of way this effort adds more trees to the streets and there are also maintenance projects And it is in the current budget to repair since it is concreted or replace mechanisms and also anticipate the incredible clarifications in other components that have to be removed from the sewage and managers are going to be carried out inside the tanks of their managers collect and dispose of this helps us drive the plant to put light to the plant and eliminates the slots and we also see these facilities to increase capacity for periods during the year where solids cannot be applied and with that we are ready for your questions and also to eliminate waste which I had to tell you what the counselor does today and I and we had the opportunity to take a tour and that place is amazing that place of the three We really saw this beautiful place and I was going to go with you but my children got sick afterwards we went together we stood there and said Wow it's incredible to see what I say this often because you can't understand what makes the city really work so let's go to those facilities like these to realize how many things are going on near us under our feet and also if you are interested in visit any of the facilities we will be delighted that you come to visit us and of course I am going to take you at your word because it is really surprising I have no questions I know I have one to start with because there are very good things and I feel that every time I I read I see another I know that counselor Barney and others there are things that are important that they are working on and I really member coen Yes thank you very much I have a question I'm just going to take them one by one because Willow Park is the Opera the city of Salem and is owned by the cities of Salem Yes then well page 83 that serves the urbanized areas of the eastern part of Salem those are cities and urbanized areas from the eastern part and these fall within the operation of Lake Huilao and this is shown within our budget this transfer of funds I know that Bryan is about to come to respond good evening everyone I am the director And yes they pay like all the users of those facilities everyone pays those who use those it is reflected in the budget no It is not shown separately it is simply added but it is included Thank you very much any other question very good we have a couple of technical issues here thanks for the answer the second question in we saw that we have a goal to have 38% of The canopy how are we doing in terms of the injured trees and I saw in that cover or in those awnings I saw that through the two we replanted some of the trees we want to see what happens with these statuses and the replanting and here and bad Ana is answering you can also answer this where we are in that process and involved with these awnings but I can answer questions as to how many trees were planted we lost about a thousand trees on the city streets due to the ice storm and the council approved hire four people to four people and six months after the program we had already achieved most of the objectives of planting the trees we had lost a thousand and we put new poles and we are going to continue planting more trees in this next year and part of it is established here and We also have to water the trees and we also have an We detected in Oregon that a PC was coming from Portland and it hurts the trees and there is a cup of the vascular system of the trees and in two years the trees die from this pest then we have We have a large population of these trees that we are very worried here in Sal because fifteen hundred trees in the city are going to be affected by this pest we are creating a program at this time it is not going to be shown in theaters for five years but we are working very closely with the odf and the oda to try to figure out how we can stop this plague from coming and to see the next steps we are going to remove and replace because the 99% mortality rate when it comes is going to affect everyone the trees in the city and if we want to save these trees it is going to be a period in which we can manage through herbicide injections and These are Ash Trees that we are talking about so it is very important those Ash Trees we want to keep them for several years and we We can do it through injections that are going to be cheaper than removing the tree. So we have to tell the management team and you that we finally have some ideas on how to handle it. The good news is that there is a lot of recent funding from the Federal Government that the odf will be able to access to help us with the fish in particular towards the Fresnos and as for the mantas, could someone talk about it yes odf is the reforestation department and Brian what I wanted to point out is that we have a program to Planting trees is not necessarily reflected in this area of \u200b\u200bwork, but we are going to get there next week and we have three hundred thousand dollars of investment to plant trees from the funds and we are treating trees. I don't have the numbers. We are earning every year in particular with the small trees that take longer to grow But we can get more information for you to give to you George and we can give it to you next week we have some questions Yes yes I have questions and I'm going to leave my week of my question of the trees for the other week I'm very very excited and I'm delighted to hear information about the Oregon micromaya does anyone have information about it I think we have some staff and Alan is reaching out to answer Yes good evening I'm Alien I'm the city engineer for this project for those of you who don't know is a gold energy department partnered with pg and is going to fund battery storage at Oxford Street and 22nd to store batteries and that is going to power a feeder for a building and that work is going to start at the end of this excuse me but I can't breathe that it's coming so fast talk we talk to us we are going to bring it to the city manager to sign",

        "text": "good afternoon and thanks for joining us we'll give folks a couple minutes to get on the call now that it's 12 noon and get started around 1202. okay i'll go ahead and get us started we have one of our um staff members who is up to speak is having some technical difficulties so if things get a little awkward in a couple minutes uh just know that that's why but i can probably handle taking care of his slides until we can get them on um so thank you so much to all of you for joining us today my name is christy split and i'm the oregon department of energy's government relations i'll facilitate our conversation today and i'd want to start by thanking maputa omeu areka and eweb uh for bringing all of us oh i wrote yeah that's right eweb for bringing us all together for what i think is an exciting opportunity for oregon's communities an energy resilience and renewable energy grant program that can both support planning and projects a couple things i want to flag before we while the first part of this webinar is aimed at applicants and cous are eligible to apply we also want to be sure to cover what the experience could be like for utilities dealing with applications coming from within their communities so we'll make sure that after we kind of get through the slideshow we talk a little bit about that before we go into the q a i also just want to make sure um that i'm clear about the definition of resilience here from the start so um the statute itself defines resilience and it's in more of the community resilience type of framework than maybe what resilience might mean for the grid or for utilities so feel free to ask questions about this when we get to it but i just wanted to like immediately raise the flag that this is more of like those community benefits when the power is out sort of resilience benefits um that the bill the statute uses as the definition that we based our program on so um our luckily our panelist that was having technical difficulties just made it so we're going to be fine um for our time together we're going to spend about 15-20 minutes going over the program itself give an example of a project out of eugene and talk a little bit about the application process and then most of our time together will really be determined by you and the questions that you have for our program staff about the program um you can use chat to ask questions along the way and you can raise hands or chat during the q a and um for those of you who aren't as familiar with webex i just thought i'd share a little bit about how to raise your hand and how to use the chat in case that's helpful to you so you'll see that there are um you'll see that there are two ways to raise your hand and one of those ways is right at the bottom if you click on the little smiley face one of the options is to raise your hand and it's right at the very top it doesn't have an image associated with it and then you can also raise your hand if you click next to your own name under attendees and then the chat you can see you can click to everyone and enter chat message and that should be on the bottom and um right hand side of your screen so when you're done speaking or if you decide you don't want to speak because someone else may be answered your question asked your same question you can click to lower your hand in the same place as you click to raise your hand so we can test this out now if there's any questions on the plan today or how the meeting will be facilitated go ahead and raise your hand if you'd like we don't seem to have anyone on the phone um i'll keep an eye on that but there's different different ways to do that for folks on the phone too so if anyone has questions you can ask them in the chat you can um and and uh yeah and then i'll also just say um uh it'd be great if you could introduce yourselves and share what uh utility you work for in the um in the chat as a way to kind of get us started and that's definitely a good way to chat check that you're finding the chat function um and we can continue to use that if you have questions like mid presentation just go ahead and throw them in the chat and i'll make sure we ask them at an opportune moment and then um the other thing that i'll flag is um we'll use both chat and raised hands during the q and a part either one is fine whatever is more comfortable for so with that i'm going to hand things over to rob delmar and james kogel who are the certified smart people when it comes to this new program um rob you feeling ready yep sorry for the slow joint i had a login problem but i'm great well it's nice to see you all right so um thank you christy and house bill 2021 also known as the 100 clean energy for all bill establish the new community renewable energy grant program and the purpose of the program is to offset costs of planning and developing renewable energy projects and those are projects up to 20 megawatts in capacity to support projects in traditionally underserved communities to promote small-scale community renewable energy projects and provide direct benefits to communities across oregon by improving energy resilience creating local jobs promoting economic development and offsetting local energy costs next slide please one of the features that distinguishes this program from previous programs in oregon is that it's only open to public and eligible applicants include tribes cities counties other public bodies and consumer-owned and the consumer-owned utilities are specifically called out within the the bill excludes cities over 500 000 which in oregon of course includes only portland and this was done in recognition of the portland clean energy fund which can provide funding for similar projects in or in portland next slide please another feature of the program is the focus on community energy resilience and the bill establishes carve-outs where fifty percent or more of the funding must go to community energy resilience projects and fifty percent or more of the funding must be for projects that serve qualifying communities and we'll see more about what qualifying communities means on the next slide next slide please so qualifying communities are defined in the bill and they include communities of low-income communities tribal rural and coastal communities and other traditionally under-represented communities in oregon next slide please the bill called for an advisory committee to work with the department of energy on program design and now program implementation the committee was instrumental in kind of sharing on-ground experience with project development and this is a list of the committee all through the fall they were helping us with the rulemaking and now they're going to be helping us with outreach and um we had central lincoln pud helping us gail malcolm representing consumer-owned utilities on the committee and she was a very vocal and helpful member of the group next slide please so since the passage of house bill 2021 we've been very built busy standing up the new program in the summer of 2021 auto staff were assigned to the project and developed an implementation plan including operational staffing and i.t changes within the agency in september we recruited a stakeholder advisory group which we just saw to help guide the program design and support development of program rules and that effort resulted in draft rules being posted with secretary of state's on january 1st and those rules are now final and the opportunity announcements for the program announcing the grants came out on march 7th next slide please so we before we move on to the specific grant opportunities i'd like to walk through a project that the eugene water electric board completed a few years ago the city of eugene like much of western oregon could be subject subject to significant damage from a cascadia earthquake and as a utility that manages both electricity and water services eweb recognized the importance of energy to water delivery and was well positioned to support resilience and disaster recovery within eugene next slide please eweb considered community energy resilience based on the rule of threes and that was in the first three days provide access to drinking water and this is the first three days following a natural disaster in the first three weeks repower critical facilities and in the first three months complete system repairs and restore regular water and electric service next slide please as a result of their planning efforts eweb developed the grid edge demonstration project the project utilized an existing 50 kilowatt pv system on the roof of the howard elementary school and added a battery energy storage system and a new potable water well to the site next slide the result is a facility that can serve as a potable water fill station for the community in the event of a power outage the school building is also provided with backup power and serves as an emergency shelter the system provides value to the community in addition to the value of the water and energy resilience features the school benefits from energy bill and e-web is able to use the batteries to provide grid services during regular day-to-day operations next slide this is a schematic diagram of how the microgrid system is put together showing the electrical loads that can be served by the system during a power the battery storage units which are shown in black can be charged by the solar and a natural gas generator and that is assuming natural gas is available in the you know during a natural the water well and the critical loads within the school are shown in green and the switch at the main breaker near the top of the dotted line area ensures isolation from the grid and that's to ensure the safety of emergency crews working on local power lines lines during a power outage so now that the program is nearly up and the agency started to hire staff that will run the program from here pandian krishnaswami is on the line and is our energy services manager and james kogel has been leading the work on the program nuts and bolts and we'll take things from here yes my name is james cogell i'm a policy analyst for the program um so the program will provide grants for planning and constructing renewable energy and energy resilience projects uh opportunity announcements were posted on march 7th uh there are four of them one for each of the project categories 12 million dollars was made available between the four opportunity announcements uh more opportunity announcements will be announced after this round closes",

        "text": " any other project or more of the work that odo does in general and the council so at this point i am going to talk stop talking and i'm going to turn it over to matt who is going to do his project overview for capital power and the so thank you for your time and attention and here you go then great thanks kate i appreciate the the opportunity to speak here tonight and for those of you who were not here at the beginning my name is matt martin i'm the director of business development at capital power i'm here to talk about the nolan hills wind power project if we could skip be two slides great thank you so um in terms of an overview of what what i'll talk about here tonight i will give you a little bit of background about capital power we'll provide a brief overview of the nolan hills project i'll talk a little bit about some of the economic impacts of the project talk about the stakeholder engagement that has been ongoing for a number of years now we'll go into a little bit of detail about the impact assessments that have been done over the past few years and finally we'll we'll leave some time open for for questions at the end um as we go through the presentation you'll see some some images like this one of various facilities that capital power owns and operates this is our beaufort solar facility in north carolina that i had the pleasure of working on uh seven years ago if you skip to the next slide so capital power um we're an independent power producer we own and operate 26 facilities across the us and canada uh totaling about 6 600 megawatts we invest in renewables you'll see a number of pictures of our of our wind fleet here we also have natural gas power plants as well as a number of um pretty exciting projects going on up in the province of alberta where we're in terms of carbon offset projects that um you know we can consider ourselves kind of very proactive and moving towards a um a low-carbon footprint future so we have 870 employees across canada and the us and i think one thing that we're very proud of is for three straight years we've been named one of the world's most ethical companies by the at the sphere institute um i think what you see is what you get with us we are you know open and honest i think if you were to ask folks where we operate our projects they would agree with you which is how we get those sorts of recognition so you could skip to the next slide there'll be a map of our facilities so there's a lot of dots on here the um i think you'll see that the blue dots are our natural gas facilities we have a pretty large presence in north uh western canada where we're headquartered up in edmonton you'll see a growing presence of of green dots in the us which is all of our operating wind farms and then kind of uh throughout the us we have a number of solar facilities that we are moving the smaller dots or our development projects so you'll notice the nolan hills project in oregon is is one of the smaller dots but we do have some projects in north carolina as i showed you earlier one in operation and three in construction as we move ahead so i think the key item from this slide is just to you know we are a very diverse power producer we have thermal facilities in natural gas and coal as well as landfill gas but we are moving towards a growing renewable fleet in terms of the you know the the wind and solar facilities that you see throughout the us next slide please so uh we're here to talk about the nolan hills facility which we have a nice picture of here on the slide so this facility has been a long time uh in development so the the win the first lease on this on this project uh was signed in 2010 so almost 12 years ago the developer put together about 48 000 acres of land primarily on the cunningham sheep ranch as well as some associated neighboring and you know the first thing they do is put up a meteorological tower to measure the wind for those of you in the area there's a lot of wind facilities to the west of the project we've been measuring the wind on this site for over a decade now so we have a good idea of how windy it is and this facility when it was first proposed back in 2017 um with that notice of intent that kate talked about earlier was just a wind farm so um since that time you know we've seen the evolving um organ has evolved a little bit you're seeing more and more solar facilities popping up as well as battery storage so um since the noi was was issued we expanded the project to be a little bit bigger to include a solar facility which i'll talk about later but uh the product's up to 600 megawatts so it's that original uh that wind energy project at 340 megawatts a 260 megawatt solar facility across about 1900 acres and then a battery storage project which we'll give you a little bit more information on the project's about four miles south of echo it's entirely within umatilla county it's about 10 miles west southwest of pendleton and on the next slide you'll see a map of the area this also has a lot of dots just to give you kind of an overview all the yellow dots are the proposed wind turbines there are up to 112 of them they're scattered throughout the site mostly on the ridge tops where it's one thing you'll notice on all the all the yellow dots is that there's a lot down the south of the site and a lot in the north of the site there's a big gap in the middle and we'll get to that a little bit later but just to kind of point your attention towards that gap the the shaded yellow area is uh the 1900 acre solar area that we mentioned earlier that's primarily in the northern part of the facility and then you'll see a couple of blue dots those blue dots are our project substations which we'll show you a picture of later on but they are effectively where um we consolidate all the power on this uh via underground cables and they will all come into those blue dots but then the the substations are connected via an overhead line which is the purple line here it's about a seven mile line that connects our southern portion parcel to the northern parcel um from those that northern partial where the blue dots are you'll see two dotted lines that are leaving the facility those are our um proposed transmission lines there are two proposals we'll get to them in a little bit there's the red dotted line that heads off to the west that is the uec or umatilla electric cooperative line and then the blue line is the bonneville power administration or bpa line which we'll talk about in a minute next slide please so i mentioned that the wind component so we are proposing up to 112 wind these are all have been vetted and approved by the federal aviation they have a maximum height of 496 feet just below the 500 foot threshold uh we're currently proposing three megawatt turbines and um you know the actual turbine will will be chosen at a later date but i think what's in the proposal and in the application that you'll see is the worst case scenario the most turbans that you would have is that 112. i like to show the pictures here because it shows a win project that's at the end of and you'll see on on the on the right hand side picture you you'll see the gravel roads that lead to each of our turbines those are about 16 to 20 feet wide that's our permanent impact and then you'll see the temporary impact which is the kind of the brown soil on the on either side of that road that can be upwards of 100 feet wide that's where our equipment tracks it's where our cranes may crawl from turbine to turbine it's also typically where we bury the but this is a good picture of kind of the temporary impacts that we have to study versus the permanent impacts that we ultimately see and the picture in the um the lower left-hand corner of the slide shows kind of what a site may look like when it's been restored and you'll see you know crops are able to be grown right up against the side of of those roads next slide please so on the solar component we decided to add a fairly large solar facility to the project couple years back it's covers up to 1900 acres you know the number here the 816 000 solar modules each one of those uh rectangles that you see in the picture is a module and so that is likely that's the highest that we expect to install that's based upon kind of older technology modules have gotten you know higher wattage over the year so we do expect to install fewer of them but they will be installed within that 1900 acre footprint and so the solar facility will be connected directly to the battery storage system so if you could slip skip to the next slide please it'll be located in a kind of a central area within the within the site this is a kind of a generic picture of what we call a battery energy storage system or a best uh effectively this is a lot of batteries compiled into all stacked up next to each other in a big c can or almost like a this kind of a trucking container that you would see on the side of the road there will be many of these kind of stacked up next to each other and the reason we have elected to pursue the the battery proposal is many folks have no renewable energy the wind doesn't always blow the solar is not always shining sun's not always shining this will allow us to deploy energy you know in the evenings or in the night time when it when it may be next slide please just a quick overview of some of the other components of a facility this i like this picture it's a wind farm in illinois that we recently i mentioned the two blue dots earlier the project substations on the bottom portion of this slide of the picture you'll see that's a single substation all of our electricity is is consolidated via underground wires which will all go into a big substation that looks like what you see here and then the voltage of of our electricity is stepped up to a higher voltage and will leave the site on an power line and you can kind of see that overhead power line leaving",

or not but I I'm um I'm hoping that this cumulative effect is um more thoroughly looked at during our role making um because that's probably the most appropriate time for that to happen so um but I do also sympathize with um the comments that were brought up um during public comic period and just um how dramatic it really is um and want to make sure that that's that's known by this Council thank you okay right uh thank you council members thank you for the discussion um I won't revisit it I did want to respond to council member chak T's comment that there there are uh and I think uh council member devilin is raising his hand maybe more physical councelor Devin we see your wanting to say something oh councelor delin can you hear me is he muted can you hear me now yes we gotta I must have been muted there I wasn't here um I wanted to Echo the comments of the councilors that to talk about how difficult it would be to put together a design standard for significant impacts visual impacts I remember very well the comments of uh one of the forers state senators from Pendleton many years ago that uh when the windmills first wind farms first came to his district everyone was in favor of them but over time many more people had come forward objecting uh to the visual impact of them I just do do not know how we would put together a standard like this uh and in terms of visual impacts uh obviously they're going to impact people in certain areas obviously they're going to be people that object to the impact in terms of the changes to the sort of natural scenery I just don't know at this point how you put something forward thank you councelor delin any other comments thank you chair out well just to go back to to my response to council member CH to um I just wanted to point out that we did get some evidence uh in the record regarding the uh cumulative impacts of wind development on a bird and bat species in the Columbia Plateau um I will personally say I found it it's concerning I do think we've responded to that in the DPO to the best we can within the the context of the standards and how it's been um treated in the past by requiring the setback requirements uh represent by the applicant and and uh requiring the thresholds of concerns to be Revisited for uh that that could trigger additional mitigation under the wildlife monitoring and mitigation plan um I do want to flag that all for you though because I do think it's worth a careful look so okay well Mr Clark excellent presentation it was a lengthy involved and detailed and you did a great job thank you thank you TR I don't know I hope we were able to give you something that helped you guys out but uh uh no thank you we we greatly value the the feedback and and I think we have a good direction good work okay so uh we've gone way over um our time for that item but it was well worth it and it's um shall we what do 15 minutes to grab our lunch and get back and try to continue moving on okay it's uh it we'll be back at H if I may just a reminder that this is your opportunity to review the letter that Fuji crder submitted please don't discuss it with each other over lunch that's right you can review it but any discussion should be on the record yeah you okay um so we'll come back at uh let's make it 10 minutes after 12 or one 10 minutes after one so this okay we're back it's um now 109 and I'd like to call the meeting back from recess and continue with the next agenda item which is the Leaning Juniper 2A request for Amendment Three it's a review of the draft proposed order as an information item Chase McVey Walker is a senior sighting analyst that will have the floor it's yours Chase thank you very much chair how uh and now good afternoon members of the council uh for the record my name is Chase McBay Walker I'm a senior sighting Analyst at the department um as chair how just mentioned I'll be providing you with an overview of um the lening Juniper two-way wind power facility and the requested Amendment amendment number three and I'll also be summarizing the issues raised in comments received on the record of the DPO public hearing next slide please Nancy okay uh request for Amendment Three to the Leaning Juniper 2A uh facility or site certificate is being processed under the type A Amendment review process which included uh a public hearing and public comment period uh the public hearing was last uh was month's occurred at last month's FC meeting and the public comment period concluded on March 29th and the certificate holder provided uh a response to public comments on April 1st after hearing feedback or direction from Council today the department will issue its proposed order order the typ a review process allows for a possible contested case on the proposed order but only those people who raised a relevant issue in person at the public hearing or in writing by the comment deadline on the draft proposed order May participate in the contested case after the deadline for contested case hearing requests on the proposed order has passed or after the contested case proceeding has concluded the council will will review the proposed order and issue its final order approving or denying the request for Amendment uh to the site certificate is there any questions on the process steps today and and going forward okay next slide please okay so at last month's council meeting in Hermiston I walked through the procedural history to date so I'm not going to uh I'm just going to keep today's recap brief the department received the preliminary request for amendment in September of last year 2023 on February 14th of this year 2024 the department received a complete request for Amendment from the certificate holder then the department issued its draft proposed order on February 29th and held its public hearing at the March f meeting on the 20 night of the 20th I believe 21st uh for today's agenda item to the best of my ability I'll present the issues raised um in comments received on the record of the DPO and we'll seek council's feedback on a couple uh comments provided to the department from Council at the hearing um and the Department forecasts issuing its proposed order next week and uh also forecasts council's review of the proposed order to occur at the next meeting next slide okay I'm going to give a general brief overview of the approved facility the Leaning Juniper 2-way wind power facility is a wind energy facility located in Gillum County and the facility consists of 43 wind turbines with a maximum blade tip height of 492 ft the certificate holder is leaning Juniper wind power to LLC a wholly owned subsidiary of oven grid Renewables LLC and the council issued the site certificate for the Leaning Juniper two-way wind power facility on September 21st 2007 next slide please the request for Amendment Three I'm going to provide an overview of the request request for Amendment Three seeks council's approval for wind turban upgrades to 36 of the 43 uh existing turbin and those upgrades would include replacing the wind turbine rotors the cells refurbishing the turbine generators and reinforcing the foundations additionally uh the certificate holder seeks to install a new 34 half kilovolt collector system and proposes requests uh the decommissioning of two of the 43 turbin the upgrades would these upgrades would require um amendments to existing conditions and on the next two slides I will have a like two different figures to toggle back and forth between but all of these upgrades and everything proposed in the amendment request would um occur within a repow corridor which on these two maps on the the slide in the next is represented as the purple line so everything proposed would happen within the repower corridor which is which it itself is within the existing site boundary and there would be no new permanent impacts just temporary disturbance and total acreage for temporary disturbance would be 396.25 next one okay for council's scope of review for this amendment request Council must determine that the prance of evidence on the records supports the following conclusions um that the facility with the proposed change complies with the applicable laws or Council standards that protect a resource or interest that could be Ed by the proposed change and for all Amendment or all requests for Amendment the amount of the bond or letter of credit required under division 22 sub 50 is adequate next slide please during the uh public hearing at last month's meeting we re received the department received oral comments from the certificate holder as well as council members Grail by and Imes um no members of the public provided oral testimony uh the department did receive three written comments submitted before the March 29th deadline one from a member of the public one from a reviewing agency and and then uh one from the certificate holder themselves Additionally the certificate holder provided uh a second comment on April 1st which the council uh approved an extension for them to respond to any comments uh following the deadline the comment deadline and Council approved that at the last meeting and exact copies of all of the written comments were provided as a attachment to to the staff report for this agenda item and also were uploaded to the public comment sighting the sighting public comment docket or public comment portal everything is online there based on the Department's review of information on the record of the amendment request including the public comments received on the record of the DP the standard listed on this slide uh the department does not identify any additional substantive changes or recommend amended or new conditions um following the the close of the commment period but now the next six slides approximately are standards where comments or issues were applicable to the standard so I'm going to go through that comment by comment standard by uh next slide please the department received a comment from the certificate holder um this was a a comment to reflect the current language of condition 27 or the the certificate holder comment indicated that the language in the DPO on condition 27 was not the same as what was represented in the uh draft site certificate Redline site certificate and so they requested that the language from the redline site certificate",

        "text": " quickly uh you'll recall in this case this is the the Nolan Hills uh case in which they have they're constructing wind turbines uh and Umatilla County has an ordinance that prohibits the construction of wind turbines within two miles of rural residences we had the contested case on this and we had before you last July an hearing uh the de applicant as well as the Department's position was that in spite of that ordinance you could approve the facility even though there were some turbin that would be less than 2 mil from rural residences and in your final order you provided a number of reasons justifications for that decision one you said uh that re that ordinance is not required by Statewide planning goals so it did not constitute an applicable Criterion alternatively you found that by Statute you are off authorized to approve a facility even if it doesn't meet a recommended applicable substantive Criterion from a from a county or a special Advisory Group if the facility otherwise complies with Statewide land use planning goals so you can say even if that ordinance is an applicable substantive Criterion we have the authority to approve it because we find it otherwise applies with all of the land use planning goals it was on that basis that alternative rationale that you provided in your final order that the Supreme Court affirmed your decision they didn't even get to the analyze whether or not the two mile setback is an applicable substantive Criterion or is required by the goals I said we don't even have to get to that because Council you even if it is you have the authority because you found that it otherwise complies with the goals so that is a 35 very much a reduced summary of the opinion uh if you have any if you get a chance to read it and you have questions about it beyond what I've just summarize just let me know and we can chat about it uh second update uh in the ongoing uh appeal of the EUR approval of Boardman to Hemingway Amendment one last month you'll recall I updated you that Idaho Power had petitioned for the Supreme Court to take take up the case in place of Union County Circuit Court this and we joined that that motion uh the Supreme Court as you as I mentioned last month denied to take the case up but in the course of their denying it they said council's decision on the on request for Amendment one approving it is final so because they affirmed that your decision was Final idah whole power this is just since our meeting last month idah whole power filed a motion to dismiss we also filed a motion to dismiss arguing that the case is moot there is no reason to proceed with having a contested case uh the petitioner requested a contested case uh among other reasons arguing that uh the notice that you had provided on the draft proposed order was insufficient uh and wanted to argue about that and again our argument in the most recently filed motion the motion to dismiss is given that the site certificate or the approval of the amendment uh has been confirmed as final by the Supreme Court the case is moot there is no point in having a contested case because it couldn't it couldn't change anything about that Amendment uh that has now been fully briefed and uh the court has heard oral argument we are hopeful that we'll get a decision from the court uh in a reasonable amount of time those are my updates this F thank you so much Mr row um okay so there are three projects we'd like to give you a snippet of an update on for this secretary report the first is another Boardman to Hemingway update um on April 16th uh just earlier this week the department issued its draft proposed order on requests for Amendment two for the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line sight certificate so we now have an open comment period on that draft proposed order and on the complete Amendment request that comment period extends through May 30th uh where we are planning to have a hearing um in at the Port of Morrow in Borman quick reference so the changes that are being proposed by Idaho Power Company the certificate holder include shifts in the location of the transmission line temporary work areas and access new and substantial improved access roads uh it also includes construction and operation of a capacitor station that would be in Union County um changes to previously imposed conditions and a proposal to expand the site boundary and micro sighting areas note that the draft proposed order also includes changes to conditions that are recommended by the department so we are not limited and only evaluating what a certificate holder applicant propose as the conditions we have our own ideas about what those conditions need to do to ensure compliance with standards so that is interesting and just to highlight Council approved Boardman to Hemingway in September of 2022 it's now 2024 and what we've been processing are changes in the location of certain segments of the line and access roads and so it's just a very interesting experience to go through that wasn't the route that was feasible to use and so they have to keep adjusting as they work with land owners and experience um engineering constraints that might not have been known based on how they were able to evaluate it in the application with limited access excuse me Sarah yes um Cher Hall I just want to if I may and I don't know if this is appropriate so Patrick can tell me to shut up but I frequently in my regular life outside of this room outside of council and asked why does it Tak so long why can't anything get done and you just stated approval 2022 we are in 2024 and I would just like to state that we have an obligation a legal requirement for you just said a public hearing and I I want people to understand and my this is Marcy's opinion that's part of the process but that's part of the reason why the time and it has nothing to do with FC or or anyone Absolut I just I just want to I keep saying it over and over and over again and I just wanted to reiterate what you stated thank you okay great um the next project we'd like to give you a snippet update is on the Summit Ridge renewable energy facility which is in the notice of intent phase uh this is a proposed 2011 megawatt wind and solar facility to be located in Wasco County um so again this is in the notice of intent phase which is the very first of seven steps in the process um the notice of receipt of that notice of intent and a public comment period was issued on March 14th we held a public meeting on that notice of intent in the town of doofer on April 3rd and thank you council member berer for attending that was wonderful and the comment period on that notice of intent extends through May 3rd and just of note um to date we have received no public comments on that project um which is surprising but it's not May 3rd yet uh and then lastly um a project we really haven't talked about in a long time it's the Eugene to Medford transmission line requests for Amendment four uh this is an the Eugene to Medford transmission line is an existing operational transmission line it's one of council's oldest site certificates issued when I was 2 years old um uh 198 to um the certificate holder is pacificore and they submitted a preliminary requests for Amendment 4 in 2018 which proposed many things but predominantly a new 17-Mile transmission line and 500 KV substation it's been on hold our review of this amendment request has been on hold for nearly 2 years um really pending information needed to evaluate the significance of impacts of the substation to try resources um and a resolution to that issue has still not been achieved and there's been changes over time and even the need for the project so we received notification last week from Pacific cor that they were withdrawing that Amendment request um so we will be updating our web page to up update that status we haven't had a chance to do that so that Amendment request is no longer under review and then um a a brief compliance update um as you know we've been bringing amendments to mitigation plans to council for formal review when the changes being requested in a mitigation planned aren't that substantive we would present these amendments in the Council secretary report um so we had a request to amend several Wildlife monitoring TR and mitigation plans for um uh the Leaning Juniper 2A and 2B facility Klondike and Golden Hills and Montag wind project the Amendments across those Wildlife monitoring and mitigation plans are all the same where they're seeking to remove a requirement to evaluate Nest success as part of their long-term Raptor nness survey um it was an outcome of us finding non-compliance iance with that requirement because they weren't actually doing it and so the resolve was that we and aen grid who is the certificate holder worked with the Department of Fish and Wildlife to better understand what is this requirement doing and what do they need to do to fix it and it was that why are they needing to do it in the first place um which is so ODFW recommendation is that because there's no Baseline data to evaluate if there's a change and Nest success that is significant that it unevaluable um and that they already had an obligation to evaluate Nest occupancy which is a better criteria to evaluate changes over time from ODFW perspective and I apologize Nest success is the success of an a raptor using the nest and a fledgling hatching and flying off so that means you actually have to monitor pretty frequently to know the outcome which wasn't happening and then it turns out it doesn't really need to be so they're striking that requirement updating long-term Raptor nness surveys to occur on years divisible by five so that they don't have to do them actually every year across their facilities which is something that ODFW has been supportive of so those are amendments that we're recommending Council with any questions on that okay Sarah yes sir can you say Nest success three times Jordan right and uh secretary esterson amendments then subject the to it opens up just the amendment part right if there's been some new standard or something like that that's applied or not yeah it's kind of unfortunate to use the word amend but so the wildlife monitoring mitigation plans specifically but it also is in a lot of mitigation plans have a section in the plan that allows for plan amendments maybe we should just use the word plan revisions over time to make",

        "text": " want this contested case process to be any more expensive or onerous than it has to be it should be efficient it should be quick we should be having fights about did the applicant meet the standard or did they not we should not be having fights about I'm a party you know did I argue with this those are going to happen but we should make sure the rules are as clear as they can be to minimize the amount of time that we spend in that process on those kind of process issues so that's kind of my Approach is the rules uh coordinator on this project is you know where can we identify issues of confusion where we create or modify the existing rules in a way that will make them easier to understand for uh this the um the applicant but but also for those who are want to participate in the process so that they can preserve their rights so they know you know for example it has come up and it's going to continue to come up you know what what kind of sufficient specificity and we should maybe come up with the you know a shortened version of that because it's really hard to say um three times fast especially uh you know what does that mean so and and knowing that they can prepare ahead of time and then participate and have a discussion on the merits about you know did the did the applicant meet the standards or not uh not have debates on did I raise this issue did I not raise this issue again those will inevitably come up uh regardless of what we do but we should make sure the rules are not contributing to the confusion uh in that process so some great comments uh from Renewables Northwest okay let's move to uh Davis Wright Tremaine yeah Tom so uh this is Derek um I'm gonna pass over to to Elaine who's joined us here I might I'll just say real quickly that I think that your uh the scope um of the objective makes sense here look forward to kind of hearing more of the details from there um I want to pass over to let her have a chance to introduce herself as well you're muted Elaine sorry about that uh good morning uh Elaine Albridge with Davis Street Tremaine I'm a permitting partner here in our Portland office and I've been working with renewable energy developers um navigate both local and state level citing processes um happy and looking forward to um I'll Echo a lot of the comments that Max raised from renewable Northwest about you know the hopes for this rack I do think probably all parties involved with like a simpler clearer process um that's efficient and so that's I think you know some common ground probably we all have for contested case proceedings and just another kind of you practical thing to put out there is that how do the evidentiary you know requirements in a contested case relate back to the DPO proceeding and how could we meet the DPO process more robust and have um issues raised by stakeholders earlier in the process that would allow an applicant the opportunity to more fully address them on the DPO record um to hopefully minimize the amount of issues that might go to contesta case so I'm just thinking about ways we could um you know work work towards having less issues come up in a contested case and really have you know only the real substantive ones be be the subject of contested cases so we're not dealing with a contested case on every single thanks and look forward to participating all right thank you Elaine uh Northwest Natural uh I don't I don't really have a whole lot at this point um I'm going to look listen and learn as this process moves forward the one thing that I am interested and and probably is already in some of the presentations we'll be providing is uh who's responsible for the costs of a contested case and how are those divvied up between the parties other than that I don't have anything at this point all right um pacificor um I'm kind of in the listen and learn at this point as well so I no comments for the group at this moment okay no worries all right well that is that is the rack I think um we kind of have a good sense of how things are going it uh it kind of sounds like to me we have uh and uh Irene and Jim who represent the public who have been involved in you know in the contested case process and who have kind of identified and staff has as well kind of a lot of these issues where it is confusing to um participants who are who are opposing projects to to understand how to navigate these sort of you know it is essentially a you know a legal matter uh in terms of How It's framed and how it's approached I mean these people are not necessarily attorneys themselves and so uh we have kind of these like legal Concepts like what is sufficient specificity uh where you know we can add some clarification some details what does it mean to be a party uh how do you you what does it mean to be a limited party uh these sorts of things that hopefully we can clarify in a way that we minimize the arguments in the contested case um to just the kind of the substantive matters again like did this where the standards met where the standards not um so uh all right well I'm going to turn it over to the kind of public comment portion we have actually quite a bit of time for public comment uh if anybody who is not a member of the rack um or if you are a member of the rack at this point uh if no if there are no members of the public who wish to to speak up if you are in the if you are joined the team sessions uh feel free to use the raise hand function I don't see anybody who's just on the who called in so you know use the little hand guy uh yes we have uh Dugan hopefully you pronounced that right yeah so Dugan uh with uh pinegate uh Pine gate Renewables or renewable energy out of uh North Carolina but that have developed several projects in Oregon and um has an application in front of the commission right now I just want to voice our support uh for uh the words of um Max uh renewable Northwest and uh you know agree with staff here about wanting to find efficiencies and just ensuring that you know this process is can be you know made as quick and do a good decision as possible whatever that ends up being um you know I think we similarly feel that you know we take a look at fsec as compared to the other states we develop in and um it certainly is is more robust which is great in some ways but that often leads to also administratively robust uh which sometimes can um you know cause problems and you know we're committed to building the projects that Oregon wants uh clearly by policy but we also want to make sure that those are going to you know get through the process on time and um you know not be unduly delayed so I'm excited to see this process move forward and um you'll probably I don't know if we will directly comment but we'll work with our our groups either the Oregon uh solar and storage Industries Association or other places you'll probably see some comments from us on this uh we'll not make in the future so I just wanted to say hello and thank you awesome great perfect uh uh introduction there and um you know this is the that was the perfect time to do so uh yeah no we um I should have said this at the beginning but we definitely encourage each of you um throughout this process to reach out to uh you know other similarly interested parties um in in kind of your space to kind of solicit additional feedback uh to bring to the rack so you don't have to just you know this is not just you representing your you know particular uh constituent if you you know if you if you are kind of rub the elbows with others who are in a similar field and you kind of share your thoughts and what's kind of going on and they have additional thoughts or whatever bring you can bring that feedback to the rack um we're more than interested to hear um but then again they those those p uh interested parties will have opportunities to directly uh reach out to the uh to the process um again particularly during the public comment period um are there any other um public participants who are interested in making additional comments okay not seeing anybody I'm gonna move so that brings us to next steps so we're gonna we're zoomed right through this all right so sounds like uh uh I can sort of predict how this is going to go but if you have after after kind of listening to what was said today I took notes there's actually part of um uh if you if you want I can send it to you maybe I'll just upload it along with the video but teams does put out a transcript it's not perfect it's going to make mistakes but it is a pretty accurate fairly accurate um transcript of what was said uh today um I could send that to you but uh so I do have kind of a record of what of what was said but if you felt like uh some clarity would be helpful I guess I'm talking mainly to Irene and Jim Who provided the most substantive comments uh it would be helpful for me because I'm going to take those suggestions and send them out to the group I want to make sure that I'm accurately characterizing what it is that you want uh please submit uh some written comments to me by uh end of day tomorrow uh just so that um yeah again I can I can kind of give the rack the best representation of whatever whatever it is that you're you're interested in um the goal will then be that I will quick as quickly as I can uh kind of turn that around into a packet for the rack to review uh I'm gonna with along with that packet I'm going to send a uh essentially a Word document of the rules just kind of a clean uh document that you can you can put your thoughts you know directly into that document and track changes or in comment bubbles or whatever you want to do uh to then share with the rack um about your thoughts and feelings about what was said today and what the other rack members have said or if you have not or developed specific ideas like I want this role to be changed to say X or whatever it might be um it's part of that packet I'm going to send out a vote so we will you know with just like we did for this one uh it'll have a bunch of times uh I don't want to push this too far",

the put the sections of the uh the uh the column in place is that how's that connected uh if it's welded you're going to need a lot of uh you're gonna be and you need to beef up that connection point to prevent uh fatigue uh cracking uh from the wind uh to uh causing a possible structural failure but i'm not i just wanna curious what how are you connecting those uh sections in that call when uh determine column thank you this is jason hey um i think i would love to follow up with harvey offline um and try to help answer his questions he's got a wealth of questions and great ones um they're kind of more on the building and engineering aspects um which we tried to talk about a little bit earlier but we're moving through all these topics pretty quickly um so appreciate that there's still questions um but but maybe try to keep our questions um related to the transmission topic here and and with energy markets coming up um if we could just all try to keep our comments on that just so it helps everybody um stay on track and focus down the topic at hand and then helps us move through and that'd be great is that okay harvey yes that's not that's not a problem we could do that anytime i could do it after send you an email yeah or and then you can and go from there i'm just i'm kind of curious about that but thanks a lot anyway yeah appreciate it great thanks harvey okay i know that we're running short on time and i want to make sure we get to the markets and rto piece um because there's i think a number of questions in the chat that would be informed by that let's move ahead to to that one um and if you continue to have transmission questions or comments add them to the chat and we can try to address those all at once towards the that's right yeah the rto uh topic you know relates certainly to transmission so i think i think it's german this item too so um i'm just gonna you know introduce um rose we're gonna have an update from oregon public utility commission on oregon investor owned utilities that's an acronym there are relating to floating offshore wind and the hydrogen topic that we've heard a little bit about today so rose anderson is a senior economist with the oregon public utilities she works on regulatory activities involving the ious the investor and utilities she's been working on pacific or energy resource planning and procurement activities for several years he's also been engaged with idaho power's resource planning activities so rose i will turn it over to you thanks jason i hope you can hear me okay i'm i'm happy to be here today and to share a quick and very general report with you all on what a few oregon investor-owned utilities are doing in utility planning and procurement processes to consider floating offshore wind and some hydrogen resources as well i'd like to begin with our six state electric utility with significant transmission resources pacificorp in the pacific or rfp it's currently ongoing at the oregon puc that it and it's a procurement process that may result in the addition of about 2 000 megawatts of wind solar and storage there will be an analysis of loading offshore wind in the rfp but the details and parameters are really yet to be that's a conversation that uh staff and pacifico will be having over the next few months we hope and we're hoping that a study can look at the economics of adding offshore wind to the company's resource portfolio after and how that might inform consideration of the rfe resource we hope the details of that analysis can be decided by november 2022 in pacific court's 2023 irp this is a long-term resource plan that's looking to create a portfolio of resources to meet load over about the next 20 years and it's the development process for this irp is active now the march public input meeting explored potential supply-side resources such as offshore wood floating offshore wind will be a supply-side resource that can be selected to be part of a preferred portfolio for what i believe is the first time in this and supply side resource modeling is not yet finalized so the cost and operational details used to model floating offshore wind haven't really been announced opuc staff is going to seek to make flexible hydrogen load a topic of discussion in the irp lead-up process and to ask for large flexible loads to be considered in irp analysis on the transmission side for pacificorp as i think we've talked about here today uh there's some more work needed to assess any transmission upgrades that might be needed to connect floating offshore wind in the irp uh it is my understanding and i'm not an irp analyst of the company but uh in order to accurately model the floating offshore wind i believe there will need to be some estimate around any transmission upgrades that might be needed and that's really because the irp model tries to accurately portray the system and its costs and that helps it calculate a least cost least risk portfolio um in local transmission planning a study has recently been requested to look at floating offshore wind and the transmission that's needed to reliably connect varying amounts of it off of the oregon coast as well as the effect positive or negative that it may have on transmission system costs and moving on to portland general the development process for the next pge irp is currently underway supply side resource options were a topic of discussion at the november 2021 irp roundtable and floating offshore wind will be a supply proxy resource that can be selected in this irp as part of our preferred supply side resource modeling is currently underway and the cost and operational details used to model floating offshore wind have not been announced yet in the current pge rfp staff and pge are currently discussing the possibility of floating offshore wind and or flexible hydrogen load and this would ideally look at a scenario where floating offshore wind and hydrogen are included and compare it to one where they're not included and kind of assess the impacts on the rfp if i could move on and maybe any questions could be answered after i'm finished with uh northwest natural the the most recent full northwest natural irp was the 2018 irp and this was a while ago and a few things have happened in the hydrogen space since then in the 2018 irp hydrogen was considered as a supply side resource but it was really only modeled in one location at the mist storage and it wasn't selected as part of a preferred portfolio but it was initially selected as part of a deep decarbonization kind of sensitivity and in the northwest natural upcoming 2022 irp hydrogen will again be a supply side proxy resource that can be selected as part of a preferred portfolio there there's already been a study on hydrogen and some discussion took place at the march 2022 technical working group meeting the irp development process is ongoing and modeling details are not yet and that is all for my update today thank you very much thanks rose there was one question for you in the chat before i'm moving over to jason and also welcome other you know questions for rose's presentation how might offshore wind show up in the utilities hb 2021 compliance plans that's a great question we are currently in the midst of a process to kind of unroll how we'll be considering hb 2021 uh we have a docket number for it it's 2225 i believe uh so i i can't speak a lot to how that's going to play out but i will say that um getting floating offshore wind into consideration and utility long-term plans irps is a really excellent first step to to getting them considered also for hp 2021. great thank you and i'll say um that your colleague kim added a little bit more in the chat as well so thank you for that thanks um i'm not seeing anything else specific um in the chat uh free rose anyone um on the phone or on the webinar that like to raise their otherwise i know jason has a few more slides related to this topic if you're able to stick around rose for a few more okay um jason why don't you um go ahead to the rest of the slides on this topic and then we can kind of take questions on all of them at the end hey thanks so much rose um that was great to hear um what what the oregon utilities are up to um and thinking um so shifting back did i skip a slide i uh i must user error i usually start i start um by summarizing the questions that we asked i think that was an oversight on mice on my end so um but the topics that we're talking about here are energy markets um i can't remember the question numbers in the prompt and question document maybe i did have a slide and it just just got deleted in translation we've been combining a lot of slides over the past couple days um to bring you bring you all these great guest presenters today so um but the general themes are you know energy markets um who's going to buy who's going to invest who's going to off take you know off taker is kind of energy jargon for a purchaser or in an energy project so it becomes pretty critical um when you've got projects of the scale which some of the commenters certainly remarked about so gigawatt scales of floating offshore wind are too costly and risky for a single moderately sized utility to procure so a lot of the comments kind of came down to sharing the output identifying sharing sharing output as a path forward to kind of address that that issue of it being too costly for for just one person to go too costly and too risky potentially for for one party to go at it alone multiple oregon off takers are necessary with potential for washington california off takers as well kind of highlighting again the regional nature of this hydrogen producers could also be off takers potentially mitigating some amount of transmission and then this is another topic that there's been some back and forth on whether it's a pro or con or where the benefits will ultimately lie so something to think about that several people raised was even with out of state off takers floating offshore wind would likely provide local oregon benefits in the form of increased power quality",

        "text": " is the public hearing to consider a case member his 23-13 for property located at 1844 Street Northeast the criteria available to this hearing or other students chapter 2 30.065 General guidelines and Community Resources prior to the close of the public hearing with statements are evidence sufficient to afford that start landmarks commission and the learnings and opportunity to respond to the issue when it's appeal to the intercessary event issue a similar failure to raise constitutional issues relating to those in action for damages in Circuit Court prior to the conclusion of the human eating participant May request and the opportunity to present a discipline administer testimony to start letting my exclamation will then either continue the public hearing or leave the record open for at least seven days thank you uh are there any conflicts of interest or ex parte contracts that any commissioner would like to declare at this time yes I received a mail notice about this project because I live within uh of the project contagious you can put a factory all right thank you uh maybe we now have the staff presentation preservation officer for the City of Salem I'd like to enter the staff report its attachments and off of the testimony into the record so this property is located at 1840 Court Street Northeast and is a contributing resource to our course Chemeketa historic district here's a street view of the house and the front entry a little bit about the history so according to nomination documents the Hewitt class was constructed by Julia and Henry Schultz in 1907 and was promptly sold to James and Marin who lived in the house until 1919. the Oregon Statesman featured ads advertising a two-room furnished basement apartment beginning in 1938 and that date's important because I'll mention it um when we discuss alterations outside of the period of significance as a reference the period of significance for the abortion method I Disturbed ends in I also want to know about two Sanborn fire Insurance Maps up here and when doing historic research realized that it originally was addressed 1740 Court Street so you can see that in the 1926-1927 Sanford map where it just shows the house itself with no accessory structures and then um you can see later on in the 1950 updated map um there were two separate one-bedroom Cottages that were constructed in 1948 at the rear of the Rock and this is an interesting history this was one of the very first properties that city council considered for a ReSound from R1 to R2 because of the multiple residence residential units on this on this property um I also want to note that the previous owner turned in replaced multiple windows with vinyls throughout the house and did remove some original signing despite these alterations the resources still reported as historic contributing to the unfortunate events so these are the few pictures that we have that were submitted by the alphabet the one on the left is from 1978 and the other two we don't know what the dates are but you can see uh especially on the picture of the UFOs on the porch that was enclosed in some of the blocks so the proposal um so you can kind of see that but I'm going to go through it piece by piece so the applicant is proposing to replace windows to remodel the front porch and back porch and restore the shingles in the Dormers and then I take one facade at a time so the north facade which is the front so the existing porch decking and square post Rail and porch column are in poor condition and the applicant is proposing to replace the existing post with a new one uh replace the decking and rail all to be a little composite or previously uh the applicants are proposing to replace the front stairs the existing stairs are not original to the structure they're being cast from the b91 with railings of pressure treated lumber and the proposed new stairs will be a bit narrower six feet wide with composite with railings to match it's currently single themed and wood and the person in Windows location will be of my own and slightly different size but the applicant is proposing to add or restore the siding in this location which is currently a vertical plywood board and he's purposing to restore the the theater she moves restoring the original Canon so this location and he's also proposing to remove that metal stove phase on the western edge of the northern slope of that so on the western side which is an interior side the applicant's proposing them to replace the existing uh wood window with a new wood double paned double among window in that location and the South facade and there's a lot happening here too so as you can see the rear porch is in very poor condition um and it's not so we enclosed any longer as I mentioned when I was going over the history um best as we can tell this was uh the access to the basement apartment and so it was it's not an original to the structure and is proposing to re-impose this porch area and remove the stairs and the door and then we signed it to manage the siding on this facade the applicants also proposing to relocate the existing bathroom window uh it's a vinyl window and it's purposing to be located at 46 inches to the west of that original that existing opening uh and then the applicant is proposing to replace the basement proper Windows on this facade with new vinyl windows and also be proposing to restore the the siding in the genre area from the front and we're going to remove the stove paint and installations and last suppose the East facade which is another side facade yeah and is proposing to replace the two first floor Windows which are single pane double round uh and yeah and the basement windows as well uh to replace the two proper windows so I'm going to go through the applicable guidelines which are in Salem Revised Code 230.065 the residential use is going to be retained so um staff recommends the one workers commission find that this guideline has been met uh I'm going to take guidelines B and C together which are related to ensuring that historic distinctive teachers are preserved and repaired so I'm recommending the landmarks commission adopt two separate conditions of approval uh relating to the the decorative Square front porch post so that the applicant is is proposing to replace the square post and this is uh has character defining features that are difficult to replicate with modern materials uh and so condition one uh staff is recommending The Landmark solution adopted this to say the application provide to shovel the condition assessment of the decorative historic front forward to post and provided the original material pricing posters names for 15 structural Integrity which will be repaired within kind of materials same condition to the potential recipe the original material and design of the decorative Square front porch poster on authorization that the post can be replaced at the time of building permit and the historic preservation officer shall authorize removal and replacement of the decorative Forge Post should the condition assessment illustrate that over 15 of the structural Integrity of the post has been compromised and the repair of the coast is not feasible criteria guidel ID historic which is related to Historic features being restored so the applicant is choosing to replace the signing both Dormers the front and the rear so that it reflects the original material on the exterior and then um guideline e so as I mentioned before this is this would apply to the report so those alterations as I mentioned were made the best as we can tell in 1938 which is after the period of significance for the historic district so that um in this particular case since that happens after the period of um it does not apply to the alterations um foreign so moving on to f and g so uh the applicant is requesting approval to replace the front porch and stairs again it includes the back porch and replace windows throughout the existing stairs and waving are not original to the QA house and they're proposed for at least concerns will be clearly new but of a compatible material and design the replacement porch decking and rail material it will also be clearly new but of a compatible material double hung Windows along secondary facades of the resource with double beam would double problem windows and these windows will be slightly smaller in size than the existing windows on these secondary facades or acquiring the applicant to reframe and decide the area around DC windows but they're located on the secondary facades so that will limit the visual impact of these changes the applicant's also proposing to replace the existing basement level single key and proper Windows throughout the resource with smaller vinyl windows and the majority of these windows are located on secondary facades minimizing their visual impact however the proposed new replacement window that they sent window on the front facade is highly visible currently and will have an accurate effective impact on the line on the resource so in order to better meet this guideline for this portion of the proposal staff recommends The Landmark solution adopt another condition of approval so condition three stating the replacement basement window on the primary facade of the Hewitt house shop that have been the existing boarding at 2021 inch opening for the original Windows location the attached and frame materials shall have the appearance of wood and be paintable and the opposed replacement of the material and specifications shall be provided to the historic preservation officer at the time um moving on to H and I so structural deficiencies so the the biggest challenge I think for this resource is adjusting the issues and he is imposing the porch which is at the the rear of the resource and it will result in school visual impacts and changes to the resource but again because it's after we are on a secondary facade it will minimize the impact and I there is no excavation of your proposed as part of this proposals so that guy I'm just not so in some staff recommends the landmarks commission and find that the proposal leads the applicable guidelines in SRC 230065 provided the recommended conditions are adopted so moving on to testimony we've received a number of of the comments and support so just today we received to be on your desk in email and support from Stephen Elmore an email from Jim Lloyd in support and then the Adkins submitted testimony and support from Jamie Fisher through Kaufman who are old on Charles soul and Joshua we've received no formal comments from the Men Northeast neighbors neighborhood the building and safety division indicated that building permits are required and that all of that and guard designs will require manufacturers installation instructions and the windows will require verification of the heat press and all this information will be required when documents are provided the playing division fire department and put the books and",

        "text": " always important what do we do now they already have a protocol place um is it was previously every four years now it's every year so we concluded that there is no additional followup that's needed they recorded it timely they already have an annual protocol for testing those so for us that was sufficient to to move forward and conclude this incident okay moving on to we are currently in the short legislative session so uh we talked previously about three bills that relate to the energy facility sighting Council House Bill 415 um that proposes to add a definition of battery energy storage systems in fex definitions so as you recall we have numerous projects where the council has reviewed uh and approved battery storage but those are in conjunction with a wind or Soler or natural gas facility um so they're not by themselves so currently there is no definition of battery energy storage whether it's in FX statutes or when in conservation development commission statutes or anywhere we know there needs to be you know a lot more battery storage systems out there and the market is such that we're going to start seeing um independent ones not associated with projects so that's what this legislation is intended to start start with is to create some justification that there is a path um so what it would do is you I said put a definition in and then it would allow optin to FC um by a development that's all the battery or that's all the legislation does it doesn't clarify how at the local level it would be reviewed and approved um there's different thoughts on that but I think this is the first of probably you know a couple of different bills related to battery energy storage I don't think this will be the the end of it I think this is just the beginning of it so likely we'll see more of this at the next legis session uh next is House Bill 4090 that would eliminate have sec jurisdiction on projects that are entirely proposed on lands and then House 1525 so the bill currently is related to the Oregon Department of energy uh Portland General Electric has added a component to that bill which would allow for standby generators to be connected to the electrical grid and dispatched to the Grid in certain circumstances currently by definition a standby generator cannot be connected to the grid um it's typically would be like a data center would have a series of diesel generators that if power is lost those would K in provide power during that outage um anything that's over 25 megaw anything that is connected to the grid would not be defined as a standard stand by generator um and would have to come to FX for review this change to the bill would add a component for certain standby generators to be able to connect to the grid um and under certain circumstances would allow power they produce to be dispatched to the grid um the the bill or the that component of the bill makes reference to 40 CFR code of feder regulations 63664 subf um and I'm not going to go through that but it creates sort of emergency circumstances so power outages or brown outs or other types of situations it provide some limitation about when those standby generators could be used to dispatch power to the grid um so the bill also indicates that the generators would have to re use renewable fuels if they are available if those fuels are available and they do not impact the warranty of the generator and begining is most of the generators out there now are diesel generators so I'm not sure what the availability is to use renewable or alternative fuels in circumstances so kind of boiling it down what this would do is if you recall last month there was the big storm and there were power outages this would be in that kind of circumstances um it would effectively allow you know you know the OHSU or Intel or you know Amazon or those kind of big facilities that have those diesel generators would allow them to connect to the grid um and cumulatively it's a peer plan that's really what it is um is in those circumstances would be providing power that then the utility you know either couldn't provide or would help them in those kind of so that is thank you sy Syd for so we've done some recent work on standby generator and so will we come back well that require us to come back again to readdress that by memory um who specifically State cannot U be the or connected so we'd have to come back we have not evaluated I have not evaluated the bill language to determine whether or not that's going to require followup Ru making it pro it probably will I just not reviewed it in that context yet um and there has been some changes to it so still it's early in the session because we're pass the session the language you know wasn't part of the original bill it was added to it so um probably but we'll follow thank you um unless there's any questions on the legislation the last item that I have is the March council meeting so March 21st and 22nd uh we will need both days we have the potential for three draft posted order hearings um on Thursday evening and then we'll have probably a more typical meeting on Friday which probably should go past noon but we'll also have a r making hearing depending upon what you do today um so it'll be a pretty big meeting um based on the location of the projects we had intended to be in Boardman but there is there is no place to hold meeting on those days Boardman so and you spent a lot of time trying to figure that out um so we're going to be in Herston bu just a quick question is yeah sure we will look into that and get to in terms of timing and coordin record I say um while s Boardman as far as Katie could probably attest to this Boardman Heron it's work East and I think that's what matters so thank for the extra effort but I I don't think that's a bad thing to and Todd if I might ask you and I get it the bill is going to change not stop but would it be possible to have chrisy send us or you send us what the three language that you have I will do that by the end of the day I will send you the current bill language or unable Monday F yeah or I mean as you know sometimes you'll get like a version of the bill and then the Amendments aren't like the full bill it's just strike this at that um I'll figure out the best way certainly capable of looking to I today so don't things change I just think that that won't be a problem was that 1525 yes okay thanks even with my change in h my curiosity is still I work out as much of my new job that all you had sir that cludes my report thank you all right well always conversation and um wow we are okay agenda Item B contested case r making this is an action item for Council we have Thomas Jackman making coordinator to present to us so Tom come on over for the record the Willer and we are here to discuss the so let's get into so so I sort of have this slide here just to kind of help everybody understand where we are uh for each rle making update that we do uh you can see here we are potentially here at the pice of the notice making stage we have already done initiation we out some rules we submitted those as part of the council packet two weeks ago and what we're doing today is discussing the proposed rules and should Council agree with Ming forward who and then enter the next Spates I would submit them to C State and that would launch the formal public comment hearing and if we look forward today um just a reminder to everybody so I just checked in with Chase who's monitoring the meeting um asked him how well he could hear you and he said not that well so usual I that's just a remind and again I we're just getting adjusted to these mics fairly new so just a reminder to make sure that the mics are relatively close to you when you're speaking so again it's easy and here you can hear everybody very well it's just making sure that those on on the line and then the recording is fine up okay so next so let's uh just provide some background about what we're trying to do here as you see there are five kind areas that we consider within the objectives this making uh the person is and these are progressing through my second year real medic here for I noticed kind of pattern that we kind of some of these we kind of reorder reiz gos to better match the process updating them uniquely here to reflect option of opposite Administrative Hearings model R circum cases uh we're trying to improve the consist to do the rules both internally andely other statutes and appable law where then a big big Focus to this one as you'll see is number four which is the clarity of the rules by dividing enhancing existing various areas Cas process and then lastly we are attempting to improve the efficiency of the contesting case process by providing additional guidance to perspective parties in terms of so yeah great so in Orange there uh we have items one through four those are really intended to be essentially all clarification uh improving the participants or would be participants ability to understand cancel inves process and the intent with these four items is to not really change anything uh certainly the adoption of the uh off Min ministr he roles will introduce some sort of new uh rule language but sense of the process is not going to be altered by any of the things we're doing in the SP it will just be increased understanding increased Clarity for everybody in terms of how the process is intended to the contested case is intended to operate next slide so then we have the number five item here and there are just just a couple two or three um small sort of additional requirements these are requirements that didn't previously exist so the would be substantive changes but uh as you'll see they're fairly l in scope but the intent here is that by introducing requir participants who follow them will then have an easier time the contested case process will I next SL please so let's go through the five different changes real quick uh first of all we have sort of a reorder reorganizing this is the existing kind of rule layout for the council cons process it goes from in division 15 from rule 12 through rule 85 and you don't already know division 15 is essentially the application process which at the tail end does include the for contested case um but you'll know 12 isort of of",

        "text": " has an issue for sure and then you know we try to be responsive and correct that issue as well as working with uh Cory Sweeney at um the weed superintendent for Moro County as well it's taking those lessons learned from our operating or further along in the permitting process projects and pulling that to these projects like all these documents are living documents and need to be updated as new information recommendation from County staff or you know subject matter experts uh comes up to date um and then just to I know there's a little bit of mystery of our um agricultural mitigation plan so I just kind of want to talk through how we got there and what what our thinking was right and so just to overview of the land we're using um predominantly not high value Farmland we're not using any irrigated land it's mostly dry land wheat and yeah we are expected to impact about um 3700 Acres of that land next slide please and so here here's kind of the reasons for a go three exception and just to be clear uh I think we fall under the that third bullet point um for other relevant factors or what two referred to as reasons just to be clear all right next slide please all right exception is warranted to allow a locality dependent facility that will fulfill important state and County goals by providing renewable energy and minimizing impacts on local farming practices and I kind of want to discuss more how we're trying to minimize our impacts on local farming practices next slide please all right location dependency right uh we already have we own and operate two existing facilities directly adjacent to the wagon trail solar project and then we operate a third additional facility there uh we're trying to group these projects as close together um one to not spread out all over the county all over the land the closer that we can get all these facilities um you know the more land there are adjacent to farm around and we don't have a bunch of little nooks and crannies within the facilities where equipment's not able to access uh additionally a big factor is having access to transmission interconnection rights as well as you're like okay it's cool that you can get electricity to a utility but can you actually deliver that power where it's needed that's also a big constraint that I don't think we we've kind of talked about so there's there's multiple factors of being able to connect and actually deliver the power where it's needed those are two different things and we are set up in this specific location to meet all of those needs next slide please yep and then this is just a visual uh display of all of our operating projects so uh the white green is the Wheat Ridge East Wind project as it stands now um and then the orange and blue outlines are Wheat Ridge one and two wind facilities and as you can see The Wagon Trail solar facility which is that purple outline is built right into the um kind of the layout of the existing wind facilities and another benefit of of that overlap is we're allowed you know we're able to share facilities between three you know in this case up to five different energy facilities right so then you have less operation maintenance buildings less substations less overhead transmission lines scattered throughout the county so we're able to share all of those existing facilities and not disturb any more land to to get power to the grid next slide please thank you okay so talking about our direct and indirect impacts to agriculture as I said we're expecting to impact around 3700 acres of aable land um and with no loss to irrigated land so kind of what does that look like um we had Eco Northwest do a economic impact study of you know what pulling this amount of Dryland wheat crop really affects the economy and I I I think the direct impact is is pretty easy to say right the the land owners that land were using who farm that land are being compensated via a solar lease right they're getting a monetary gain from the use of that land um the hard thing to kind of determine is what about the people who are indirectly affected whether that's tenant Farmers uh the local agricultural industry stores suppliers um and that's where we kind of really targeted what we're doing right um and so talk about tenant Farmers we have a great relationship and history proven history of Contracting the tenant Farmers whose land we're taking whether it's due Road grading Road Improvement uh you know it's not that we are trying to like displace them move on and not be associated with them we are just trying to substitute their income with instead of farming it would be uh support of the energy facility and we have been extremely conscious of that and intend to do so moving forward as well uh the other Factor the the indirect impacts of um developing agricultural land so through our study uh we're expected to impact approximately 487 ,000 um dollars per year of Dryland wheat and that'll be kind of the impact to the agricultural economy um and what we did is we looked at what are we currently doing like what are the real numbers in moral County that we are spending well luckily for us we have the operating solar facility and we know exactly how much money we're spending uh specifically on weed abatement weed mitigation so we took that number got a quote from our same who's located Moro yilla County who who operates who purchases his chemicals from more County grain Growers and also uh in Hermon and it turns out we were spending more money than the farmers were spending to cultivate that land and that's based off of numbers that Mr Rous gave us as well as the tenant Farmer on the other property gave us so it's like okay well I understand those are not dollar for dooll Replacements right I think that's like an important acknowledgement to to make but it's also you know we are still spending in the economy we are using local business businesses to help us out um and that's where it came from and so really that $500,000 contribution has nothing to do with offsetting the the indirect impacts so to say right because we have the numbers we have the proof that we're spending that money in the economy anyway really what it it came from is listening to the public saying like hey there's a need to you know help about these other people that you're affecting like what can you do to help us out so we listened to um really the county initially brought it up to me and sorry Tamara if you feel like I kind of cut you out but the process I took is I went to the the the shareholders were actually affected so whether that's Farmers directly in the location near North Lex I talked to Chris talked to Cory Miller and I said hey give me a list of people who would have good ide is to support Dryland wheat for everybody in the county not just people with the project and so I got a list probably five people I talked to every single one and I said like how much money do you need and what would you do with that money and the people that kind of stuck with me was Larry lucher at the OSU Extension Office doing Dryland we research because you know I think one of the best ways we can mitigate our impacts is being more efficient with the acreage we are farming and that's directly what he's doing right and so he gave me a list of equipment he wants I said cool done I like that idea let's do it and then the next was uh more County grain Growers I I spoke to their GM I said like what do you see a need and you know I think I I spoke about the northflex grite elevator just because it's directly adjacent to the our project you know they want to put in three-phase power need to do some shot creete repairs um I don't think our money that we're contributing will will fix everything they want but I think it's a good start and right we're operating in the community and if we need to sponsor another project we will it's just not you know laid out in writing um and the the other aspect that kind of went down was like how do we want to to do this because one it had never been done by the time I'm I'm working through this issue I told Chase I was like hey we need another month like we heard there's this need um obviously like not to like point out but there's another project doing the same thing um that I'm sure you'll hear about later and it's already been approved by the county but like we were like trying to blaze our own path and see you know what is the right way to handle this and and what we came to you know after talk to the stakeholders is directing the money directly to the people who need it to get it to them quickly right we said we want to pay all of it up front we requested from staff to make it a pre-construction compliance condition so you know that we are required to make these payments prior to starting construction um and they only called out 470,000 and the commitment we we made to the two parties was a total of 500,000 so regardless of what the condition is we are doing the $500,000 and that was just kind of like our thinking so I just wanted to clear that up I will say right it is a new idea and um I try to be thoughtful and listen to the community um on how to get there the one thing that I didn't do that probably right like next time around is maybe get Tamara more involved or uh go through the and no like no no like shade to anybody right in the county but it's like hey maybe if the county wants to be the administrator of the funds like figure out a way to make that work um I did not do that for this one just because I thought like hey the fastest way that I can get the aid to the people who need it the people were affecting is directly doing it before we disturb of the land and so that was our thinking we're not trying to like go around anybody anything uh next slide please yeah this uh just kind of talks about taxes like yeah we pay our taxes um uh but the the other thing that's like kind of important right is the operational jobs that it will bring right obviously you have the construction jobs brings spending in the uh in the local economy but operational jobs right this will give uh moral County three to five high paying technical jobs that can then be levied into a career at next a or any other Energy company honestly um and then right we",

        "text": " as a medium one of those on the medium timeline so three to five years it was initially thought we would start looking at this we've learned recently that Eugene has moved forward just passed a ban in its natural gas starting this year on residential and that was low rise residential so nothing about three stories is my understanding and that was only new construction so not existing um so they are moving forward Milwaukee passed two resolutions earlier last year asking staff to come back with code um for uh to prohibit gas infrastructure again in residential and that's beginning in they also the second resolution was for City Gas systems that are failing to be replaced kind of electric and I think in some instances starting right away on that so A couple cities are looking at um I've not seen a whole lot at the state level here yet I know buildings and Energy Efficiency itself has been a big conversation topic there's a resilient buildings task force that's had a number of conversations the Oregon global warming commissions had a number of con conversations on building efficiency there's a few bills kind of on the table a couple that would prohibit local entities from from doing these kinds of prohibitions there's one in the other direction that would allow so not seeing a lot of movement on either of those yet but there's a number of conversations in looking I did see that Washington State just recently their State Building Code now requires in July of this year heat pumps for new residential and Commercial so there are some changes some people looking at this it's not one we've looked at yet and I Know It causes a number of concerns as as most of these in the high list probably will so it's kind of where we're at right now okay any questions or comments okay thank you all right uh next one mw23 enhanced the capture of Wastewater emissions um that was on our long-term list so greater than five years out this is one that I need to actually do a bit more research on you know as we just completed our admissions inventory we realized we're not releasing methane to the atmosphere from that process likely I think we thought previously and our missions are actually pretty darn low you know 5 000 compared to 1.2 million excuse my ignorance on this but isn't this what our Cogen facility does well and that was my initial thought as well I guess okay yeah yes it does and I think the reason this is high as Heather said is that when this list is first made out we had a very high Wastewater division rate based on the loan assumption that we missed okay someone thought we had living yeah I do have space for a second coach in it and so I'm not sure what our efficiency is on how much we're capturing now if there's more to be captured if we put a second coach now and my understanding is that the Cogen facility has challenges currently just because we're kind of yeah the new one that we put in is new generation and we've had a lot of ongoing mechanical issues with it so when it's up and running it's extremely efficient but we also have quite a few so it's a few years old now so maybe the technology was catching up and better but we did build a building margin to house a certain fund and I'm not sure like I said I'm not sure what our capture rate is are we all of it or I don't know the number and it might be a bit flawed because of the on-again off again of the actual running event right it would be I would like to know more about that on again off again business and take a look at that I would just like to know more about this whole thing yeah right like did this come from the assumption that we had lagoons if so do we need to reword this to be more specific about adding the same one or right like I this seems very yeah yeah so maybe mw23 is when we can take a deeper dive into to see like yeah counselor was saying is it is it relevant is there does it need to be reworked is it you know was it based on uh faulty information let's take a look let's take a deeper dive on that one okay just have to be careful when you're taking a deeper drive into Wastewater emissions so thank you for that cautionary note uh Mr city manager I appreciate that okay so we're halfway through this list um promote Energy Trust Oregon um programs for industrial and large commercial buildings um this one was um expected to start three to three to five years out so it's a medium one it seems very similar to the first one that we spoke of to me where we're just promoting their programs in general although I do think if we're if we're targeting Industrial and Commercial businesses it our Outreach probably needs to be a bit more targeted as well and that's something that like you said Lisa might have Lisa and other staff at the city might have more and maybe a conversation with said core too to get them engaged and to make sure that yeah so it to me it seems like we had a um 32 and 35 together and not yeah there's some seems like there's some opportunities there on both of those so that makes sense so that one we could potentially move move forward sooner great okay Ian 30 and en9 these are the two that although they're worded slightly differently and they um they actually had different timelines to start um I did confirm they're the same task um so work with PGE to design and adopt a community-wide clean energy program or a green power rate as cn30 says so PGE actually came and I think it was the same meeting that Energy Trust joined and they gave a very high level overview of what is a new um potential umbrella green tariff program that's actually been kind of baked into house bill 2021 and that's the the bill that set pretty stringent clean energy targets for Pacific Power in PGE so this community supported Renewables tariff program is in that film language as well as an option for the utility stick to come up with and what that would be for communities is it is a higher rate if a community is interested and we sign we go through and sign a participant participation agreement with PGE that's pretty detailed then we would potentially have a higher rate across the city that would be an opt out for folks so it would require again a lot of communication a lot of discussion up front and then there were you know folks of low income would not be they would be automatically enrolled without the extra fee it's my understanding but there's a lot of details that PG is still working to work through so we met with PGE recently a few of us and they confirmed that the program is still under development they're still working through the bones of what this tariff might look like the next step as I understand PGE submits to the Oregon Public Utilities Commission their clean energy plan which outlines their plan forward to meet The Targets in House Bill 2021 and I think it is supposed to include kind of the basic framework for this Doterra program as well so once that plan is submitted and they'd mentioned March so I need to keep my eyes open see if that gets submitted I think it's going to be several months is what they're expecting before the puc would approve that plan in a program and then they would start having conversations with communities individual communities um in PGE and Pacific Power service territory to see if to gauge interest in this tariff program for their community so it would need to be approved by a city council before it would even need to go okay so we'll stay tuned to see what that work looks like at the at the puc level yeah I'm going to start watching and see when that gets submitted and and checking in with kind of other folks other cities are watching us as well what would the money go brain energy efforts yeah there's there would be still being fleshed out but basically to some to support local renewable energy projects and I think that could be like hyper local potentially like in Salem um some small scale projects maybe like with battery I think we could you know depending on the agreement we could potentially work with PG and kind of focus areas of where they might go if we so choose otherwise money can just go to you know kind of more Regional projects it's really I think right now sounds pretty darn flexible yeah something we'd want to work through um in pretty good detail so interesting thank you all right so en14 third from the top a weatherization prioritizing low income and that was low-income renters homeowners and businesses for the full language um this one was on our early implementation list I didn't pull it over to our work plan primarily because this because the city is not really the lead in this one at this point so development of a new weatherization program kind of at least the way the strategy was written really hinges on healthy homes program funding which the Oregon Health Authority will be administering that program they're still finalizing the program details it looks like they anticipate having grant funding available later this year for local agencies that are interested in administering local programs but it's not yet available when I spoke to Mid Willamette Valley Community Action Agency last year they were interested in applying I haven't touched base with them for several months but this information was also forwarded to the Housing Authority as well as Marion County and they've kind of expressed interest I don't know if they have capacity as well for this kind of program but it's not presently something that at least right now that the city is planning to kind of administer on our own so it's hopefully moving forward soon and we'll keep checking in with our partners in the community but it's not something that we're taking the lead on right now no um this one here I know the CD is not taking the lead and Community Action has for years had this program but I think it'd be nice to sort of um eventually start Gathering all the players together to know what's happening I mean just this morning there was a report I'm not sure which European country I forgot the low income a lot of people's um ability heating bills have doubled and they've had to create warm zones for people so 300 sites around the country that's for people to be warm during the day after their kids get out of school and before they go to bed and because they just can't afford to heat their house and a lot of it was if you just hear them it was weatherization related one lady was saying how a draft comes through her house",

        "text": " to um how you see or you and your members see fsac and just as i i view f sex process as pretty tight with pretty tight timeline lines and uh to do the work this significant amount of work that needs to be done and how do your members see f sex process in terms of in light of the timeline that you just certainly focused on here today how do you see f sex uh timeline within that more comprehensive timeline that's a great question um i would say increasingly your assessment of it being pretty tight i think is increasingly an observation from what i'm hearing from our members because of those things that are taking longer after the site certificate so the off take the interconnection the questions around materials procurement you know finding all the labor and everything is getting all that done in the three years for start of the three years works if everything goes and so uh that that would be one observation general observation that i would share um for that and and sorry i should have i i view the tightness as for staff oh that too yeah to review and kind of get back to people and and if i'm not mistaken once that sector certificate is issued the timeline can be extended extended with an amendment you know um so hopefully that provides some flexibility to get that work done uh yeah i think the amendment does um although i would defer to staff on on the if that adds extra work for them um you know from the applicant standpoint i think it it does add extra uh work and cost i don't know if it's similar for staff when they have to review an amendment but um yeah no i i definitely appreciate the the uh tight timeline for the staff and the amount of work that they have to do for these applications okay thank you again thanks for being here today are there any other questions comments sure grill if i may i just want to let that all the comments play out so councilmember talk to us brought up one question about offshore um energy and so i just want to provide a little bit of comment about that um just i was thought somebody might somebody else might talk about that but but since they didn't i'll bring it up um so just to be clear anything offshore is not f-sect jurisdictional and that's why we typically don't have conversations about those types of facilities not that there have been any yet or beyond demonstration facilities but there is currently um some evaluations going on between or the state of oregon the state of california and the federal government for some pretty you know significant offshore wind in the future there's certainly a a desire you know i think by all parties that i just to have that and if it's beyond three miles offshore it would be federal jurisdiction if it's within three miles it's state jurisdiction but that is the department of state lands and not fsec so where that might trigger some connectivity to f-sec is if you did see a large wind energy facility likely that would also result in a pretty significant transmission line to get that to the power grid and that's that transmission line would very likely be our jurisdiction unless there's some change in in state or federal policy right now um it would likely be our jurisdiction but that would be the limit to our jurisdiction but you know um max and diane talked about sort of the we're likely to see you know a lot of new you know future projects uh the forecasting that we're looking at we're seeing the same thing that's in addition the potentially big offshore wind projects so i think it's at least in the forecast to try to you know get into you know 100 renewable or as close as we can it will include all of those elements and not just either offshore or onshore it'll be a combination of those two i know it's pretty generic but if council members want any more information on the work that's being on offshore when the department of energy is certainly part of that not us in within the sighting division but other parts of the department of energy are participating in that and we can certainly provide you some updates on that if you're interested thanks i'd quickly just add to that that oregon state university is uh by next year i understand we'll have a wave energy test facility up and running off about seven miles off the coast of thank you patrick any other comments other questions well then again i'll say thank you to max and diane for joining us today and we appreciate the information it was thorough and extremely helpful that will transition us to our last agenda item which is agenda item h the west end solar energy project hearing officer appointment we this is an action item and we have kellen tardy weather odo senior sighting analyst to walk us through this item madam chair we've got chase is stepping in for kellen who was unable to be here today so chase mcvay walker will be doing this presentation instead all right on hi chase maybe you're doing it time oh there let me put my hand down now okay okay well thank you for joining us and thanks for stepping up to handle this agenda item for us no problem okay i can figure this out okay well share my screen okay well can everyone hear me first of and are you able to see my slide screen and we'll get started good afternoon madden chair vice chair howe and members of the council for the record my name is chase mcvay walker senior signing analyst at the oregon department of energy item h this afternoon is a request to appoint a hearing officer for the proposed west end solar energy facility let me see okay i think this is good the agenda item will be rather brief and administrative as my presentation consists of only a few slides with that being said feel free to stop me at any point for questions on this agenda item and i can do the best of my ability to answer them the appointment of a hearing officer does require council action as uh chair stated so following my presentation we will need to have a motion and a vote on it west end solar energy project is a proposed 50 megawatt solar photovoltaic energy generation facility to be located in umatilla county two miles southeast of the city of hermiston within a site boundary of approximately 324 acres of exclusive farm use zoned land additionally as proposed there's going to be up to 70 megawatts of energy storage as part of this facility in a little brief uh procedural history the department received a request for expedited review from the applicant on december 11 2020 and then received the preliminary application for site certificate in november of 2021 the department then issued an expedited review project order on february 10 and is currently reviewing the pasc or preliminary application for site certificate for completeness following the completeness review the department will issue the draft proposed order and hold a public hearing on the or draft proposed order which it to occur in 2022 the dpo public hearing will require a hearing officer to run the hearing and this is a map locational map for the proposed west end solar energy project and if you can see my cursor which is a tiny white arrow right in the middle is a purple box and that is the proposed location of this energy facility two miles approximately two miles southeast of the city of hermiston the oregon office of administrative hearings or oah provides an independent and impartial forum for citizens and businesses to to dispute state agency actions and it also employs 65 professional administrative law judges or aljs that are utilized by approximately 70 state agencies however odo and fsec are not legally required to utilize oah since 2017 however fsec has exclusively used oah aljs as hearing officers in the list uh following the last bullet on this slide below shows the last seven projects that have featured an the department has coordinated with our counterparts at oah for a recommendation of a hearing officer for the west end solar energy project oah has recommended administrative law judge miss allison green webster to be appointed as the hearing officer for the west end solar energy project the staff report for this agenda item agenda item h provides a short bio on alj green webster and includes some of her relevant history including her current and previous f-sec most recently miss green webster served as the hearing hearings officer for the boardman solar energy facility proceedings which occurred in 2017 and and she is currently serving as the hearing officer presiding over the contested case proceedings for the boardman to hemingway transmission line additionally miss greenwebster also presides over hearings for the city of portland fire and police disability and retirement fund she has been a presenter at administrative law conferences and the oregon dui multi-disciplinary impaired driving training conference she is a trainer and peer reviewer for other administrative law judges and has a bachelor's degree in communications from ucla she received her jd from loyola law school in los angeles prior to joining the oregon office of administrative hearings ms greene webster worked as staff attorney for the oregon workers compensation board before that she spent several years in private practice in both oregon and miss greenwebster is a member of the oregon state bar and the state bar of california and that leads me to staff's and staff's recommendation to council this afternoon is to appoint alj green or allison green webster as the hearing officer for the west end solar energy project and if you have any further questions i'd be happy to feel them at this point or any questions period i'd be happy to feel them at this point and if not thank you chief yes it works uh thank you are there any questions for madam chair this is kent i'll move the council appoint administrative logic allison green webster from the oregon office of administrative hearings as a hearing officer for the proceedings for the west end solar project as recommended by staff thank you we have a motion and a second there any further discussion hearing none mr secretary please call the role hillary jenkins perry chalk dude kent howe marcy grill cindy condon yes motion carries madam chair thank you mr secretary chase thank you handling that presenting and we appreciate your assistance that is our last agenda item are there any further things that mr secretary you need to communicate to council yes thank you madam chair one one follow-up item so um so chris reminded me that we already actually do have a bond letter of credit rule-making uh agenda item or",

        "text": " ability to um prioritize funding to households that need it and not necessarily have them be competing against um like larger square foot households for the same dollars great well thanks for answering anyway um all right now on to the slide we're on um I still don't see any hands up we do have a couple of comments in here including from my former next door neighbor and dear friend um so Jeremy um just says if the purpose is to encourage energy improvements that would not otherwise happen and doesn't see much reason to spend money retroactively the exception would be if there's a delay between publishing the admin rules and the actual program launch date so I think for us it's less it's less publishing admin rules it's more our application and what we put in there that we would um and then what we put in we'd have to hear back from the Feds that they say okay to before we would feel good about that being the criteria that we think will be for the program so if we get the feedback from doe that like yes your program is accepted as drafted and then there's a big delay between that and the actual program launch dat AK us getting the money that's I think what Jeremy's saying might be interesting to think about and then Noel um wanted to share that retroactivity she doesn't think retroactivity is appropriate for Equity reasons but if they were to do it perhaps retroactive to January 1 2024 just to help contractors ramp up gradually instead of starting when um rebates are released and there's kind of a rush on them um I don't see any other comments and I don't see any other hands so I'm sure we'll get a couple of other comments on this slide later um but we can might go maybe go on and start thinking about the next Topic at hand so for this one um homes rebates will not cover 100% of project costs and while stacking with other programs is possible it's still likely that some of the project costs will need to be covered by the participant despite this do you have recommendations and considerations for reaching justice 40 and other disadvantaged communities with program while you're thinking about it one of the um areas where we're seeing overlap between um lowincome justice 40 or other disadvantaged community um and the homes program maybe lining up well would be in multif family housing um which also kind of poses its own set of um unique circumstances for trying to reach participants um and get participation in the program so just thinking about it um it could be framed specifically about um kind of uh single family homes in general or we could start talking in a little bit more about multif family homes with this uh David has his hand up I'll tell you when you're off mute David and I'm not sure if Stacy's here or Abby's here I know we're we're switching our moderators during our during or our host but we are green now great thanks Abby or Stacy David you're good to go yeah thanks so regarding specifically like um how to reach justice 40 and other disadvantaged communities I would say you know building into your delivery model you know community- based organizations who are focused on delivering services to those communities um you I you know modeled around what's gone on in Portland with you know Portland clean energy fund efforts you know we're starting to actually see a lot of success with that um where there are Community Based organizations that were never involved previously with Energy Efficiency programming are now involved uh in helping get those Services delivered to their community members who would otherwise you know not have been participants in these kind of programs in the past whether or not that means you know flexing some of the administrative dollars to go through those folks as official Outreach or navig positions or something else but including them in the delivery model thanks all right thanks David um we did get some feedback about concern about um 100% incentives can lead to waste and um Jay Ward hey Jay Wonder if PF or the climate Protection Program or the some of the other federal funds money that's coming in be stacked to cover j40 customer obligations the answer is probably yes on that stuff do you want to weigh in but I think that's definitely looking at stacking yeah although there's some limitations on like which federal programs can and can't stack together I know USD is trying to provide clear guidance on how much of what federal funding sources can go toward any given project um and so there's still some ambiguity about what what is and isn't eligible for stacking great but yeah we'll definitely be looking at stacking overall is a way to get there thanks Jay and yeah just what specific programs will be up for debate um Arlene wonders if the 80% Ami criteria is is that in effect here and covering 100% for those who qualify and 50% for higher incomes is that is that right um so that the reason why we're asking about this is because we we foresee it as challenging to meeting um some of the justice 40 requirements uh and targeting households and have limited resources and limited Capital to support energy projects um so how do we how do we navigate that space to try to reach um you know direct a minimum of 40% of the benefits of this program to those types households uh let's see um another thought on providing clear paths for multif family project may be the efficient path toward meeting justice 40 and then from Ashland Ashland likes to have good ideas generally and it says they're interested in combining homes with on Bill financing for a justice 40 track and um it'd be great if Odo could work with a CBO or the city to organize such a program so thanks for that idea Emily our super smart federal grants officer is waiting weighing in to say stacking rebates with non-federal funds like utility programs is generally allowable and encouraged as long as the total rebated value does not exceed the total cost of the project good there um and then we have a comment that an initial targeting analysis could drive this selection to identify uh dacks that will experience the best outcomes on their bills and provide system value relev to relative to existing constraints and that D communities are the most vulnerable to increased Bill impacts that can be the result of electrification so targeting connects the right customers to the right Solutions helping customers save on their bills while mitigating The increased energy burden from new technologies like home electrification and should be considered as a best practice for implementing these programs in Oregon so we make sure we look at that comment again later too and um and Jeremy again just saying there's currently huge utility incentives on many projects and measures I I don't know that that's necessar true for a lot of these um but it will almost certainly not be hard to exceed 100% um I I not sure I think nearly all incentive programs prevent you from being able to take an incentive over 100% for what it's worth and Derk Larsson thinks Outreach to renters both for the creation of the program and once programs are alive should be a priority um and um they may not be the decision makers but it is them who's going to affect the most so maybe look into build shift um effort in Portland there's so much that is happening in the city of Portland that we're very actively tracking and looking into for inspiration so thanks for that specific flag um I don't see any other hands up or any other comments right now so we can go ahead and move to the next slide and now a couple general questions um how can we just kind of talked about this but any other thoughts on how Odo can ensure rebates reach low-income and disadvantaged communities specific specifically that live in multif family housing so if you have any additional thoughts that specifically relate to multif family that'd be great and then what consideration should be made to encourage landlords to allow for energy efficient upgrades that benefit their tenants so kind of digging in a little bit more onto the multif family Andor rentals any thoughts on that David has his hand up David go ahead yeah and um thanks for recognizing me again sorry to take up too much time but I'm really glad you're raising your hand it's so helpful to have some conversation and not just me talking in the chat from the chat than I won't make it an echo chamber uh so I know some states have been considering just setting aside a certain amount of the he money for flowing through their um you know their state affordable housing finance office here that would be Oregon community housing community services you know they already have their oret program which is you know Energy Efficiency money for multi family um programs so just thinking if you just wondering if you might think about um you know pushing some of your money on here if you want to hit multifamily it could be aligned with that programming over there since they already do a process for folks to apply get identified and it's affordable um some of it's new construction some of it's retrofit but the here money isn't uh limited to just existing so um it could fit nicely alongside that money if you wanted to guarantee that it you were going to hit a certain percent of uh improving affordable multifam yeah and I will just note we've been talking with um housing community services about their programs and how we can um ensure that these are complimentary to each other so thank you for that additional flag on the specific program that they're working on yeah probably just good information too and then we'll get to Jay thanks for raising your hand Jay I'll get we'll get you off mute in a sec um but what I wanted to just quickly add to that is we actually have legislation that directs us to establish these programs and that legislation actually directs us to do it in coordination um with ohcs so definitely working closely with them all right Jay I'll let you know when you're off mute you are off mute I wanted toh touch on Jeremy's comments uh earlier and and I certainly am not immersed in all of our offerings but the only we an Indy trust operates uh in offers incentives for several of the investor own Utilities in the state and I can't think think of uh any incentives that I would consider to be huge with the possible exception of a heat pump pilot that we're running right now that is both Limited in time and budget um the rest of the ones that we offer at least in IOU territory are um basically cost effective and incremental um so I I would hope they would be leveraged into this program but I don't know that uh we're going to contribute much to the going over exceeding 100",

        "text": " of noxious weeds uh it was also referenced under the fish and wildlife habitat standard for this facility as it's um it's unne necessity to achieve habitat restoration of temporary impacts next slide please and then the fire safety plan that we mentioned also needs to be adjusted to incorporate sheet management the fire safety plan for this facility was imposed as a condition under the council's Public Services standard it was intended to minimize impacts to fire service providers by ensuring that there was adequate risk protection at the site so this is the existing condition existing plan risk protection is covered by worker training requirements annual coordination with local fire service providers vegetation management and then adequate evaluation of controls at the site so sheet management comes into the veg management component thank you um so again for both of these plans that apply during operations the certificate holders requesting that they be amended to incorporate a sheep management strategy their sheep are being proposed primarily to control vegetation in lie of mowing to reduce on-site fire risk uh and fuel sources mowing is described by the certificate holder as difficult and impossible to get underneath the solar panels themselves and sheep are viewed as being able to get under there more uh there is hope that the Sheep will help control noxious weeds but it's much more of a vegetation management um strategy the certificate holders identified that sheet management would be provided by Krebs solar grazing um it would include a sheep herder on site 247 if and when the Sheep are on site um and then any Personnel on site whether it's the Sheep herder or other Specialists from this kreb solar grazing LLC would be trained of sight hazards and of site requirements so they're um estimating they could have 400 to 2400 sheep at this site again it's 1100 Acre Site um but up to 2400 sheep at the site during any given month they may use dogs at the site to help move them around and help to control PR risk although the site so all solar facilities are completely fenced I don't know if a coyote can get in there but um and then they've said if the use of dogs and a herder would help disperse animal waste so that they're not just in one location these are all you know things that we're kind of saying is this allowable what's the risk what's going on next slide please so we um immediately con consulted with our uh uh sister agency of Department of Agriculture expert Jim Johnson to better understand uh what are the concerns risks um that we might need to understand uh if any within the context of council standards um he suggested that we evaluate the applicability of an animal feeding um oh that's not right confined animal feed law operation which would um sort of address concerns with runoff waste runoff getting into a water body um but there's specific criteria that apply to this type of permit and that we ask the certificate holder to evaluate it they don't believe any of those criteria would be triggered um within the fence line of this site uh through survey results we know this to be true there are no cultural resources no Wetlands no threaten and endangered plants no threaten and endangered species um that could be further impacted by these sheep uh it the idea of sheep management grazing at the site would be to reduce long-term use of herbicides at the site and then could potentially benefit local a practices by supporting use of the sheep there are existing conditions that would apply to the Sheep whether they're there or not um landowner consultation ongoing during operation that's required under condition 38 and then uh operational inspection and repair of erosion issues under condition 85 again more concerns that we're like What are the impacts under Council standards of allowing this that we might need to be worried about and um it kind of lands with we don't have very many concerns at all um but we do want to know that it's happening so we requ we don't want Dwayne to be surprised when he goes out there and there's dogs and sheep um 2400 sheep um so we have asked them to incorporate these uh this element not that we would we intending to like regulate the practice of sheep grazing but if it's in there then we know about it and we can be um do our inspection safely so the sheet management element uh is being Incorporated Into the Fire Safety Management plan and noxious weed um just with specifics about how many sheep might be out there and how they'll they will evaluate how many sheep would be out there so we are recommending that you approve these plan uh amendments um and that it would authorize reduce level of herbicide treatment at the site long term if it's successful I just have a question this is a new practice sort of I think um is there any way we can ask the applicant for some kind of monitoring report to see how effective this is because if it's a good practice we might want to encourage others to do it yeah if it's not we would discourage but I'm just curious on as to how well it will work because it I like the idea just of show me show me how it looks on the ground well and that was um that was an interesting outcome of talking with Jim at Department of a where he really questioned how the site could have enough vegetation to support 2400 sheep and he said they're going to have to do supplemental feeding supplemental planting I mean they do have to stabilize the site um it can't be like a dust bowl uh and so they they will do um but the benefit of having it in both of the noxious weed plan and fire safety plan is that they will have to report I think that we could um it I would say the way that they would report it's not clear that they have to report on the success of it or even like um I guess it would be ideal if they can report on that per head count and vegetation density that would support it given what they've currently forecasted but because we do want it to be successful it's like a mitigation plan like so council member Condon uh thank you um excuse me um this is kind of interesting I know gilam county is a lot different than Lane County but it uh if I remember correctly mudy Creek is also thinking about uh sheet um grazing and I realize the vegetation different all that but um it'll be interesting to see those at the same time as we go through the process of looking at muddy creek and yeah you know what the future may bring in terms of sheep and yeah solar thank you council member IMS yes I just have a comment um I live in moral County and um this is an unrelated site but um uh we have a dam and Hepner and um the US Army cor of Engineers they bring in um goats every year to feed on the the dam and get all of the vegetation off and it's a very successful program it's a completely different um site and than you know a solar field where you know so but I just wanted to add that to the you know it this has been being done in other areas of application so um look forward to seeing what how it works out on the solar field pant thank you council member chaku yes for the record uh this is council member Perry choc I want to um just for informational purposes before we decide whether or not we should put sheep or goats out on Project areas um we want to make sure that 100% of the project area has been identified for resources because goats and sheep not only eat the grass but they'll eat the roots of grass meaning it's a ground disturbance to have these animals on your property and so if we're going to accept that as a uh a determiner on whether or not uh hazardous vegetation is growing need to realize that first off the vegetation is growing in dirt and it growing is a non-disturbance where it being removed by a farm animal is a disturbance so we want to make sure that we're looking at uh whether or not the project area has been 100% identified as by archaeologist as being culturally significant or not so I just wanted to make that uh just a little informational piece for you thank you um Vice chair how I think had a comment yeah I had a question um great presentation thank you Sarah um you said this is first one in Oregon or first one for FC right okay using she goats are more well I know like eweb in yeah along the canal uh up the McKenzie uses goats very effectively but it's for blackberries you know so okay kind of different but um okay so that was other studies around the United States doing it any information at all huh I don't know the answer to that yeah okay and one last question uh the patchway wi that's the old monag renaming do we have any idea of what that means I thought it had something to do with son ch um counselor choc to hatte to put you on the spot here but uh do you happen to know the meaning of uh the wit for record this is Perry Cho I believe that is um matilla or Walla Wala so it's the different tribal members have different uh languages okay that to me that suggests an upper Plateau naming which up there would be Walla waller caus or Y matilla Cool okay thank you I just looked up a press release from Aven grid and similar to what um council member talked to to saying they're saying it says uh patchway means sun in sahaptin language the project is located on seated lands of confederated tribes of the Warm Springs and the name pays homage to the rich history and stewardship of Warm Springs and yella thank you for that Mr secretary for the record Todd cornet just couple of um kind of notes on this um I'm no expert on this but my understanding is we probably will never see goats use um goats jump on things and eat things um like wires and others so it's it's not likely that we're going to see goats used um in these sort of confined areas I think they would likely be too damaging so it probably will be limited to sheep um and obviously we'll see how that works um one other note I think that's probably important is you know and I think this you know the concept is great you know if we can have these sites not use herbicides and pesticides you know that would be um great you know so the point to try to keep you know for Wildfire purposes for um you know weed proliferation purposes um but I also want to make",

        "text": " about this a little bit um I'll just go ahead and and split this we um soorry we the DPO did recommend a new site certific conditions um requiring compliance with the Wildfire mitigation plan attached to the DPO during construction um the conditions then require finalization of the operational portion of the plan prior to beginning um uh based on kind of the comments that we received in the feedback we are we are at the point where we do think additional work is needed prior to construction so we will be looking to that um and our primary recommendations are really regarding coordination with the local fire service providers and I having more specific plans about how to respond but um we're looking for your feedback on that well as well um so if I could the next slide please um so these were the comments that were raised on the record um uh so commenters uh identified uh F of specificity for procedures standards and time frames for inspections and vegetation management during the operational feed uh phase of the project uh lack of Provisions for routine anchor bolt inspections lack of Provisions to to address hazard from lightning strikes and monitoring during lightning events um inadequate consideration of fire spread potential during high wind events potential impacts of residen is agricultural buildings and equipment cropland and cropland soils uh and then inadequate coordination with local fire service providers um I'll provide a little bit of uh of background and and show the fire map and then we can talk about these kind of one by one um so if I could get the next slide um thank you um so this is the fire map we were discussing earlier um I think we've gone over it a lot but I just kind of wanted to show um again how we discussed the prop land areas um do show up as lower risk partly because of the fuel modeling um that goes into this model whereas the more hilly areas show a higher likelihood that a fire that occurred in those areas would be severe and be harder to control um uh this model is a hazard to potential structures so it's not saying the risk to things that are actually on the landscape it's saying if a fire occurred in a started in a pixel how damaging would it be to or how how what's the potential for serious damage to a structure within a certain radius and I I won't give that specific radius uh because I I don't remember what it is but um but it is basically it's meant to approximate how quickly will something spread out of control if it starts in one of these things so um a lot of the areas uh in the more I guess rugged portions of the site the portion to the south of butter Creek um are considered to be moderate to high in their fire risk and you can see there's some very high um portions modeled in there um so we do think that overall um there is moderate to high risk at the site of of a fire becoming uncontrolled if it's not adequately contained um in these new micro sighting areas um those are not the areas where most structures or uh prop lands are um so again I'll just clarify and we can do our best to clarify this in the record that um those this isn't really a reflection of the hazard it's it's the risk um at the say so that makes sense even though this is this why this says Hazard um there's any questions about the map we can talk about it a little more I know we talked about this a lot and what the data is already so um there's no other questions we could move okay not about the map but about um the risk and um incorporating um you know the wind factor right and how you know we're just looking at this site but in reality um the wind can carry Embers miles and we've seen that in Oregon recently so just wanted to point that out as we work through this thank you all thank you council member I'm um one and one of the things that we see as potentially lacking in the Wildfire plan is identification of both natural fire brakes and in places where um the certificate holder would maintain fire brakes uh kind of permanently and then where uh fire lines and other fire suppression activities would be concentrated if there were uh a fire in one of these zones um there are some natural fire breaks in the site the Butter Creek and little Butter Creek and those Associated roads uh do provide somewhat of a defensible space Break um you know so so there is some indication that if a fire were to occur in portions of the site you know it would at least be containable and that we we didn't get that data though from the certificate holder and it hasn't been vetted so that that's something that we think needs to be developed more fully um in the final plan again I just want to reiterate I live in this area and so I'm pretty familiar with fires in the area in fact we had one last summer right in my town and um there was a road barrier present but that didn't stop the fire from crossing the road um there's even Creeks you know like butter Creek that will have winter uh winter runoff in it but then come a month or two later depending on the weather that year it's dry so just want to have those factors considered into the discussion um just how easily it can jump um also we had the Cascade the lock fire a few years ago and we had the Columbia River right there it's a huge body of water and it jumped the river and went over to bonnaville so just want to make sure that we're thinking that out a big Vision like how this really does happen in Oregan With the Wind thank you thank you coun Prim um to continue with the next slide yeah I guess I'll just respond to say I I am not downplaying the risk of fire at the site at all I do think that um council members I'm that right that you know fire risk is is a very serious issue with this facility um and with all energy facilities in general there have been energy like wind turbine related fires in the area um there's grass fires associated with birds hitting power lines um so it does happen it's it's not uh we're not we're not trying to downplay that and hope that the certificate holder is also hearing the level of concern um as um we got a a number of comments about the operational aspects of the pH facility and what they would do to vegetation uh and inspect components to to ensure that the components themselves aren't proposing a um ignition risk um the certificate holder did provide the revised plan that had this table in it this information kind of explaining what their inspection schedule would look like um I uh it provides for for visual inspections of most components uh at least on a quarterly basis uh with some uh inspected annually there's a more detailed list of this in the plan itself um and they would be doing annual inspections to ensure compliance with the Aven power line interaction recommendations um and that's specifically inspecting the transmission line compon components to ensure that um the protections to prevent Avan electrocutions are in place uh and then they would be doing inspections to ensure that the clearances are maintained and gravel pads are are uh free vegetation and that defensible spaces are maintained um you know on this more annual basis I guess um I'm probably not able to speak to the ACT ual standards and manufacturers recommendations in detail but if there are any questions on this we can discuss yeah um I think that's good that there's some time frames here I would think that vegetation in particular those would be be preventative so we would do the those they don't specify what time of year here is that correct I'd have to go back and look recollection is that the inspections and a annual vegetation management plan as far as where they're going to do spraying and mowing for this stuff would be prepared before the Fire season each year um but sure that the county weed person that's the expert here has given that input as to when they would like to see these things done um because you know the council's presented with a pretty high um understanding of that so just wanted to make sure that that collaboration was happening I believe that the weed supervisor is more directly involved with the weed treatments and the weed eradication program but as far as things as like what section of the transmission line needs to be mowed or when trimming needs to occur to maintain the 5 foot clearances from the transmission lines is is kind of a separate issue well I'm just talking about when they're doing it when they're performing the inspection and when they're you know that's that's the only thing I and I don't want to get too far into this I understand this is this is out of my wheelhouse but um as long as it's being done at the appropriate time yeah and and I do believe that before the Fire season and making sure that the trimming is done before the Fire season is the right time um again I'm little over my skis and I can pull up the plan itself if that'd be helpful but um just want to make sure that the coordination and collaboration happening that's that's where this is my question is more geared towards so you um if I could get the next slide um yeah similarly this just kind of lists the the particular vegetation management standards um I do want to point out that um I believe the ion rural Fire Protection District uh requested a 100 foot defensible space around structures and that would include um the substation control build bu and I think the battery site uh itself which they're kind of on a combined site um and we did uh request that be included in a condition uh and I don't think that particular setback distance showed up in the the management plan so I think that would exceed um that defensible space would exceed these standards otherwise the standards are based kind of on the engineering details and the likelihood of um aring based on the voltage of the equipment and that's beyond my particular knowledge set um uh so otherwise these are the standards that would apply it's the international um Institute of electrical engineers uh standards the National Electric committee standards and the um which are I think also adopted by the National Fire Protection Association and then the National Electric reliability Corporation standards um a lot of acronyms a lot of acronyms and I uh yeah please please don't ask me to explain what's what's in that um right next slide um so to kind of go through the issues um uh we heard concerns about hazard from lightning and uh both I think the hazard from lightning striking turbines and the",

        "text": " plan okay thank you cool good thank you any questions or comments on fish and wildlife habitat um let's see council is threatening an endangered species standard this is pretty short based on the applicant's literature review that was confirmed reviewed and confirmed by odfnw and the oregon department of agriculture suitable habitat for state listed threatened and endangered species was not identified within the analysis therefore the department recommends that the standard is met and there are no conditions recommended underneath this this council have any questions no questions the scenic resources standard requires requires a finding of the visibility of proposed facility structures or vegetation loss and landscape alterations would not cause a significant adverse impact to scenic resources and values identified as significant or important in local land use plans tribal tribal management plans or federal management plans um here in the table provided uh is a list of some of the plans that were reviewed and the scenic resources that were um were a table rock uh area of critical environmental concern and two scenic byways in the evaluation in the proposed order the department recommends that council find the visual impacts from the landscape alteration and facility structures associated with construction and operation would not result in significant adverse impacts to these resources that were identified as significant or important um however the applicant does propose measures as i uh highlighted before under protected areas that would reduce um the visual impacts to scenic resources the department recommends these measures under scenic resources condition one um in which that facility structures like the o m building and substation would be used as uh earth tone colors or in a way that blends in the current landscape this would also apply to the battery storage enclosures that facility lighted be shielded and directed downward um to the minimum necessary for construction operations safety and security and this also uh you know applies to reducing potential visual impacts underneath the recreation standard as well as protected areas that's all i had on scenic resources the council's historic cultural archaeological resources standard under sub 1 of this standard the council must find that the construction operation of the facility taking into account mitigation are not likely to result in significant adverse impacts to historic cultural or archaeological resources that have been listed on or would likely be listed on the national register of historic places or the nrhp covers under council's um jurisdiction and review under the standard um for facilities on private lands uh it would cover archaeological objects um and archaeological sites as defined in shippo's statutes shippo is the oregon state historic preservation and under sea for a facility on public lands it would cover archaeological sites do you want to note that the facility site boundary includes that are privately owned and also there's a couple parcels that are owned by the oregon department of state lands or dsl under the standard the department recommends uh two conditions um which i will note on in my um in the applicant's desktop review and from the on-site pedestrian surveys that were conducted in collaboration with the klamath tribes the the applicant identified seven prehistoric sites treated as eligible for the nrhp 22 prehistoric sites treated as potentially eligible and and 69 prehistoric sites treated as not eligible for listing on the uh nrhp these preliminary recommendations were subsequently replaced to treat all of these sites and isolates as part of an archaeological district so uh uh there's archaeological sites which just are just kind of high level explaining it um we have uh archaeological sites which are made up of a grouping or related amount of archaeological objects or isolates but isolate is um you know kind of a smaller unrelated um archaeological potential archaeological resource on on the landscape so all of these um and were essentially treated as a archaeological district um that was an outcome of the work that the department did in with shippo and the applicant and the applicant's uh ongoing early and ongoing coordination with um the affected tribes which primarily included the klamath tribes and the burn pine burns caillou tribe aside from the above ground historic resources which there were a couple historic resources ultimately i believe schiphol concurred that they were not eligible on the nrhp um the archaeological resources identified in this district are all were all classified as prehistoric archaeological resources representing the ancestors of modern so that's so essentially they were all considered tribal resources so the result of coordination between the applicant chippo the klamath and burns paiute tribes and the department was a memorandum of agreement between chippewa and the applicant which was codified in this archaeological testing and excavation method methodologies plan which is attached as s1 to the proposed order um this plan defines archaeological testing and excavation which provide avoidance minimization monitor and monitoring for impacts to archaeological sites and mitigation measures to catalog archaeological and artifacts this plan was executed between the applicant and shippo um and reflects agreements that the applicant came to with the affected tribes um on that note we also and as footnoted to discuss further in the proposed order is that um the klamath tribes you know provided comment essentially that they um came to an agreement with the applicant um which is reflected in the avoidance areas monitoring and mitigation and that the standard in their opinion would be met the council standard um the applicant also proposes avoidance minimization mitigation and monitoring proposed uh that is outlined in a cultural mitigation and monitoring plan or cmmp this is included as attachment s3 to the proposed order the cmmp includes applicant represented measures again to avoid uh avoid impacts as um i pointed out in that if council has it in their mind's eye um of those avoidance areas of those dune areas that were um common for pygmy rabbits or where pygmy rabbit colonies were found these are also common areas where tribal ancestral resources um are were found or may be prevalent or so the cmmp uh has measures that avoid these resources and that also reduce uh to these prehistoric archaeological resources such as revising the facility layout to avoid impacts to sensitive areas as i as i noted um this also includes the inadvertent discovery plan which is um the or an idp inadvertent discovery plans are pretty typical in their structure and their content of what they lay out and provide um procedures and contacts uh that relate to sensitive resources and particularly if there's human remains that are found on site to verify that construction activities prior to enduring construction are conducted consistent with this archaeological testing and excavation methodologies plan and that the avoidance measures to around sensitive areas are completed um the department historic culture and archaeological resource condition one okay i'm gonna move still on historic but i'm gonna move on to the next one because this is interesting so as we noted right um as we noted there were these archaeological sites um and objects and subsequently the entire site is being treated as an archaeological but because the applicant intends to conduct work within an area of known archaeological objects and sites this is a you know a trigger or a box that's checked that requires um that archaeological permits that are issued by shippo um that those would need to be obtained now this is a state permit um that you know applies and could be within council's jurisdiction if the applicant requests it to be such uh and so obsidian uh solar requested that these shipping archaeological permits be included and governed by the site certificate so um uh so let me find my place here so uh through the application process the department and shippo and the applicant coordinated to get these applications for the permits completed um and and that that they were conducted in accordance to shippo's procedures which went out to um you know affected parties for comments and that that information was provided back and so um these permits uh also were attached to the draft proposed order for additional commenting on any of those conditions because functionally a permit and any conditions for a permit another state permit that's under the council's jurisdiction those conditions function as a site certificate condition so these permits are also attached to the proposed order now and because these permits are under council's jurisdiction um the effective date of these permits were normally if an uh a developer were just to get them directly with shippo when schiphol issued them they would have a date which begins their expiration process or for when they apply but because this is council's the dates and signatures are blank on those permits as attached to the proposed order and the dates will be filled in based on the date of the council final decision which is consistent with that general standard of review condition one so um so after final if there's affirmative those that would kind of be the start date with the whole intent that these permits are executed uh or dated signed and begin and then are go they go over to the applicant so that the applicant is conducting any ground disturbing consistent um with the the permits um and that is what i have for the historic culture and archaeological resources standard are there comments or uh miss starting weather this is perry chopte i hi councilmember truck too um i'd like to give the council a little bit of background on the area and um of the permitting process anytime that um a cultural site is going to be impacted by a project you have to apply for a permit through the state historical preservation office the area out there has a huge history with luther cressman 75 sets of sandals that average about 9 000 years a piece um at fort rock and then um just a short jaunt from there is the paisley cave um it's one of the oldest areas for dna evidence of man on the north and south american we work to work with them on cultural resource surveys out there and the dunes it is uh a prime place to uh bury our our deceased ancestors it um back in the day it was a lake and um as the lake started to recede 10 000 years ago um the only place where there were actual dirt to put our people in were those dunes and there are areas real close to the project area where the dunes are are part of our traditional burial grounds and so we worked with project proponent to identify these areas um it is very significant we worked with the university of oregon to do a surveys out there and to evaluate it for cultural resources and so um the area is very significant to several tribes warm springs burns and us and so um we spent a little time out there and it is a very very special place so thank you for the opportunity to give you a little bit of background on it thank you for sharing that perry informative absolutely the council's recreation standard evaluates the importance of recreational opportunities and is assessed based on five",

Kent how here Jordan trit here Cindy Condon here Perry chak toot here and buyer here you have a form Madam chair thank you Mr secretary are there any agenda modifications Madam chair There Are No Agenda modifications at this time thank you I have the following announcements please mute your phones and if you are joining us by phone and receive a phone call please hang up from this call and dial back in after finishing your other call for those signed on to the webinar please do not broadcast your webcam for the public comment portion and agenda item C and the agenda item D public comment period there are three ways ways to let us know you are interested in providing comments to the council for those in person please fill out registration cards available on the table and submit to Nancy hatch for those using the WebEx you will need to use the raise your hand feature for those on the phone only you will need to press star three which will alert us that you want to speak we will go over these options again during that those agenda items if you want to receive future email notifications of Council meetings project mes stones or Ru makings to our click Dimensions program you can do so by clicking on the link in the agenda or on the council web page look for the green box on the right hand side of the page that says sign up for emails updates you are also welcome to access the online project mapping tool in any documents by visiting our website please note that the audio and video of this meeting is being recorded and may be posted to the council's website following the meeting energy facility sighting Council meetings shall be conducted in a a respectful and courteous manner where everyone is allowed to State their positions at the appropriate times consistent with Council rules and procedures willful accusatory offensive insulting threatening insolent or slamer comments which disrupt the council meeting are not acceptable pursuant to Oregon administrative rule 0080 any person who engages in unacceptable conduct which disrupts the meeting may be expelled we're going to move to our first agenda item which is the approval of the November 17th 2023 meeting minutes Madam chair yes if I may so the two options for the motion are as presented and recommended by staff and the second would be with changes um so we didn't realize it until just recently that the meeting minutes do not accurately reflect the October vote um in that vote council member Condon abstained from voting on the October meeting minutes and so the November meeting minutes didn't accurately reflect that so that would be uh my recommendation in terms of the motion is as presented and recommended U by staff with the change to reflect that council member Condon did not vote on the October minutes okay Madam chair yes hi I move that the council approve the minutes of the November 17th 2023 meeting um as presented and recommended by staff with the one change that uh councelor Condon uh abstained from the vote on the October October uh meeting minutes approval thank you Vice chair how has made a motion Cindy Conan for the records I second that motion thank you council member Condon any other comments hearing none Mr secretary please call the role Kent how yes and byon I'll abstain because I was not at the November meeting thank you and we'll make sure to reflect that in these minutes thank you Jordan trit yes per chak to yes yes Cindy Condon yes Marcy Grail yes motion carries Madam chair thank you Mr secretary our next item is the Council secretary report thank you madam chair um so Staffing and Council updates I'll start with um so Governor kotek has appointed Katie Imes of Lexington to replace council member Truitt so for those of you who are not familiar with Lexington it is approximately 37 miles directly south of bardman so miss IMS would give us uh I think very important geographic representation um we historically uh or at least for quite some time had representation in that area in that sort of uh Columbia Plateau area um the majority of our facilities have been there uh for quite some time so having Miss Imes should she get through the Senate rules committee and the full Senate vote would be an important geographic representation um that we haven't had for for some period of time um Miss Imes currently serves as a council member on the for the town of Lexington so she's a city council member and previously she was the moral County Transit manager so she lives in a good area and she um has a lot of interest in terms of these facilities the Senate rules committee will meet early February to review and recommend appointees and the full Senate should vote shortly after that um do not have the exact dates yet if Miss Imes is confirmed she would participate in the February council meeting and therefore this could be Council member TR its's final meeting to to be determined um but it could be so if that is the case I just want to take the opportunity to say that it's been a pleasure to work with you and to provide whatever assistance we we can to you in your um hard work and efforts and my sincerest gratitude on all of your hard work and and thoughtful deliberations on you know what are some very complicated projects well thank you Todd and for the record this is uh Jordan TR I I spent a wild four years uh it's been a very interesting time I don't know that I was aware this might potentially be my last meeting but um in the event that it is thank you to everyone for staff um and the support of fellow council members and the public um it's been very informative and educational and I will definitely keep close tabs on what's going on so thank you Todd so it's always a little awkward because the timing of the U replace ments so if it is we will invite you back and have a proper thank you at a future time and if if it if this is not my last meeting then I'll do this again I just this is coun or chair girl I just want to say that one thank you for sticking around when you didn't have to to make sure that we could continue conducting uh business and I definitely will uh take you up on that followup because you know we still haven't played golf yet so let's go uh next I would like to introduce uh om Carr um she is our new operations and policy analyst and replaces Wally Adams omit started on December 4th she comes to us from the private sector and most recently was an operations project manager for remotely video where she did extensive um project management and business process Improvement um so she's got a lot of experience in there which is primarily what the position is designed for so she is still very much coming up to speed on working for the state of Oregon as well as working in sort of the Nuance of of what we do um but she's making very significant progress and um will likely be on the agenda for next month to have her um her annual work uh program uh reviewed and approved by the council in terms of what the process of improvement projects um she'll be working on in the near term so um so we have an interesting Tradition at the sighting division I'm not sure we've ever told you about this but when um it's somebody's birthday during our staff meetings we kazoo them happy birthday um and that's usually really poorly done but um but it's fun nonetheless so um on Tuesday uh Dwayne was not at our um staff meeting because he normally doesn't work on Friday so he switched his days to be able to be here today for the agenda item so we did not kazoo happy birthday to Dwayne tomorrow is his birthday uh I'm not going to do it today but I just want to express since we missed it happy birthday happy birthday uh next are project updates um so the first is on the Muddy Creek energy Park um as a reminder of the project is currently proposed as a 199 megawatt solar PV and battery storage facility located immediately east of Interstate 5 and approximately 8 miles south of the city of Brownsville the project would occupy 1,588 Acres or 2.5 square miles the project is currently in the notice of intent phase uh and the applicant has not yet submitted their application to us although we do believe that will will be coming very shortly um so more importantly for the purpose of this update is there is no current open public comment period so last week um both council members Truitt and council member uh Condon received emails from members of the public and people just sort of searched you all out um and tried to find your emails um and you both received emails expressing opposition to the project um council member it and council member Conan promptly sent those emails to me um asking what you should do with them um and so essentially where we're at now because it's no there's no open public comment time frame um this creates a potential issue with the record council members are obligated to only rely upon information in the record with which to evaluate and issue a decision so information that you receive outside of those time frames um must be disclosed on the record so that's what we're doing today um you Nancy printed the two emails um that the two council members received you all have those um Chase mcfay Walker who's the Project Lead has provided those to the applicant and we put them in the record of the project um so this is one thing that's important to make sure that it's all disclosed so that any final decision by the council um is an appropriate decision and it's based only on information on the record so now this information is on the record um so my recommendation to you should you receive emails in the future is to do exactly that do not respond um you know forward them to us if somebody engages you in a you know verbal conversation or calls you on the phone um my recommendation is to politely cut that off um and you know should you receive re any kind of substantive information from them it would need to be disclosed on the record um such as we're doing today um and forwarded to the applicant to make sure that they have an opportunity to respond to any information um as well um what we've done with the two emails that we received or",

        "text": " other part to answer the question is how it fits in the climate action plan in many ways this is one of the early opportunities for everybody in but most everybody in Salem to say I'm involved in the climate action plan because I'm contributing this amount becomes an individual participation opportunity less so than what are they doing else which would be an interesting exercise to see how many people do partipate and if I could add one one note on that you know it's it's think about this both in terms of the things that you can do to just sort of Simply reduce the city's emissions on a you know metric tons basis and then also things you can do to benefit your community overall like you know this is there's a combination like does a project where you put solar panels on top of a fire station and also batteries in the basement um reduce emissions absolutely it also provides really significant resiliency benefits uh for your community in the event of a major outage whether it's caused by um a big earthquake or an ice storm or whatever else um you know we PGE provides really significant uptime um but it's not perfect and it can't be just because of the climate and other um environmental risks that we all face um so that's a spot where you know maybe you can go to your community and say this is going to increase your bill by two bucks a month or whatever the number is going to be it will help us you know get closer to our climate goals and also provide the significant benefit to our community overall regardless of the climate benefits I think that's a really great that's a really great Point Riley and um and mayor you're well aware that City of Salem has the First Community micro grid um and that's an excellent example of a partnership as well as serving the has a larger role in serving the community because it does serve your Public Works which is your emergency Operation Center in case of a significant event so it has multiple benefits um and in that in in that micro GD it also is serving um a small number of customers um but but I appreciate that Riley brought up that that we can certainly have conversations about what makes sense for your community in terms of a pro small scale project great thank you Wendy for that context I think like something that just came to mind we could do another micro grid maybe at our airport in ass with a solar a solar farm out there and then because we know that in the event of the Cascadia our airport could become really a critical asset that we need to keep up and running yep exactly that's exactly right so then it's it has a resiliency aspect it has an economic aspect so it's like multiple benefits to the entire Community great I guess my my last question if I could is one of the challenges as we kind of wrestle with this is the difference between net metering and selling power back PGE for facility so so for example you know at the airport we could put in some solar it be net metered and that would reduce the the airport's overall cost for their electricity but we're not then contributing to the overall grid that's really just a reduction to sale and it's not a CommunityWide benefit whereas a larger facility then would sell directly to PG it would be a net metering operation that's right and there are you know um uh there are statutory limits on how big a n metering facility can be that significantly reduce the actually there might be regulatory requirements I have to check um but either way there are limitations on how big in that Ming facility can be and sort of you know how that can serve to offset any particular um facilities um usage um and I think that could potentially be part of the solution um but it by itself can't be um you know full disclosure some of you may have seen in some media coverage that we have been talking about changes to our net metering program um that sort of that work is also in my shop it sort of paused for the moment I just want to flag that because that just came up and I don't want to not mention it as a current net metor metering customer with solar panels on my roof I definitely am paying attention to that well good well mayor I can guarant guantee you that whatever we do will not change the deal you have right now we are not looking at Mak making retrospective changes at all great good to know thank you I want to make sure everybody has a chance to get all of their questions answered whether it's committee members or staff so if anybody has questions please Now's the Time because I think this is a really important kind of foundational conversation on whether we're even going to go down this road you know that's uh that's why we asked PG to be here just kind of get our make sure our understanding level of this program is is uh established so we can even talk about whether or not we want to have this conversation uh because that's you know certainly something you know we've been talking a few of us have been talking with Wendy about but it's it's you know it's fairly complex and so now is a great time to get those questions answered if you haven't so I want to check in online with councelor Phillips or councelor Gonzalez make sure that you're having an opportunity to have questions thank you mayor and definitely a lot to take in great information but no questions yeah thank you counselor councelor Phillips are you good um I mean I probably have questions I I I just may not be able to phrase them right now um I mean I guess like what I'm looking for is like a sense of scale in comparison to the goals that we as the City of Salem have has set as our um aspirational you know Targets in terms of um you know reducing the carbon emissions that we're doing um and what is needed to actually move the needle um so you know like getting a sense of perspective and then broadly speaking my question would be like what are the deadlines I mean I I think what hearing I'll paraphrase what I think I'm hearing is that this is an opportunity to partner um uh with our our local stakeholder in providing energy uh to go above and beyond what PG is already going to do they've got their own targets that are um set by the state of Oregon um but we can now go above and beyond so just like a sense of scale uh and then a sense of like are there deadlines like when do when do we need to make this decision yeah thank you councelor for that I would just add on to that kind of compound that question a little bit because I'm curious about this kind of conversation about uh scalability or compounding like if we start small what does that look like to build you know if we enter into like maybe just a very small discreet program to begin with what does that look like if it you know this proves to be popular or whatever how how do we scale that up so I'm I'm curious we can hear from PGE about what the councelor asking maybe also my question on top U those are really great questions I'll go with counselor Phil's questions first and then I'll go to your question mayor um so to answer your question very directly councelor Phillips there is no deadline um you know we're building a program that can be opted into by a community more or less at any time we will probably have some timing suggestions um relative to when you would want to start something to sort of match what other resource procurements we might be doing um but you know it's not to say that you have to do this by 2028 or something like that um and then to your question of scale um remind me what Salem's um what what Salem's number is and and when uh 50% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 and okay carbon neutral by 2050 okay that's helpful um so you know we can take that and we can say okay well you know what's what's needed on a megawatt hour basis to do that um and I don't know off the top of my head but it would be relatively is well it wouldn't be straightforward to figure it out but we could get to a um and then we would simply say okay well you know what's PGE going to be doing already you know what percentage of your city's electricity in 2035 will be carbon free um or will be renewable and then what's the incremental amount we would need to do on top of that um that's something that we'd have to go take back and do some math um but that's how we would figure it out thank you I guess I thought of a question that might not be related but like I guess is there an opportunity for us locally to incentivize like private residences to move towards solar in this or is that kind of a separate route from this no it absolutely is and and that's something we've been discussing um with in terms of our our net metering program program um and changes we're talking about making to it we do see a program like this as an opportunity for um communities that aren't Portland that don't have the Portland clean energy fund um to create a pot of money that could be used for a similar purpose um so so yes like could some of this money go to reduce the cost of like a solar Plus Storage for um um for residential customers in the City of Salem absolutely you know that's the kind of thing where we need we can have discussions about that in the participation agreement stage but this program is designed to create options around that kind of thing thank you that's that was a great question counselor that help me understand that a little bit better as well so I appreciate that I anybody have questions any members of the public have questions that we don't normally do that but things like we have people from uh home builders and chamber and folks who might have questions so I U I think one of the areas with the most known unknowns and unknown unknowns is the whole category of risk allocation people identifying the risk allocation the balance between what PGE takes as a risk and what the city takes as a risk you said one of the ways to address that is to start small uh several times you talked about I think you said a 20year agreement is that just your thought that you know locking the two agencies into a 20-y year agreement or a seveny year agreement or a 10 year agreement",

        "text": " you go through your inverter did they the uh disadvantages of says maybe a low density and you've got a very strong powerful magnetic field uh you can't have any steel around it uh if you have for example the foundations of the site i saw the kind of the concrete foundations have a fiberglass rebar if you put steel rebar in there or the the magnetic field is so strong it'll pull the rebar out of the concrete but it's cryogenic it's a very a low temperature uh technology you have to uh i think that conducts super conducting con materials has improved since the 1980s so you might be a lower uh temperature a higher temperature superconductor material might work out but i would definitely do a a cost benefit study on that definitely find out whether you have the technology to uh transmission uh power through a submarine cable uh if you can't do it or it's not very cost prohibitive you're gonna have to look at storage and methods of storage and then maybe getting it sent to the shoreline if you do have uh technology for a submarine cable you can put some storage on land uh like either hydrogen or like a fuel cell type thing or a silver gun magnet store smees uh the other i know there's other compressed air maybe but anyway those are some ideas uh just throw them out but i think you'll need to do some cost-benefit space to see if they're even feasible thank you thanks harvey yeah no i agree and there's there's so many different ways to skin this cat which is why you didn't get too much in the weeds of the actual development of the offshore wind or the undersea cabling so that's really going to come down to the finding out what what's the most the most cost-effective method of deployment so that's that's why from our side we just look at the grid and try to simplify and treat these generators as just fixed profiles that are injected at these sites on land ask your question about or your comment about storage we the storage that we did study we co-located at the same substations so they're essentially um at the same of injection and yeah i am curious to see if the how the economics pencil out with the undersea cabling i do know that um the lcv numbers that patrick mentioned did include some at least some undersea transmission so i don't it might not be exactly to these substations but it's it that it's included in that cost there so of course you that it's not going to help if there's no undersea transmission just during winter turbines out there i know other people are looking into floating storage or hide or even hydrogen to absorb some of that power um my opinion of that and i don't know if we want to talk too much about hydrogen but um that's it's essentially just another energy product that still needs to be transported to a load center whether it's electricity or demand or if it's hydrogen demand so it still has to get over the coastal range and there still would need to be investments so it might help a little bit in in shifting when that the offshore one power is used to make it to reduce some curtailment but then in that case it's just another form of storage and there's nothing technology specific in the way that we modeled storage in our production cost modeling so it very easily could be hydrogen storage rather than battery storage um just depends on on how the economics work out thanks marty there's another um uh question in here for you well let me just uh say that there was a comment from mike about um um interacting in the future on windport's navigation studies uh breakwater segments mooring um sounds like he's involved in some east coast wind projects um adam helped answer a good question from amy about the power grid needing to support our regional interconnected system uh yeah actually i saw amy's and i wanted to just briefly uh respond to uh she mentioned how uh oh wait oh sorry adam responding to amy here i guess sorry this repulsion involves this uh topic uh the coastal power loads are relatively small that's true so there'll be times when offshoring is generating significantly more power at a given moment yeah that's true and that's why we we see such a need for expanding those coastal lines uh but we did do a relatively quick analysis on how much of the how much of the coastal load can be served by offshore wind and because a lot of a lot of the benefit here and i imagine people living in these coastal uh support afterwards much more if there is a local benefit rather than just a benefit to the rest of the western connection or even to another state like california like oh it's great that we're we can help the duck curve but what about coastal oregon and we found that based on the timing of coastal loads and the wind speed profiles that offshore wind could serve over 84 of hourly coastal organ loads so it represents a relatively high capacity credit resource for the oregon coastal community so if there was say some outages along those tie-in lines that connect coastal oregon to the rest of the western interconnection offshore wind could could still provide a significant amount of their energy now of course it's not 100 capacity credit but we found between and this is a wide range for a couple of reasons but between 34 and 62 capacity credits that means that um about 33 to 62 percent of the total nameplate capacity of the offshore wind could be can be reliably counted upon to serve load to serve coastal oregon load so we did find a pretty significant benefit to coastal communities and potentially even some reliability and resilience benefits to coastal oregon but we can't we didn't want to say those explicitly without running a reliability model i know it's a it's a really juicy word and it reliability and it's a very important topic but i don't want to over overstate how much the production cost model can say about reliability so hey marty there's a few uh questions coming in here that are actually going to be addressed in jason's slide so i might hold some of these questions if you're able to stay on for a bit longer until after jason slides but there is one for amanda that sounds pretty specific to your findings about um commenting on how your findings might change considering the more realistic scenario under the current bone call area a process that power would be injected into just the fairview and winston substations um she said it might be speculation but it would be helpful to hear your insights yeah certainly would be some speculation if you look at these southern sites so the existing lions the existing topology actually helps it's good that we're looking at the southern areas because the fairview to the ipad corridor line is actually that has the highest capacity right now it's over it's two lines that sum over a thousand megawatts of capacity already and then you can see went into toledo are actually connected in a loop there so if we were only injecting power to winston it would have two paths to get the i5 quarter and so that's really helpful for an n minus one contingency situation and also just for more total uh transmission capacity to get to the i think it actually it probably wouldn't look all that different in terms of individual curtailment at individual sites um with the exception that we could essentially combine to liu and winston at the toledo location so in this case it would be combining central number three and then south central number four into that one call area that that exists now one thing i really can't speculate on is how the power profiles would be when we're looking at slightly different areas i know that you know they're all they're not that far apart from each other but but um local differences in weather will change the timing of the resource which will have a huge impact on its value to the grid so that's really the main and that's something that that travis was getting at right the complementarity of resources sort of the key piece here when we look at grid integration and that will change a bit if we change the the distribution of the turbines so i can't speculate on that too much but i will say that because there isn't really a coastal backbone right now and each of these substations just has a single connection point to the broader grid with the exception of toledo and winston but you can see all the other ones only have a single high voltage connection then they're actually relatively independent in how how their and what happens with their curtailment and their operations so so that's why i think it's our study is still a relatively good approximation of what what will actually happen in the call areas but of course we need to do that study to say for sure i'll just note that there's um a good question from mike about transmission that i'll um we'll go through the transmission slides after this and we'll get to see if there's any more from that question and also note that there's some um conversation in the chat about desalinization needs and hydrogen which could be further uses of um electricity from floating offshore wind okay i'm going to turn it to jason and thanks um marty for staying on the line for a bit longer if more questions come yeah of course thank you all right uh thanks marty switching gears a little bit to you know what what we've talked about a few times in relation to the pnnl study and the nrel study is the need for additional transmission analysis so don't remember the exact phrasing of the comments we heard earlier today but the need for reliability analysis and power flow modeling to really see how the system reacts and whether there is transmission service rights i don't know if that's been mentioned yet today but you need to have transmission service rights as well which is kind of an accounting method for keeping track of where the power is being sold and allocated to which has a little bit different function to it um than like the physical limitations and where electricity actually flows but they're they're kind of related um so kind of with that in mind um i'll talk a little bit about northern they're the regional transmission planning entity for for the pacific northwest region as well as the inter-mountain region they basically perform analysis that examines interactions between all the local transmission plans of the region's transmission providers which there are are many some of them are listed here um bpa pacific or pg idaho power puget sound vista some of those have a lot more transmission mileage",

        "text": " that could include equipment or working capital or help with hiring so that they might be better able to meet this coming wave activity so you know just looking for looks like financial support for the contractors directly great question I'm going to let Jen answer that because she's been following the workforce opportunities more but I do um actually no I'm just going to let John answer it um that's a that's a great question um under the inflation reduction act we do know there will be funding available to provide um contractor training we don't know exactly the full extent of that and it is um intended to go to complement the work under the residential Energy Efficiency upgrade programs the homes in here rebate programs there's a lot we don't know um one of the major things we still don't know is whether or not these funds would be available formula to to every state that expects to receive funds under homes in hura or if it's something we may have to compete for as a state in order to access those funds so that's something we'll be watching for um but I will mention in part of our attempts to coordinate across agencies um we we've started conversations and we'll likely have more with other agencies like business Oregon that may be able to have offer financing programs for particularly traded sector businesses that we may be able to to find ways to refer different types of contractors to access the existing programs that they may otherwise have not known about so we'll be looking for those kinds of opportunities too to help our help our Workforce and our business expand to meet the needs and I will just add that I was in DC last week and I talked with officials from EPA and and doe and and there is really a strong commitment to that justice 40 and a strong commitment to making sure These funds get to communities who need it the most and communities that may not have been able to access opportunities like this in the past and they seem very open to ideas so I would encourage you Tim and others to respond to requests for information and share that this is an issue that or an area that you think would be good for additional Investments and if you have specific types of activities or amounts of funding I really think they're they're looking for ways to get this money to the people who need it the most uh thanks Janine and Jen um not seeing any hands yet um people have been maybe thinking about more in the chat so we can give folks a little bit more time to think they have more questions at this point so I think with that maybe we since we're not seeing any more questions in the chat or hands raised we can move to our questions for you at the end and a few more polls and then um Odo staff are available to hang out until for for some more time if people have questions um that they think of while the polls are going on so with that I will ask Stacy to Launch one of those other polls the one that I jumped the gun on earlier okay did you find this webinar helpful now that we've gone through the whole um be honest you won't hurt our feelings uh and the next question will be when another webinar be helpful and then we'll get at what other information would be helpful so if you did not find it helpful please feel free either in um in the chat or in the portal to let us know what we could do to make it more helpful in the future all right thank you to those of you who are responding we'll give 10 seconds or so looks like people most people found it somewhat helpful that's good it's generally how I feel after the webinars that we're hearing from the federal agencies yeah someone helpful all right thank you next question is would another webinar be helpful so this would be on a particular topic or you know maybe in a month or two once we get more guides from the federal government are happy to keep doing these as long as we have new information to share looks like most people would want to do this again okay we'll give folks five more seconds all right we have one more question for you and that is what other information would you find and this one you can type your answer and send it I don't know if everybody else is seeing the results but I had to enter a test one so that I could see them right more specific details on some of these programs how to form Partnerships with Odo for resource sharing rollout that's a great great idea or we'll leave this one open for a while if people want to think about it contact people in other state agencies great yep Paul feel free to get in touch through our portal if you have a specific question about a specific agency and we can get you to the right people structured implementation and workflow and a timeline for kickoff yes that would be fantastic a lot of that is still unknown yeah great point on the narrowing down to specific opportunities hearing that thank you Innovative approaches think that would be a great place to hear ideas from you all I see that Tim Miller snuck a question into the poll response do we see odo's previous loan programs being reopened to serve some of the opportunities in these programs Tim not at this point would need legislative Authority and borrowing Authority for the small-scale energy Loan program which is um hasn't made any loans since 2015 we don't have the expertise and Staffing here at the agency anymore but there are programs like a revolving Loan Fund that we are thinking about and talking to our sister agencies about because it would be great to be able to bring some of that funding to the state integrating Oregon's climate change goals and greenhouse gas reduction with funding projects yes absolutely I think that's guidance coming from the federal government is this funding has to work towards greenhouse gas reductions so that'll definitely be a part of it part of our work I don't know if it's too much multitasking but we can maybe leave this poll open for a minute and go back and see if anybody had any additional questions that they thought of you want to put in the chat or raise your hand questions in the chat or raised hands great well we'll leave this webinar open and the poll up for another few minutes but um I'll just close by saying thank you for attending thank you for your interest in these programs and in the work that the Oregon Department of energy is doing and for your partnership on these opportunities we are really excited about this it's a bit overwhelming with the amount of funding Federal funding coming our way but it's a huge opportunity for the state to make significant progress on our clean energy and climate change so Jen or Ruchi any final words of wisdom from either of you oh just thanks for coming to join us thank you all right well again we'll be on here for a couple more minutes but um we're done with our program so if you need to jump off we understand thanks again for being here looks like there might be a hand raised for 10. and Tim it looks like you're unmuted I wondered I thought I'd wait till most people go since I've been asking a lot of questions but since you're staying on so nicely um Jen I wonder if you could touch a little further on the slide you covered on the cprg and the greenhouse gas production fund you mentioned some stuff there pretty quickly and I didn't quite catch it sure um I can I can try too there was a webinar attended earlier today and under the climate pollution reduction fund let's see if I can find that slide again here um which is the five billion dollar one that's referenced here and um essentially it sounds like they are planning to launch this in two different phases um the first one will be a non-competitive planning phase that they're tending to release roughly 250 million for for planning activities and then the remaining balance of that will be available for implementation grants to a much um wider base of eligible applicants and on a competitive basis and they reference that being open as as soon as summer of 2023 and so we may have planning activities going alongside implementation activities under the climate pollution reduction fund at at the same time time potentially and there will be one state well most likely we will have a state agency that will be designated um out of the governor's office to the be the applicant for the planning portion of of those funds um there may be some options for um new municipalities or tribes to also receive planning dollars as well but it it sounds like they are intending at least for each state to receive receive the funds if the state chooses to to seek it I'm not sure if there's something specific you're looking for uh that I might be able to to add on to that um I was really um also looking at the second part there just if there's any new thinking that you know of about you know helping private Partners I'm obviously tracking some of those conversations and just wanted to on the on the greenhouse gas production Fund in Green Bank that you mentioned here sure um so there was also a webinar on on that one today as well um and one of the things that I I think was kind of a highlight that um came across for for us from those webinars was that there's um a seven billion that will be available to one group of entities which includes States and then that there's really a strong emphasis on solar related programs um in that seven billion dollars and then there is the remaining 20 billion dollars available to um you know different types of entities that it appears states are not at least directly eligible for and um it it seems as though the the option for the seven billion dollars is likely to move faster potentially or at least get the guidance out sooner than the remaining 20 billion it seemed like there were still quite a few more questions around that larger portion um one of the things they did mention uh was that it could be available to financing institutions of all all sizes and colors I believe uh I hope is the correct wording that they used um so that does kind of uh give us an idea that it sounds like EPA is is planning for some flexibility and and how they think about the financing portion under that 20 billion dollars um for the greenhouse gas fund thank you so much appreciate it thanks for the questions Tim I think it makes for a more engaging webinar so thanks for asking them things in the chat and it looks like the participant list is kind of dropping off all right well then I think we can close the webinar and again really appreciate people's time and thanks to the O",

        "text": " have to demonstrate there's a need so there's requirements for that they'll have to meet that we also just our Council just adopted a wildfire mitigation rule so they'll have to evaluate risk in the area of the line and have a wildfire mitigation plan for our puc regulated facility it will likely be a puc reviewed and approved plan but we have requirements that you can kind of track and follow to understand how that risk will be evaluated and mitigated long term but if you have any questions because it's a good way to track and follow and press and make sure that those requirements are evaluated as best they can and so if you have any questions about those citations you can email Kate and show get you those okay so I have another commenter Les sorry I can't remember Greek okay let's create 2450 North Foothill Road um first of all thank you for being here Odie thank you for being here it's a very informative you know I'm going to start by saying I I don't think there's anybody in this room who doesn't value and appreciate the strong utility infrastructure that we have and I understand the need for redundancy I get that but the point I think I want to make to and to Ode is I guess I don't understand why this is needs to happen you know pbnl already has 230 kilowatt lines that exit Lone Pine substation Head East up the hill and then parallel Foothill Road a good 600 yards up behind residences away from people we talked a lot about um the impact lessening the impact and can you help me understand why there wasn't a proposal to piggyback or parallel those lines and not intrude on our communities our families on impact our property values it seems like that would be a real feasible alternative to doing what you would propose to do to us today well the first thing you have to be clear on is what we have to do is get from loan so you're already limited by your endpoints you have to get from one to the other now you're limited in paths to get between so um our our routes do try to follow lines as much as possible that's why we're going uh and I don't remember the names of the roads to the north but near Kirkland Road where we're going to be double circuiting along next to the 115 so we do try to account for following existing easements to impact people as least as possible it's also why we're following roads to the best that we can because roads are already an impact one of the things that wek requires of us is that if you have a circuit that serves a purpose and you're going to Bill a build a second circuit that seems serves the same purpose you can't have them in close proximity or to each other or on the same structures as each other for a long period of time so it would be no different than if I had two plugs for a lamb and I plugged them both into one socket and they both ran to the same light and then I put them right next to each other on the ground if I run them both over and cut them they're both gone They don't serve the Redundant purpose so they have to be separated in order to serve that redundant purpose can you can you grow that what is separation say that again what is separation what constitutes separation what does that mean how far apart do they have to be in most Administration about really wide open area uh it seems to be readily available for a second set of lines yeah in most cases it's what they they look at the ruling span uh distance and in this case it would be about 600 yards 600 meters even if I paralleled now I'm 600 feet away from an existing line and not bumped up and next to it like I can lines that are not the same circuit I have now increased the impact because now I have property that's stuck between two power lines for 600b or 600 meters I don't know if that made sense but all of that is taken into account in order to try to find a route that again it's going to be the least impactful that we can get in so I understand what you're saying and this goes back to what I tried to say earlier I don't know that I'm going to give you an answer that's going to satisfy you but we do look at all of what you're bringing up to try to find around that would follow I mean existing lines existing roads all the way between two even if we do that we're still going to find people who are impacted and who are going to be angry and say why didn't you put this line around that hill where I wouldn't see it or it's not next to 17 other lines okay okay thank you okay so I I did want to at least try one more time Brian Millard Ryan Millard in the room okay he's not in the room all right so that's it for my comment cards before we turn it over to the webinar and the people on the phone is there anybody else in the room that wants to ask a question or make a there's no one on the phone no one with the hand raised but let's go ahead and read that do you want to read it okay so for people who are on the webinar and the bottom of the main window is a set of icons click on the tab that says participants and then click on the handout icon on the bottom right of the participant and that will raise your hand and then Nancy can see you on the computer and she will call on you and then if you want to lower your hand you click it again to lower your hand so for people on the webinar if you're interested in asking a question and making a comment um please follow those instructions to raise your hand we're going to give you a minute just to see and then for people who are on the phone if you press star three on your phone it will also Ping On Nancy's computer and she'll see you I actually have an buyer and has a question okay and buyer is on the webinar so yeah we can hear you okay this is Ann Byer I am a fairly new member of the energy facility signing Council I wanted to take time to thank the department of energy staff for their presentation as well as Pacific core and thanks to all the people who are sitting in on this presentation I just want to encourage you to stick with the process I I understand that it's long but there are many opportunities for public comment and I know that I and the other council members really take your concerns and your comments into consideration I think a really good example of that is on the new Wildfire standard where the council did just adopt a new standard to address concerns that we had heard about from the public so thank you all for your participation stick with this because you have valid points that you're raising thank you Nancy you can you can re-mute me thank you Anne thank you council member buyer is there anybody else Nancy that has their hand up no I do not have any others do we have any Star threes on the no ma'am okay that's fine what you had said regarding studies show the properties are not really affected so many feet out or are you willing to put that in writing I'm not sure what are you talking about EMF or monetary yeah yeah it's the EMF that that's that is scientific data I mean they have you can measure it you can measure the field so then why do property values fund it interception yeah perception well yeah perception but if you could where can we give them information I mean by Realtors and stuff if we want to give them information if you're going to sell a piece of property they ought to be at um work knowledgeable have some something that can show a perspective buyer so the only real the only study that I have ever personally read which was done by the real estate community it indicated there was no cost impact on houses because of the existing utilities I will have to go try and find it again it's been a very long time but what what it did conclude is that what you might find is that a home near a line might take longer to sell than a home not near a line or a home near a substation might take longer to sell than a home not near a substation time can be valued as money but as far as what this particular real estate study indicated is if a home is worth a hundred thousand dollars here it's worth a hundred thousand dollars there it just might take longer to get it that's the only one I've ever personally read and it's been it's been a while since I've read it I'll have to go back go back search but if you put a comment in or leave your name I will try to find it for you I spoke to an Maia appraiser and he said the opposite of what he just said which is what I said earlier though too you get on the internet you're going to find Six studies that say it's this six that say it's the other well I didn't go in there I spoke to a Mai real term but the opposite ways again though it's you're going to find opinions that vary across the world We Believe some of these questions are just they're I can't give you an answer that is going to satisfy you I'm telling you what I believe I'm telling you what the company believes uh who you want to accept as what the real impact is going to be that's going to be up to you I would fact if if we come to you for an easement I would be unafraid to factor that in to a request for compensation the goal the goal through that compensation is also and again I say it this way intentionally at the end you will feel less angry at us if we compensate you appropriately but if I put a line near your property I've never had anyone say thank you all right um any other okay I see one more um you mentioned that there's a small section of residence on hillbrow that already have transmission lines then stacked on top for single pole those go away at all if not the transmission lines but the high power lines go away Bill Gates drought yeah no no this doesn't replace alignment this is needed in addition so if there if there's a section of transmission line that is like the one that goes near Kirkland Road near the north we would double circuit it you would see a single set of poles with two sets of three wires or six wires",

        "text": " had this conversation a little bit during the work session and we were hoping to have a little more ground under our feet upon fully intended in this instance on what that land Supply land Readiness looks like that conversation is still um waiting for a final report out from the site writing or the land supply subcommittee of the task force so that report hasn't been completely finalized yet but kind of looking at what is that large law Aid is a huge part of that but also making sure that we have site Readiness that's available for those smaller and medium-sized vendors within the the latter of semiconductor Advanced manufacturing and support services so it's not just making sure that we have one big large lot and that's going to take care of the question but making sure that we have the resources from the state to make those lands available for quicker development not just for one really large lot but for lots of a variety of sizes from 50 acres to 100 acres to the larger properties that become the center of the land use conversation what still is not clear is whether or not there will be a super citing provision they're really looking to see if they can find Solutions inside the urban growth boundary that would not require that type of super sighting but that question has not been fully answered yet in in finalizing what it's really going to take to have um a favorable application go into the U.S Department of Commerce and in talking with the staff in um representative bonamici's office they're also tracking this very closely this is something that's incredibly important not just to Senators Wyden and Merkley but also to Congressman bonamichi's office is there's a lot of Investments That become available for Oregon if we become a hub and create opportunities for good living wage jobs for um with an opportunity for more folks to get into those median income jobs that are above a living wage and above minimum wage so in finding out from them what the Department of Commerce is really focusing in on for Oregon is the final stage and making sure that we have right sized this initial 30-day package and when we have more details that's when I'll come back to the board and make sure that it's meeting your needs so that we can figure out if our logo is going on the supporting materials or not so at this point in time I'm happy to answer any questions related to those first 30 days the Sip application I believe is due towards the end of February that's why it's being rushed through at the beginning of session which complicates the you know like it's it's never really a time when we see a lot of work in the Ways and Means Committee it's never a time when we see tax credits um really considered but it is of utmost importance to have Oregon show its work that we are willing to work and we are ready for that chips application from the state to be supported so that we can support the businesses to bring down those resources to help us create better communities with better opportunities across the board um with that I'm happy to answer questions and I'm sorry I don't have more on-site readiness it's okay Commissioners are there any questions or comments on the semiconductor conversation slide go ahead commissioner fly thank you chair Harrington um Aaron thank you for that overview I was just reforming you said something about the incentives piece in the first 30 days and I was reflecting back on my notes what I wrote down back when we had that presentation um and one of the incentives that was being recommended was extend Enterprise Zone that's not part of the first 30 days it is I just short-handed that to sip and gain share because that's what we as a county have focused on but yes that would also include um extending the sunset on Enterprise and Rural long-term Enterprise zones which are um how other areas of the state have created more opportunity their shorter property tax exemption areas the county itself has not um to my knowledge opened up an Enterprise Zone um in County unincorporated areas that some of our cities within Washington County have in addition there's a number of other cities and counties that have looked at the rural long-term Enterprise tax abatement program to incentivize their their areas where they provide those Advanced manufacturing other support services that support um this part of the industry but yes it is part of that initial 30-day effort okay yeah thank you for the explanation because in the in the previous presentation the two were recommending subred like extend game share and combining the two so we're our board will see a conversation that's combines to two extending gain share and extending the Enterprise Zone okay yeah my expectation is there will be one or two bills depending upon relating to Clauses and the the laws that LC requires us to follow as far as how many topics you can have in one one bill um game share has a separate uh Sunset it is only tied to the Strategic investment program tax abatement or sip tax abatement Enterprise zones don't come with a gain share type program okay yeah I just was referring thank you that clarifies for me thank you the form will be is controlled by the legislature yeah other comments or questions I don't really have any comments that I didn't make the last time I'm all supportive of uh having us take a look with caveat the state has to be an active partner I mean this is not fair to local government not to be and my other one is this goes back my memory and then sometimes we've dealt with my things I've kind of Forgotten but we looked Once Upon a Time many years ago in Enterprise zones or zones and I thought legislative folks internally I should realize legal folks internally yeah I told us it's not not permissible for a county to have an Enterprise Zone dude just for cities but maybe that's all changed by now so if that's the case they'd have to enable through some legislation as to have an Enterprise to do these things is that is that still would that I thought that's what Aaron was saying maybe I decidedly they have to allow us to do that yes okay counties could not have Enterprise zones okay well that sounds still true all right yeah go ahead unincorporated areas yeah the one question that I don't know the answer to and we'll look up and make sure that I get all this detail right and confer with Tom and his colleagues in the general counsel's office to make sure I don't act as a lawyer in any way shape or form is the the rural Enterprise zones might be slightly different and that might be where Counties have invested um I need to double check that though so please don't take my word on that um and as to your appointments um about being an active partner we are trying to right size uh um investment package that the legislature will bring in the hundreds of millions of dollars um to Bear Insight Readiness so that they are paying oh and and how we run that program I think is the other key piece of are we going to continue to use the regionally significant industrial sites program or make modifications to um so that the state is really putting the money forward because that I think is key to the industry is that they need those upfront infrastructure costs um cared for and one of the key messages that I've taken away from from this board is not just the on-site it is the off-site it's all the things that make the capacity possible including the livable communities around it making sure that it's not just one property that wins it's that our community wins when the state invests just have one follow-up go ahead uh Aaron what you just said remind me of to ask this question and um is I I know you said there's 1900 bills I'm I'm not gonna quiz you but I am wondering if there is if you're hearing any talks around if there is a bill to undo what I don't remember the bill number but in my notes somewhere you should add that support yes um she mentioned the site Readiness this is my question is related to sight Readiness to just be clear and something that you said Aaron that reminded me that's the question uh there was a bill I think um in 2014 40 78 in 2014 that does the rural designation rural Reserve versus Urban Reserve designations is are you hearing um rumbling conversations about to undo that bill did to undo the did it pass in 2014 it um that's the bill that set the urban and rural reserves in Washington County um the litigation of also referred to as the grand bargain um which is uh coming into question right now there are individual bills related I think that are looking at specific areas where that might happen but that's also where the super sighting piece of what might come out of the land um area finding a large lot may look at um areas that have been designated as rural reserves as potential sites for super sighting and that would again he could chunk out of that agreement that was reached in house bill 4078 in so rural reserves are um a constant piece of conversation there are some specific legislative Concepts that I I have not identified quite yet but I am certain are in my um that would look at some of those designations I think that this um the other component to this package that might disrupt that bill is related to the super citing and providing that someone likely the governor with the authority to supersite even if it is um a rural Reserve if that is the only means of finding identifiable industrial lands that can be made development ready thank you in case you didn't hear earlier as part of board communication uh commissioner FYE had the opportunity to meet with Mr Tom Vander zanden and uh hear a little bit of history from his thank you I I was unfortunately in a Committee hearing already at 8 A.M this morning so thank you so um uh I forgot my question already oh yes so on the semiconductor conversation uh you talked about not having seen an updated report yet do you know if there are draft versions circulating um my understanding is that there's a memo and it's probably I will I can share that that the initial take but they had to do more research and they were planning to meet again I believe it's this week and so it should be forthcoming what their final recommendations are but I will I will confer with um active and Lut to make sure that we have all of the information to you and I will provide it with um the Friday memo that um comes out if I can locate it",

        "text": " that we have right now and then we'll see if there's any other information or questions that people have but I have a Brian Millard it's Brian in the room taking that okay how about a Brian with a c right and C so I'm just wondering how does this benefit mean so if you don't mind can you come up so we can get you on the so if you can state your name the life is on if you do want to comment or ask a thank you so you want my name sure uh Brian um so I'm just wondering how this benefits me the Atlanta um I know you said that it will something goes out a little safety net but what do I bet what do I get out of you guys are putting lines over my property big towers next to my coffee how does this help me so when you're asking for specific benefits that ensuring that the grid won't get interrupted and power flow won't get interrupted that is the benefit that is going to be seen by the landowners um beyond that there isn't a dramatic a benefit to a landowner to have lines over their properties um so it's just the continued flow of power so uh have you guys done research on how this affects property value we haven't as a company done specific research but we get this question quite a bit and the only answer and it's not satisfactory that I can give is if you look on the internet uh there have been studies that have supposedly been done and what they indicate and what you'll find is some of the studies will say it has no impact some will have say that it has some slight impact on costs and other studies will say that all it impacts is a time or fail but as a company we haven't done any studies ourselves well you you study the word is that not a concern are you good we don't we won't we don't plan to do any studies to determine a true impact on property value for the existence of lines what about health or you're referring to EMF electromagnetic forces those have been studied and again the we get this question on most of these public comment periods or through the public comment periods and it may not be a satisfactory answer but we construct our lines in a manner to reduce the EMF down to a signal that's below any of that of any association with any human health concerns so we feel that based on the studies that are out there based on scientific data our EMF drops off dramatically with distance and so even with a linear source of EMF if your transmission line is signal drops off the square in the business so what what that's saying to you is the power of that EMS signal drops off dramatically and we have done our own tests through Consultants to find that you will have EMF signals in your home uh heating blankets are some of the highest they provide a much greater EMF signature than you deal with during the winter than you'll ever see Federal from a transvest in regards to nice uh let alone humans who's not just a mistake that we have animals we have cattle feed goats chickens there's no yeah no effects to any life I mean an animal no no no no effects said no dangerous effects that's the way based on everything that we've known and all the data that we've seen there is no effect on that EMS has that's a group of yes all of that has to be considered um and the maintenance of our right away has to be such that that fire dangers reduced down to the level that it is some of you may be seeing where now we're telling people that we have uh power being turned off in remote areas where when the winds and the temperatures get to a certain time during the summer fire danger we're doing preemptive line uh de-energizations so all that has to be considered as part of Mobile broadnecks you can keep going uh I can tell you that I know I truly understand it's not a joyful part of my job to go to a property you want to tell them I have to build mines over their house or you know we're never going to build over your own um so the only thing I can tell you is that some of my answers are not going to be satisfactory to you no matter what I say I'm aware of that I'm not going to try to assemble or try to trick you you're going to be straight up because I'm I'm gonna get caught if I tried to lie so ask anything you just you may not be satisfied with the answer but don't be afraid to ask it it's important to you so it's important yeah I have three sons um so if you were to have a property with lines going over your wallpaper where your kids will play it would you let your kids play out there yes I I have I have house uh with lime serum both transmission and distribution and I have no problem with them playing near a substation I mean I work in them all the I don't feel the least bit threatened by him I have no health effects I can tell you that there are no studies out there that indicate Electrical Workers have a higher incidence of any other type of Health effect that non-electrical non-electrical workers have and they're around power lines and Transformers and substations every day all the time during their own these uh are they just gonna come under our property and do surveys or are they going to contact us ahead of time how do you go ahead and throw them out we're you're notifying some of you may have already been being notified about some surveys that have been going on so yeah we're not just gonna just show up one day and without your permission start walking on your property or sending out mailers they're making phone calls ahead of surveys and uh they should be knocking on doors if uh if it's a residential Community or property where there's homes or somebody that's clearly living there we should be knocking on the door or leaving a hanger letting you know what's happened and what we're doing and why so no one should ever just be showing up on your property and the reality is if they show up and you don't want them on your property you tell them not to go and they should not force them force their way onto your property so the surveys are all done with your permission and if you don't give permission then the surveys won't happen on your problem um is there any compensation to put in there isn't compensation for the surveys but when the process gets to the point where we're requesting easements from you if the line's going nearer on your property there's compensation for them a conversation enough between a fix the the value of my house or the things it's like a pocket change so the right-of-way process is uh it's a give and take or go back and forth however you want to say it the way that makes it it's a the way it works from the we have a fiduciary responsibility to our rig pairs so we're not like a solar farm that's the big thing everybody tells us is solar farm just came and offered me nine times the value because they want to put a solar field on my front I can't do that I can't just offer you that kind of money because I'm obligated to ensure that I'm keeping costs as low as possible for the rates for the other rate payers that being said if I am not taking your property we value the area that we are running the line over so let's just say breeze it's an acre and we're just running a line on your property that's an acre in length and the value of your property is a hundred dollars an acre we're going to offer you eighty dollars we're gonna probably we're going to come at 75 or 80 percent of the value because it's not taking it from you and you're still allowed to use that land to do quite a bit of what you planned on doing generally speaking you just can't build structures underneath the line when we make that offer our biggest goal my biggest goal with our right-of-way agents is to be out with handing you that offer in person because I get it like I said um I've been on the other side of this so I do understand how it feels and that when I come to you and I say hey I want to throw a line over your property and I'm going to give you eighty dollars ninety percent of you are going to be insulted and throw in the garbage because it's not what it's worth because I got to deal with this line for the rest of my life I got my kids that have to run around under it like you're worried about I've got animals that I'm grazing underneath it which I'm gonna read about but the reason that I want to present it to you in person is because what I want to get across is I am offering you this value to start you can come back to us with what value you feel it's worth the good news is on your side you don't really have to go over the top trying to justify the value you can put in you can come back with a reasonable request for more money and it's considered it was I think the east it's the one away from the center of the thank you well done thank you thank you for your comments and your questions a couple of things she might have done yeah no I just um because we're trying to Overlay our process in the regulatory requirements I just wanted to offer to you sir um so one of our requirements is a need standard so for all transmission lines have to demonstrate there's a need so there's requirements for that they'll have to meet that we also just our Council just adopted a wildfire mitigation rule so they'll have to evaluate risk in the area of the line and have a wildfire mitigation plan for our puc regulated facility it will likely be a puc reviewed and approved plan but we have requirements that you can kind of track and follow to understand how that risk will be evaluated and mitigated long term but if you have any questions because it's a good way to track and follow and press and make sure that those requirements are evaluated as best they can and so if you have any questions about those citations you can email Kate and show get you those okay so I have another commenter Les sorry I can't remember Greek okay let's create 2450 North Foothill Road um first of all thank you for being here Odie thank you for being here it's a very informative you know I'm going to start by saying I I don't think there's anybody in this room who doesn't value and appreciate the strong",

        "text": " so from a informed decision argument uh yeah if the owner knows the source energy or excuse me the source emissions involved with a particular choice that that would I think that'd be very helpful from a site energy or site standpoint that would just be an electrification measure because electricity doesn't have any site emissions but it does have Source emissions and that wouldn't be a uh informed decision on the part of the owner okay yeah thanks Kevin uh Ben yeah along a similar line I do think it's helpful to the program to include that uh since you know the stated goals are are to reduce emissions but uh getting back to what we're doing with the rest of the standard and how it's based on on site energy use this one statement if we leave it in and and wipe out all the other greenhouse gas targets is kind of Island and I I don't know like taken out of context like that and you know unless we provide some kind of alternate compliance path that takes emissions into account I don't know that that's particularly useful for the owners I'm personally inclined to leave it in though is that is again the stated goal of this program even though we're not specifically targeting okay yeah thanks Ben uh Vin I'm thinking about um Washington State and then Seattle's new carbon performance standards I think they call them building emissions performance um so since the city of Seattle is looking at decarbonization and the state is looking at energy reduction um and as I understand because State preemption we have some similar issues here in um places like Portland and the overall state of um not being able to where local jurisdictions can't simply um they don't have the home rule authority to um have their own Energy Efficiency standards so carbon is the pathway uh so I think thinking as cities like Portland and others move forward on to meet their climate goals I think it'd be helpful for owners to have the decarbonization assessments um now for with the state they have a sense of you know if this is going to happen at the local level as it as Seattle's kind of has done with Washington um I think if those decarbonization assessments have done in Washington ensure that it's it's helpful to all the folks in Seattle similarly all the folks in Portland right now whove reported commercial building since 2015 have a leg up on on um getting ready for the the state's building performance standards so I I'm inclined to say it's beneficial to have it in um I don't see there's a future where we aren't thinking about carbon generally and so this I do think it's different than a ghgi Target where it's just here's the you know here here's how you could decarbonize too I also wanted to speak to site versus source eui so uh we use site eui uh reported to portfolio manager at the city of Portland and uh that does include electricity um so there's a a greenhouse gas emission factor that is included in the side eui it's based on kilowatt hours consumed um so there there definitely the side eui does include that uh there's a multiple reasons why we don't use Source eui um and so we're really getting into the building level of intervention not necessarily at the generation level intervention that's one main reason but also I I think there's inconsistency consistency on source eui so there's L loss of energy um in transmission lines that are included with source eui and um you know if we include that something that we we don't see on source cui is the the loss of methane along natural gas lines and um and methan being a something like 10,000 times more potent greenhouse gas I think is um we're it's I don't feel like we're doing it an Apples to Apples comparison if we look at source UI yeah thanks thanks Finn um okay well yeah I appreciate the comments on that on the decarbonization assessment piece we'll definitely take those into you know into account as we as we move forward it sounds like there's overall maybe some interest in kind of keeping that in even if it's not a a like a direct explicit component of meeting the organ BPS but that it um it aligns with the overall goal the stated goals of the BPS the legislation and that it could potentially help inform future um local uh BPS like what's potentially moving forward in Portland so um let's see moving yeah kind of moving down this line so if you don't meet the performance Target qualified energy auditor needs to complete an audit according to Section 8 Energy Efficiency measures that reduce energy use to meet the target shall be implemented according to section n and then upon completion the building shall be granted conditional compliance with um with those so it kind of the conditional compliance pathway is one where you can if you don't meet the target but you've identified measures and you do the measures but the measures haven't had enough time to actually be in place yet to document a full Year's worth of energy reductions there's this conditional compliance timeline um so I did want to oh Alex yeah you know I I don't know now I can't find my notes but I was curious and maybe this is somewhere else once you on a conditional compliance pass how do you get back to a compliance and whether that potentially needs some clarification how a building once that it's on unconditional compliance path can um remedy that and get back into full compliance yeah that that is kind of later on but um you know essentially the pathway there would be documenting an eui that meets the target okay and that's L that's laid out how that how that works yeah you know because you want to sure right that that conditional compliance buildings are still working towards getting into full compliance yeah cool thank you thanks so I did want to to add to kind of maybe spend some time discussing this one too um so for more recently built buildings um and this is a pathway that is in the Washington standard where Washington essentially requires that more recently built buildings meet a Target that's 15% more efficient um than the other than other buildings um you know we're still limited for the um the targets to be at the most as stringent as the average eui um but essentially Washington provides a a different separate and a little bit more stringent requirement for newer buildings um to have to meet a Target that's 15% more efficient and if they if they don't meet that 15% more efficient Target but they do meet the the standard eui Target for that building type um there's still a pathway that they can use to implement commissioning measures in order to document and show conditional compliance so I just I wanted to point point this one out um and and just kind of explore the the opportunity or the need to include a pathway like this in Oregon or if um there's also the potential just to to treat U you know all buildings the same regardless of of when they were built um you know I I think any new building that's built to the Oregon energy code within the last you know few Cycles um is going to be a you know especially now um is going to be a very efficient building already and um in just about all cases I I think would have no trouble meeting a BPS um I'm I'm sure there are going to be some cases where a new building just due to the way it's operating or the way that it's um you know its energy intensive features um perhaps doesn't meet an eui Target where that exists um and I think that's something we'll kind of have to think about how that how that building might um you know might be able to comply but um you know that so that's always the option is to kind of treat all buildings the same whether or not it's a new building or or an old building or should we have a more stringent requirement for newer buildings because they're built to a more stringent code um Kevin looks like you have a raise hand yeah thanks Blake I'm I'm just doing the conceptual math here so if if the legislation says that the target can't be more stringent than the then this section I think you'd have to have a target for everyone else that's 15% worse than the average that's that's right yeah so it would a new building would only be able to have a more stringent Target where the uh yeah where the target for that building type wasn't at the average because we still can't go beyond the average got okay that makes sense yeah so if it turned out that the Target that we set for a specific building um is not at the average which you know we we haven't we we'll be going through that Target setting uh procedure soon um it would only be available for or applicable if the targets aren't quite at the average yeah gotcha okay makes sense yeah know yeah your math is is H is tracking there Alex yeah essentially following up on that I think that means uh since since we're currently um anticipating that all buildings have to meet the average uh we would you know exclude buildings if we would require only new buildings buildings to meet that average and other and all other buildings less so I'm I'm in favor with rather you know the broader approach that all buildings have to meet the average since that's the the ceiling that's allowed in the okay yeah thanks Alex um then and just to follow up on my thought oh sorry jumping ahead there um I I thank you uh I I know we haven't defined that what these numbers are yet and and I guess I'm not sure how that's even going to happen I I I think like uh like was just suggested the average would be the standard but I suppose there could be a particular building type that for whatever reason isn't the average that that the target would be higher um I'm not sure where that would be the case but maybe there's a compelling reason for that and then then the section could come into play like you're were describing but uh yeah otherwise I I tend to agree I think the average is probably we're shooting for but I don't know that's a very complex process I know that has yet to be done so yeah cool thank you yeah thanks Kevin Vin yeah I think we'll get to part of this later when we start thinking about like buildings that don't really have an average like convention centers um but um in the meantime I'm just generally I I really like this approach I'm imagining from Washington of having commissioning which is really you know much higher level of intervention than just an energy audit and identify EMS because if a new newly constructed building and this isn't always going to be true but generally a newly constructed building isn't performing as well",

        "text": " was out for public review so just really encourage you to look at our website on that let me know if you need help yes Ryan will be a good resource for you so I mentioned the tri party agreement here um EPA ecology and due signed a legally binding trip party agreement and consent order May of 1989 Milestones were developed for rec and cir cleanup so um the Hamford sitewide permit application material was originally Incorporated through TPA m Stones not all the facilities and dangerous Waste Management units were included in the first Hamford sightway permit and so if you go on the website and you look at the current 8C permit and you review the standard permit conditions you can see the history of the development of the Hampford site white permit and the different unit groups that came in and were closed out of the permit and if you will have questions just feel free to stop me um just a little bit about the Hampford site wde permit history the first Hamford sitewide permit was issued 1994 currently we're in revision 8C we have 22 unit groups in this revision it's separated into standard permit conditions that apply to all the unit groups as well as attachments or documents in support of the standard conditions operating unit groups corrective Action Unit groups closing unit groups and post closure unit groups we had a revision nine go out for public review for the a renewal so every 10 years a permit has to be renewed um as you can see it was a little bit past 10 years that we went out with the renewal in 2012 it took quite a bit of time to get the renewal prepared um 37 unit groups uh was included in the renewal um um and we incorporated all those who were considered interim status since then and I'll just say after the renewal was um provided for public review it went out for 120-day public comment period we had multiple public hearings throughout the Pacific Northwest we received 5,000 comments on that per renewal since then we have been addressing the comments we are working through every unit group every agenda to prepare a revised renewal in 2024 and that will be um revision 9A and that will go out for public review in 2024 it will include 50 unit groups it will incorporate all the inter status units and it maintains the same organization as I mentioned in HC so I'm going to um move on to R D and D permits a little bit that ask a question yes what type of waste are we talking about you said it wasn't radioactive but it was dangerous dangerous waste and dangerous waste components it would be like the tank Farms it'd be waste from tank Farms um it'd be waste from old cleanup sites like the solid waste and operations sites um trying to think of some other examples um chemicals or not radioactive so it's chemicals that you're be it's radioactive but that's not what they regulate right what they don't regulate the radioactive part they regulate the stuff that's with the radioactive okay thank you for your question appreciate that yes uh so if it's taken 12 years for the Rev n review to come out when is R 10 I that kind of half joking but you know looking at the schedule if every 10 years has to be renewed that from the date when it is officially reviewed and approved by ecy or is it the submitt what's that time frame so um I appreciate that question um in 2024 will go out for a public review again it will be 120-day public comment period um and then we will need to address comments we will need to update documents so um let me back up a little bit we will continue to maintain HC at the same time so HC will continue to uh be maintained as the final permit that the permites are working toward we will have the revision 9A out for public review and then once it's it goes out for public review we receive the comments we update the documents then we will issue that permit once the permit becomes effective then it will be 10 years after that is that 120 days for review set in your rules no the choice by apology it's not set in the rules we wanted to provide enough time the our estimate so okay if I say the estimate Stephanie how many pages the site white is care because we're still we're still sorting through the amount of documents it should be about 20,000 Pages which is 120 days meaning that's not much time for the public to get through 20,000 Pages just the requirement actually is just 45 days oh my so a college greatly expanded on that and that's why we're uh working on a robust communication plan ran workshops and have to educate the public on what's going to go out the comment and we'll also do Regional hearings throughout the the state yeah I appreciate that St and that's where my comment kind of came from is are you mandated by rule no so you do 100 could you do more if somebody said hey this is just so much material it's so important we need more than that time if if somebody if somebody requested an extension we would um we would entertain it we would definitely look at it to see yes if we need to give it more time absolutely thank a really nerdy question but those 20,000 pages is that going to be like a 20,000 page PDF or is it going to be something machine readable which we could write code to like stand here to look fors of interest so it will be a web page that you could look at on the ecology website that will have links to each of the unit groups and each of the documents within the unit group so kind of like if you look at HC now it's divided up that way so it wouldn't be like one PDF awesome thank you I think Stephen just volunteered to uh review it will it be red lines like some permit mods are with the changes or is it just all going to look like completely new it completely we do have the redline text from um the so when we put up the Rev n renewal we did maintain the redline text um when the permites provided supplemental information and so we do have that in our administrative record but it won't be what presents to the public okay is that in a machine format it's it's not a machine readable format is that what you're asking is that a is that part is the Redlin part in the machine readable format or um I guess I'd have to know what that is I what do you mean byr PDF uh so the opposite of OCR PDF um or like an act structured document that you could then write a program to find to extract the parts that were actually changed that were actually changed without scroll through 20,000 pages to look for the red lines or open it in word and click next change next change next change yeah it won't be be like that we as far as looking at like the administrative record you could look at the red line and yes it it would be like that where you could look at the next changes you know we're also incorporating a technical fact sheet with each of the unit groups that will um you know the the intent is to explain everything that has changed since the rep n renewal all right so I'll I'll go on but if you all still have questions just don't have to hesitate to ask so um talking a little bit about research development and demonstration permits c a question online oh yeah can you define what a unit is or unit group a unit group so a unit group um it's it's the way we have the permit organized by um the particular facility site um that's being managed under Rec that's a great question it makes me go back and look at what our definition is in the standard TR conditions so was that the question online okay super super thank you so ecology May issue an RD and permit to a facility that proposes to use an Innovative or um and experimental dangerous waste technology or process and that's defined in wack 17333 809 draft Rd and permits follow 840 regular ations in which ecology leads the public comit period so the permites provide a draft permit application to ecology and we draft permit conditions and draft the permit and provide it for a 45-day public comment period and usually yet public hearing is you know involved as well the operation of an RD and facility is limited to one year so it's a short permit so we have two um Rd and permits that we're working on and you've probably heard of both of these I would imagine your discussions um the test bed initiative the test bed initiative phase two project Rd and permit the purpose is to demonstrate and evaluate the feasibility of pre-treating liquid tank waste using an intank column we receiv received the formal permit application in June of this year and the 45-day public comment period will begin early spring so currently preparing the permit for review the new con Rd and permit the purpose of the newon project Rd and permit is to evaluate the effectiveness of particular control technology and reducing Target tank Vapor constituents and air emissions from the Hampford tanks we received the permit application just recently September 28th of this year and we're responding to the permit application and the public comment period is scheduled for early 2024 so um just moving on to some of the folks that we work with on permits um within ecology we have an oversight program hazardous waste toxics Reduction Program in permitting we work with them closely um they make sure we meet our commitments with EPA and permitting um we go to them for guidance and Direction they write our permitting guidance 9542 which again you can find on the ecology website um they maintain our memorandum of understanding with EPA so we appreciate hr's involvement and our permits and um and definitely their advice that they give us I talked a little bit before about um working with EPA region 10 so I won't go through through that again but I I'll just say that we do provide um to EPA region 10 uh permit renewals permit modifications for review and um they help us with permit condition development so um we appreciate their involvement and definitely the advice and Direction they give to us we also

        "text": " responsibly about and your needs impacts for current and future Generations under what we do you'll see kind of the way that we beat the mission and there's a lot of programs and divisions here at Odo exciting we have a big report that we do every year we run programs that um on getting bandages with the from the legislature has assigned to us and for this funding opportunity that we're talking about today it will be a new energy program at Odo um that's you know federally funded and it will help the support a resilient and affordable MLP system that kind of links back to our mission next slide please um this is another sort of orienting slide in the picture and after the passage of both the iija and the inflation reduction act Oda recognized that the state would be receiving millions of dollars from the federal government and the purpose of that is to invest in clean energy Energy Efficiency resilience and other important priorities we did a number of public weapons and we discussed with our energy advisory work group early one of these law scores passed um and we developed these guiding principles on those on this slide to help us figure out how to prioritize and how to how to think about all of the funding that's coming our way so I won't read these all in detail but you know we're basically focusing on Equity including Geographic diversity coordination with tribal governments where possible providing technical assistance focusing on cross-agency Partnerships where uh you know we work with qtq and we've seen quite a bit so focusing on those Partnerships to help us with expertise um and then finally taking advantage of every high priority funding opportunity but also ensuring that we're having the quality work that fits up every available uh dollar codes best use so that might mean we don't we might not go to every single funding opportunity but we want to try to balance that these guiding principles here um and so you'll hopefully notice in our discussion today that we're applying many of you guidance both of the spending opportunity as well okay I think that's it for me I said that to Christine sure so I think we already think of the group introductions for today so we can actually keep moving forward and move on to the next slide people who wants to introduce somebody you did earlier but is there anyone else to joined that or is there anyone that we missed uh a couple additionally we've got right we travel one uh Kyle from energy quest of Oregon uh Jessica reichers from technology and technology and policy manager at Odem uh Jim Crider from the Oregon rural and member of the environmental justice Council uh Christine Go Lightly from Columbia River and Revival Fish uh Natasha Jackson from Northwest Gas Sarah Buck Walter from Pacific War and I believe those are the the recent editions so and then we also have Whitney door from the EQ just that I've mentioned okay thank you and then um next we'll just kind of pop into where all of this funding came from really quickly I know many of you are already familiar with it and have maybe attend some of our other webinars before um but it's a quick um refresher on where this funding came from and then we'll jump into the need of why we're here um the program is funded under the infrastructure investment in jobs act this piece of legislation includes 62 billion dollars for U.S department of energy to deliver a more Equitable clean energy future for the American people if I invested in American manufacturing and workers expanding access to Energy Efficiency and green energy for families communities and businesses delivering reliable clean and affordable power more Americans and building the Technologies of tomorrow with clean energy and the purpose of these funds as outlined by the news Department of energy is to improve all hazards resilience on the electrical Grail against disruptive events generate the greatest Community benefit in reducing the likelihood and consequences of destructive events Advanced Department of energies Equity environmental and energy Justice priorities including the Justice foreign so the application to the U.S Department of Veterans was already submitted on April 18th we were required to submit that request to the Department of energy by May 31st so we're a little bit ahead of scheduled there um and that was for the first two allegations of funding for the federal program I'm going to program States tribes and territories apply directly to the federal government and then once awarded police can then run processes to issue five Awards and entities eligible as sub recipients such as electric grid operators electricity storage operators electricity generators transmission owners or operators distribution provider and school suppliers um Odo is the state agency that will apply for receive and administer these funds and these are intend to focus on electrical utilities then finally um the legislation conflicts allocations over five years um and the department of energy influence issue the first and second allocations of funding at the same time accounting for the extended application deadline that they gave us the first two applications for the state are listed on the slide both a little less than 10 million dollars we're required to pass 95 of these funds through to our sub grantees and the program does have two match requirements first the state or tribes are required to provide a 15 match and then secondly sub recipients are required to provide a match as well some recipients will be required to match the rate of either 100 or one-third depending on their electricity sales in previous year and that is the background so I'll pass it back over to uh Rob to go through the process can you answered do you know if the um state math is that tied up in the state legislature um hold up with the Republican walkout so there is no State match yet is that correct it was tied in with our with our budget I believe so um so it's it's tied in with that and maybe Rich you can talk more to that with me yeah so our budget is out of the house but it's all in our budget so um you can get you the specifics of where it is but the state matches in the budget so as long as the budget passes eventually then our staff same match at someone can you discuss what the utility match can consist of whether in-kind services or other flavors of the funding um I believe that both of those are um I know that our match is going to be a good patch all right so I'm just gonna give a brief history of how we've done make sure is there any questions in the chat based on the family covered no questions yet okay thank you so yeah I'll share a little bit of the brief history for how we got married but we submitted in April we began work on this program last summer and we developed a draft program narrative that was based solely on Wildfire mitigation projects and since then we've done a lot of listening and a lot of Outreach and that's significant changes including expanding the eligible measures to any specification projects not just we've done public hearings in again in March and we had a requests for information where we got some valuable feedback or utilities and the types of projects that you think we're going to see in the program and the result is that we we make some some significant changes to the narrative and we also resolved it in a change in the way that we distribute the bus between small and large utilities and then a little closer every minute um the funding for the large and small utilities are based on a shared of customer sales at the stadium and we have a table to look at that in the next slide but the other thing we did for small utilities was that that's about project DeLorean which was originally proposed at six hundred thousand and so we took that cap away we bought a little bit more flexible anything was wrong James we also build some flexibility into the way that disadvantaged communities are described in the program just a reminder that this is what we've submitted to usdoe as an application and so we're waiting feedback for them to see how much flexibility we actually have on for these things but that's really composed to the narrative next slide please we're gonna discuss it later the disadvantaged communities how you changed the description or where is it different again sure so we have guidance from federal guidance in the form of a matter highlights areas that are clearly defined as disadvantaged communities in the state we have a slide for that later okay but we've also in our letter it said that if you're outside of that map and you want to make a case for certain communities or populations be considered a disadvantaged community would like to let communities make their own case and that's where we're waiting for some to see what the federal response is to that part so yeah so this is a budget summary showing the close to 20 million and that Emily mentioned the 95 that goes to projects we we did the math and found that 25 of customers in the state are served by small utilities Dental definitions and that's the minimum number of we would have for funding in the growth in our narrative we've proposed a carbon 40 percent for these small utilities um built from a little over five and a half million originally proposed to a little over seven and a half million sliding abilities again we removed the cap for utility Max of the Lord ultimate The Narrative can highlight our program objectives number one is to mitigate natural Hazard number two is deliver benefits to disadvantaged communities degree is maximized broad Community benefits that complement the group resilience projects and finally just to continue to learn as we operate the program and update these objectives as we go along with your cheeriors of are those weighted all the same or that's what we're going to work on today you know is the Criterion wait yeah we're going to hopefully develop my charity today if narrative we adopted the full list of eligible measures that are provided in the federal guidance side next slide this is a slightly abbreviated list from the federal guidance measure of Life utility full management vegetation management reconductorate underground a real hardening measures two-thirds of the way down you'll see there's an asterisk on the microgrids and batteries those are eligible Technologies under the program but we have another program I don't know the fund those and the feedback that we got the utilities was to focus more on the hardens and so that's going to be our focus in the first two rounds and also like pulling down for the last measure so the last bullet here new generation and cyber security are not included in this program it's a new generation includes solar wind type the generation projects that could be tied to uh are there any that stand out to you is most interesting or kind of propellant in terms of projects that you were coming",

        "text": " and so it wasn't a study of storage by any means it wasn't you know meant to say this is all that storage can do but in this particular scenario in the way that we set up storage it did reduce curtailment by about 15 even without any transmission upgrades um but we're still at levels that are pretty unreasonable for for the investment of all that uh generation so we would still need to see transmission upgrades to make those worthwhile um so that's what's meant by the furthest the next two bars um the brown and darker red are near zero um across the board so you can see in claptop there actually are zero and then in toledo it's less than about five percent so that shows that in the transmission upgrade scenarios we avoided most of the curtailment there um okay next slide should be the last one i think finding seven um right so this is showing how offshore when we inject more offshore wind we also see higher imports from oregon to california and that these happen to coincide nicely with their peak net load in the evening so i hope i'm sure people are familiar with these duck charts so um we see that after wind does help alleviate the duck curve by providing energy in the in the um early evening time and then as as we see higher injection of offshore when we see more exports along that line so this will feed it nicely to future studies that look at oregon and california offshore wind it'll be interesting to see how those fields change when we actually have maybe more offshore wind in california so expect that to change but suffice it to say that there is value for california and further fields in offshore wind on in on the oregon coast as long as we can get it along those coastal lines so i think i think that's it one more slide might have just a summary on it oh just references so that's all i have looking forward to the questions i see there's already a bunch in the chat not sure how you want to handle that yeah marty um i have been going through the chat a little bit just so that we can surface some of it in discussion as um and for those on the phone so i'll just do that quickly and give you a chance to sort of weigh in on some of these questions okay um i think you answered the contingency analysis one um already from julie but sean also had a similar question for you as before for pcm studies runs versus reliability using wac ads cases and then there is also a question about please explaining more about the change in assumptions made the transmission system itself were the ratings of the transmission lines increased uh if so could you help under help the understanding of the new ratings used as well as any reliability considerations i think you covered a little bit of that before um but if you wanted to emphasize anything there specifically and then kathy asked if um this analysis was redone using only the three bone claw areas sure um why don't i start from the bend so the three bone collar is actually this was done before those three are identified so we use five call areas so kind of distributed evenly from north to south along the coast um and each was mapped to a single substation so those were the names that i had on on that finding three slide and those call areas in turn came from a previous study from nrel that looked at just the cost of oregon how much you know and actually patrick could talk better to that but that was more of the studying the lcoe projections and then also seeing maybe what the full technical potential could be along the coast those calling errors weren't represent were meant to represent the ones that exist now but they at least the southern sides have have similar uh characteristics so the purposes of those colors were really just for us to pull resource data so we could get realistic power profiles but they weren't meant to be you know the send stone this is where the sites will be so of course a lot of the analysis does depend on timing of the wind speeds in each particular area and then the combination of how much capacity we're putting in each location um but they were they mapped relatively closely to the existing collars now they just we started this before they were set in stone so okay so the transmission system uh we increased the ratings and transmissions lines so we started out before upgrading those lines by having a pretty in-depth discussion with um bpa so it's authority in in the area to make sure that we had all of the metrics correct so we we changed our existing assumptions a little bit by increased by introducing summer versus winter ratings so summer summer thermal limits are generally lower because there's heating and line sag so there's there's less power that can be but and then also reactants and resistance but we didn't change those and those generally less impactful on the model so it really was just the thermal limits that we're interested in and not stability limits because stability we can generally kind of use a hand wavy assumption assume that well you can put whatever active power support to to support stability but really it's the thermal limits of the lines how much can how much current can flow in these lines without them literally burning up so that's um that's what we increased in order to reduce curtailment there and then similar question pcm studies reliability right so we um we didn't study reliability in in the full sense of the word no that would require a different model or a lot more runs where we where we force the lines to be out and see what happens but we uh we didn't do that in this case um and then surfacing a comment from sean that california interest in being an off taker still would likely face a bottleneck at the inter ties given that they're fully subscribed and then amanda had a clarifying question on um if this curtailment under the circumstance if the curtailment is under the circumstance that all 2.6 gigawatts goes into a single connection point oh sorry is that i'm not looking for that question uh oh is the curtain under no so there in all of the scenarios uh and if you go back to slide or the finding one uh jason that should help help me answer this so we we distributed the capacity uh oh the next yeah just one one more to the right uh the one with the map on it oh nice okay so right so we distributed as you see on this table here and um the kind of ocean locations are just meant to represent the centroid of those of those aliquots that we used to get the resource data not necessarily matching up with the actual call areas although the southerly sites definitely were more similar to the existing call areas but this is how we distribute it and then each is connected to one of those red boxes so um you can see in the parenthesis there which which site matches up with which substation and we just identified five along the coast that we thought five high voltage substations that were the closest geographically and would make the most sense as a time point and another piece is important that we didn't measure we didn't capture transmission to actually get the power to those substations so we all would just assume that it was generated right but no the 2.6 gigawatts is distributed as as you can see in this table and that's why the curtailment was broken out uh on the next slide uh so great i'm gonna go to harvey on the phone and then i'll come back to the chat as people put more questions and comments and uh go ahead harvey thank you uh just some ideas i you know they may not uh pan out but uh i think you need to do a cost-benefit study but if the submarine cable uh from your offshore tran uh generating site the technology for that uh if you got if far out uh i don't know if we got the technology to some for some reason electrical high voltage submarine cables uh it's also that like mentioned the chat before or landslides uh on the continental shelf or if it's close to that or some sloped area could be severed that might be a problem or the technology is not uh cause it's not there or it's not caught prohibit if you put it up too far uh when you're gonna need storage uh in some ways you could put a this is just a an idea uh you have uh some floating barges and you have a storage uh method such a idea suggested was hydrogen you you have a compressor you store the hydrogen in a in a pressure vessel you put the barge you disconnect the barge and then you take it to a brookings or coos bay and plug it into the transmission system it's kind of i don't know it may not work but and then uh did provide your peak power you got another one that's already a couple of two or three others uh accumulating power and you go this back and forth but that's a kind of a maintenance problem you know for using tugs crew the other alternative is a um it's been an experimental light i know i've seen this a bonneville that's been done at bottle was a super kentucky magnetic storage smees they call it smees they did that back in 1980s it was successful project uh it can store electricity and but yeah and it cleans the power you can get very clean power coming out of it when you go through your inverter did they the uh disadvantages of says maybe a low density and you've got a very strong powerful magnetic field uh you can't have any steel around it uh if you have for example the foundations of the site i saw the kind of the concrete foundations have a fiberglass rebar if you put steel rebar in there or the the magnetic field is so strong it'll pull the rebar out of the concrete but it's cryogenic it's a very a low temperature uh technology you have to uh i think that conducts super conducting con materials has improved since the 1980s so you might be a lower uh temperature a higher temperature superconductor material might work out but i would definitely do a a cost benefit study on that definitely find out whether you have the technology to uh transmission uh power through a submarine cable uh if you can't do it or it's not very cost prohibitive you're gonna have to look at storage and methods of storage and then maybe getting it sent to the shoreline if you do have uh technology",

        "text": " about that property or development that's really needed um to precipitate that removal from production so it's a very different process than what we're talking about with solar or maybe you know some other uses that Merit an exception where a certain level of Solar Development is permissible even while that property is still maintained under you know protective exclusive Farm use zoning um ostensibly because a county is found that it's not going to impact you know agricultural operations in the surrounding area the cost of agricultural operations in the surrounding area likewise any other type of Industrial Development that might be permitted say as commercial activity in conjunction with Farm use that's allowed um under the program you'll find also solar projects and other types of resources that require taking an exception to Statewide planning both free just like you would if you were changing the zoning um and so again it requires that there's something unique about that property or about the circumstances or about the proposal that merits waving you know the standards that implements those principles and policies of the Agricultural lands Protection Program I don't know if that answered your question councilwoman but there's some some differences in in some ways not there may not be differences in in when you take an exception it's a similar kind of process but um as far as the longevity of the use um you know I'm not aware of any solar wind projects that have been decommissioned where the land has been restored to an agricultural use so it'll be interesting to see how that might unfold going forward into the future thank you yeah just my thinking was is that a solar project maybe a wind um might have a lighter touch on the landscape and be able to be used in the future for farming or so thank you for that yeah so uh this is Marcy and I have a question for you or maybe an observation um no great secret that our state has endured tremendous wildfires over the last few years and I'm no meteorology expert and certainly not familiar with land use except for my experience here how do you see wildfires impacting um the lands as you as you do your work and subsequently any potential effect on um that's yeah thank you chair Grail that's a very interesting question um it comes up more in the context of uh Gulf 4 and Forest lands which has standards built into it um that address sort of the protection of um it's really protections that are really designed to protect um Timber stands um from Wild from introduction of risk that would increase um the potential for wildfires um as far as the agricultural lands program I think the conversations really you know been around restoration of agricultural lands post um introduction of Hazards and it's it's easier to restore agricultural lands than it is Forest lands um post fire so those are conversations that are sort of ongoing I don't know is there is there a different way of framing that question to her girl um it's and I I recognize it's a it's a large topic the reason I asked specifically is because as we've done uh numerous public hearings for example infrastructure are a huge deal and so when we talk about you know what happens to lands and things it's it's just a it's just an observation I think and I'll certainly uh read more about goal for we obviously keep talking about all three in our space so thank you uh for that I'll do some more research um so does anyone else have any uh additional questions for Miss Foote grail for the record the Sperry chocolate yes sir please go ahead pepper chalk too in my experience uh Klamath and Lake does all they can to go through their process to circumvent any type of guidelines for solar due to the uh problem with irrigation it all comes down to money if they can't irrigate that land because there's really no water down here we're in the middle of a massive drought this last year was you know a pretty good water year but um we're gonna have to have numerous years like this to fill the aquifer and allow irrigation as it was um so what the idea is if we can't irrigate this farmland and make money raising Alfalfa or potatoes or hay or grain let's convert it into solar and if you look through Lake County and you look through clama County you can see all kinds of solar projects coming up right in the middle of high value Farmland because it's they're constituents you know the the voting bulk of southern Oregon and so everybody wants to get voted back into office so they're going to do what they can to make sure these solar projects go through and we've got them right here in the Basin and all of it out here is a high value farmland so they say um there was a study done in the late 1800s that said the land out here wasn't fit for farming because of the high volcanic makeup of the soil the water drops right through the soil it doesn't have a high level of clay in it which would hold the water you know fairly in the surface you know that combined with uh the sense on a dollar agreement with Pacific Corps to run their pumps and pump water out on their field when that ended no six everybody was trying to figure out a different way to make money on the land and what's their answer solar and it's it's popping up all over down here I haven't seen a lot of these projects come before us at fsic so they have to be permitted by the counties so that's just my opinion on it um if you if we get a chance to come down and look ever I'll Point them out and some of them pretty expensive too so thank you for the time to talk to you I appreciate you it was a good report thank you council member talk to so Ms foot I think overall and I think we have all told you that we value what you've shared with us um and I hope that there's an opportunity for you to join us again I um it's been clear for at least me during my time on the council that your department works well with um fsex staff for us to be able to make the decisions necessary so thank you again for your for your time today and thank you very much to how our vice chair how uh chair Grill and uh Todd for inviting me here today it's been a pleasure and I'm happy to come back and talk anytime all right thank you all right well the next item on our agenda is the public comment period this is an information item this time is reserved for the public to address the council regarding any item within Council jurisdiction that is not otherwise closed for common items closed for comment include the Nolan Hills wind power project I will defer to Nancy uh to run this item to see if we have anyone wishing to speak thank you madam chair um I do see Angela Crowley has her hand up Angela I have unmuted your mic thank you opportunity to speak and thank you council members my name is Angela Crowley cook I'm the executive director of asea the Oregon solar Plus Storage Industries Association I mostly wanted to give some of our comments on the report that you just heard but before I do that I did want to note that back in the legislative report that you heard there was a question about HB 3179 and whether counties supported that bill or not and I wanted to let you know that the association of Oregon counties has come out strongly in support of that bill so Cam most counties do indeed support that piece of legislation so I wanted to talk about the report you just heard and give some other information that maybe wasn't part of the report um one thing I took away though from that great report was that 98 of our agriculture land in Oregon remains protected so when I hear that I think that's that's excellent our laws have been working we're not in a crisis when it comes to losing Farmland in Oregon but we are in a climate crisis and that's why we're seeing these new Oregon laws and these new solar projects and permits for solar projects coming in Oregon and all around the country chair Grail noted the increase in wildfires of course the climate crisis is exacerbating those wildfires droughts council member Chuck tube noted that farmers can no longer Farm due to droughts and areas of Klamath and Lake counties all of these negative impacts on the land are increasing because of the climate crisis which is why we believe that in many cases solar is an exception and deserves an exception to some of these goals because our land use law is created in that Senate Bill 100 did not take our current climate crisis into consideration um one other note um well first I want to talk a little bit about the different types of soil and land that some of these projects are on um in Klamath and Lake counties those are some of the counties you saw with the most permitted solar remember that those soils are not technically high value Farmland there are very little class one and two soils however there are class three and four soils which is what those counties would consider high value Farmland in those counties and I would argue that during these kinds of droughts when you can't Farm on some of those lands anymore solar is actually a great way to keep that land available for farming solar can be removed from the land very easily I know many members on the council have seen these utility scale projects solar projects personally and know that you literally just pull the steel out of the ground they're very different from some of the other land uses that you've seen that require sewer and and lots of buildings multiple rows that are really more permanent conversions of land solar is a temporary conversion of land if water comes back like we all hope it does in Klamath County and it's more profitable for that land to go back to farming those farmers can end their leases and um you know when the when the solar lease is up and they can return that land back to agriculture very easily so please do keep that in mind when we're talking about our current climate crisis and the balance that we really need to have to protect those lands by addressing the climate crisis um so like I said the the we we should be making some exceptions to our Landing schools really because of the climate um the report mentioned that the exception used for many of these projects is because they're close to transmission and we believe that should should be a notable exception and a worthwhile exception because our land use schools did not anticipate that being a need for projects like this and really for renewable projects so um it is it is exceptional that",

        "text": " low-income and disadvantaged communities in the event of a grid outage and maximizing household and Community ownership models in Solar Technologies next slide please so in order to achieve those impacts and outcomes we'll have to take on certain the application from the US EPA breaks those down into a distributed solar Market strategy a financial assistance strategy which they would like to see 75 percent of the funds to be used for financial assistance for these projects and then a project deployment technical assistance strategy and an equitable access and meaningful involvement plan all of these applications right now are early stage Concepts which we'd love to discuss with you all today and with that I'll hand this over to Rob Del Mar to start to introduce our early stage thank you Jen and just an audio check is it coming through okay there we go okay so for Oregon's concept to spend these funds we've got some um some broad goals that I'll describe momentarily and then we also have some more programs specific ideas um that I'll cover in future slides so from the big picture we really want to utilize these federal funds to bring benefits of solar installations to low income and other disadvantaged communities in Oregon and to do that we know we're going to need to be working with Community Partners to reach out to these disadvantaged communities it will involve increased incentives for multi-family and Community solar projects that provide benefits to low-income participants um we also would like to develop some long-term strategies that can remain in post 2030 when the federal funds are no longer available we would like um essentially low-income participation in future solar programs in Oregon even when the federal funds are all spent and finally kind of over all of these goals we would like to have a Workforce Development program so that we have a diverse and Equitable Workforce to essentially install all of this solar that we hope to install in the next five years so this is a quick view of the different program tracks that we would like to develop within solar for all and it starts with single family and this will be again an increased incentive for low-income participants to be able to access benefits of solar installations on their own homes and for folks that do not own their own homes we have plans to also develop a multi-family incentive um and I'll get into these in a little bit more detail in a moment um and when we can't get the solar on site we also have two different approaches for Community solar projects and one is community solar in investor owned utility service territories and another is community solar in consumer owned utility service territories and that's most of the rural parts of the and again overarching all of this we would like to be working on Workforce Development so that we can reach um into every corner of the state with a um with an able Workforce and living wages to get all this work done in the single family program we we really want to utilize these federal funds to increase the incentive stack and cover a high percentage of project costs and today we have had many different solar programs in Oregon they've provided millions of dollars worth of incentives to oregonians over the years and primarily we've been able to reach um affluent households and moderate income households but we haven't done a great job of reaching low-income households with these programs and so increasing this incentive stack with the federal dollars is one way we can see to do that we will be leveraging Energy Trust of Oregon programs and the Oregon solar and storage rebate programs that are already developed already have a known application process an online application platforms we want to utilize these existing programs to essentially minimize the administrative burden for contractors and homeowners to access these additional federal funds um we also recognize that to reach a new group of program participants we're going to have to coordinate with partners and the Oregon housing cap agencies Habitat for Humanity all of these organizations and many others we plan to work with so that we can make sure that we can access this new market and also coordinate work with other contractors that may be doing Roofing or insulation or efficiency work in the same low-income housing space and finally we'd like to explore ways to extend the federal funds to essentially Provide support to the low-income Market beyond the grant period ending in 2030. and when we talk about increasing the incentive stack this is a very simplified example of what that incentive stack might look like for a typical project and so in this table we look at a system size of five kilowatts which is a little smaller than an average system size in the overall residential Market in Oregon but still a system that can generate sixty percent forty to sixty percent of the household energy consumption for a typical home we're looking at an average cost of four dollars per watt which is what we see in the residential market now so that gives us a total project cost of twenty thousand dollars per installation our current programs are the Oregon solar and storage rebate program which provides a five thousand dollar and for customers that are within Energy Trust of Oregon service territories that's customers of PGE and Pacific there is also the energy trust solar Within Reach rebate and so in this example we have the five thousand dollar rebate that would be made available by Energy Trust for a 5kw system in Pacific Power territory so when these numbers start adding up we um there's two more pieces here one is a federal tax credit and that is calculated at 30 percent of the eligible project cost of a system and that has a few issues with it in the low income space and we'll get into those in a moment and then finally what's left in this stack is what is normally the homeowner contribution which may not be a huge lift for some of the more affluent homeowners but for low income it proves to be a real hurdle for getting into the solar market and that's this estimated funding Gap and for our purposes right now this is serving as a proxy for the federal incentive that we would likely offer in solar for all so this is just a real quick look at the project cost and the finding the um Financial incentive stack that could bring solar installations within the cost range of low-income households in and a few things that we need to keep in mind one monetizing the federal tax credit can be a challenge if the homeowner and in some cases low-income homeowners don't have adequate federal tax liability to take that federal tax credit and as we saw before that's worth forty five hundred to six thousand dollars depending on where the system is and how big it is it's a big piece of the puzzle and we're going to be working with um with Federal Partners to see how we might utilize a new option to get a direct pay rather than a tax credit for um for that share of the funding puzzle and to do that we think we're going to have to work with third-party partners and those might be non-profit entities within the community it could be done at a Statewide level it could be done with commercial partners and that's something that we're going to be working on throughout the application period but also well into the first year of the program implementation and planning we also would like to leverage additional funding Partners to hopefully increase volume and if we go back to the incentives stack you see the five thousand dollar incentives from the Oregon solar and storage rebate program that's ossrp and also Energy Trust of incentive rebates five thousand dollars those incentives are subject to the budgets Within These programs and we can foresee a scenario where um the real limiting factor to the number of homes that we can serve is not the federal funds but the funding within our own in-state programs so what we would like to do on this second bullet point is see if we can leverage additional funding Partners to essentially increase the volume of the the number of households that we can serve with our existing programs within the state and then of course post-grant planning this is hopefully leaving some tools in place that will enable the solar industry to remain active in low-income spaces after the grant period and of course this involves supporting the existing solar industry in Oregon and hopefully completing some Workforce a few of the questions that we've got and again as as Jen mentioned we have a portal open for folks to ponder these um at your own time um but really some of the key questions we have is how can the Coalition reach low-income and disadvantaged communities how can the Coalition serve residents in manufactured housing should a financing product looked again this might be used to increase the volume of the program and then how can Community organizations support and benefit from these program offerings again there's no urgency to answer these questions today we have a a q a portal open where we hope to gather your feedback in the coming weeks um moving on to multi-family here the objective is to support solar installations for low-income households and multi-family housing developments again the idea is to utilize federal funds to increase the incentive stack help bring these solar projects onto more of these multi-family housing developments and again we're able to leverage Energy Trust of Oregon and Oregon solar and storage rebate programs to both bring State funding to the incentive stack but also to minimize the administrative burden and we also see in the multi-family space that this is a good place to support storage installations where we may be able to provide backup power options for residents and multi-family housing units and this backup power might be able to support a common space heating cooling refrigerators charging the types of services that are most needed when the power does go out and so we would like to bring that energy resilience into the multi-family space we have programs that do it in single family but for the federal funds we just get a lot more bang for the buck doing storage and multi-family which is why we would like to do it in this program to really stretch those federal funds for and so again here's how it would kind of look where we have a rooftop solar program and that would deliver Bill savings to the residents of multi-family houses and then finally and also on battery storage for energy resilience and that brings us to some questions and the first one is how can the Coalition ensure that the benefits from a solar and storage installation are passed on to the residents of a multi-family housing unit and not just the owner and we have several developers in Oregon that have already done this successfully and we think that we can get this built into a program so that we have a prerequisite that anyone participating is passing these benefits onto the residents and not just the owner and of course this is another reason why we like battery",

        "text": " emails um that the two council members received you all have those um Chase mcfay Walker who's the Project Lead has provided those to the applicant and we put them in the record of the project um so this is one thing that's important to make sure that it's all disclosed so that any final decision by the council um is an appropriate decision and it's based only on information on the record so now this information is on the record um so my recommendation to you should you receive emails in the future is to do exactly that do not respond um you know forward them to us if somebody engages you in a you know verbal conversation or calls you on the phone um my recommendation is to politely cut that off um and you know should you receive re any kind of substantive information from them it would need to be disclosed on the record um such as we're doing today um and forwarded to the applicant to make sure that they have an opportunity to respond to any information um as well um what we've done with the two emails that we received or to the the people who sent them is we've responded to them um and told them we're not in a public comment time frame um you know it's it's not the right time to provide information you know to council members you know to influence them really in any way whether you're for or against a project um but we want to try to Pivot those people away towards staff we do not have those limitations um so we're not subject to that same limitation it is our responsibility to work with the applicant to work with the public to provide as much information on how the process works um and so we responded to them and said you know please don't send more emails to council members but we are here to help you we are here to um walk you through our process the project do whatever we can to help you fully uh participate in the process so that's what we want to Pivot towards is getting those people towards the department and away from Council um so yeah I would say um you know essentially this is this is primarily a quasi judicial body not a legislative body you you do legislation when you do rul making but the applications and amendments are Quasi quasi judicial and you are limited to the record um so it is very important that you know these projects be treated fairly um you know again doesn't matter if somebody's proposing being a proponent or an opponent of the project that all that information has to be on the record so um I know you know this is some new to some of you um some of you have had extensive experience dealing with these issues so I would just stop at this point and say is there any questions or thoughts or ideas or you know preferences in the way you would like to handle this obviously we have to have in a legal way but there are a number of ways that we can handle it um you know as well so I just wanted to throw that up in terms of any thoughts or ideas or any experiences you'd like to share um if you've dealt with this issue before so council member con yeah I have a question I have never dealt with um this before so um the fact that it's not a public comment period um but now it is part of the record how does um that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me that it's not a public comment period but the comment is included in the record so could there be a lot of emails that come in a non-comment period that and end up being part of the that we do this time and time again well only if they search you out and find your information um if they send an email to us um or try to provide comment to us we let them know this is not a public comment period it doesn't go into the record the same way we're not obligated to provide that information because that's not part of the decision record it's outside of a comment period we don't share it with you um that then has no potential influence on you but in this instance if you know for for your sake council member Condon you received this email and if you didn't share it and then later on you use information in that email to help make your decision on the project and that wasn't shared with the applicant and that wasn't shared with the other council members that could jeopardize the actual final decision whatever it is um if if that's found out on right what I'm a little bit confused about is that it seems to me there's an advantage to sending emails and having them in a non-comment period and having them as part of the record yeah well certainly that's why we don't provide your email addresses we don't share your email addresses or your phone numbers to preclude just that type of thing um and so you know again we've we've responded to you know those folks and let them know you know there are comment periods the better way is to wait and submit comments to the council members during those comment periods in the meantime we staff are happy to work with you to you know Express you know or to share you know how our process works and how they can best participate in our process I think this is you know not untypical where we are um a project is proposed in a new area and you know people don't have experience working in this format uh and they are doing what makes sense to them to try to influence the final decision decision again we have very specific kind of procedural rules and requirements and you know I'm sure unbeknownst to them this was not the right way to provide information and we want to Pivot and direct them to that right way um but make sure by the time we get to that point we've had an opportunity to answer any questions they have to educate them so they best know how to respond you know in terms of their comment again related to council standards these are the things that you're limited by and just if I can and that email did not come to me I just want to say that it went to somebody else so was forward it to me got it thank you chair gr oh oh go ahead gra um yes this is ampire just a quick question if somebody provides comments during the non-official comment period as in this case um did they have the same appeal rights as so it you have to offer it during the public comment period um to be part of the rais it or wave it kind of requirements yes yeah thank you C member that is correct so this does not register them as having commented which would allow them to request participation in the contested case because it's outside of that particular comment period but should it have any potential influence on you know a decision you know by a council member that's what we need to um fix on the record thank you chair Grill Vice chair how if I could ask U is there a certain staff person if any of this continues in the future that we should forward uh always forward to me um okay yeah I think that's best I mean you can certainly forward it to the Project Lead um but you know sometimes particularly early on the project you may not remember who that is so you're you're always you know available to send it directly to me um and then you know myself and then whoever the Project Lead will will handle sort of responding to the person and you know again working to make sure that the information is disclosed on the record like we are today yeah I'm I'm just going to add following follow this is Patrick Ro doj uh following up on your question council member Condon I haven't looked into this issue but how I would like to see it resolved if uh assuming that I find support for it is while we have introduced it in the record so it's acknowledged that it has been received it should be excluded from your consideration and any decision making okay that makes sense Vice chair how yeah thank you so an application hasn't been made but they sent what what's the name of the status of it right now they made it's still in the notice of intent State notice of intent yeah so it's you know we we had the notice of intent submitted we had the public information meeting um we had a comment period associated with that we received you know a fair number of comments um based on you know our own evaluation of the notice of intent as well as the comments we issued the project order which is the you know list of standards and requirements that the applicant has to submit um the applicant is currently working on their application we should be receiving it um relatively soon within the next couple of months is what we understand um so it is coming soon but even then we won't have a public comment period until we issue the draft proposed order so we're still the ways out from having the next public comment period this is chair Grail I think the one thing that you can you know there is an opportunity to acknowledge the work that has been done around communication and even though they've been a little misguided and when they could apply it does show that people are paying attention and so the importance of us continuing the way we have been and always looking to do better is shouldn't be lost in all that yeah and I think this is what we you know obviously there's going to be a lot of interest in this project and and we want to do as much as we can to you know not just Orient people to the kind of proper way to do it but to educate them um you know what I didn't mention is I actually had a phone call from somebody who was trying to find council member buyer's email address um and I know politely that no I'm not going to be providing you that but that I pivoted to you know how our process works what can we do to help you better prepared to you know review the application review our draft proposed order you know and provide substantive comments that you know potentially could influence the council member's decision so um it was a good pivot I had a very good conversation with her talked with her about a half an hour um she definitely was appreciative of that and indicated that she would would be um you know getting back to me in the near future for probably thoughts and ideas on you know how to better understand our process so that that's essentially what we try to do um but it is to try to you know limit people trying to influence you outside of the correct ways within process so just a question with respect to what after oh Cindy Condon",

        "text": " I think the battery site uh itself which they're kind of on a combined site um and we did uh request that be included in a condition uh and I don't think that particular setback distance showed up in the the management plan so I think that would exceed um that defensible space would exceed these standards otherwise the standards are based kind of on the engineering details and the likelihood of um aring based on the voltage of the equipment and that's beyond my particular knowledge set um uh so otherwise these are the standards that would apply it's the international um Institute of electrical engineers uh standards the National Electric committee standards and the um which are I think also adopted by the National Fire Protection Association and then the National Electric reliability Corporation standards um a lot of acronyms a lot of acronyms and I uh yeah please please don't ask me to explain what's what's in that um right next slide um so to kind of go through the issues um uh we heard concerns about hazard from lightning and uh both I think the hazard from lightning striking turbines and the hazard of lightening starting a fire uh at the site and um that getting out of control and there extra equipment being out there um so it's not referenced in the Wildfire plan or the associated documentation um but in the project description portion of the rfa1 um the certificate holder did indicate that a lighting protection system would be incorporated into the turbine blades um that from what I understand provides a pathway uh for the current to go through the blades and down through the tower and be grounded um to reduce fire risk uh I think the certificate holder represents that that would eliminate fire risk from lightning and I think we all know that's not the case it reduces it or minimizes it but um there is still some risk there um the Wildfire mitigation plan does call for monitoring during Red Flight warnings and um based on some of the review of the data from the National Weather Service it is my understanding that red flag warnings can be issued in Morrow County in conditions where there might be a dry lightning event um that's means that there's a lightning storm combined with other high fire risk uh things so most of the provisions in the Wildfire mitigation plan are are related to whether or not construction work will occur um they do reference that there will be people monitoring the site um and monitoring fire weather and then during operations it would be monitoring by the scata system uh that's incorporated into the facility components um I yeah I I guess I will open the floor to you all to think whether uh you believe those adequately address these concerns or whether you think we should go more um I uh gr for the record this is Marcy gril I think what I would be curious to know obviously there's a distinct difference between construction and operation generally speaking when Farms don't have a whole lot of folks running around um during operation and so it might be something to identify during High periods um but the other part to council member im's point about coordination in general when I think about these Wildfire mitigation plans and I think about the ones that utilities have um that they have at least the IUS have to submit to the Pu um foration because if you know my experience right now is during um high-risk Seasons they are like nope you can't do anything shut it down and so are are they working together because in general when you think about the transmission lines you know they're they're doing their con anyway it's just I think that's something to to ask the developer about is are you coordinating with the um other facilities utilities and things around because that's where I think the risk may come and then Al timately do they have the same bandwidth to to stop work um if you know a local utility is saying you know we're at a Red Flag Warning we've got everybody out patrolling line because we're worried and you're just Trucking along that's not helping that Community that's my buyer this is a much simpler concept but if we can have the provision about the lightning protection syst systems reflected in the Wildfire mitigation plan because I wouldn't have thought to look at the projects specs I would like it there because that at least says yeah this is a thing and we're concerned about it in this context thank you thank you council member by I will just say my own research on this showed that if there are issues with the whing protection system that's when there can still be a fire risk so I think we would also recommend that inspections of those components be specified to thank um uh so the next big big topic area was that there was inadequate consideration of fire spread potential during high wind events uh and that the potential for impacts to residences agricultural buildings equipment cropland and cropland soils uh wasn't um adequately addressed in the wild fire mitigation plan um and so we we agree with those comments um we do think that the plan needs to be revised to address these issues um we would like guidance from the Council on uh to what extent you think those revisions need to go how specific uh is good enough to to really say this I mean in some ways I think um we would at a minimum like to see at least contact between the rural fire service providers and and an agreement that explains who will respond to a fire and where and that there's a protocol for uh the onsite managers to provide them with constrain Maps or or at least direct the fire suppression activities away from the sensitive resources in a more Ideal World we'd like to see maps and figures showing exactly how everything will go down but I know that's maybe not realistic so um as we're open to any Council suggestions on this issue councel gril I think I'm okay with putting a little burden on folks because of the impact for what we're talking about and I think if if we leave it too subjective then again our responsibilities is to the communities and that that they have they should be able to go to sleep at night knowing that there is a real plan not a make Bel my experience is in moments of Crisis people panic and we need to ensure that the certificate holder um and the developer are doing everything possible that it's documented people know what to do and there's no question and to council members I'm Point again talking about rural areas don't have a lot of resources to start so they may have to do something to support along the way to protect these areas so I'm saying the more the better this is Kent and I um is there a difference between construction activities in times of just operation after construction as far as these types of wildfire provision concerns uh is it there's a fire it doesn't matter whether it's just operation or whether they're under construction chair how I would say for response not as much um it is more of an issue I mean fire at the site is a fire at the site there is some issues that there's things on the landscape like once the battery system is there the fire resp responders need to know whether or not it's safe to fight fire around the battery system they need to know how to do that um things like that um so the prevention side of the planning I think does change quite dramatically but the fire response side of it is less dynamic between construction and operation okay yeah that too chair how um councelor IMS um I would I would um really like to see the certificate holder um and the applicant um the developer um engage with the local we've already talked about this with the local fire districts um which are not just Morrow County it's Umatilla County too um and that there there could be possibly some um on-site training for those First Responders and also um that they could assess the Ware mitigation plan and give timely response to that plan and any um that those be um you know that there they have the opportunity to respond to the plan um and any issues that they have with it and any you know potential issues that they might see um we've talked a little bit about capacity um and having you know that's just a our observation so I'm sure that they would have the same um and then also identifying um the structures you know that are most vulnerable in the area um that would probably be an important part of assessing um the you know the Wildfire mitigation plan and and having a plan in place to address um how they're going to you know rise to that conflict so um those are just two little things that I can think of and I'm not even a fire expert right so um I just think about my own home and where I live you know that um those are things that I would think about as a homeowner in an area where you're surrounded by Dryland wheat and towers and lightning and all these different factors that uh are real so U the big thing for me is really the coordination with the fire districts that that be addressed and that that be done um in a timely manner um I don't know if anything in your recommendation talks about preconstruction having things done before um or not but I think that's a relevant discussion for the council to consider if anybody else has any thoughts on that and I would sorry this is council member Grail and I would also suggest with that training and coordination don't forget the local utilities because there is a big difference between going to a wind farm than handling your normal facilities and often times people think oh well you're you're linan you can fig well hold on because I don't do this every day so they need to be part of the mix too and and they are electrical qualifi and they would be a great resource they do have you know tools and they are are considered first respond responder so I would encourage them to be part of the the mix I've watched um anyway I just from experience I would say don't forget to acknowledge that those are resources available okay I just thought of something else too that I wrote in my notes um and that is just out of curiosity if the um County Emergency manager has been brought into the loop on this this kind of stuff if they are even on other projects in Oregon but um I think that's a good resource to um have part of the discussion is the emergency manager for the county both counties you council members um chair how if I may I just wanted to add and to point out as um we continue forward with this project but um so there is an existing condition that Council previously imposed in the original site certificate it's called gen pso3 it was before the Wild",

        "text": "thank you all right I'm gonna call to order today's meeting for the City of Salem Solid Waste committee for Thursday September 21st 2023. members present our Stapleton nishioka Varney right let's see here stop y'all can introduce if you have something to present does that sound good or do you want to introduce our guests okay perfect okay um I need an approval of minutes I know you have a motion I will move to approve the minutes second any discussion we are to public comments no okay and we uh if you can introduce yourself and say what order your address and we typically have three minutes but I have no idea how that works in this setting so uh chairs aprilton and the person to follow with me hello um my name is Paulina Durham I use Chico pronouns and I am the clean air organizer with the responsibility uh we are an organization of health professionals and health Advocates working collaboratively with Community Partners across the state on policy as a clinical change that promotes human health my role focuses on promoting a just transition to zero waste and holding the code anti American incinerator just outside the city of Salem accountable for the harmful pollutants of the incinerator emits this includes educating the public about the attended health risks the business and Order poses uh during the 2023 legislative session Oregon passed SB 488 introduced by Senator Doug Patterson sb48 requires the covanta Marion accelerator as the only Municipal solid wasting Center here at Oregon to perform continuous monitoring of its emissions this bill is a huge step forward everyone has the right to know what is in the air they breathe the water they drink Oregon PSR believes that we have still further to go the Statesman Journal reported last year quote covanta Marion burned 16 335 tons of medical waste making it the fourth largest medical waste incinerator in the country but because that's less than 10 of the total waste burned at the facility the U.S Environmental Protection Agency classifies it as a municipal waste incinerator the EPA regulates medical wasters iterator is more stringently precisely because burning medical waste produces more pollutants than municipal waste the anti-marian incinerator is not regulated as a medical waste incinerator only because of the sheer volume of the other types of waste that it burns perversely incentivizing the incinerator to burn larger amounts of waste that add to the total load of pollutants those surrounding Community as opposed to SP 488 is a huge step forward in providing the public with the information they deserve but regulatory gaps such as these remain thank you for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself and my work on the covanta Marian incinerator if you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out to me and I look forward to continued discussion with this committee and working towards a solution that works for the people of Salem and protects their health thank you any questions right now or do you have like you know there's he has oh shut up go ahead Chris I got a big question and and this this the medical waste issue is actually uh probably more significant than I think most people realize because um it's the only means to get rid of medical waves within the state of Oregon and so I'm hoping that uh in addition if you're looking at drafting you know this sb4 488 there's actually going to be funding future funding to uh replace that incinerator with actually a medical waste incinerator that could be utilized by every jurisdiction within the state of Oregon has that have you guys taken that initial step the reason I ask this is because a lot of the other jurisdictions I work with are being and I'll use the word gouge to significantly by covanta because it's the only place you can do the only place you can take medical waste within the state you can't autoclave but the only the next nearest autoclave is up in Seattle all right so we do have a significant problem you do bring up some issues but again you know shutting the thing down is it it may solve one problem but you'll open up another problem and ask what are we going to do with the waste once we shut it down the medical waste yeah you guys you guys are putting this together need to also understand that you know you solve one problem you create another problem um and and I can see the collective jurisdictions within the state of Oregon would would want to be a part of this because like I said down in Eugene they're paying almost 800 a ton to have their medical waste shipped up to covanta have it incinerated and they're they're a little bit upset um so that's one jurisdiction I'm specifically working with and and I know um the other medical waste stericycle and uh Trilogy have agreements in place with colvan to get a lower rate however that still doesn't answer the problem what we're going to do with this stuff if we do shut down covanta in Marion County so that's you know keep that in mind how much in 16 000 tons is a significant amount of waste and that's not all the waste so you know yeah I I would point out that there are now other ways to safely dispose of medical waste other than other than putting it straight into the incinerator and I think that I think that those other methods are um are less harmful I understand that but right now incineration especially post covet is the only way that some of these are are allowed to to be you know the to get rid of the waste I I can tell you that um up in in Gresham that they're specifically told that the only way that they want their medical waste disposed not an autoclave they want to incinerate it so those are the limitations and everyone thinks you know mindset burning it kills it so again when you're looking at this you might want to consider this bill who needs to also address what do we do with this once yeah I think shut it down yeah yeah I do believe yeah oh sorry it's okay um well I want to make sure that we keep it in the concept or that the realm of public comments so thank you so much for providing your public comment I look forward to the conversation later with you uh Mr Bell and what I would like to take from this Ryan is that I think that maybe this committee would like to just have one of our future meetings just dedicated to medical waste understanding it understanding um the nuances around and I know that we'll get there with covanta um and the different Implement implications of changes there but also ways that we can change it so that it's um safer for the communities around there I know that there's conversations about scrubbers and only the different conversations so I know that it is vast and nuanced and I think that it would be great to have not only conversations about covanta as it functions as it is which I know we're in and take two and all that great stuff but I also want to know specifically and I think to speak for the committee when I say specifically about medical waste and the complications that that brings up for our community so thank you for your comment did you have a comment for oh I wanted to say thank you because you have the same comment I did I'd like to know what the definition of medical wastage is exactly what it includes and also how we might be able to just reduce the amount that is um whatever incinerated is it I mean maybe parts of it don't need to be considered medical waste but it were being charged for it that makes sense yeah okay all of those things could you just solve all this problem for us to thank you thanks for bringing this point now of course yeah stay engaged we'd love to have you stick with us the meeting if you'd like or come back oh yeah awesome great y'all thank you so much thank you and feel free to reach out if you have any questions all right Mr Jim Jeffy you know the drill right yes I I think the I just want the comment one thing about paulina's testimony that I think as you said 16 000 tons 16 000 335 I wish I knew that I used to know what percent of that was in state it's small maybe like 10 something like that um so just understand that the vast majority of the 16 000 tons of medical waste is out of state income too so okay thank you for having me again today I um 350 Salem and also the Clean Air now Coalition we're part of the Clean Air now Coalition that includes Physicians for social responsibility and Beyond toxics and and other Statewide groups I just want to repeat since you're going to be dealing with the rate issue today that our requests for your consideration in 2024 is that we add to the every other week 20 gallon surface that would continue that and that we also have every other week 35 gallon that is very common in other cities I think Eugene has that and but to we usually look at it as our peer um and we need that so that people have a way to say if I'm not filling up with a 35 gallon can or even plenty dollar against I could have every other week 35 service and pay less and reduce my bill it's just a way to do two things give people some control over their bill and also incentivize people to reduce to reduce their trash so that's what we're asking for every other week 35 gallons are in The Sun Also that both every other week 20 and 35 be promoted by the City of Salem next year by sending out a flyer in the utility bill or you know however you do it on your fabulous Facebook page which everybody looks at all the time um and makes nasty now um so anyway that's what we're asking for every other week 35 promote we need to promote we didn't promote 20 down every other week and I I'd love to know how many people actually opted for that I bet it wasn't very many and we get a report but anyway um my time's almost up and I'm going to close by handing this out because we're co-sponsoring a meeting in Corvallis on the 10th of October called Berry trash and it's all about landfills and as you know a lot of our solid waste all of it from West Salem and a lot of it even from this side goes to",

        "text": " we can connect and follow up a as a Committee Member any uh any additional questions you have for folks or any other discussion you want to bring up on your thoughts for the committee's charges I like it's going no questions and uh Zachary Mario any any questions for the x uh Debbie I'm gonna turn it over to you for discussion on your committee and um electric uh whatever we call it Electric Tools electric electric equipment use yeah so um the way that I outlined this is different from from what Dylan did I just went along with the bullet points on the deliverable um that he put into the um into the document so I did there was four bullet points and I kind of out outlined where we're at on those four bullet points right now um so that's what I've got up here yeah so the first one is um how do they align how do the policies align with the emissions reduction goals um so I wrote down what the climate action plan is um and that's to reduce 50% of of the Citywide greenhouse gas iions um for the base compared with the Baseline year of 2016 by 2035 and to be carbon neutral by 2050 and then I looked for in the plan this specific part that relates to the two-stroke engines that we were kind of focusing on and um they it says within three to five years it was put into that since 2021 so as far as timeline goes right now is a really good time to start doing that um and you're supposed to develop and Implement a plan to phase combustion and two-stroke engines within the city limits so um that's kind of what we're going with and um I think that they align very well um getting rid of the two-stroke engines and phasing into electric with with the climate action plan I think it's an important part of it um but one thing that I did find out is that I can't find in the climate action plan that it talks specifically about landscaping equipment I can't find anywhere that it does that maybe I missed it um but it focuses mostly on um ruction and transportation I think is the primary source of carbon emissions I also didn't find that it talked a lot about um other emissions which is one of the worst things about the two-stroke engines is the is not necessarily the carbon emissions it's it which is not good but it's uh all the other emissions because they're not regulated like regular engines are so we've got a lot of um you know uh talks about particulate matters nitrogen oxide Benzene for Malahide and I don't see those in the climate action plan just see the carage um so I would like to see that you know as a big part of it for getting rid of that's an important thing I went to a neighborhood association meeting and they were talking about trying to sign on to getting rid of gas powered leaf blowers yes within the City of Salem which I I agree with also um but one of the problems they had is that our climate action plan talks about carbon uh emissions and it's only 4% according to the uh EPA of all the carbon emiss come from the two-stroke engin so it doesn't look like a really important part of it but with all the other emissions accounting for 17% of the Vol organic carbon 12% of nitrogen oxide 29% of the of the carbon monoxide and those are all important too so that was one thing I found out um so basically uh because the two stroke engines are so inefficient and they're not regulated like regular engines are uh one hour of emissions from a gas power Leaf lower is the same as driving 1100 miles in a car which is crazy and a typical weekly Yard Service creates more pollution than revving your car in your driveway for 10 hours so it's just not accounting for all of that uh the inefficiency of it I think um so that's I think it is going to help us Advance our our plan um but I think it's underestimated when we look at the uh the plan that we have so the next bullet point was evaluation of existing city parks and um and I really have a hard time with this because I don't I really need a lot of help from staff because I don't know the existing city parks and policies other than um other than the uh climate action plan so what is the is there an internal policy on when do we use battery uh equipment when when do we use when do we not use battery equipment During certain Seasons or do we just when when how much do we have how much have we already transition I thought um no both noi and mil sent you information with regard to what's already trans because I could have been sworn I saw was copy on stuff that was sent to you guys relative to that 2022 um there was an there was an email and it said that they looked at um all the different kinds like the uh the stream trimmers and things like that um and those were pretty good at the time but that the Le Leaf power gas power Leaf flows were not the battery power wasn't Lo but that was a year and a half ago and um and I know Joan emailed noi again and hasn't sent anything to to me so I don't think she got any responses for about that I haven't emailed anybody because we were asked um to go through Keith because we didn't want to bother the staff so um I haven't emailed anybody this is a good chance for me to talk to people and try to you know establish that so we can um I can get more information to staff like can't I can't find the step out okay I know they've had some conversation with Joan but I'll I'll follow up with Joan okay well with my staff see what they've sent John and kind of stuff because I know both of them from the urban forestry standpoint and then from Parks operations I've sent some information with regard to that so yeah well yeah and I think one of the questions there Jen is is are there existing policies around it or is it just kind of uh you know your staff practice uh and kind of the approach right is is there any I don't know that there would be any like city code related to this um or any other kind of official policy versus uh uh in the moment kind of decision making of we need to buy a new piece of equipment what do we buy here right like that type of I could be wrong on that but I guess is if there are any policies kind of which direction might Debbie and Joan and Mauricio look for that and Juliana I saw your hand up if you want to respond to that um you can go ahead and respond first so there's not a formalized policy that's established a lot of that is predicated on availability and need and budget quite honestly each year we have a certain amount of budget each year this is what we can think this is the amount of equipment we have to do because obviously we go through with all of the parks that we have in staff we go through um equipment very quickly by comparison to a lot of entities so um so you know those are all kind of drivers um so there's not been a formalized policy per se as to how much is going to be for example each year that we're going to swap out and use this type or in scenario um that kind of things so it's really for staff is looking for opportunities on the type of work that they're doing and what's available on the market um that will meet the needs for maintaining parks and that is not cost prohibitive because we buy lots of equipment obviously for 92 parks and so you know we try to uh it's just kind of a continual kind of annual thing that we replace as availability and as need um but we can't we we don't have the ability completely clear something out and buy all new we we we run stuff until it dies and we can't it's not you know reasonable to keep fixing it and replacing it um so because obviously budget's a large component of that but when it dies are we trying to replace with electric I mean that's and again that's when we look at to see what's on the market what's available for the use that we're going to need to do because with maintaining in in 92 Parks that's a lot of heavy use continually all day long you know 365 days of the year and so um so you know we we we're just we look for opportunities it's an ongoing process I guess when we do that and Debbie thinking about and Julian I know you had a comment here but just thinking about your committee and kind of the recommendations right one of the recommendations could be for the city to develop a policy of replacement right and and recognize in that recommendation though that to Jen's Point like that's a Major budgetary Impact act right and in electric stuff potentially being more expensive and so that's something that if city council were to adopt that recommendation it's also going to have to follow up with with budgetary approaches uh to that as well which might be difficult uh in the current moment for the city um and and so that but that I think that's something that the committee could consider right is is would it be appropriate for us to recommend a a replacement policy um for uh the parks um equipment uh and if so what could that look like right and Juliana did you sorry I keep talking please jump in no um so for that I was just going to say if you could also include in like looking at a policy if you could include um contract when the city contracts out so that's not as much Parks but it is more for like the other City buildings that contract out those Lawn Service type of uh program so if you want to look into that as well that is something that the client action plan has also expressed interest in so if you have that as part of your policy I would love to steal some of that from you Sor to jump I I think a few years back this council did adopt um not necessarily for landscape equipment but for City vehicles uh to replace them with electric vehicles and to do that and and they had a goal I don't remember remember the year to be honest by but by a certain year um with the intent of replacing City vehicles for electric vehicles um to address climate action plans and so forth I think some of the problem has been so the city has started that",

        "text": " you know for notice requirements for a regular application are pretty extensive whether or not we think they make sense they're in the statute so we follow them um they're less onerous or and specific for an amendment process and so where you know where it makes sense we've sort of streamlined it and potentially as part of this process we might want to streamline it even more uh the third difference is that there's a higher bar for someone to be a party to a contestant case essentially the difference is that you can't just have for regular application you have to have raised an issue uh with sort of suff sufficient specificity as we say in the rules and that really just means that you've basically identified an issue and you've you know raised some uh that would support that issue that's really all it means for but for an amendment you have to have raised an issue and and basically provide enough facts and it has to be the uh significant enough that that Council that it would have that the hearing officer or the council determines that it would would potentially change their uh view on an issue um so it's just a it's a higher bar and frankly uh it is it isn't met very often so if you're in on the amendment track there's much you're much less likely to uh see a contested case um and that is very attractive for developers so uh they're very interested in in you know the amendment process I think for that reason uh and fourth uh after 2017 revamp of the amendment rules a type A type B track was created uh as I talked about previously so you could potentially be on uh your Amendment could be deemed tight B which shrinks things down even more and it's really just quicker timelines reflective of the fact that you have qual you have basically your project or amendment has been designated as a as a simpler easy to review um Amendment so therefore we can have quicker time ons um any questions about these items or what it means to file an amendment versus just a regular application as you can see there's not like 50 differences I mean and if you if you go back and look at the slide of the of the amendment process it sort of tracks the application process with a draft proposed order the public comment um the final order possible contested case that's all the same as a as an actual Amendment so these these four items here um can be significant but it's not like there's a thousand um we do have a whole yeah go ahead oh what St I I have a question so I'm sure trying to follow it because I'm on the phone and I'm not online to see it sorry about that um looking at the whole Amendment versus an noi so when you're looking at that there was no public comment and there's actually there's nothing that's given to the public right now we have notices which are newspaper which are actually so inefficient because no one really reads the newspaper but um you know and to get that information out to the public which would stop the problems maybe going forward to have the contested cases or send something to you know the state of Oregon through the sunshine act or something like that um that would help also the developers not spend all that money in an area maybe they shouldn't be at so I'm just wondering is that what you're saying this amendment is there is no public um information or notice given out when their amendments are given so there is a notice it's just that there's no public comment period so there is there is a required public notice that's that goes out to the people that sign up to receive notices um uh and but unlike with the noi where you would have a public comment period there is no public comment period for amendments after the notice is issued something we can talk about for the public can they go back later then that would be something they would just do fastic Cas and if the amendment was changed or what they have to go through the state of Oregon through like sunshine or something like that sorry I didn't I didn't follow your your question what was your question so if there wasn't um for a public comment on that and an amendment was just made okay and then moving forward yep then what is the public to be able to come back for that Amendment do they just go after that later for a change going through so there's still a there's still a a public comment period with an amendment it's just not it's not at the begin so with a regular application you have public comment period after the initial notice and then there's the public comment period after the um draft proposed order is issued so for an amendment it's just after the draft proposal order so you still have an opportunity to comment um and raise issues um and potentially be involved in a contested case just um not at the beginning of the project I got it now thank you so much yeah no worries um okay so uh I just have a little information slide here that I thought might be uh interesting and it's something we're still looking at but this is just so you have an idea since 2017 when the type A tracks were created we've had uh 27 Amendments 16 of those were deemed type A 11 of those were deemed type B there's also a type c which nobody has ever asked to be on and uh we will uh as such I consider it on the topping block but we'll we'll get to that here in a little bit but you can see the type B's are shorter six months on average and type A is 10 months on average but one of the Thick questions I have is are they shorter because type B is like more efficient or are they shorter because type B was those projects or those amendments were already simpler and if we hadn't bothered with a type A type B those amendments would have been seven months like how much time are we really saving by having the a type B track given it takes a lot of time and energy to make this determin so is the time and energy spent determining whether an amendment is type A or type B if we just went straight into uh doing the amendment would would that actually be more efficient so I hope I'm that question makes sense but uh yeah it's it's something that we're definitely thinking about and and want to look at so what is the scope of this uh Ru making so to be clear it's it's primarily the language in uh in the O 345 division 27 however it also could potentially include other sort of like tertiary language that maybe directly references the amendment uh process there's like a rule in uh division 15 that uh in the contested case section that specifically talks about the contested case board Amendment uh I think that's up for up for grabs so it's primarily going to be the stuff in division 27 uh which I emailed to everybody uh last last week but if there is some other sort of like oh hey there's this rule over here that's directly connected to the amendment process but not in division 27 that's within the scope as well so anything related directly related to the the council's amendment process is uh up for grabs here in terms of what you know what we're looking at and the objectives are pretty straightforward that the solutions are going to be more complicated but we want to make the rules more clear that's always my goal uh you know we've had a couple of years it's been five years since the 2017 uh rulle making went out and that was a pretty complex gnarly rule making uh you know where there's some unintended consequences of that rule making where there some things we didn't foresee uh some ambiguities you know now that we've had experience implementing those rules for the last five years uh how can we make the rules more clear number two serve related but not uh is how do we can we improve the process are there certain parts of the amendment process where where we have more flexibility because it's not as prescripted by Statute um to make the process more efficient while still protecting the the public uh and number three this is sort of required but uh you know ensuring that we comply do the current roles uh comply with any new statutes or or revised rules or other recent direction from the courts so and then outside the scope is just stuff that's not related to the amendment process uh does does anybody have any questions about the scope of this R all right as you can see it's pretty broad okay so I'm now going to go through some slides here which is basically you know staff has spent some some time some meaningful chunks of time here going through the amendment rules and sort of identifying like well there's this confusing this this could be tweaked we should probably make this better but again like no no actual drafting of languages occurred uh and so it's just sort of like a a an issue Spotter and I'm going to go through I want to say the the main ones not everything that we've looked at um just to kind of give you an idea of like what what we want to look at what we want you to look at um but I'm I'm if there are any things that we missed or any other additional issues that you are concerned about then absolutely this is the this is the time and place to raise those all right so as we said I'm not going to spend a whole a lot more time on this um one of the things the r needs to do is determine whether type A type B type c determination process is worth the effort so takes a lot of time takes a lot of resources to go through that process we got to you know do some analysis present in front of council during that time we could just be processing the amendment so is the is the effort extended resulting in an overall efficiency gain we could just provide more flexibility in the rules so that if if an amendment really isn't that complicated we just have one track but the track sort of provides the flexibility to move things quicker if an amendment is more straightforward rather than having tracks um so uh you know we need rules guiding the return of sites to useful nonhazardous condition there isn't really anything in the amendment process uh that directly addresses this issue um um staff has identified a need for some additional rules to cover partial retirement of of a facility there not really anything in there right now so if you if you have an amendment and you basically you know you have let's say I'm just going to make these numbers up you know 500 megawatts of wind turbines and you want to you know decommission 200 of them and",

        "text": " so I have some concern about that um our last public meeting we talked quite a bit about wildfire mitigation plans and um striving for a more cohesive um approach so that we see these plans becoming um just better I guess in general um and also um better you know more frequent inspections and I did see in this one that they had actually put that information in there so that's um but again um also want to reiterate that um you know speaking with the First Responders in this area is really really important um all those fire districts that are impacted by this project um reaching out to them and um also you know what their capacity levels are and how are they going to respond to the fire when it happens because it will happen um we need to know that they have been engaged um and that and what their comments are because we don't ever get to hear from or from what I gather so far I haven't heard from any local fire responders um to these matters so I'm very curious about that and um also wanted to ask this is more of a question and I'm not sure who can answer it but um I noticed that the comment period was different on this than the one that we just had it was 30 days versus 45 days and again I'm new here so I'm still learning what constitutes a 30-day review versus a 45 day review or comment period I should say not review and um if this was an expedited process so I'm thinking maybe that might be it thank you secretary cornette for the record Todd cornette I can certainly take the last one um so I believe the minimum comment period is 21 days so that's the legal requirement for a draft proposal or comment I have to go back and verify that but I think that's probably correct um beyond that we we never said a 21 day or I I doubt that we've ever said a 21 day because don't believe that's sufficient to review the complete application or the complete request for Amendment and a draft proposed order um but frankly it's a judgment call on staff's part based upon the proposed project location what we've known to date about interest on that project Bo been to Heming way a lot of interest therefore it was you know going to be a minimum of 45 days because that's you know based on our experience we know that there's a lot of interest um and we wanted to make sure people had that opportunity for this project um at the public information meeting on the notice of intent at the public information meeting on the complete application there was very limited um interest uh limited participation that doesn't necessarily mean that at the draft proposed order stage there would be that same limited participation but it's likely um and so that's essentially why we chose a lesser time frame than the Boardman the Hemingway way any other comments questions Vice chair Condon um thank you Cindy conon for the record and I forgot I did have a question on the Wildfire um mitigation and I I should have um checked on this um it's my memory that the Wildfire standard is on ignition it it kind of uh applies to ignition Source the the project being an ignition source because you mentioned grassland is more um of a problem for fire than the solar facility um it jogged my memory and I'm just curious in any of the Wildfire mitigation plans that we're looking at or whatnot are is there a I haven't seen and I know I've asked about it before a notification process for adjacent land owners should there be an ignition on a project is that anticipated in the plan in mitigation plans I just don't know about about the development of those plans thank you uh Vice chair Condon this is Sarah esterson senior policy adviser for the record um I think that what we're trying to ensure is included in Wildfire mitigation plans is an obligation to develop a process for working with emergency responders to notify local land owners but that the obligation wouldn't be for the certificate holder the facility Personnel to do that notification so we haven't because we don't actually have any Wildfire mitigation plans that have been finalized or are in place we're not seeing what that actually looks like what is the process they've developed but the plans say you've got to develop a process thank you and I I know you've been working on it and so just as that developed through the process I'm interested in in um adjacent property owners and the protection of their property in timely I mean ambers do fly pretty quickly and so what are the mitigation efforts for those adjacent so I'm was just looking for that information thank you no problem counc berer Vice chair Conan I think we added a condition to the obsidian project one of the Amendments that we've been trying to include on other um projects for that coordination with the local responders knowing that the local responders probably have better access to property records than the developer would and would have a system perhaps in place um to notify by those adjacent Property Owners I know in dutes County you can get text alerts for Wildfire smoke uh you know all sorts of police activities so there are different mechanisms to do those property owner notifications and I think as we start to see mitigation plans maybe there'll be a model that other developers can adopt but we want to make sure that that language is in every condition we put under the Wildfire standards that we expect that coordination just a follow up to that and yes I do remember that we talked about it and had it as a condition it's just as we see more and more plans I'd like developers to think about about okay what's our responsibility for it because like I said the Embers travel quickly and I I don't know what the what the timing for even knowledge of an incident and then now um engaging with the local fire I just um I don't know enough about it yeah thanks and there's a there's a potential for at least one potentially three in the next six months where we would actually see the outcome of what this means what is the plan for that landowner communication and we can bring that back to you thank you Council Devin this is a very general questions chairman maybe just that Mike I'm waiting I've been noticing I mean I believe the developers are very cognizant of the fire issues but I've been seeing in the last probably year and a half more of the proposals coming in with more of the potential some of them are not transmission lines but power lines being underground compared to uh proposal from a couple years back is are you generally seeing that and I mean I think that's a recognition of the the way to to minimize the chances of fire is to put power lines underground particularly given what litigation there's been in western states on this issue well I don't want to speak for next era but I thought that they actually have a policy for 34.5 KV lines that are there underground um we haven't dealt with high voltage underground proposals yet yeah I was seeing more lines big fo change any other comments okay um as previously stated the comment deadline is June 7th at 5:00 pm the applicant will be given until Monday June 10th at 5:00 pm Pacific time to provide responses to comments however if requested by the certificate holder the department is authorized to grant them additional time to respond does the applicant wish to provide any responses tonight yes sir thank you for the opportunity again this is Ryan Hill with the wagon trail solar project um and could you go ahead and go to slide 15 that I uh sent over earlier yeah slide5 I just kind of want to address some of the uh comments brought up tonight sorry let me get logged in here um and just kind of talk through our thinking specifically on the go three uh exception but to kind of answer some other things right our noxious weed plan our fire mitigation plan those are living documents right so we we update those when there's a new piece of information and you know a larger company like my parent company NeXT D energy resources uh we're going through pre-construction compliance of a a wind project also in Morrow County and so all the lessons learn that we get from that noxious weed mitigation plan fire mitigation plan we we bring to our other projects as well so while you might not have seen those changes for this specific project they are coming um additionally I walked through with the mo County Emergency manager this week with our operating site right just to get his input on our operating facility what we could do better his input the coordination with the local First Responders and then we went a step further where we brought in our construction superintendents to talk about hey what are we doing during construction what can we do better you know how are we going to coordinate with the county if there is an emergency whether it's fire related or a personal injury you know working out all those details um and then Additionally you know he get to see up close and personal you know a battery storage system as well as solar panels and and wind turbin so I think it was a good experience for him and so we are doing that coordination and you know sometimes all of these plans are pretty detailed but it's hard to include every little thing we are we are doing within the county and and the same thing goes for the noxious weed plan um you know we talk to our neighbors uh Chris he'll he'll let us know if he has an issue for sure and then you know we try to be responsive and correct that issue as well as working with uh Cory Sweeney at um the weed superintendent for Moro County as well it's taking those lessons learned from our operating or further along in the permitting process projects and pulling that to these projects like all these documents are living documents and need to be updated as new information recommendation from County staff or you know subject matter experts uh comes up to date um and then just to I know there's a little bit of mystery of our um agricultural mitigation plan so I just kind of want to talk through how we got there and what what our thinking was right and so just to overview of the land we're using um predominantly not high value Farmland we're not using any irrigated land it's mostly dry land wheat and yeah we are expected to impact about um 3700 Acres of that land next slide please and so here here's kind of the reasons for a go three exception and just to be clear uh I think we fall under",

        "text": " to correct me if i misstate something but um the puc rules require uh electric owned investor owned utilities to operate in compliance with wildfire protection plans and the requirements for those plans are outlined in the newly established ors 757 963 which was implemented through senate bill 762 the standard embedded in both the puc rules and that statute is that the wildfire protection plans must reflect a reasonable balancing of mitigation costs with resulting reduction in wildfire risk um and i kind of wanted to point this out uh because while we are mindful that the the council rule is not intended to uh cause unnecessary cost of compliance or administrator burdens on certificate holders um the council uh really doesn't have the same mandate to uh consider cost containment um or rate recovery as as the duc does so we are working under slightly different and may need to use a slightly different standard to evaluate compliance with a council rule or standard seeing some things moving around um so as we go into this the approach we've kind of recommended is or our initial approach that we're thinking of pursuing right now is to establish a new standard that requires facilities to develop a wildfire risk mitigation plan for the we would kind of like to hear from you all whether you all think that's an appropriate approach whether there are other approaches we should consider and whether or not you think that approach would be an effective way of mitigating wildfire risk um we also want to know if we do go forward with the planner approach what sort of these the appropriate standards or criteria would be to evaluate those plans and to evaluate compliance with the wildfire standard so um with that i will kind of open this up to discussion and look for any hands hands raised or if anybody has any questions or clarification okay well i am not uh any hands raised on this so hopefully we will get some more thoughts going as i go through a little bit more um okay and maybe we can move on to the discussion of applicability as folks are chewing on this a little bit um which is uh our second question is really related to the types of facilities so if we do go forward with this idea to require energy facilities to submit a wildfire risk plan as part of their application for site certificate we want to know whether or not that rule should apply to all energy facilities or or a subset of them the puc rules do apply just to electric utilities and there is specific rules as i mentioned for investor owned utilities and then a more general mandate for consumer-owned electric utilities and the puc does have other specific safety rules for other types of regulated utilities but those planning rules only apply to electric lines and also generating assets owned by those investor-owned utilities the council has has a little bit broader jurisdiction as i mentioned earlier and i just wanted to throw some examples out there of the things that the council does have jurisdiction over that includes high voltage transmission lines um most of those high voltage transmission lines would be operated owned and operated by the electric utilities um and then we would also be reviewing wind and solar power generation um natural gas power plants pipelines and storage facilities and then uh certain fuel pipelines and facilities and the council's jurisdiction is generally determined by uh the size of facilities so we would only be reviewing very large uh facilities that kind of reach a level of statewide concern but but it does cover a broad area and i just saw a question from lori um about whether or not oregon department of forestry is participating in this rule making unfortunately um nobody from odf was available to join the workshop today but we have been in contact with them and plan on working with them a little bit more closely on some of the risk analysis questions that we have as well so okay and so um does anybody have any uh thoughts or comments or perspectives on on whether or not the council should be looking just at um electric power generation facilities um or whether or not we should be looking more broadly at any energy facilities under the council's okay and lori i'm looking at your comment now saying that um the oregon environment forestry sometimes depends on high voltage transmission line corridors as fire breaks and i think that would be something that would be really good for us to be aware of and in consideration and consider during the citing process although i'm not sure if to this point that that's been something specifically that we've considered uh jim i see your hand is up so please please go ahead yes if if i may i just want to go back to the regulatory approach i'm a slide behind in my thinking but in looking at the question of is a facility specific wildfire protection an appropriate and effective way to wildfire risk i think about fire departments and how would they handle a chemical a production facility or a data center to my knowledge of some of the that i know they have plans pre-ordained for certain facilities knowing where the pipe stands knowing the evacuation routes electrical supply centers um so i would think looking at best practices at the state fire marshal's office might inform that question as to how to look at your different facilities and anticipate the types of incidents that may occur and thus work with the local departments for responses thanks jim and um look to sarah if she has anything to add i know some of our facilities do have emergency response plans and some of the more traditional energy facilities i think have you know they do have some requirements to maintain um a in an action plan if there is an incident at the facility that uh explains whether or not there's hazardous materials on site i know we've worked with some of the facilities that have a battery energy storage system to you know give some training to first responders on on what they would need to do if there was a fire at the energy system um at the battery system you know whether or not it's safe to be open what what sort of um fire suppression uh might it might be equipped with and what the best way to put out a fire would be um but that's not certainly something i think that's been very consistent across all types of so i think that's a good good comment thank you i don't have anything to add i just want to say that what you said was consistent what i was thinking thanks well um i i think i often tell this at google making workshops maybe too often but one of my professors taught me that the best way get people to talk or the best tool to get people to talk was awkward silences but that does not seem to be working for me too well today so we can go ahead and move on and see if there's more discussion as we go through some of these other topics oh well so one other question that we had on our applicability questions and um maybe i actually need to go through this i think i missed the slide uh would be whether there are specific factors like geography zoning or design that should be considered um and then um i think one thing we would like to hear feedback from and we can get this later if needed to is if we should be giving special consideration to facilities that are already subject to a uh wildfire protection plan um and so this would be you know whether or not we would be accepting those plans or giving some sort of exemption to um the the investor owned utility owned and operated transmission lines particularly that are already subject to the puc's and uh if anybody does have any thoughts on that now we certainly like to discuss it but as i'll mention at the end we're also happy to accept written comments if people have ideas uh david uh yeah i you know i think you hit the nail on the head i think it doesn't make sense to require mitigation planning if utilities already required to provide a comprehensive wildfire mitigation plan through the puc so i think we would advocate that there be deference or incorporation of those pre-existing plans and david i don't know if you can uh speak to this and it's okay if you can't but i am curious if the current wildfire protection plans really get down to a facility specific or if it's just more general practices that apply to the whole system uh yeah i mean i can only speak to the mitigation plans that are applicable to you know transmission and distribution um i imagine the um something beyond that isn't currently covered through the puc no i think they're designed to be a comprehensive plan that applies to a overall system you know you're not managing individual lines but you know hundreds or even thousands of miles of line so that that type of coverage you know requires a comprehensive planning and not something specific okay thank you oh well let me let me add that's not to say we don't do you know mitigation planning taking into account um you know risk at certain areas so i don't want to leave it at that that doesn't entirely ignore site-specific impacts thanks and you know i'll get into this in in a second but i do know you know the one of the criteria is that there's at least identifications of areas within the utility service area that are height subject to heightened levels of risk um so i do i think we know there is you know some geographic specificity there um but i think that's helpful clarification that you know these are really general practices that are subject to the whole whole system and helps us you know kind of refine our thinking about it as well um jim i see you have your hand up uh yeah thanks um on the first one um about newly proposed facilities in oregon or just electric power generation i think you know all facilities should be looked at but also i think the older facilities should also be looked at and included because as we look at the power fires in california they tended to be older lines not well maintained so i think to just do it for new stuff really misses the point of the risk that we are exposed to and our need to mitigate for that so really the old stuff should almost be first because the new stuff will probably be built to the best standards thanks jim yeah and i will say that we definitely um you know want to be careful about proposing anything that's retroactively applicable um but we will definitely take that into consideration and and look at it pretty carefully okay any any other comments on this set of questions before we move on to kind of getting into some of the more specific criteria okay um so this slide sort of outlines the criteria uh was in senate bill 762 for those uh system-wide electric utility plans um i don't think everything is on here and i do do want to note that um the puc rules implementing the",

going over our two main projects that we're currently working on uh first to get an update and look at the scenarios and some of the financial metrics and a sneak peek at the co-benefits work for oregon's roadmap to after the presentation which will include some clarifying questions we will open it up for public comment the public will be welcome to comment on anything that's on our agenda or anything they want to bring before the then we'll take a short break and come back and have a commission discussion on the work that's been done specifically on the work we present and then the last agenda item is to get an update on our natural and working lands proposal project and then we'll close out the next steps so that's kind of where we're headed we close out this introduction part um i'll ask linda to remind people how they can raise their hand for public comment and to make perfect comments to the i just wanted to acknowledge the significance of the inflation reduction act that was signed into law on tuesday and the significant opportunity that it for both of the topics that we're going to be discussing today um the work because of the investments across all sectors including national and working lands that that that bill will uh that act will will have uh that and the support it'll provide to states uh towards meeting their client mitigation goals so i'm really excited to see that and i think it makes me feel more confident the work the potential to achieve the goals that we're discussing so very excited about that i wanted to um also as an update uh thank wendy who has been supporting the commission this summer as the department of energy recruited for maya's replacement and i just want to thank wendy for stepping in and really helping out i wanted to thank the department for the speed at which and the great work that the department did in recruiting maya's replacement who has joined us today zach baker is um will be helping the commission as part part of his duties and i'm just thrilled to have him uh on board to support the commission and and the department of energy more broadly alan did you want to say anything or do should i just pass it over to zach to uh introduce himself um i'll i'll let zach introduce himself but many of you know him i i'm really thrilled that zach chose to come work with us at odo he's got a great resume a lot of good experience on climate change and i think he's going to be an incredible add to to the team and i don't think we'll miss a beat when he comes gets fully up to speed so right now he's in sponge mode but he'll he's a quick learner and he'll he'll uh be helping us out quite a bit and it has already zach you want to introduce yourself a little bit yeah thanks alan thanks chairman mcdonald and hello commissioners and uh those listening in to today's meeting zachariah baker and go by zach for short really excited to be diving into this i know many of you through my previous work and can't wait to work with you in this role and uh for those who i haven't met yet i'm really looking forward to meeting and working with you i've worked in the climate and clean energy space for a while now at the local state and federal levels uh with the majority of that work in oregon most recently i was at the oregon public utility commission working on utility planning procurement and decarbonization including implementation of hpe 2021 the clean electricity bill and before that i worked for a northwest based nonprofit called climate solutions uh designing and advocating for state and local policies on climate and clean energy and in that role i had the privilege of serving on the rulemaking advisory committee for deq's climate protection and then i've also worked in the oregon legislature a staff to a state representative and served as a city councillor in fort valles oregon where i helped the city develop a climate action plan so definitely more to share uh but i'll leave my intro there for now and uh i'm really looking forward to supporting the work of the commission and um please don't hesitate to be in touch as we go and uh thanks yeah welcome zach it's really great to have someone with that diverse background so great to have you here let me just look at my notes and make um one thing i just wanted to mention i've been having challenges with my internet so if i disappear or so i can't see a slide i will it'll it'll pass soon and we can pick things back up and i appreciate understanding of that then i thought we would go ahead and take roll call and i will just go my screen and try and go down the list to um and have folks that you're here uh so representative brock smith yes here commissioner jackson directly director bateman and welcome thank you commissioner chippentower commissioner oh i don't think we could hear you cheryl we do that again we can't hear you so maybe um linda can work with you after we get through the roll call um to see if she can help you figure that i i was having trouble with that earlier today so i i understand the challenges commissioner ford i'm here good afternoon director benner i'm here nice to see everyone jumping over you guys are all jumping i'm commissioner after here good to see everybody director whitman here good afternoon everybody senator finley mr phillies president thank you commissioner patowski you are on you try to come off mute and say you're here it looks like commissioner patowski might be having some challenges as well my challenge is i didn't unmute sorry good afternoon and commissioner magnera uh present i think that concludes if i missed anybody that's on the commission i think i did so with that i will open it up to commissioners if you have updates that you want to share with the commission i would love to i'd love to hear hear those director benner yes chairman donald thank you um uh chair mcdonald asked me to share a little bit about the recent visit from us department of energy secretary jennifer granholm she was in portland on monday a week ago monday um to see some of the great things that our state is doing on climate change and some of the new technologies that we're pioneering that are going to help us with our clean energy transition so we started the at electric island the collaborative between daimler trucks and portland general electric we were joined by governor and the two senators it was a little bit of a victory lap on the inflation reduction act um but she uh the secretary got to drive one of the trucks it was pretty cool hear more about the the goals and the efforts of daimler which are pretty fantastic and and some of the work that the state is doing support that effort in the governor's remarks at the press event she mentioned the work that this commission is doing on the roadmap to 2035 and the analysis that um we talked about last time showing that uh we are that our goals are in reach um if we implement and fund the programs that are on the books and i thought she did a really good job of sort of taking a victory lap but also emphasizing the need to do the work that we say we're going to do and the importance of continuing to keep our our feet to the pedal on that one then we went south to wilsonville and visited a battery manufacturer called ess it's a long duration energy storage battery that doesn't use lithium and they are doing some really neat work there the senators were very excited about that and the potential to expand some of the work that's happening in that facility uh and then finally we went to oregon state university to see their wave technology center and learn more about the packwave project where they're actually starting to get some um well soon we'll be putting some of the wave energy devices in the water and hear about the um funding and um permitting successes they've had and there was a lot of interest from the secretary in the work that's happening at our universities so um thanks for the opportunity to share that i will just um share one other thing which is uh direct uh chair mcdonald mentioned the inflation reduction act and um that's really really exciting i just want to make sure people understand that at least for funding for energy the us department of energy has a lot of work to do to get money out the door from the the iija that is starting to come our way but you know it's it takes time um for them to sta they're having to staff up and get money out the door and then we'll have to staff up and get money out the door so i just want to make sure people understand that inflation reduction act money is great it's not coming yet it'll be um it'll be on its way you know soon but the i think one one great thing about both of those bills is that they are not um really focused on shovel-ready projects they're really focused on um supporting capacity and development and implementation of longer term plans so i oregon is very well positioned to receive a lot of funds in part due to the work that's been happening at this so i'm going to put in the um chat a link to the oregon department of energy's webpage on the infrastructure investment and jobs act which will you know update with information on the inflation reduction act as we get it but feel free to reach out if you have any questions sorry that was a long date thank you director benner that's great and i completely agree it will take time but knowing that it's a 10-year program it also provides that certainty to be able to kind of expand programs there are other updates that people commissioners want to make i'll just note that um suzanne carlson is here for representing and catherine williams is here representing northwest natural um and i don't know if uh mike is officially representing oregon department of agriculture but he's here um glad to have you join us and i'm trying to see who else might be in that same i think that might be it but um do uh catherine or suzanne do you have any updates you'd like to share kathy can you hear me this is catherine okay good sorry we've been working behind the scenes on",

        "text": " the decision making record staff would then have to keep track of that make sure they got into the record and also allow the applicant to respond to those comments we have a process that's in place right now for comments Project Specific comments there are two opportunities one is through the when the the notice intent is issued the public is given an opportunity those comments are made part of your decisionmaking record and then of course on the draft proposed order public comments Project Specific comments are made part of the record the applicant is given an opportunity to respond staff evaluates and provides you their input uh there is nothing in your rules that requires separate comments made uh comments made separately to you or comment made during the course of a public meeting one of your regular meetings that requires you to make those part of the decision making uh I want to point out that Oregon public meetings Law requires that the public be able to observe and monitor public meetings there's nothing in Oregon public meetings law that requires you to accept public comments during a meeting you have a rule FC itself has a rule that says during a public meeting you will take comments from the public uh of matters of concern except for those matters that are closed that you have indicated in the notice are closed to public comments so the practice has been once a matter goes into contested case we indicate in the notice you're no longer accepting comments on that matter even during a public meeting we haven't done that uh for matters that are just open that for projects for which there's an application but have yet to go to public comment people can come in and provide comments on those projects the question is whether or not those comments are made part of the decisionmaking record meaning the record that the staff considers when they're preparing a d and that you ultimately consider when you're making your decision M there's nothing that would require you to make such comments that are that are made during one of these meetings that are made separately to you part of that decision-making record and as I mentioned just a moment ago it would be problematic to do so from a fairness standpoint for the applicant and from an administrative standpoint for staff thank you record um so just question from The public's point of view um what then is the purpose it's not part of the record uh what's the purpose of the public com a portal provide public or I guess it's unclear to me take a step sure um so for the than you counc I think I want to make sure that we're talking about the same thing so there is public comment period during a council meeting that's where you know outside of a contested case looking for right information it's a public meeting you notice public meeting taking minutes we recording it um something comes in we notify an applicant certificate holder hey we got a public comment on your project you might want to be aware of this that's different than the public comment portal and the two comment time frames associated with an active project Patrick just talked about at the notice of intent stage at the dra propos order stage we have specific timelines we send out the notice we indicate what the time frame is within which to provide comment and the methods by which to provide comment which also includes the public comment for that is only active for a project during those time frames people can't go to the public comment portal and simply provide a public comment on a project that's not an opportunity there is they have to go into the public comment portal choose the project and then comment on that project if project is out not within a public comment period there is no way to provide comment on the portal for that project okay um sorry I just make sure I understand this so if I I have a comment to make on a project that and I'm coming through the portal I choose to make my comment is that part of is that comment part of okay so when we when we provide notice there's an open public comment period really people can provide comment in many different ways they can send us an email they can mail us a physical copy of their comments they can go into the public comment portal they can provide a fact they can show up at any kind of public hearing associated with that and provide oral comments there's numerous ways that people can provide comments but outside of that comment period before it starts and after it ends those they're all the same you can't provide comment I mean they might they might submit comments two days before or two days after that's not a public comment associated with that comment period so the public comment portal you know activates and deactivates during that time frame somebody can always submit a handwritten letter to us afterward and we're going to say that's not part of the decision record as Patrick was talking about because that was submitted outside of the public comment and is the public aware of that like is there respon very we try to be very explicit that your time frame to submit comments during the notice of intent period during the draft proposed order are within these dates and here are the ways within which you can provide comment right but so if somebody does provide comment and you know not familiar with the timing um and they provide comment that it's not it's outside of the period do they receive a response that says I'm sorry you know thank you yeah we the so at the last meeting we talked about the the various comments that came in we have responded to all of those um people letting them know that you know submitted your comments outside of a public comment time frame we've provided these to the um we provided these to all council members however you're not consider part of record please let us know if you would like to have a conversation so we can help you better understand how our process works how to work within it um what to look at how to participate all of those things thank you council member so just to confus if somebody comes and Prov public comments clearly on the agenda saying won't take public comments on these projects because the record is closed but there's probably that gray area between when the comment period on the notice inent closes before the draft order issued and another period St where somebody put conceivably come offer comments on the project and still in the process those comments would not be part of the decision record but there could be an opportunity for that individual to come under public during public and that would be part of Rec so even though we hear testimony um dur the public comment period on a particular project not part of the decision record unless it's prescri period That's thank you looking at the screen council member counc CH everybody did there thumbs counc com thank you for providing such Clarity I apprciate um and the last update uh is bway amendment number one um and The Challenge on the denial the cont case I'll turn that over to Mr you an update last month uh that in that matter was uh filed in Union County Circuit Court and that we intended to we had filed a motion to transfer to the Supreme Court that motion has been denied so for now it stays in Union counc Circuit bu um just a quick question we um got the link to the Supreme Court on the project any IDE decision there I can't remember the time they had to decide yeah theet um the Supreme Court has six months within which two reach its final decision and I believe that time of filing or is that the time of uh six months from when the petition was petition for review was filed right now I can't recall my head when that petition was filed I want to say was wrong early theal arum was January right so it might it might have been early December right it might have been early December probably ability is a reminder the Forman Hemingway project um you know which was quite voluminous and complex they issued their final decision in four months so I that means they issue this decision you know in less than six months but um I think again going back to how our process works is you know that it gets refined along the way from the notice of intent to the draft proposed order you know all the way through contested case in the final order that there is a good clear clean record that's the design that the Supreme Court then has all of that information um that's well articulated and that's the design is to allow them to be able to have all that information with which to make a relatively decision thank you um Nancy can you forward the slide please okay see that um very well so uh you know it's not every council meeting but when there is some incident or significant compliance activity provide you that update so we did receive uh earlier this month from the big low Canyon Wind Farm a incident notification so they um found a broken bearing blade bearing bolt at the base of a particular wind turbine and um they notified us within the time frame after the incident so that was spond um they tested all the bolts on that particular wind turbine they all passed and just as a reminder this was an issue where we've had you know elements with the big cany wind farm wind turbin um we had other issues with bolts and and other things falling off the wind turs um but they currently have a monitoring protocol which on an annual basis they will go out and check all the these same FS on every single winter so you know in this case you know not afraid that the B fell down but you know what are the what are the followup activities and that's I think Where It's always important what do we do now they already have a protocol place um is it was previously every four years now it's every year so we concluded that there is no additional followup that's needed they recorded it timely they already have an annual protocol for testing those so for us that was sufficient to to move forward and conclude this incident okay moving on to we are currently in the short legislative session so uh we talked previously about three bills that relate to the energy facility sighting Council House Bill 415 um that proposes to add a definition of battery energy storage systems in fex definitions so as you recall we have numerous projects where the council has reviewed uh and approved battery storage but those are in conjunction with a wind or Soler or natural gas facility um so they're not by themselves so currently there is no definition of battery energy storage whether it's in FX statutes or when in conservation development commission statutes or anywhere we know there needs to be you know a lot more battery storage systems out there and the market is such that we're going",

        "text": "good morning and thank you for joining us i think we're just going to give it a couple more minutes to let people uh join us and we'll be starting shortly thank you for your patience good morning everyone and thank you for uh we'll we'll just start right now and i want to pass this to our agency director jeanne benner to welcome you good morning everyone can you hear me all right michael can you give me a thumbs up yep okay thanks um well i just want to kick off the meeting this morning by saying thank you we really appreciate you spending time with us here this morning to talk about how the department of energy can help wildfire survivors with energy and we hope that you'll be willing to share your thoughts with us on how we can design a program that will work well for survivors as michael said my name is janine benner and i'm the director of the department of energy in oregon and on the line with us today are a number of my colleagues from the department so michael freels is leading our efforts to design and launch the program christy split heads up our government relations work and she'll be monitoring and facilitating the q a on this call and andy cameron heads up our energy efficiency and conservation team we've got a number of other folks on the line to take notes and help answer and i think we are also going to be joined this morning by andy boulton who's an analyst at the building codes division who will also share a bit about his agency's efforts are on wildfire recovery oh there's andy thanks for joining us andy so we're hoping to have an interactive meeting this morning with lots of questions and feedback from attendees and michael will walk you through how to engage with us on that shortly and i also want to make sure that you are aware that this meeting is being next slide please michael so before we jump into the meeting i do want to take a minute and just let you know about the oregon department of energy for those of you who aren't and what you see on the screen now is our vision our mission and how we achieve that mission so at the oregon department of energy we help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable energy system we advance solutions to shape an equitable clean energy transition protect the environment and public health and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for current and future providing support for wildfire survivors to rebuild in a way that saves them energy and money will contribute towards a safe equitable clean and sustainable and it's our hope that this program can help make life at least a little bit easier for survivors in terms of energy efficiency and i'm personally glad that the department of energy can play a small role in the recovery so now i will turn it over to michael to give you a sense of the agenda for today's meeting and how you can engage in the conversation thank you good morning okay so today we've got a stacked agenda so we'll be using our webex platform and so we're going to take a couple of minutes to kind of talk about the logistics and how to properly use the webex platform because we certainly we're here to listen to everybody we want every everybody to be able to engage um and so then we'll talk about kind of our schedule of the meetings this meeting previously previous meetings we've had and some future meetings that we'd like people to attend and we'll talk through our wildfire recovery legislation what's brought us here for this discussion and kind of our initial ideas and plans vision for what a program might look like but we're certainly still fielding feedback and want to hear from everyone to help us with the program and as janine pointed out we've got andy bolton here to talk about dcps's wildfire hardening program which is a great program that's going to be aligned with what we're offering and we'll walk through what that looks like but hopefully we'll have quite a bit of time at the end kind of an open forum we've got a lot of great questions for this group but please don't feel limited by our questions we'd love to hear your questions or general feedback and how rebuilding is going for you uh thoughts you have about kind of our program design and and just uh we'd love to hear about your experiences and janine pointed out that this is being recorded and it will be available online afterwards and previous meetings we've had are available uh online as well so here is a screenshot of what webex looks like hopefully this looks very similar to what you see right now and please notice you can see who the panelists are in the upper right and that you can raise your hand so right now we we are doing an event where everyone's muted at this time so we can kind of talk but if you have something to say please raise your hand and uh christy will call on you and we'll we'll hear what you have to say if you have a question or a statement or anything you'd like to kind of contribute to the conversation we certainly want to encourage that we're here to listen uh so q and a as as janine pointed out we've got over to the right we've got a q a function where you can write questions within the group please send it to everybody so we can all see the questions and and bring those up within the discussion and talk through with them if it's more comfortable for you instead of raising your hand and speaking to put something in the q a that's great we'd love to hear from you that way we also we'll talk about in a little bit we also have a public comment portal this is another opportunity for you to offer feedback and so there's a lot of different means to to provide feedback on this process and we'd love to hear from you so this is one of a series of community obviously we had wildfires all over the state and so we want to have some regional meetings to talk to everyone so last week we talked to the oregon coastal area and mckinsey river lane county area obviously right now we're talking the san diego county marion county area later this week we're going to talk to talk to southern oregon but also please don't feel limited by that if you know somebody a community member who's really interested in this stuff and and couldn't make this meeting please come to our our southern oregon meeting it's not going to be limited uh by just people from southern oregon we'd love to have you all these kind of community meetings will uh will feed a final kind of rulemaking meeting that we'll have at the end on uh november 9th so we at that point we'd love to kind of talk through here's what we've heard from everybody here's we're thinking of some initial kind of rule making rules around what we're going to design and uh and it's an opportunity to provide feedback again if we misheard something if you want to reiterate some feedback or you weren't able to attend some of the earlier meetings that's a great one to attend as well so there's lots of opportunity to provide feedback and if you see in that lower right we have a little link there for our public comment portal and so we'll we'll talk about that then and we actually put that in the q a if people if it's easier for people to get that link that way so the reason we're here unfortunately in 2020 there were 21 fires across the high winds a variety of different factors led to some destructive wildfires we lost over a million acres of of land and over 5000 structures were destroyed in oregon unfortunately so in the 2021 legislature some uh some bills were or enacted in order to help with that wildfire recovery uh during the meeting today we're really hoping to listen to people and hear about the recovery efforts as obviously we're focused on san diego canyon the mary county area we'd love to hear everyone's experiences with that and what they've experienced and and what they've heard and how the recovery efforts are going because that will certainly inform what we want to design and how we can help people as best we christy can you talk a little bit about the legislation i sure can good morning so in response to the wildfires that happened in 2020 the oregon legislature got to work and that includes legislators representing the cnem canyon and legislators throughout the state working together to figure out how to respond so that the state could support recovery efforts and it's not and while it's to support individuals it's also meant to support rebuilding communities and in that vein house bill 2289 was put together which was essentially intended to streamline the rebuilding process to make it easier in a variety of different ways for people to rebuild their homes or for homes to rebuild where ones had burned down during the fires and that also included commercial structures not just homes and also addressed manufactured homes as you may know many of the homes lost at many of the locations for manufactured homes and so that bill was put together by a big work group of folks and one of the things they decided to do was to take a look at oregon's energy code or um building code and oregon has a um a building code that has standards for energy efficiency and we have through the years increased energy efficiency in new construction at an incremental level right and so if you had an older home that was lost during the fires your home would not have been as energy efficient as a home built now however there was concern that building to the new code would make things more expensive than it would be to rebuild the exact same existing structure and so there was a decision made to allow folks under house bill 2289 to rebuild structures at the code the building code that was in place in 2008 and so with that move made there was also a conversation at that same table to figure out well how could we incentivize people to build to the current code so that their new homes would be as efficient as other new homes we know this saves people money on their bills in the long run and it's better for the environment and so there's a win-win there so the decision was made that perhaps there could be an incentive program at the oregon department of uh that would support rebuilding and what happened is um the bill house bill 2289 did not contain that provision but at the very end of session there's always a bill that passes we call it the christmas tree bill at the capitol and it includes",

        "text": " would see on the side of the road there will be many of these kind of stacked up next to each other and the reason we have elected to pursue the the battery proposal is many folks have no renewable energy the wind doesn't always blow the solar is not always shining sun's not always shining this will allow us to deploy energy you know in the evenings or in the night time when it when it may be next slide please just a quick overview of some of the other components of a facility this i like this picture it's a wind farm in illinois that we recently i mentioned the two blue dots earlier the project substations on the bottom portion of this slide of the picture you'll see that's a single substation all of our electricity is is consolidated via underground wires which will all go into a big substation that looks like what you see here and then the voltage of of our electricity is stepped up to a higher voltage and will leave the site on an power line and you can kind of see that overhead power line leaving that substation on the right hand side of the picture it will be a similar concept on this site in the background is our operations and maintenance building which is where we'll have offices we'll have um you know maintenance shed and that's where all of our technicians will be based i think we've got a number of acreages listed on this on this slide that's kind of our expected worst case impact i think it's important to note that if you look at the the disturbed area within the square around our o m building in our substation that's actually a 10 acre parcel for all of those components we will undoubtedly take up more room for this project it's a bigger project but um you know it is a fairly compact footprint in terms of where are where where our local headquarters will you can see some of the turbines in the background with the permanent roads in in white as well as the temporary impacts around each turbine but this just lists a number of um a number of stats that will be associated in terms of access roads and um we'll also have some some new meteorological towers on site right now we actually have five temporary towers that you'll be able to see if you were to drive around the area those will come down after construction and we will put up three permanent towers to measure the wind if the project is built uh we'll also have a temporary construction yard that will be upwards of 27 acres that's where when our components are brought to site they will be staged there and then be delivered to the to the pads where they're installed next slide please on the transmission line i mentioned earlier you know there's the the uec option which was the red line heading west the bpa option which was the blue line heading north this gives a little bit of detail around it we have not finalized design on what it will look like the project is currently being studied by um by bonneville power administration to connect to the stanfield substation we expect to have results back from them in july of this year connection will require a five mile overhead line it will follow the existing bpa line that there's actually a bpa line that goes through the site right now that was one of the reasons why the site was chosen and so um we would we will need to build a new line next to that bpa line to get to a new newly constructed stanfield substation so that is the lower impact option the five mile option um bpa transmission line the the uec or umatilla electric co-op line is a much larger line it's a 25 mile line you could um skip to the next slide this provides a good uh this is a very busy slide so apologies for all of the uh all the colors but the uec line is the line that you see it's a bit of a squiggly line headed uh north and west we did not choose that squiggly line it's not obviously not the straightest line but it i think that the the key item to flag on this is that we will be following the existing uec lines that that are already there and so in discussions with uec we would take their existing lines and put new power poles on that same side of the street that they're already on they'll be taller poles power lines will go on top of the poles the existing uec lines will go we call it underbuilt on those lines uh we've done this on projects in illinois and while design is not finalized because of that that the wires have to be taller i'm sorry the poles have to be taller when we study uh this corridor you'll notice it's a pretty wide corridor ubc's right away is typically about 100 feet uh we've studied about 300 feet so if you go through the maps on the project you'll see that you know we've looked at both sides of the road and the reason for that is when these taller poles get they're laid down on their side we actually have to study you know the temporary impacts of a of working on both sides of the corridor but the intent for uec is to construct the line within their existing right away where the polls already are next slide please in terms of the the local economic impact so this is uh all assuming that the entire project gets built so if a smaller project ultimately gets built these these dollar values would come down but we do expect to pay upwards of 100 million dollars to umatilla county that would be done through the strategic investment program agreement which the county already has a number of agreements with existing wind farms it would be a similar structure to that that we will be working with the county so it's a pretty large taxpayer within the region i think that the biggest economic stimulus you'll see down the the fifth bullet it's you know we are estimating this will be about an 800 million dollar project if inflation continues the way that it has it will likely be higher than that but it's it's a pretty sizable investment um it also has a pretty large construction workforce you'll note here 400 workers on site at its peak with 450 000 person hours for once the project's up and running you know it's less of an economic impact in terms of permanent employment it has anywhere from 8 to 12 employees typically we have one wind technician for every 10 so all 112 turbines get built we would have 11 technicians plus some oversight staff so but it's in the in 8 to 12 um in terms of the permanent employees i think you know the last bullet on here is is you know part of that um you know capital power i should have mentioned this earlier like we do own and operate our projects we're publicly traded company you know we when we build a project our full intent is to own and operate it we invest in our communities and last year alone we invested almost 1.9 million dollars a picture here of a local fire department in texas where you know donations like that are very important to us and you know the folks that are directly impacted by a project in their community we like to give back where we can next slide please so this slide you know there's a quick summary of some of the engagement that done over the years you know as part of that noi that came out in 2017 we've we've engaged with a number of different agencies across the state state serving a variety of different purposes i think this is you know just this is not an exhaustive list but i think the key item here is as we've talked to these folks there's been additional studies and that we've had to do throughout the site and so if you could skip to the next slide this is a list of all the different analyses that have been done again not an exhaustive list but we've got folks on the line here that can attest that this project has been well vetted in terms of you know environmental impacts and and cultural impacts we've done lots and lots of surveys whether it's habitat surveys avian surveys wildlife surveys we've looked for a lot of washington ground squirrel habitat it's a very dry area but we've been able to avoid wetlands and waters visual noise analysis anytime you have a wind farm that's a very important analysis to be done uh we will meet all the standards required for that and then obviously the the avian surveys and eagle use surveys if we go back to earth if you recall from that prior slide at the very beginning where there's a southern portion of the site in the northern portion of the site there is uh alkali canyon goes right through the middle of the site and we've established a setback to ensure kind of minimal impacts to those those folks let's get to the next slide this is a kind of high level overview of of you know the results of all these studies is that we've redid that redesigned the site to minimize these impacts so we've avoided wetlands and waters we've avoided impacts to washington ground squirrel colonies we i mentioned that step back to the alkali canyon which was requested by odfw avoided or minimized sagebrush habitat impacts as well as that collision risk setback of our turbines from um kind of the hunting grounds in the canyon i think the last bullet on here relates to the habitat mitigation plan that has been approved by odfw the details of that will be finalized once the design is finalized so once we choose kind of uh what size turbine we will ultimately use and whether we'll build those 112 turbines or something less than that ultimately a mitigation plan will be will be implemented to address any impacts that our project has next slide please so additional impact assessments that were done relates to cultural resources not only identified sites that are outlined within our application but indirect impacts such as visual or there there's some sensitive sites and cultural sites around the product that we've worked with shippo to um to minimize decommissioning um there will be a decommissioning bond or letter of credit that will be posted to account for the cleanup of the project when the useful life is over we generally plan for 30 years on the on the wind farm upwards of 35 or 40 on the on the solar facility but a bond will be posted to when the site is reached the end of its useful life we will uh there will be funds available to clean it up and finally on the on the sounds you know we will comply with the oregon noise route noise rule uh regardless of the",

of the dotted line area ensures isolation from the grid and that's to ensure the safety of emergency crews working on local power lines lines during a power outage so now that the program is nearly up and the agency started to hire staff that will run the program from here pandian krishnaswami is on the line and is our energy services manager and james kogel has been leading the work on the program nuts and bolts and we'll take things from here yes my name is james cogell i'm a policy analyst for the program um so the program will provide grants for planning and constructing renewable energy and energy resilience projects uh opportunity announcements were posted on march 7th uh there are four of them one for each of the project categories 12 million dollars was made available between the four opportunity announcements uh more opportunity announcements will be announced after this round closes with additional funds online applications will open shortly we will only be accepting applications through the online application next slide please opportunity announcements outline the minimum required information for a complete application as well as detailing how applications will be scored during the review process this includes required information about the project the applicant and partners and consultation with different stakeholders and groups following a review of applications to make sure they contain all the required information and are eligible for the program the applications will undergo a competitive review process assessing the strength of the project and its feasibility as well as how the project meets the program's priorities and benefits the scoring criteria includes topics such as project leadership involvement of environmental justice jobs and economic development direct energy cost savings families and small businesses inclusion of inclusive hiring and promotion policies procurement of services from disadvantaged businesses assisting with natural health and mitigation plans and geographic and project diversity the grants will be reported on a competitive basis at this point we don't know how many grants will be awarded and how the funding will be distributed across the four categories how the funding will be distributed will depend on the number and strength of applications in the different buckets along with the required funding allocations stated in legislation next slide please so uh the online application is still being finalized and expected to be available uh shortly uh you will be able to access it from the community renewable energy grant program web page um the red arrow kind of indicates where it'll be when it's available next slide please if you're familiar with odo's custom service portal you'll also be able to access it here by selecting the financial incentive drop down menu and uh selecting community renewable energy grant program next time please you get the application uh you'll be able to apply for a planning and construction grant change information and withdraw an application using the drop down menu next step please after that uh if you haven't already you'll be asked to sign in uh if this is your first time accessing the customer portal you need to register and create a profile as well next slide please so once you start an application you'll be given information about the eligibility requirements for the program and asked to confirm whether or not you and the project meet these requirements next slide please and then uh it kind of just flows into the application itself you'll be asked for details about uh the applicant organization next slide please and there'll also be opportunity to provide contact details for uh an uh which will be the person odo uh which is out to contact with any communications about the application and any questions that we might have uh you'll also be asked about if you're partnering with any organizations next slide please and you'll be able to input information about project partners i'd require documents relating to the project partners in the application portal similarly if you're working with a contractor you'll be able to put their information on a subsequent page next slide please as you go through the application portal you will then be prompted to provide information about the project details of what information will be asked can be found in the opportunity before you submit you'll be able to review the document submitted and you can click back through the application to check information that has been next slide please so once you've submitted your application uh this kind of chat shows the process our process with applicants um if you have questions about the opportunity announcements please submit them by may 20th this will allow staff to respond and post answers online before they close the application on june 10th following the close of the application applications will be reviewed after which the successful projects will be offered a performance agreement while unsuccessful projects will be able to reapply in future opportunity applicants will be able to request up to 30 of the grant funding upon signing a performance agreement for the construction grants the applicant must have taken meaningful steps to seek side control filed the request for interconnection with a host utility or appropriate transmission provider and met any other requirements provided by the department in the performance agreement to be eligible to receive that 30 following the signing of the performance next slide please and so thanks for uh taking the time to hear about the program um we'll be happy to hear any questions you have regret regarding it and if there's any specific information you would like more detail on please let us know thanks james and one thing i wanted to do to kind of kick us off while folks formulate their questions raise their hands um put things in the chat was just about the role of utilities when they're not applicants but are working with and um i'm i think rob and james know this i'm rusty i just got back from being on vacation so uh everyone i just want to make sure everybody knows that to start with so in case i make any horrible mistakes or anything just blame florida my dad moved there and it's way too distracting there but um but um could you maybe just riff on that like what the role like there are requirements by applicants to work with utilities um could either one of you speak to that and then talk a little bit um how you could imagine utilities supporting community applications you want me to go through some of the requirements rob and then you can maybe speak to um how some of that relationship can develop yeah that sounds good um so applicants one of the requirements in uh the processes applicants will need to consult with um the utility uh that kind of is the host utility um kind of we'll need to seek information on the impacts on to the existing utility infrastructure as well as the estimated costs of interconnection so and we're going to want to get this information so we can assess the feasibility of the projects and so quite often they might be asking for a letter from the utility to kind of demonstrate they've taken that step in consulting with uh the utility and that's going to be for both planning and the construction grants and the level of detail obviously you'll differ um because they'll have different information for a construction grant might be more details you'll be able to provide a bit more uh information in the letter but for those planning grants it might be a a little broader broader brush um and then also successful applicants um may be seeking to um file a request for instant connection um early on in that process and that because that's one of the triggers to allowing them to get that 30 percent uh upfront grant funding um in the uh once they signed the performance agreement rob do you want to continue on sure yeah um and and as christie said that the reference to consulting with the electric utility is in the bill and essentially it recognizes that all of these are complicated electrical systems that are interconnecting with grid infrastructure and all of them will require interconnection agreements and so you know consultation with the utility is part of all of these projects but kind of backing up one step we also see that there is an opportunity one for utilities to develop their own projects and in some cases they might look like some of the community solar projects that we've already seen around the state and i know that there are there's at least one of those that's being considered for the program where it would be a consumer-owned utility starting a community solar project but also just a way to pass a potentially very valuable service onto your members if you're aware of any of your members that may have a that they want to develop this is a great time to do it if it has these community attributes or some you know energy resilience attributes or serves an community within your service territory this is a great time to come in and get some funding for these projects and so we're really hoping that it's seen in that light that it's an opportunity to essentially convey this benefit to your members if you're aware of projects and i think i'll leave it there unless there's any other thoughts from christie or james i think that sounds really helpful and i i think that gail malcolm who represented cous at the table when we were developing this program was really instrumental in us thinking through the role of utilities and just want to give give her a shout out charlie tracy you have your hand up do you want to go ahead and ask your first your question um you should be off or maybe you took your hand down i'm not no question well keith has his hand up can patricia can you take keith off me okay keith you should be good chrissy can you hear me okay yes we can thank you okay thank you hey um we're working with uh bonneville environmental foundation on a possible project out here in forest grove that would involve um upwards up to about 400 kw of community solar but our project would involve us um taking all the production credits and pushing them back into our low-income uh assistance program serving all of our customers that qualify for that program would that uh under the direction you have now would that qualify for as part of the this grant funding for direct energy cost savings to our families and small businesses from that language does that seem like that would rob um yeah definitely so the eligibility requirements are are pretty straightforward that there's technology eligibility and that has to essentially just be a renewable energy technology so 400 kilowatts of solar apply without question or would be eligible without question and then the the other eligibility requirement has to do with the actual applicant and so as long as the applicant was either you as the utility or some other public body that would make the applicant eligible and the way in which the benefits flow back to low-income members of the community would help it to score points",

        "text": " which that combined is actually uh unit one and then sickle two which is the unit two each of the units has separate llc's limited liability corporations as the site certificate holder but both are owned by the same parent company nextera energy Resources LLC the event SQL unit which is the unit 2 is currently being repowered with new blades and the cells consistent with the council's approval of amendment number seven in July this year the amendment determination request proposes the Wind Facility components within the Van Sickle unit be reassigned from the current site certificate Builder which is FPL energy state line 2 Incorporated to then signal2 wind LLC without requiring an amendment because nextera energy Resources LLC which the parent company will continue to retain control of both of the units in this case the particularly event signal to unit so Oregon administrative rule requires that a site certificate Trend required a safe certificate transfer if there has been a change in ownership possession or control of the facility or the certificate holder reporting to the subscript holder and his parent company there will be no such change because while the assets will be assigned to a new LLC and the new LLC will become the certificate holder the parent company will retain ownership possession and control of the project and the certificate holder So based on a review of this rule the circumstances associated with the reassignment of the unit from one LLC to another and the written verification that nextera energy Resources LLC will continue to retain control of the encyclical unit the department agreed with the certificate holder and concluded on October 27 yesterday that an amendment was not required so this determination with sound via currency email through our click Dimensions email system okay you can sign up to receive that and it was also forwarded to council members yesterday so also importantly per our administrative rule 345 zero two seven zero three five seven sub six at the request of any member of the energy facilities fighting Council the Department's determination must be referred to the council for concurrence modification or rejection so just as a there are two types of two general types of amendment determination plus the type A type B the type A type B only the certificate holder can request that be brought to council if they disagree with the Department's determination so for this type it is essentially you know at the uh well certificate holder could do it as well but it's the uh if the council believes that they will remove you you know the determination of the department you may do that and so if you do want to have this brought up to the full Council please let us know within you know probably early next week and then we would add that to the November yes Cindy um thank you chair girl um Cindy Condon um so I got the email last night squared away and so I appreciate you um forwarding that I I guess I would like to look a little bit more injured or have the department look into it with respect to the you know once again we're uh considering the parent company as the ultimate responsibility but I don't see that in the you know does the security Interest come from the parent company or the LLC and so I'm somewhat unusing with that so I guess I might that patterns feel comfortable kind of responding to that the security instrument is going to be updated but it will name the new LLC team of the assets have been assigned but I haven't seen it but I know that that is in the works City plan and again and I guess in in my mind that it is the LLC not the parent that we should be relying on for their financial capability the financial statements for them do we have a comfort letter for the LLC not for the parent company I think of them as very different entities and I know I've mentioned that before so a solar country uh for record talk Hornet so just for playing that out uh not comfortable in would you like us to bring this to Council in November so that you can evaluate your career disagree uh with the determination or would you just like a little more information before you meet that would be a little bit more time to look at it um and I just didn't have time last night I wrote some more conversation sure um with respect to the what what are the uh aware of the jobs uh where are they connect and right now I just don't I see Dexter as the parent that's fine but if they're not doing this site certificate holder they're nowhere else in the mess really the result uh and just from a practical um so the November council meeting is the 17th and 18th um and so because that is earlier in the month because of the Thanksgiving holiday uh next Friday is the date deadline for the first round packets so um if you wanted to have this brought up to full Council uh I did say November um we we may be able to do that but it also may need to go to December because again we're on a shorter time frame uh for the next chance so again but that doesn't mean that you know you shouldn't uh request you know that evaluation but I just wanted to correct it so okay for the record this is Marcy so is it I I think I understand what Cindy's asking but is it even something like if you got to delegate Patrick but if there were something that you could identify answer what you're saying it may not be needed it also is that what we're looking at is that you're going to look and double check to make sure to be able to answer and maybe we're looking at a placeholder and if more information is needed then we'd say in December so everybody could do their full parts that yeah that's good um so I think before we don't need to do it on the record today but before um you know you leave today I think maybe we should have a conversation and I could write down like your specific questions so that we can then look into those and see if after we respond you're comfortable with then stats termination or if you're not in which case then we will put it on either the November or the December Council agenda does that mean yeah yeah thank you yeah I think that's sensible for the record this is Marcy and I I can't help remember to talk about it at these things seem to happen in this business and with all one on the world it's likely to continue to happen can at least get some parameters and understand up front now I'll say that's all later thank you thank you next on my list is the Nolan Hills project and specifically related to the contested case so following council's review of the Nolan Hills wind power project at its July council meeting the department issued the proposed order taking into account all comments that were submitted on the record of the draft post order during that time frame uh during the time frame to a request to participate in a contested case the council appointed hearing officer received such a request from Umatilla County who did not agree with the conclusion in the proposed order related to new Attila County's two-mile setback requirement between wind turbines and Residences essentially the determination was that it was not applicable substance criteria because it was not required by the language goals but they disagreed with that and that's essentially what their request to participate in a contested cases about so I can recall in the applicant's application they asserted that the setback requirement was not a political substance criteria So based upon the applicant's assertion the department evaluated that came to the same conclusion agreed with them in the draft proposed order and then during the DPO hearing Council also agreed with that on the record are they you know this is Hannah are they the only yes for the party yeah David McCartney um so that's the that's the nature of the contested case and then on October 14th the uh Council appointing hearing officer King Triana provided a status update email to um I forwarded that email to Council on that same day the 14th uh in summary the email stated that she anticipates providing written updates to the Council on this matter honor about the 15th of each month uh through the course of the contestant case proceeding or on an as needed basis and then on September 12th she issued the notice of petitions to request the party status the order scheduling and pre-hearing Conference and pre-rehearing conference agenda then October on October 5th 2022 the petitioner you mentioned the county the applicant and the Oregon Department of energy all through legal counsel participated in a telephonic free hearing conference regarding the petition on party status and she will be issuing an order on that petition for party status uh and and the contested case issues as soon as practically we think that's maybe the next step is yeah the order on she didn't State and win okay I would think we'd see it even before December okay yeah first let's say these are the parties these are the issues then we'll have a pre-hearing conference uh to talk about just how the contests saw proceed and eventually that will result in case so we'll keep Council up to date or she will keep Council up to date through us on the status of the investigation my recollection is that when we did the contested case on b2h we had got limited parties came we had to agree to the limited so will that Will Herb worker come back to us for approval possibly uh I believe that was because people were challenging right and so whether or not their issue was included or whether they were limited parties or not so that was raised so um similarly you know depending upon her determination even until the county would uh bring that to council if they but uh it's more likely we're just gonna agree it's probably you know I don't want to presuppose anything but because it's really one issue one party um it's probably not nearly the the complexity that department having by right so it's possible but I would say a lot less likely I I would agree that there's they actually raised two issues the other issue that they raised was uh the they had commented on the DPO that Council should require the applicant to get a contingent conditional use permit in the proposed order the department did include a requirement saying you have to get a cup from the county uh during the pre-sering conference the County's attorney uh stated that they interpret the requirement to get a cup product differently than how we interpret it which is the cup would include the setback requirements so it's if you however the hearing officer results the first issue should take care of that second",

        "text": " one of the big takeaways from this we have this TR tremendous resource for use in Oregon standard 100 has a tremendous amount of content that is very useful for imple implementing a BPS but you we can't just adopt it as is it really has to be adapted to align with both the realities and the needs of Oregon and we'll pause once again for any questions I will stop presenting so that I can actually see Blake are there any that you would like I'm just now looking at them so I want to see if there's any that need my attention I so I maybe not specific to your presentation but about ashray standard 2024 will there be a link on our website for a copy of the standard and I think I saw another question about um so ashray does offer their standards for a free readon version but I actually noticed that the most recent version of standard 100 is the 2018 version up on their read only so I would expect that it'll be up on their website on their free rate only um the newest version sometime soon I I don't know exactly when I don't know the timing either um however I do know that it is complete so it is in publication version I mean we are in 2024 so this is actually a case where uh the version of a standard is available in the year that is is in its title um I know that full versions of them are out there but they are under restricted use right now so I am a non-voting member of the committee that works on standard 100 so I have one and I am not allowed to share it uh but it will be an important piece that we'll make sure that the people who are working on the adaptation of standard 100 have access to to the content so that we can effectively use it and then yeah and then I'll mention too so as we go through our rule making process we'll be integrating our um our organ specific requirements into the standard 100 100 language so like those sections of 100 as we work on them will be part of our rule review and then after we're done with our rules and we have the integrated Oregon version that takes standard 100 and modifies it for Oregon um and come up with you know that complete package that complete document that will be available on our website for download for the Oregon integrated version of it for free but you know that'll only be complete after we're done with our rules so like the Oregon version of standard 100 will be there free at the end of our so that's it yeah for me so yeah feel free to continue Sean I don't think I see any other questions in there now oh I do see so Washington State posted a copy on their website during the ru making I I'll have to see I know we have a licensing agreement with ashray for it I I can definitely ask to see if that's something that's possible under our under our licensing agreement I don't want to uh you know proom promise anything if that's something that actually wouldn't be okay with our with our agreement but I I can definitely look into and there was a question about um five 0000001 and my understanding is that is a a good way to think about that would be an international version of um standard 100 or not I I don't want to give the the the impression that it's like an adapted version of standard 100 but it's a it's like standard 100 in it purpose but it's from a more perspective um Sean do you have additional slides to go through or are we kind of at the question and answer no we we really wanted to keep this high level as an introduction for people to the standard and not overwhelm them with a lot of details so as as we move through this process we of course always are going to to welcome questions and so we can move on to our next item okay great um okay yeah so the the last item on really on the agenda is just kind of closing and next steps and opportunity for Q&amp;A and I've gone through the um you I've tried to go through some of the questions that were asked during my portion and answer those um so hopefully if you asked a question I know it's a little bit clunky in the chat to see like the the question answer but I tried to list the question first and then provide an answer to it um as I went through but I don't think I got to everything yet so I I'll kind of just try to scan through here and um and see if there are any uh I guess I see one here so for state agencies that own buildings we already do much of this for buildings over 5,000 square feet VI the seed program with the annual seed report so this is for state buildings only cover this there will there will be additional reporting requirement um so we do have um what we do recognize that with building performance standards a lot of what's required through BPS is already being done at the state level we are um closely looking at opportunities to consolidate that effort so that state agencies don't need to like double report and uh reduce we want to reduce the amount of duplicate uh work required um so yeah we're we're really looking into streamlining that maybe reducing the State Building um seed report activities if they're covered buildings under under the BPS you know for some of those buildings that are under the BPS threshold but over what we typically track through state agency usage 5,000 square feet and above we'll probably still want to keep tracking those but I think there's an opportunity to to consolidate for um let's see just scanning through if there's any questions um that I haven't answered yet uh I'll kind of go back up to the top there's a question about um where will the rfps be listed so those would be listed on um organ buys once they're once they're posted if you've signed up to receive notifications from the state procurement system organ buys that's where they'll be listed um are we still adding to the ru making advisory committee um the committee for the tier one buildings is is set um but we do want to get input on the tier two uh R making advisory committee and just a note too you know if you're if you're not on the rle making advisory committee for tier one buildings um and the ru making that we're doing this year um you know not just tier one but all the ru making we're doing this year um but still wanted to monitor that rack activity those will be open to the public too um and there's definitely the opportunity to comment we don't want to um certainly don't want to limit input on our rul making to just the members of the of the committee it's open to you know we'll consider just as as much members that aren't on the committee um there's a question about every state agency is under order from the governor under executive order 2004 to exercise any and all authority and discretion to reduce greenhouse gas pollution by 80% below 1990 Levels by 2050 how will oo prioritize decisions in the rulem to ensure this program follows that order um so yeah I think this question kind of goes back to what I was covering at the beginning of the um of the presentation where programs like building performance standards are um you know policies that help address like one component of State energy use and St and achieving that goal so when we look at all of the different policies to help us get to that goal of 80% reduction below 1990 levels like you look at um like the clean electricity requirements um deq's climate Protection Program our energy codes energy Appliance standards um clean fuels Transportation like what impact will or what effect will each of those programs have on our state energy um and greenhouse gas emissions um you know then you have to consider what else is needed to help us get to the goals so building performance standards was really the the policy that kind of rose to the top for existing buildings to to cover existing buildings component of our Statewide greenhous gas emissions to help us close that Gap to where we need to be it was part of a uh legislative task force requirement an interim task force that occurred before the 2023 session so um you know I think you know certainly through our our implementation of the BPS IT addresses emissions from existing buildings um you know we we're limited and directed to looking at site energy use but certainly setting those targets will help reduce energy use which in turns help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings um and that's kind of how we're prioritizing our our Outlook and framework of the program to help get to those greenhouse gas reduction goals we see it as a as a critical component to helping our state get there um How will I see a question about how will data be received from the owners um it will be primarily reported through the plan is to have it reported through energy start portfolio manager and then have our um our database our BPS database kind of overlay and extract data from portfolio manager uh portfolio managers kind of the the standard in the industry I think most folks are it's free um you know a lot of building owners are familiar with it if they've ever reported their energy use to like the city of Portland that uses commercial or that has a commercial building benchmarking program or if they've applied for an energy star score um it's kind of the standard in the industry so we're um hoping to leverage that um let's I'm trying to scan through let's see I don't know it's kind of hard to see questions that I that I haven't answered but I'll certainly go through the chat afterward and if there's any that I haven't answered um try to answer those oh uh Medical Office Buildings healthc care but not Hospital fall under tier one or tier two oh no I don't think I answered that one yet um I at this point I think think those would actually be a tier one building um classified under more of an of an office building not a not a hospital as long as it is just a like a separate and distinct um office type building and doesn't actually include any sort of like uh Healthcare activities in it um what are the alternatives for campuses that do not have building level metering this is something that we're interested in hearing from stakeholders as we go through our process for sure I think some other jurisdictions have um applied a campus level approach as as a potential pathway for compliance",

        "text": " for the first time that I'm aware they excluded all the utility CEOs and they made it a community thing and so the pressure with more people being engaged even outside of quote Professionals in the business um I I think we're going to feel a shift that I don't know what that looks like but there definitely are different perspectives that we haven't been engaged with previously if I may just kind of reiterate the point that shared robot up about the sort of narrative that's out there this is also one of the reasons why yesterday you know I felt it was important to bring up the farm and Forest report and also the sort of status of you know f-sec solar projects I mean we have 3.6 gigawatts of active solar right now just under f-sect but those narratives that are out there don't talk anything about what's happening they just talk about the need for you know the future and that's why I think it's important that you know that information gets shared it gets put out there obviously the apartment Forest report will be given to the legislature as well so you know we can't sort of change what the narrative is going to be from people but we can at least put the data out there that maybe is you know pushes back on some of that narrative because it's not entirely truthful well thank you chair Grail and Todd for that observations um yeah concur on all fronts um so just to quickly talk about what else again energy being sexy as the chair put it is true um Energy Efficiency is usually not on that list but this time it will definitely be a big issue and it's been a pretty like contentious task force that's been meeting talking about Energy Efficiency in new and existing buildings so we'll see what comes out of that conversation what sort of policy comes out but that'll also be I think sort of the twin big deal on energy um I think these other issues are also really important and likely to likely to come up there or will come up during session incentive programs including extending our solar rebate program which is mostly for a residential scale solar Federal funding and related budget items I'm sure that you all have heard from Todd or from our staff before but if you haven't the agency is getting quite a bit of federal funding directed our way for mostly for Energy Efficiency but for energy projects in general so that's coming up uh Statewide energy strategy is something we actually recommended the state coming up with in our recent biennial Energy report so that's a conversation a couple of legislators are also bringing to the table um two things that you'll definitely want to pay attention to as as a council as well there is a package of legislation being developed on Rural energy development that is being put together by a group called making energy work for Rural Oregon they have a policy committee and they've been working really hard to come up with a package so I'm not sure what would be in that package at this point but I do expect that to come forward and when I come back and talk more with you I can tell you what sort of details were in that if any of them affect citing and then um chair Grail mentioned hydrogen specifically hydrogen and then also offshore wind in particular have been just really hot issues in the state and I expect legislation on both of those from various places probably multiple pieces of legislation and we'll kind of see what gets moving during session any questions on any of that before I move on to the last Quick slide well this is handling and I just make the observation that the last three bullets you had there are pretty related to each other and um it would be interesting to see if there's intertwining among those issues before the session yes you're absolutely right I think that's something we've been thinking is we kind of need to get together and figure out what we want to do as a state and if we just sort of pursue like one-offs is that going to be the most strategic thing so I think you're absolutely right that's a really astute observation and we'll see how they all interact during the session to come and then I can go to the last slide and this is just our calendar for this um so the legislative session you'll see in bold starts January 17th there's always sort of an on-ramp um really I would say December 7th the 9th legislative committee meetings is when we kind of get the preview of what bills are out there and what I haven't heard about yet right so we'll know then and then bills get filed most of the bills that will come up in session get filed December 21st I don't know if WebEx is picking up my cap but I'm so sorry I wanted to be with you all in Hermiston but my husband's out of town so Stockholm and now of course I have a um and then the swearing-in day where the legislators all come together and they'll be like a big speech from the new governor a big speech from the new presiding officers they have to get voted in by the whole chamber on that day that'll all happen on January 9th and then January 17th session starts in Earnest there's a bunch of deadlines that keep the work flowing during the legislative session you can expect that the busiest time will be right around that April 4th first chamber work session deadline it's always a real intense time and then the last day of session will be somewhere between likely June 15th and June 25th which is the last day um under the Constitutional Amendment um or Constitution not necessarily um that uh that the legislature could meet without having a super majority vote to continue which will likely never yeah and just to sort of add into that you know we talked about this in the um but for those who when we weren't here during the long uh last the last long session so we certainly you know evaluate and participate in the you know direct sighting relating bills that you know that will impact f-sec but we also track every land use bill because you know the way the land use system works you know in Oregon is our Landing standard basically ties back to either the direct applicability of lcdc statutes or rules or uh local government uh adopted comprehensive plan and land use ordinances so it's critical that we evaluate those and there are always a flurry of land use bills in every session very long session so many of them you know don't end up being uh completed many of them are unrelated but most of them have relating to Clauses that are so broad that could be converted into anything near the end of the session which then requires a lot of diligence on our part to make sure that we're just keeping an eye on them to understand how they may you know be indirectly affect the council and and you know council's rules and program so it's a lot of work it's the short yes and just a question um has the agency submitted any bills yeah a summary of those blood questions yes yes thanks for asking that's a really good question and I'm sorry for not thinking to include it here um we I think in part because we were waiting to make sure we could submit those bills that the new governor would um approve them or whatever but actually they're being submitted by Governor Kate Brown and so we it's actually not we didn't have to wait it's kind of interesting to find that out so um we have two pieces of legislation that will be um dropped or filed by December 21st one of them is to extend the sunset for that solar rebate program that I mentioned real quickly that's our bill that would do that and also make a technical fix to that solar rebate program and that's been a really successful program that's been really great for sort of distributed solar not the kind of solar you all work on but the kind that's on rooftops of affordable housing or so um so that that bill is one we're really excited about and then we also have legislation that establishes a program at the agency to help communities apply for federal or state funding for energy projects so essentially we want to have a person on our staff a program at our agency that's responsive to community needs and it's specifically geared toward environmental justice communities that are now defined in statute and include rural communities Coastal communities tribal communities low-income communities communities that have a lot of immigrants or communities that have a lot of people of color and then there's also some other other pieces in that definition too like Health equities comes up so it's a pretty broad definition but we want to help essentially local governments it's kind of the target audience there or tribal governments help them uh because we've heard a lot about capacity being an issue in smaller communities or tribal communities so we wanted to be responsive to that to have a person on our staff who can be more of a helpful hand so that's the other piece of legislation we're calling it The thank you thanks for asking other questions do you have anything else Christy nope that's all from me thank you but we will look forward to seeing you regularly during session thank you for your efforts in joining us this morning if there's nothing else we will close that agenda item thank you thank you chair Graham we are now on a break says uh but we don't have any more agenda items because agenda item aged the Westin solar project we've agreed to keep the record open so the applicant can respond to the comments made yesterday so December 2nd is their deadline I believe yes thank um so does anyone have any further questions or comments yes time but outside of the agenda yeah as long as we're concluding that I think we are including that um so you do still have the future dates on the agenda oh oh uh that must have been a hierarchical error um I had that in the secretary court so oh okay that was the intention so that must have been a thought that we didn't uh clarify yeah okay well then if there are no other formal items then we will go ahead yeah I just wanna if if this is councilmember Jenkins last meeting which is unclear at this point I've learned this before that's why it's hard to know that it's sort of been uh multiple times um I just if it is I just want to express my sincere gratitude for the amount of work you know that Haley puts um you know he reads everything uh in fine detail like he gets in so far into the wheat and it makes us so much better and I just greatly appreciate all the time and effort you know that you put into",

        "text": " I don't have the numbers. We are earning every year in particular with the small trees that take longer to grow But we can get more information for you to give to you George and we can give it to you next week we have some questions Yes yes I have questions and I'm going to leave my week of my question of the trees for the other week I'm very very excited and I'm delighted to hear information about the Oregon micromaya does anyone have information about it I think we have some staff and Alan is reaching out to answer Yes good evening I'm Alien I'm the city engineer for this project for those of you who don't know is a gold energy department partnered with pg and is going to fund battery storage at Oxford Street and 22nd to store batteries and that is going to power a feeder for a building and that work is going to start at the end of this excuse me but I can't breathe that it's coming so fast talk we talk to us we are going to bring it to the city manager to sign and the work is going to be carried out with the design and construction this year and next year And Alan the odeoe sorry the Oregon department of energy This is a very exciting program and it is very very good news I don't know if you have any other questions in this regard member Philips And that is a question to point out and see a comment For at the beginning of this meeting we had a preamble pointing out the big things and one of them is the adoption of the operational commission if we saw is to add to given this in this section what we have in terms of the Parents can help us with this reviewed in the previous section those are not here in terms of the power range and we all Sorry you can't hear four members of sos and we had two and we have eight positions in the last area I think I was late but I want to point out that it is really very important to add things like kiss seeing adding two essential things like our rangers because we have an expansion and we only have one if that is correct and we have 92 parks we need more forest rangers Yes then I think the time has come to expand the number of rangers and they really have those that are very tall and very excited and so I'm seeing in terms of this growing community Yes thank you very much counselor each of these positions that were included in has a direct relationship with the safety of our community and those are part of and we want to improve that function and the community and to keep this usable thank you very much we want to make sure that we hear well that any new position will be recommended only and that vacancy will be filled And if phase one of the income options and implemented And if this is correct then all Those new ones for all of that are going to be based on phase two of those income, yes, and on our personnel discussion, while these are very important positions, we do not want to put ourselves in a position where we do not have the income to sustain them, we want to put this operating commission in this year's budget and we want to demonstrate to the community and the council and the budget committee the purposes for which we are going to use it but on the other hand fail by not having enough income to support the operations that are already functioning so stay and we are going to continue giving you more information I do n't know if there are more questions yes I really my question that I have is that if we fulfill these positions that they are asking for then some of these positions bring with them additional income on the way in the future That would support those positions well directly not really not some of the support positions in those operations can have a compensation and the allocation plan of other funds because other funds are taken care of and no not directly indirectly we can say that the rangers can reserve so that the parks to receive income for thank you and I don't know if this answered the question and I think you are thinking Yes, but I'm fine and if you have to come back, then come back to us Yes, thank you Mr. President in that section During this year and last year the budget of thousand dollars to the climate action plan and My question that one came out But what is the budget for climate action this was identified in the budget and once this action plan is finalized and completed I want to know what is the transition of the sections climatic conditions as well as seen instead of just the planning because the prevention plant has been budgeted for several years the first is the reference of 200,000 and the 950,000 is the same amount in dollars that was seen for the implementation services also for the action plan and we also see that these we know that there are going to be more costs as there is more implementation of the plans that is why both things are included the budget for next year thank you very much I think I have been trying to see how many new ftps and find the full-time employees and for the counselor Philips and I want to talk about the in terms of the coast guard uh forest guard and I see that with good eyes that there are more but if we look at page 176 we are showing the four new compliances with the codes of the fiscal year and five point four to ten point four five So these are the four This is the code But as explained in the text two of them are going to function as the rangers and in the other part we also see under those rangers we have two more that were added from one point one six to one So my question would be I have a question that I asked and what I see is that for these rangers two classified as also people who support security and two of them are as rangers so There are six new uh full- time people two work as rangers two work as security people and others are classified rangers so I think it's good But somehow I want to check if I'm reading page 176 because the staff is saying there are four and I see That 's six for me. There are six, two rangers and two security people and two more. Well, there are several things that are happening because good consolidation of the compliance programs and with it all these compliances in the fiscal year in this column were mixed within a only program and we also have a staff assignment each year here and this fluctuates depending on which members are assigned to the program But as for new full-time people we have two compliance officers and two new rangers who are also classified as compliance officers but the compliance program is not shown, yes, I answered, yes, the member is clear. I need you to turn on your microphone. Well, I am going to follow up with you, but I did want to understand if we are talking about four or six full-time people, or for me it was not Of course, if there were four or I'll talk to you later, don't worry, it sounds great. Let's follow up. There are also four in total. We can do more research on which personnel is assigned to the compliance program and I think that many times when we are changing from place to place it can get very confusing so Thank you for taking the extra time to explain to us any other questions members today thank you Madam President and I think for me it is difficult priorities and many of you I am always struggling with priorities I know where There are mine and sometimes it is difficult to see the parks when we are seeing daily problems that have to do with, for example, homeless people, drug addiction and mental illness, but I am also the owner of a restaurant that survived the pandemic and I had to learn to think out of the box every time I turned around so when I see this I'm thinking about my business and my home and I create and I think creatively and I heard that you guys drove and said there 's nothing here that's not useful So I I also heard it and I also heard the public testimony that says that somehow it makes sense with what I was thinking and it has to do with the apa or the aip and it really made me think it's something I didn't know about So when I hear things new and I don't know anything about it I want to know more so I hope what I'm saying makes sense and thanks for the opportunity to share Thank you very much Joshua I would like to talk about it Yes I can follow up but I know how this works for me it sounds like there is a doesn't add up or there's something going on And I also know that our family had to put that aside a long time ago through employment and My question is where are we at This is what it's about And that's called the individual accounting program that it really gives benefits separately the city takes it six percent and is often referred to as if we see that finance people I know they are not finance people but it is called like a peak how to collect it really depends on where we are who pays and in where things are paid at the moment I think we chose it because of salary increases several years ago and that's why we pay it. It's cheaper for us to pay that six percent than to increase a salary by six percent. Well that makes me think more. I will be able to give you more information if you require it, member Milton Yes, the question I asked before, plate fifteen and eight go hand in hand, true, And why are you seeing them and the reason for My question is because it has sustainable growth and we are seeing one as a branch of the library and also an amphitheater program that we rent in we wanted to have a library people come into the community in the west part of Salem so in all these positions The question is if there is any study that has been carried out where we asked for an increase of three point five in budget and there is something that would show that if we are doing this that if this is going to be sustainable for the future and with the amphitheater etc. then that is a very very very good question. small tangent in",

        "text": " it now um we know at least some fires have been ignited or made worse by electric infrastructure for example the 2018 campfire near paradise california was determined by cal fire investigators have been caused by a fault a faulty transmission line owned by pacific gas and electric company there's been some other incidences of uh electric utility cause or related fire here in oregon although i do want to point out that there haven't been any major fire incidents at fsec jurisdictional um we have had some minor uh incidents reported to us at facilities um and there have been also been some documented cases of fires at um renewable energy facilities so the picture on this slide shows a 2018 fire in gillum county um that was start started after a nacelle caught fire at a turbine tower at a non-fsec jurisdictional facility um there's also been a few incidents of uh fires caused by wildfire or wildlife contact or contact with vegetation at the gentile lines that connect facilities generating facilities to the bulk transmission grid so that's sort of the overall contacts that we're working in there's been this visibility of wildfire and that has led to a increased interest in just making sure that wildfire risk is appropriately analyzed addressed and mitigated during the sighting process and luckily sarah is going to talk a little bit about how we've been doing that so far and what some of the strengths and weaknesses of our current roles are thank you chris so yeah again my name is sarah esterson and i'm just going to walk you through a slide or two so we wanted to highlight existing council standards where there has been or could be an evaluation of fire and or fire risk depending on the facility we've presented those here so first under the organizational expertise standard the council is obligated to find in part that an applicant has demonstrated an ability to design construct and operate the facility in a manner that protects public health and safety and so it's that public health and safety trigger that in some instances we see some discussion of fire risk from an energy and then the second standard that's presented here is the council's public services standard just for reference that standard requires council to find that an build a proposed facility so they can construct and operate it and it would not be likely to result in a significant adverse impact uh to the ability of a public or private service provider to provide fire protection services and then of course that evaluation typically goes out about 10 miles from the site boundary of an energy facility so you can go to the next slide so um consistent with those two standards that we just walked you through we wanted to outline the associated exhibits that are associated with those standards and an exhibit is submitted with an application for site certificate or a request for amendment and in some instances those exhibits have information related to facility fire these exhibits starting in the order we've presented here include exhibit d um exhibit d goes with organizational expertise and then there's exhibit k that goes with land use we'll talk about that in just a second and then exhibit you which goes with public services um so specific examples what we're seeing in exhibit d um is if a proposed facility includes a lithium-ion battery energy storage we're typically seeing acknowledgement of some level of fire risk from dangerous heat evolution or thermal and so a developer might present that to minimize that risk that the transporter of lithium-ion batteries would adhere to federal requirements so there's a little bit of an evaluation and then in exhibit k what we've seen is that if if a proposed facility is located within a local jurisdiction that has adopted code provisions that are specific to fire mitigation or a development standard that's specific to to fire then those code provisions would be evaluated in exhibit k and some examples that we've seen are in josephine county and wasco county where they in fact had some fire related zone provisions that were incorporated and so we saw an analysis there and then um lastly in exhibit u we you know there's an evaluation of of construction and operation of a facility and so we typically see an evaluation of construction-related fire risk and and how that would minimize impact to fire service providers and then for operational fire risk it's really been largely limited to whether the facility is within an existing service provider's territory and if it is then that's largely where the impact is is left and if it's not in a service provider territory then we might see you know some plan for how to work with a service provider a fire protection service provider to ensure that there's coverage in that area but rarely if ever is there any type of wildfire risk assessment under that exhibit for that standard and then we didn't include it here because it's not related to a standard but wanted to acknowledge that exhibit b which is the the project description does have an information requirement to um fire systems and equipment for the for the proposed facility um but a council isn't obligated to make a finding on exhibit b so our intent here is to show you the little um not the little but the places within an application that we have seen some information about fire and fire systems but uh certainly none of these provide a clear nexus to help the department or applicants evaluate you know clearly evaluate fire risk so um i will with that hand it back over thanks sarah yeah and i did um see from jim a comment from jim that these slides are slightly different than uh the ones that were sent out earlier we will get the most recent or this final set posted to the website uh as soon as we after this meeting um you know i think for the most part besides a few adjustments i think this is the only slide that is new from from what was sent out before so um so given that current contacts um we do i just wanted to remind everyone that the council is charged with generally ensuring that the sighting construction and operation of energy facilities is consistent with the protection of public health and safety in the environment and that is under the sighting policy found in ors 469310 and then to carry out this mandate that the council has the authority to adopt standards and rules for the sighting construction and operation of energy as provided in os 469 470 and 469 501. as sarah kind of went over um that ladder statute identifies a number of topics that are currently addressed in council standards um and those include protection of public health and safety and and also impacts on public services and and we think that this rulemaking would fall under maybe either one of those categories um as we are moving into um the rule-making process uh as todd mentioned earlier we are really early in the process and so we haven't settled on a specific approach or strategy um but we have identified some objectives of what we'd like to accomplish with this rulemaking um those that we would like whatever proposed rules we come up with to minimize the risk of a facility subject to the council's jurisdiction uh minimize the risk of that facility causing a wildfire we'd like to ensure that there are adequate protections in place to ensure that public and health health and safety is protected in the event that there's a fire at a facility regardless of the cause of ignition and then finally to provide some regulatory certainty and consistency to our certificate holders we do want to maintain uh with the wildfire mitigation rules adopted by the puc to the extent possible so um at a minimum we are trying to avoid any direct conflicts but really to the extent that we can we would like our rules to follow a similar approach to what they've been doing well well there are several different ways that that can look before i move into our more specific discussion topics to kind of unpack how we want to meet these objectives i just wanted to take a second to see um if anybody has any other any questions or would like any qualifications about the scope or contacts that we're working in right now okay well c none um i'll keep moving on and um as questions or comments pop up to feel free to raise your hand um at any time so um as i mentioned at the beginning we've identified kind of five broad areas where we'd like to get feedback um from you all during our discussion um the first is uh the overall regulatory approach we should take to addressing wildfire risk the second is the applicability and scope of a council standard or rule and specifically we'd kind of like to know what types of facilities the rule should because the council's jurisdiction extends past just electric generation facilities and transmission lines next we'd like to talk a little bit about the specific methods and criteria for analyzing wildfire risk at facility sites and and then talk a little bit more about specific preventative actions or programs that may be uh required or implemented to mitigate risk at energy facilities we're going to go through these one by one i think prepared a brief introduction for each one and then have some questions for you all if we need to skip around a little bit or something comes up that's out of that's okay as well so we can kind of keep the conversation flowing but with that i'll just go ahead and get started on our first topic which is on the regulatory approach okay so um given our objective to maintain consistency with the puc rules as much as possible we uh we would like to get some feedback on what you all think the appropriate approach would be to take regulatory approach would be for the council to take on this um so the puc rules and i will look to uh any pvc staff that wants to correct me if i misstate something but um the puc rules require uh electric owned investor owned utilities to operate in compliance with wildfire protection plans and the requirements for those plans are outlined in the newly established ors 757 963 which was implemented through senate bill 762 the standard embedded in both the puc rules and that statute is that the wildfire protection plans must reflect a reasonable balancing of mitigation costs with resulting reduction in wildfire risk um and i kind of wanted to point this out uh because while we are mindful that the the council rule is not intended to uh cause unnecessary cost of compliance or administrator burdens on certificate holders um the council uh really doesn't have the same mandate to uh consider cost containment um or rate recovery as as the duc does so we are working under slightly different and may need to use a slightly different standard to evaluate compliance with a council rule or standard seeing some things moving around um so as we go into this the approach we've kind of recommended is or our initial approach that we're thinking of pursuing right now",

        "text": " the six percent um matt misstated that six percent of the property holdings uh cunningham and pendleton own way more than 75 000 or even 25 000 acres it is six percent of the crop land so not all land zones six percent of the cropland there's range land there's there's la la there's multiple uses of of their land which is documented in the testimony in the declarations and again mr corey could answer any further questions about that i want to make that very clear for the record though um most fundamentally um it is essential for applicants to fully engage with the landowners to uh work those people who work the land who know the land can identify the uses of the land and uh and and they can help us as applicants identify the best lands for the full benefit of farming operations and other uses on the property did that during the application process and these were not land owners who said have at it um design a project let us know when when the hearing is no as the declarations uh i think make very clear these landowners were were involved in every step of this process they are stewards of this land that's been in in their hands of their family for five generations so this is a big deal for these landowners who were absolutely involved in the design and sighting of this facility so here the landowners they identified the best location based on their use and their knowledge of the land and as matt indicated the site that was that was is in fact considered the worst you know um least productive agricultural property in their land holdings that is adjacent to another location that's kind of similar and and as matt indicated i'll just punctuate this it's an opportunity to make some economical use of the land where farming is just simply not a viable opportunity and again mr corey can fill in the testimony of steve corey and bob levy provides detailed evidence identifying the best location for the solar facility these landowners know their land and they as i said they were actively involved in site selection and design they chose the site based upon the fact that it is their poorest agricultural that it is in the heart of the wind generation generation facility therefore the least amount of impact on the surrounding lands as well it minimizes impacts on the land by transmission lines by roads it's very very close to their farm operations building so for multiple reasons this site makes a great deal of sense for the uh for these landowners cunningham ranch and pendleton so just to kind of wrap up here um this industry is still in its infancy and we understand the council is still kind of evolving how to deal with solar energy siding and you know we're in the industry we're we're trying to figure it out too and how the regulatory standards should apply so it's not surprising to us that the council has questions good to ask that we have a responsibility to answer and that's we are committed to do that and we will be committed for the next application and the next application in the next application because there will be more um and this is not going to end anytime soon what is important to us is that there be on how we meet goal 3 goals and standards and how that relates to and synchronizes with other very important state policies most particularly climate change and that is very much in our minds as we are working on these applications and working with these landowners the testimony from both mr levy and corey in fact touched on and believe me i didn't write this testimony for him but that their testimony touched on their responsibility and how they believe they can make very beneficial and important use of the land to deal with climate change goals that's a real issue for this family um they're very they're taking some responsibility for so here for this project we believe that we have struck the right balance with the evidence and the rationale to support the approval and we ask to approve this project an issue a proposed order at the conclusion of this hearing i have one little wrap up thing to do though on the two-mile setback if you like that from us right now and i'll start and you can correct anything i say matt all right um we are matt is i'm not working with the in order to um avoid locations it would be subject to the two-mile setback we're in a process of trying to figure that out we're not suggesting that anything be revised with a dpo right now we need to check in with the county particular on their strategy their standards for waivers or consents for locations that might be shy of the two-mile buffer area so i just want to kind of let you know that that's very much in the attention nolan hills to get that resolve to the county satisfaction and we believe we can do that but we'll need just a bit of time but we don't want to hold up this to do that so we would um our all right and i talked to mr cornett about this i think if if we're able to succeed in this effort we would essentially kind of just request that piece of the dpo be removed because we would be in compliance with the county yeah so so we heard from from mr jolly earlier and and i think not um his comments were echoed by the by the county and the county's comments are on the record they were submitted on may 26 and you know so we capital power we plan to own and operate this long term we want to be good members of the community within umatilla county and we want to work with the county to make sure that we can live within their standards we do need to understand you allowance for for landowners local residences to waive those setbacks which we don't have resolved today but i do want to put it on the record that you know capital power takes community engagement very seriously we want to be a good member of the umtil accounting community we will be coming before umatilla county for other approvals as well and we want to unders we want them to to know and recognize that this project which has evolved over time we have 112 turbines in this application 100 of those are outside two miles from a residence and so this project could be built tomorrow with those hundred turbines but we we want to analyze and confirm before we effectively give up on those other 12 turbines because they're on nice high peaks with good winds and things of that nature so it's a process that will be ongoing here and just as the f-sec historian here i will say that we are wanting to indicate in any way that the goal findings method of resolving these issues uh through local codes is is in any way uh something that we're not you know that we're giving up on or or that isn't that is not an important part of this process the point is for this project we think we can avoid doing that all right thank you so at this point i think i want to turn it over to council to see if they have any questions for the applicant comments they want to make and and give uh council an opportunity to you know kind of have that dialogue with the applicant this is hanley jenkins council member first question is you're not asking us remove the 12 turbines from consideration at this time we need need to still address them as if they're there in relationship to the two-mile setback okay you agree with that yes i'm i'm nodding so verbally that's correct thank you that's that's my first so my second question is completely different and um you asked the staff to provide us some excerpts from exhibit k we got a packet of maps in that packet of maps there is a right exhibit six uh figure p dash five and i won't make you go looking for it but um it includes um areas enrolled in the conservation reserve program lands and if i'm interpreting the site or the solar farm correctly it does that on this map it's not in the crp program is that because it's been more recently enrolled yes i yes i think that is the case mr jenkins and and steve cory knows all about this issue so but he probably didn't do the math yeah you probably didn't do the math and the map you know this application has been in the works for a very long time and so whether everything is currently shown as it is today is a question your oral testimony and your other written testimony clearly says it's into yes it is i got the map and i tried to superimpose the location on this i went but it's not on the map you you continue to have a very sharp eye yes thank you so it is in crp that's all thank you that's all i have thank you this is cindy condon and i have a thank you so in your last month the project one of the unique factors that was used used last month um was that the the project is solar wind and battery and that it's located proximate to transmission lines and a proposed substation at bpa and i am curious well in the it's as i remember the project is talked about in terms of phases is being done in phases so will every phase include batteries those three unique elements of battery storage solar and wind and additionally if bpa does not develop the substation proposed then so i think in within exhibit k there's reference to being within a mile of a bpm an existing bpa transmission line which is which is true our proposed interconnection to bpa which is in the application is further they want that substation to be north of the umatilla river for access reasons and so if that project sorry if that substation does not get built the alternative connection is either a smaller project to the existing bpa line a mile to the north or the uec transmission option which is the long 25 mile line that goes off the page so to answer questions about phases that is going to be somewhat dependent upon the commercial solution to this project which is not yet uh finalized and so ultimately we want to provide a product to a customer um who's willing to pay a certain amount resiliency and reliable power and so as of today and the reason we added solar in batteries that you need those all three components to get to that close to around the clock solution and that's not just the utilities in oregon but cni customers are also looking for that uh more reliable product and so ultimately we're going to build what we can sell and so if we cannot sell 600 megawatts",

secretary report Flor is yours thank you chair um first our council member updates so Katie IMS was confirmed by the full Senate on February 9th in her first term uh of the energy facility sting Council officially started on February 16th so welcome council member IMS on behalf of the staff we thank you for volunteering your time what we do is incredibly important important and your role is um the at the decision making side of that is incredibly important as well so welcome thank you Todd I appreciate that chair Vice chair members of the camp I just want to take this opportunity May on okay um this opportunity to say um I'm very excited to be here and um I look forward to serving alongside you and um I understand I have a lot to learn and U but I look forward it's been a very welcoming um on boarding everybody's been very um gracious and so just appreciate that and leave at that thank you thank you and welcome and we forward to working with you also in terms council member updates uh council member Cho Toot's first term in on March 15th of this year um council member Chu has submitted requests to the governor's office for reappointment um so moving forward on that process um as you know you know It ultimately result the legislative process has to go in front of the Senate rules committee and be voted on by the full senate for confirmations outside of a legislative session they schedule those at varying times we believe the next legislative dat would be in April that's and thank you council member chaku for your continuing service and your willingness to continue into a second term so we very much appreciate yes on behalf this is chair bra on behalf of all of us we appreciate it you bring a unique perspective to us and we are glad that you're staying on thank you okay I'm G move on to project updates first is the Summit Ridge wind farm so this project is an approved wind energy generation facility it's located in northeastern Wasco County County it's been approved for 72 wind turbin with a peak generating capacity of 194 megaw it was originally approved in 2011 since then there have been five approved amendments and there is the sixth which is currently under review these amendments uh have related to varying things including change of ownership time extension beginning and ending construction time extension requests um as well as one which is proposing to add solar PV and battery storage to the project as well um the project has uh been appealed uh in a couple of different uh Ways by the friends of Columbia River cge uh to Circuit Court those have been going on for some time U and those relate to the denial and contested case on one of the Amendments as well as sort of the status whether stat project is actually active or nonactive so on February 14th we received a request to decommission the facility terminate the site certificate as well as withdraw amendment number six so the decom conditioning request requires a notice and a public comment period we have not yet sent out that notice to the public establishing a public comment so that will be in front of you um whether it's March or April it will be coming to you at some so we're starting just beginning in that process um following on that even though that project is not yet been terminated um the same applicant or developer um has submitted a notice of intent for a new project which is the Summit Ridge renewable energy facility functionally it is the same project as the approval through amendment number five as well as what they're proposing in amendment number six so they're they're effectively resetting project that would include 32 wind turbines equaling 201 megaw solar area equaling 60 megaw and battery storage equaling 21 megawatts that came in relatively recent we have set up a website the notice of intent is located on the website but as part of the notice of intent process we have to provide notice to the public reviewing agencies and see comment we've not yet done that um we will also have a public informational meeting uh We've not yet set that either so that will be Council question about is that a strategy that does away with all the activity and then we just start from I'm just curious what what's behind it in terms of uh the activity so far and then going forward well I'm not really inclined to speak for the certificate holder or this case the applicant but on its face that appears to be what's happening I guess from from our position we'll get a new S for S that starts a new we know about a lot of that work um but the analysis is still the same um or similar yes you know in that assuming all of the standards or requirements are all exactly the same in terms of all of the characteristics and facts on the ground are all the same um it would be largely the same you know but things Chang you know this originally was approved in 2011 there has been multiple amendments but you know it's also an opportunity you know we know in this area but for example in other areas in the Columbia Plateau Washington ground squirrel migrate you know and move into new areas and we've had where project has been approved um taken several years to go into construction and by the time they did Washington ground srel had moved into that area which then eliminated their ability to develop half of the project now I don't know if there's any circumstances like that in this area of this project but that's where new information is valuable to assure that everything is the same we don't we don't assume it is we have to valuate the facts thank you um next is the Boardman solar energy facility this is an approved 75 megawatt solar energy project on 790 Acres located in North moral County uh was originally approved in early 2018 with a deadline to begin Construction in February of 20121 council approved amendment number one allowing a three-year time extension um for the beginning of construction which ends today um certificate aler stated that they will not be seeking another time extension or let the site certificate expire um they've indicated that they will be seeking County approval instead uh if you recall last uh last legislative session there was a change in jurisdictional thresholds about what go to counties um and they're going to be seeking um to have this project permitted by the county instead next is the cardi Generating Station so this is Project is located in moral County uh not too far from City of Boardman it consists of two two components um it's an an operational 450 megawatt combined cycle natural gas field electrical generating plant and that was approved originally in 2012 and it's been constructed and operated they they did have a another unit that was proved that they didn't build Ander valid um they also had requested under amendment number one 50 megawatt solar PB facility um so I don't know picture the location but you have the cardi Generating Station then across the street was the bman coal plant then there is a big retention pond water area it was related to the P coal plant and south of that was where the um solar facility was approved so the solar facility was approved in 2018 not yet constructed they requested time extension begin construction through 2025 is their February 2025 will be their new timeline to begin construction earlier this month we received amendment number four requesting to increase the solar components from 50 megawatts to 1885 megawatts and adding 156 megawatt of battery storage um I don't had not looked at the details I believe um a lot of that new area would be on the site of the Ord next on my list is the Muddy Creek project so at the last council meeting we spent some time providing comments that were submitted directly to some council members um and we talked about those comments were outside public comment period since they were specific to a couple council members um it was important that we provided those to all council members as as well as the applicant to make sure you know that there are no procedurals associated with project um so we did that um think that was exactly what needed to be done and then lingering question um that was asked by council member was uh council members was were those comments part of the decision record or not and um our doj Council Patrick grow indicated that he would do a little more research and come back to council and provide you with that information as to whether that constituted being part of the decision record or not an alternative to Patrick to respon so as we discussed at the last meeting there's uh the difficulty that comments made separately to council members poses there's at least two difficulties that that poses one the it's uh the applicant has not had you're the decision makers uh In fairness the applicant needs to be able to review and respond and provide their input would need to if they were to be made part of the decision making record uh and second from an administrative standpoint it's difficult for staff uh if you were to get a lot of those types of comments whether they be provided to you separately uh as they were last month or if they were were to be provided just as part of public comments during one of your regular meetings if those comments had to be part of the decision making record staff would then have to keep track of that make sure they got into the record and also allow the applicant to respond to those comments we have a process that's in place right now for comments Project Specific comments there are two opportunities one is through the when the the notice intent is issued the public is given an opportunity those comments are made part of your decisionmaking record and then of course on the draft proposed order public comments Project Specific comments are made part of the record the applicant is given an opportunity to respond staff evaluates and provides you their input uh there is nothing in your rules that requires separate comments made uh comments made separately to you or comment made during the course of a public meeting one of your regular meetings that requires you to make those part of the decision making uh I want to point out that Oregon public meetings Law requires that the public be able to observe and monitor public meetings there's nothing in Oregon public meetings law that requires you to accept public comments during a meeting you have a rule FC itself",

listing map of properties that would be crossed by the facilities the noi is valid for two years that means the applicant has until September 22nd 2025 to submit their application once the department has issued a project order however in the case of this particular project the applicant is indicated they will submit their application by or in July next year 2024 at this time at the end of this presentation uh we'll be soliciting comments from the public and state agencies local governments and tribal governments and the uh the public comment period for comments on the noi closes December 1st for this year in 2023 after we've received all comments the department will release a project order which will list the application submitt requirements in applicable statutes schools and standard the Second Step based on the application the will once the project order is is issued the applicant will submit an application um and from there the department will review the application in coordination with state agencies local governments and tribal governments this process does take some time um as there's regularly additional requests for additional information uh provided by the department to the applicant um that an applicant must address before the department can determine that the application is once determined once completeness is determined on an application the department will hold informational meeting another informational meeting that's another opportunity comment following receipt of a complete application the department will then prepare a draft proposed order which contains our recommended bindings of pro clim non-compliance with citing standards as well as the conditions we recommend Council impos under each of those standards which of those 16 General standards and additional we'll initiate another round of public involvement once we issue the draft proposed order at that stage there will be a public comment period and a public hearing persons who wish to contest the project must participate during the DP public hearing uh to be potential potentially eligible to participate the case following issu of the DPO the proposed order will uh be issued and that will contain changes to the draft proposed order based on feedback received from Council and reviewing agency partners in the public at the proposed order those who commented on the draft proposed order May request part of status in the case following the conclusion of the contested case or if no persons request party status in the contested case the council will issue a final decision on whether to approve or deny a site certificate if Council authorizes the site certificate and the developer seeks to make any major changes to the facility in the future the developer will need to request an amendment to the certificate which will initiate another round of council review and public participation what is not on this flowchart slide is the appeal path uh final FC decisions are appealable directly to the Oregon Supreme Court and they have six months uh within which to issue their final next slide please I've said it uh a few times in my presentation thus far uh reviewing agency and reviewing agencies are state agencies local governments tribal governments and in some cases federal agencies that we at the organ Department of energy seeking input from during our VI and proposed facilities these agencies and governments help us determine what studies should be conducted which permits are required and what statutes administrative rules and government ordinances apply to a specific facility at this point in our process we've already reached out to each reviewing agency to solicit comments during the noi phase and we'll continue to coordinate with our reviewing agency partners throughout this proposed facility as I mentioned we're in the notice of intent stage and the notice of intent really is uh desktop level analysis of a proposed project while we're happy to receive comments any comments or particular really at this point in our process interested in comments that are related to specific resources part of the inent the applicant had to conduct desktop studies for resources within and near the site boundary using the specific distances shown on this slide for example uh for the fish and wildlife habitat and land use resources um desktop studies were conducted within a half mile of the uh threatened dangered species and opportunities uh had a study area of five mons and for Scenic resources and public services there is a 10 miles study area based on what we hear from from you tonight reviewing agencies and anyone throughout this com noi com period uh these study area distances may stay the same or they increase study areas determine how far out from the facility the applicant must evaluate potential impacts to a given resource an evaluation of imput some of these resources can significant onsite survey work such field surveys to evaluate impacts that Wildlife have forend danged um if you have any thoughts or comments on about potential impact of the project or to resources please include those in your comments if you if you provide comments tonight um next slide please in the F section process applicants may elect to undergo the local land use review process or seek the council land use determination in the case of this project the applicant has requested that the council make the land use determination in the notice of attenta applicant is indicated that the local land use requirements of um matilla Mor count would be Consolidated into the state RW however the applicant can change up that decision um on what land use review process they want to seek up until the point they submit their application in recognition that matilla and Moro counties both are experts of their own land use codes and ordinances the department appointed both the unella County Board of Commissioners and the more County Board of Commissioners as the special Advisory Group for this project the two special advisory groups the department has requested that both Moro County andilla County provide a list of the local appable substantive criteria the facility would be evaluated against um would be evaluated against um next slide following the applicants portion of this presentation the public will have an opportunity to provide verbal comments on the proposed facility you also have public also has an opportunity to submit written comments throughout the end of the day on December 1st 2023 these comments and all comments our carded record and will be made available to the applicant next slide just in general the department has created a lot of information um in hopes that it would be helpful to the process our website contains a public guide as I mentioned and a series of handouts to help they explain the F process and how it works how to better kind participate in that General um the website also includes options to sign up to receive email notices on specific facilities or rle makings and to also comment on typing projects here on the bottom of this slide is in green is the URL for this particular project project page guess we could leave this up for a short bit should anyone like to write it down or take a photo um that said as a reminder these slides are already available on our project page um and lastly next slide this is my information for those listening over the phone my phone number is 5323 my name is Chase big Walker please feel free anyone to contact me with any questions that you may have um with that I'll now turn things over to the applicant to both introduce themselves and provide more specific information thank you Chase and thank you to the Department of energy and the council for allowing us to speak on behalf of the hum till andoro County connect project thank you all in attendance this evening and virtually we appreciate the interest in our project thank you for attending tonight my name is Weston Putman manager of public relations for umil Electric Cooperative this evening I am joined by manager of engineering for UVC Cole bod land use specialist fortil Electric Hollins and together we are joined by several representatives from Power Engineers who is a consultant supporting and assisting U on this project so as Chase mentioned our presentation or our focus of our presentation is going to be more focused on the details and a little bit of the facts and figures of the itself so with any project regardless the size that human electric is getting ready to undertake orend or proposing we do what we call an analysis to identify a purpose and need and for this instance it's a purpose and need for new transmission as this as Chase mentioned is a 230 Kil transmission line during this analysis we were actually able to identify three that we believe will bring value from the umcc project and I'm going to go through it briefly in this slide but then the next slide I want to share a map that we feel brings a little bit more value to each and then I'm going to be able to talk to through so the first one is to increased system reliability and capacity of youtil Electric's 230 KB transmission line or system the second one is to support Economic Development and future growth within the region again that's both Umatilla and moral counties and really e organ as a whole the third one is to create a transmission path for renewable energy so now I'd like to share the map on screen and as you can see I want to start with the first one again increased system reliability and capacity as you can see on the screen the two green lines represent util Electric's current 230 kilovolt transmission system as you can see we have one on the east side near Herston and etilla in Umatilla County on the west side we have one in bman in Moro County however what you don't see is a line connected two what the umcc project would do is create an added layer of reliability and resiliency to this system so as of now with what we currently have if a major outage natural disaster weather event whatever it may be we're to take out system with our current capacity we are very limited to what we're able to do from an outage restoration perspective and a timely and uh matter this would create an adday of redundancy so if if anything were to happen in bourman or heran and this all went out for whatever reason we would be able to reroute power directly to the other 230 KB creating an added layer of resilience for number two again to assist and support Economic Development and future growth in the region and for this I want to highlight a certain area that some of you may be familiar with in recent years and especially in recent months as we know the Army chemical Depo transferred ownership to the Columbia Development Authority and with that we as the electric utility unit electric are anticipating a lot of growth a lot of development from economic job standpoint coming into the area and we want",

        "text": " that is okay if that's what you want to the one place that i will try to kind of keep things um consistent is to make sure that we're not veering into something that is not already included in the evidentiary record because that is important that we you know acknowledge that that's been and uh and that we need to stick to that tesla condon um council member condon here um i am just a bit confused by the contested case on page 268 and this is the first time i've read through a contested case so um in mr white's testimony he's concerned about strike on a hill and i heard no mention of water on page 268 discussing structural standard five on b i don't know if we want to call it up to construction the certificate holder will consult with landowners regarding right-of-way acquisition it's rather long but it speaks to water and i'm just questioning is is this a water is mr white concerned about water or stability of the hill and secondly for idaho power mr white said pretty clearly and i don't see it anywhere that anybody's asking for a full structural stability study on the ground for the whole but just this one piece this the hills over the grant and i'd just like you to clarify for me talking about the whole project versus this piece of it to satisfy maybe some of the concerns uh prior to site certificate being yeah or i don't know what order you give some clarification jesse on how to proceed yeah and again this is um going to be at the council's discretion how you want to handle this i um think that you know the to keep things as fair and as clear as possible um you know if if a council member has a question um we should you know you should direct that to whoever it is that you want to hear from provide the other party an opportunity to say something about it as well um and you know in this particular instance i heard you ask a question that sounded like it was directed to mr white um and um and so you know i think again to be fair it would make sense to have him answer that and then to see if idaho power has anything else that they want to say about that and again i don't want to sound like a broken record on this but we we really really need to keep things confined to what is on the record i don't think we've strayed from that at all but um it's it's just something i want everybody to keep in mind okay it sounds then like giving the opportunity to mr white to come up and answer the question that counselor anden has asked with no new information being presented okay um the question i think i heard was was this about water on the slope and it's really about in the there are maps and descriptions of the area around legrand and the area is described as unstable in the form of unconsolidated landslide debris and everyone who lives in the area knows what that's about you know the driveways are cracking and basically pulling apart it's a it's a very um unstable area so people are concerned about that and also the the blasting plan mentioned earlier never specifies where blasting's going to occur so we just don't know they might decide to blast they might is there anything else thank you just to confirm it really it was not specific to water it's stability for the hill and there's no request that i have heard or read about of you or anyone else saying there needs to be a an analysis of the whole correct yeah no one transmitted i've it's been saying that right thank you okay does idaho power wish to just very briefly um i i've been able to confirm and this is in the record that the geotech plan does is uh there is a plan to specifically address and do detailed geotechnical studies of the area that mr white is concerned about that is something that will be done once we know where the route is going to do those types of studies are not particularly effective until you you have the final design and routing one other point i would ask the council to consider is that it certainly isn't in idaho power's interest to place a tower in an unstable area um not only are we you know are we required by law to avoid those types of risks but it would be you know it would be something that for that idaho power regardless of the law would avoid and we hope that that gives the council some comfort about our intentions of doing very serious geotechnical work particularly in areas of concern prior to any construction thank you okay so council are there any suggestions um or recommended changes to the conditions under this structural standard number five in the proposed order no is this in the sdks order this is in the contested case order sorry that's right let's remember condon again um mr ratcliffe on page 268 sorry is that a condition a required condition in the contested case order on page 268 is contested case issue ss3 for which there were no exceptions filed which was more specific to blasting and potential impacts water quality no we're talking about ss5 no i know it's related to mr whites so front party we have an amended recommended soil condition number four and that includes the highlighted information that you're pointing to um and so that is and uh a recommendation from the hearing officer to include that language so as the proposed contested case order is written if adopted that would include this bolded language but not related to structural standard five i misread read that then it yeah it's not it wasn't this language didn't arise from structural standard issue five but it is a piece of the proposed contested case and so should you adopt the proposed contested case order without modifying this piece then that bold language will go in so since we're in in this kind of narrowing down of issues we have a number of of issues on which no exceptions were filed where the hearing officer may have made changes from the agency's proposed order to address some of the concerns that were raised by the person who who requested that contested case issue um and you know i i don't have the specifics of this you know or know the reason why this person didn't file an um but it's entirely possible that you know that that revision um met the concerns of the the person involved my my error i think okay then back to structural standard five there's a lot of weaving going on here between different structural standards but sounds like that one was taken care of and under structural standard three let's go back to structural standard five are there any comments or recommendations for changes to conditions under the proposed contested case order related to structural standard five seems hearing none maybe we got through that one and now we need to go back to the proposed order no we did not there was no there was no straw poll right so we stopped the straw poll and then you went into deliberation so we need to go back to the straw poll on the proposed contested case order before we go back to the proposed order so in doing the straw polls we want you pull us yes okay so unless there's any other changes i can read that one both include language that yes okay that patrick suggested okay so as i have it articulated council will agree with the findings of fact conclusions of law and conditions of approval in the proposed contested case order pertaining to issue s5 with the following modifications to make the changes to reflect that the proposed contested case order i'm sorry that's duplication that significant reconnaissance desktop survey was conducted okay so haley jenkins perry choctoote ken howe yes ann beyer jordan truitt yes cindy condon yes thank you and then now back to the proposed order yes counselor buyer conferred with our counsel i had a question on the blasting component of this condition which requires notice but notice through a newspaper newspapers aren't always the best source of information these days and i'm wondering if it is impractical to ask that the applicant notify property owners a given distance of a blasting activity i know that's something we regularly did at the local just to make sure that property owners were aware that something was going to happen i think the other conditions are appropriate um in terms of of notice but but i think then the newspaper notice alone is is probably not the best vehicle so thank you how's the council feel about that suggestion on notice um thank you for the question councilmember jenkins i'm trying to remember what we did at the local level and i don't know if it's 500 feet from the impact area or a half mile i i am the wrong person to ask about distance but thinking about the impact of blasting and just letting people know that it's going to happen um i i just can't remember from our local code what we required but somebody with practical experience could help inform this thank you this is patrick wrote the department of justice can i just seek clarification on are you referencing counselor buyer to the um amended recommended soil protection condition for in the proposed contested case order okay i see it no thank you um council member buyer i i know the intent is to give very clear and objective standards so i think notice um notice to property owners of record within a certain distance would be since we don't know what that distance is right now is that something staff can come back to us with tomorrow when we come back to this i hate doing that but for the the applicant's construction contractor to do a mailed notice to some to property owners within blasting of some unknown give more direction within a certain timeframe frame at least a week in advance or something and i can look at our county code language tonight to see if i can find something specific i don't mean to be so onerous but when you give notice it's good to get the notice to the people who are affected so first of all i think we need to find out where's the council on this as yeah well let me ask ann uh this is hanley um so this would be in addition to the the one week notice in the newspaper or in replacement of i i don't feel strongly either way but but i think it's critical target the notice not i i hate to say this in public but not many people read public notices in um i i'm just going to offer um because this would be the applicant or its construction contractor and i guess and we're just so programmed that when you say notice i get a procedural trigger in my head and it means a certain thing so i don't",

        "text": " it was originally posted and then it was edited sketch at the very last minute thing yeah yeah so what so at this point where does that leave go uh well at this point um we're gonna have to get it passed through Council so that the code language changes so they can't paint on those silos right and then when we let them know that hey these are allowed to be painted they would have to decide um Direction they want to go in terms of design then it'll go through the public process again or get Linda Khan in her neighborhood association to say hey we like the design we don't like the design then I recommend to SPAC you know did it follow the rules and then Spock will re uh look at the criteria and review them say yes it matches it's not an advertisement it's more public work of art accepted in the painted I see and then we get the legal uh easement for seven years okay and we wouldn't be able to create like entrepreneurial program until we speak to Kate and the stakeholders that's what I'm thinking is a next steps correct yeah maybe once the which will require code changes we're seeing you know yeah it feels like there needs to be a way to yes right now those are the two options and that creates this awkwardness where we're all sort of like sure kind of like it it looks great is it a piece of art that's a sale in the monster penis should they have to paint it no probably not so but what's the answer we should just put it in the art collection this week we don't know either this has been going on for a long time is there is that a usual thing that it takes that long sometimes code I mean they haven't even presented it to council yet why yeah well I learned uh talking to Tom that um I'm supposed to put in the staff report I wasn't an impression that legal department was putting in a staff report to city council and so I just learned this week so I have the template I just received it before this meeting so I'll be putting that up okay thanks for asking questions any other questions do we get those applications or for murals we've only received three in the past two years uh one was for or well four one two or four existing murals uh one was so we have to go through that process uh and those required those had a lot of Community Support letters because there's more say this mural or it's or we're gonna have to paint over it um the last two was the machio Charities so it was a big industrial one um it was North in North Salem which is you know has kind of like an art desert and then the last one was for this downtown uh one on Front Street however that was pulled in January um I'm gonna be receiving one for a new dental office built down South by the Costco area and so I'm looking forward to that one not the Costco I'm sorry the Beehive yes so they contacted me and they're like how are they gonna see it though because the dental office has really pulled back from a commercial yeah so the mural yeah because of the front of that dental office I don't know where they put a mural yeah it would have to be behind the parking lot and so one of the questions is is it you know accessible to the public and so they're gonna have to show that you know public can drive in there and you know see it so which really does feel like yeah because there's also also like we don't provide funding for anything like this but then we're responsible for or are we not responsible for any sort of upkeeper the city would um include them on our GIS you know art um collection so that'll be the advertising and it is important to have that agreement absolutely yeah yeah and that's to ensure vandalism chair right away yeah one more question about the Public Works building and the art yeah there how's that coming along followers building is going really well um it's what it's called dry rough or they rough the everything yeah I don't know the construction process yeah um but um yeah um they're not they don't have any of the artists in there yet um I can give you an update at the next meeting for Mountain diamond yeah I saw the last pictures that were running all the network cables all the blue internet oh wow and they're like just huge yeah that's a lot so but I'm excited for for you guys to come and do the opening um I know we want to do something separate uh from the actual living cutting of the building um so yep you know they actually have a the uh what are the anonymous carrier I know whoever that's going to be I guess if there's going to be construction right if there's construction then yeah and there should be some uh percent going to because they think it's going to happen as of July that's what I read foreign I'm actually helping with the recruitment of the airport credentialing yeah they're under public works now airport we're doing that that's okay now the terminal is changing it's gonna be a rough it's just to get it operational so he's not gonna you mean it's not going to be like going into something's really pleasure we're not going to be in Singapore airport but it is important to use it because if it gets utilized then that's when the real remodel will eventually get done so I think tell everyone if it's affordable San Francisco and so I mean I think this first I I don't know you know more than I do but I think the first year is really important to get Federal funding yeah after it so what's up yes yeah oh yeah it is not connected to it it's off a little bit yeah exactly 30 minutes and I think that's a pretty decent restaurant yeah it's actually pretty cool you should check it out yeah it's weird what they consider so I guess next meeting we're back to zoom and Landscape yeah and then but we can also address the zoom meeting I heard if Kate suggested another time yes okay yeah I just need seven days ahead to post the agenda and I'll let the public but I thought this was a great meeting yeah for the first one you guys did a lot very subcommittee is done proving some some repairs so very nice thank you yeah yeah my dog will be happy she's sitting in the car thank you oh thank you thanks so Susan you're gonna try to make it tomorrow to the yes yes

of my I've taken some of my letters and notebooks and all sorts of stuff that I've shredded and made it so made into other sculptures and sort of doing an environment you know kind of in an effort to kind of let go of some of this stuff wow because I keep a lot of things yeah this is big this is good yeah thank you you're welcome oh well I'll send it maybe I'll send something around all right oh and the brochures yes I um go to contact someone from facilities to open it for me do you wanna should I do should we do that another time yeah I'll set up a time for me to either send it to your house oh okay do you mind if I just drop it off no I don't mind I can leave it over here if you if you um if you do get it before tomorrow morning I'll be over at the library meeting okay I don't know yeah let me check with the um facilities person um I probably you know our next review yeah the the Open Studios is May 6th so that you know it's a waste of time okay yeah just like keep me posted whatever we'll do thank you you mentioned something about putting a barcode on it the sticker the I probably won't have that printed by the time we get it to you tomorrow because I think I can get it too tomorrow yeah if it's before I mean six in our all right well our yeah I wouldn't worry about the neighborhood association but the the Open Studios of the mill okay it will be May 6th sounds good

        "text": " just gonna kind of uh lick these split here however we can totally stop and go back at any point in time if council has any other questions or wants to go back waste minimization it's pretty simple before you go on to waste minimization this is handling um so i see that the applicant does not intend to join the rural fire district we do have structures i'm not as worried about the panels as i am about the operation and maintenance buildings and so i'm kind of surprised that there's no willingness on the part of the applicant to annex into the rural fire district i realize that there's taxes associated with that but it does seem that it's uh important that there be some kind of fire protection associated with those is there some other provision for fire protection for the maintenance buildings i would have to and i don't know if sarah has it open or can pop it open but if we went into this the attachment u3 which is the fire protection and emergency response plan um i believe that there are measures that uh the applicant represents of how of what equipment they would have on site during construction and operation i don't off the top of my head the details of the offer like the equipment that would be at the o m buildings during operation to address buyers joining and working with the rfpa is that they they basically participate as a member have and share fire protection equipment on site and i believe that we have details or examples of what some of that might be i don't know sarah do you have that in front of you or does it have that level of detail so so i believe that over in the fire protection plan that there are measures of fire control equipment that they would have on site and then participation and membership in the rfpa means that they work in conjunction with the rfpa to make sure that there is fire protection equipment on site or that could be shared with other members that are in the area yeah i remember reading something about the fire district would have access to that equipment but i guess my concern is that there's no obligation on the part of the to provide structural fire protection which they're responsible for um unless the project is within annexed within their boundary and so you know they may or may not respond and they're not obligated to now one of the this is dara one of the requirements in the draft fire protection and emergency response plan is that they would the applicant would be obligated to provide evidence of its participation in the high desert rfpa or um and include a copy of the agreement okay so this may not be accurate then in the dpo or in the following presentation okay and you have it right there is this something that we can con this is marcy is this something that we can uh maybe later if i'm needed trying to see just one minute here let me look at my slide and maybe it's just how i represented it in my health words this is kent and picking up on uh what um councilor jenkins is talking about there i seem to recall that even though they may not it may not be plausible or feasible to annex into the fire district they could still contract for services and so maybe that could be a solution to provide the fire protection needed i think we're all on the same page i think we see that there's potential for liability and risk and i don't know that it feels like we're satisfied with the answer thus far this is sydney and i i'm just on page 170 of attachment three i might be reading this wrong um but to me that read that the department includes in the plan that the applica applicant either submits an application for annexation to the christmas valley rural fire protection district or becomes a lifetime member of the rangeland fire protection association to provide fire protection and response so i guess i i thought that was covered so are you reading from public service condition number four i am reading from page 170 which is sorry of just um it's the paragraph right before public services condition 4. the the just in the discussion so the last couple sentences includes in the plan submit an application for annexation or become so that's all you can do is you can you can ask to be included you can't force them you can't force the district to accept so that's that's that's adequate cooperation with the local rural fire protection and emergency services so yeah i'm just concerned that the doesn't at least make them ask so i guess that would that would be something that i would raise yeah oh to me it's they are going to participate in the and then may annex into the fire you know again all they can do is ask to be included in the rural fire district or as kent says contract you can't i don't think you can require them to be a member of the rural fire district because that's up to the rural fire district to make that decision and what right now what the condition says is in cooperation with the local fire protection and emergency services you know that's i don't think that's you know requiring them to ask but i think that requirement is in the plan that the condition is referring to okay okay i don't have that open so that's what is on in in front of the screen here this is the attachment u3 that the department compiled based on the representations and the only reason i'm bringing this up is because i don't believe the other agencies are responsible for structural fire they're responsible for wildland fire and so it's the real fire district that's responsible for the structural i think that's why it's important that they have play a role here so if that last sentence what was on just on the screen were included in that can if you go up a couple pages there the last sentence the last sentence of a previous paragraph um was saying that they must provide evidence just back up a little bit well i guess i in the proposed order or in the attachment knowing what you were just showing on your screen the the plan yeah i don't have the plan open uh and i don't either that's why well prior to construction yeah that sentence if that were well but the so the condition routes you you know the condition says do the plan and so and then the plan it's it has so it's one of those situations where could put it in the condition but it becomes a redundant requirement i know i don't i don't think it has to be in the condition but i am concerned that this says that it that it is a particip you know it is participating participating in the royal fire district and again i think it's they can only ask they've asked to participate and then and here it's i don't know i don't you know the desert roll fire protection area or annex into the christmas valley rule for fire protection area i think the idea is that right now it reads more like this is marcy that it's an absolute that this can happen versus it's not guaranteed and how do we capture that well i think uh it's you put the word request participation evidence of requesting participation in the high desert rural fire protection area and that makes sense to me of its i don't i think i'm accurate here i might ask the other planners in the room kent and uh um and todd my experience is you can't you can't force them to be in the royal fire just because it's not their decision it's the real fire district's decision yeah and that's my experience as well business can't and but i also had the experience that if requested for annexation into the district but were unable to get that they could still contract for services from that district and i think that might be something that we want to add in here they request to annex into the rfpd or contract for services or particip request to participate in the rfpa um yes sorry i'm like so we have a letter from fire protection or from sarah this is this is from the fire district correct but we don't have a comment letter from the rfpa right right the fire district basically says yeah you can annex um but the applicant isn't necessarily representing that they will do that they're representing that they will i think maybe what is missing here is just the it is not it is likely that um coordination or like membership in the will happen but it's not a guarantee and it's kind of framed as a guarantee here but in a way it isn't uh councillor jenkins uh question about structural protection and the high desert rfpa is going to be more for wildfire and less for structural protection whereas the rfpd would be the provider of services for structural yeah i don't have the boundary maps but i assume the structure structures are in the rural fire protection district and i guess on long after is we probably need to go beyond um coordination with local rural fire protection that's here's the keys to the truck you want to drive it go ahead well i think we need more than that helen do you think maybe we could table this and go back and evaluate the relevant information on the record and make sure council has everything they need to propose a potential change yeah yeah i think so yeah it'd be a good idea if council is comfortable with that i appreciate that this is marcy and i just want to say i think these are the type of things that councils should do is have this kind of conversation but i definitely think it would be great to allow you time to go back and assess or whatever and then come back with us okay we will do that all right thank you one one other thing this is ken it might be that some of the response from what do i want to say here the the the applicant i guess will do maybe not wanting to annex to the district is because we're talking what 4 000 some acres but and that would that could be a big price tag to annex uh to the fire district possibly i don't whereas the structural fire protection would be just a portion a small portion of that area a contract for services with that fire district might be a lot or something that they could uh as opposed to annexing the entire boundary of the yeah so what you're recommending is um that that would be an ore or or a contract for structural protection yeah i i think that's i think that gets at you know what my concern was is structural protection going to rely on sarah to help me with these notes to address what i think um i think we want to be able to move forward and i think that maybe we'll con this and council will proceed maybe through",

        "text": " on a possible project out here in forest grove that would involve um upwards up to about 400 kw of community solar but our project would involve us um taking all the production credits and pushing them back into our low-income uh assistance program serving all of our customers that qualify for that program would that uh under the direction you have now would that qualify for as part of the this grant funding for direct energy cost savings to our families and small businesses from that language does that seem like that would rob um yeah definitely so the eligibility requirements are are pretty straightforward that there's technology eligibility and that has to essentially just be a renewable energy technology so 400 kilowatts of solar apply without question or would be eligible without question and then the the other eligibility requirement has to do with the actual applicant and so as long as the applicant was either you as the utility or some other public body that would make the applicant eligible and the way in which the benefits flow back to low-income members of the community would help it to score points within the competitive review process so yeah it sounds to me like it would be an eligible project that would do well in the program all right thank you rob charlie let's try again you're off mute you should be able to speak now can you hear me all right great um thanks uh and thanks for everything you guys are doing on this uh it's it's a really neat uh program um one of the we've we've got a project our community solar project that we're planning to build uh kind of late fall this year and it's starting to look like uh supply chain constraints are going to make it so that we have to uh start ordering materials uh soon we'd still like to be eligible for the grant and i'm wondering how you guys will handle you know any kind of uh costs that happen before you know you know before award i guess um can they count as the 50 or or is it does everything have to wait until after the award james do you want to take that one maybe yes um so eligible costs to be funded by the grant will only be those that are incurred after the application deadline and i just wanted to we'll check our definition of the project costs so the project costs will be the costs um incurred by the applicant as a whole so that is um just like the whole project for the renewable energy system but the only eligible costs will be those incurred after the um application deadline does that kind of make sense uh i think so so you're saying that if if it's all possible you know we would wait until after as it was june 10th to expend those funds for those funds you're hoping to claim uh by the grant yes okay so yeah and i think we have a really related question to um charlie you can stay off and did you want to follow up at all before i michelle had a question which was well projects that have already started purchasing materials or began prior to completing the application potentially qualify and i think well i should but it's the answer to that yes but those costs would not be reimbursable is that correct um so it's kind of how the rules have been written um in that the cost the project's still eligible but only those costs incurred after the application deadline would be um eligible costs for the grant um to be to fund for the grant funding to be used on roger just one thing and i think i think charlie mentioned that the for a renewable energy only project that's a constructive project the grant is only able to cover 50 of the funds and so i think the part of the question was getting to you know those funds that are expended prior to the grant deadline could those be counted in 50 of funds that are provided by the you not as necessarily as match but um as those funds that can't be reimbursed by the grant and therefore you know if you were starting a project now and incurred some costs anything that you purchased now i think would not be reimbursable but potentially could count as the 50 of project cost and i'm not sure i wanted to just clarify with james how we think about that um would those be eligible to count as the 50 of project cost that the local you you know that the partner is yes as we got it written in the rules that would uh that would be count but the funds expended could be included in that kind of total project cost but our funding would only be able to cover those costs that are expended after uh the application deadline so thanks for that clarification rob does that help charlie yeah i think that answers the question and and so um so long as we didn't spend you know uh beyond 50 we might still be in a position to to reap the benefit of the um of the funding okay and and that's that's how i see it at least at this point as we wouldn't we wouldn't be exceeding that so um so that uh that helps thank you and i think leah's question just got answered as we were chatting about can you use incurred costs before the application deadline for the matching portion for that matching portion for clean energy projects that then the answer i think is yes right yes and it's not like it corrects me if i'm wrong but it's not like precisely a dollar for dollar match it's just we can cover up to 50 of the cost for it for it all right any other questions any other i don't see any other hands raised nothing in the chat this is usually the time where like five questions come in at once uh keith i'll let you know when you're off mute all right you should be good thank you yeah keith horman again city force grove lighting power hey um does as part of that 50 match does in kind work done by the utility constitute a portion of that is it all just financial 50 percent um so i'm just looking at the precise language because we have um some language in our roles not covering kind of staffing costs that uh kind of would be covered in the ordinary um kind of work processes of the the project sort of thing all the the the organization i should say that's in the statute actually it's in the rules and the statute yeah yeah so if it's like if you hire a consultant or something like that that could be covered but staff for its existing staffing costs that's the limits that okay so you mean like we couldn't construct portions of the project or prep work that would not count towards it then our own crews i think that's correct we can keep we'll look into that to make sure because i think things like the could be covered you know but i think it's just the actual staff time it's like if it's an existing staff that seems like the statute was trying to dissuade against that gotcha okay thank you all right jennifer has her hand up go ahead jennifer um point with community solar um if there was storage added to something like that would that be considered a resilience project and be eligible for 100 or is a community solar project always going to be a just a renewable so adding storage to community solar could definitely turn a project into a resilience project so long as that storage was serving some community resilience function and so yeah definitely i think that we'll probably see more and more community solar projects adding storage for exactly that reason and within the competitive reviewing so you know there will be an evaluation of just how much resilience benefit is brought to the community through the project and so um you know a project that's a community space a library a fire hall things like this are really clear uh but if it's a you know a small battery that's just providing you know enough backup to charge some cell phones in in one location that probably won't score as but certainly adding batteries to community solar brings a project over into the side of the the projects and that's a 100 um reimbursement under the statute then okay thank you thank you jennifer all right tucker um i'll let you know when you're off mute with where jennifer was taking that there you go we can hear you now tucker can you hear me yeah okay better i'm just trying to follow up with where uh jennifer was taking that that question and just trying to better understand the resiliency side of this is i'm in the community working with community partners and they're gonna ask questions about kind of what resiliency means and another interest too and things like electric vehicle chargers and that sort of stuff is that rolls out kind of from the federal side so if you solar into an ev charging station or stall does that is that something that would qualify here too just from the transportation sector and kind of the importance of that for resiliency and whatnot by the way i appreciate you guys entertaining that oh yeah yeah no problem tucker and i owe you a phone call too i catching up for my vacation but i saw that you're in my voicemail uh rob do you want to take that one sure yeah so again if there's a if you can make the case that the solar part of the system is able to provide power to those charging stations in the event of a grid power outage it would be providing resilience benefits and we recognize the value of you know in the event of an emergency that could be very valuable resilience benefit to a community to have a fleet of vehicles that don't need when all the pumps at the gas stations are down you know that's potentially a very good resilience benefit but it would just have to be designed and constructed in such a way where the solar was able to provide you know charging to the to the station when the when the grid was down um one one follow-up to that just to understand what this project covers if you're if you're to do a project with multiple components like that where you're you know you're including ev charging or anything of that nature does it just cover the the actual power production itself you know in the solar array or wind energy or whatever or does it also cover the cost of your electric vehicle chargers and that and that piece of it electric vehicle charging infrastructure is eligible and i may kick it over to james if there's any specific reference to that but within the statute it calls that out as an eligible cost and so charging stations yes but thinking the vehicles no yeah yeah makes sense okay thank you great thanks tucker anybody else have any questions",

        "text": "us with them so kind of keep an eye on that it should be sort of interesting to see if that changes or if that continues but um but they kind of have like a few people that like hang out as independent so kind of interesting interesting Dynamic there um so I had I had also just wanted to share a couple of just quick notes on Big Picture policy items if you will or Dynamics one is that the capital will be under construction and like pretty significant construction they're doing seismic upgrades of the sort of middle of the building for those who are familiar there's sort of an old part that includes the Rotunda and most of the basement and then there's also wings and then there's also where the Committees are is also in addition so those areas are going to be open the wings and where that Edition is but the middle of the building which includes the two legislative Chambers will be closed they're going to keep the house chamber open for session and both the Senate and the house are going to be meeting there so not necessarily at the same time but like sharing the space so I think that'll just sort of change the Dynamics about like when floor sessions are held a lot in historically the Senate house we're offer meeting at the same time so just kind of know that it'll be a little bit different from usual because of that and also if any of you come to the Capitol my understanding is that quarters are going to be very tight so just be mentally prepared and there might be some we're still kind of waiting to hear of meetings will be virtual sometimes in order to like discourage the public from coming in person because there's no space for everybody so anyway it should be interesting to see how that works and then there's also um a somewhat unclear budget picture that was yet another relatively stable revenue forecast just last week earlier this week um the December forecast happened in and so but I say it's unclear because the state economists are expecting a mild recession I mean I think anybody who's paying attention is expecting a mild recession for the country that will affect the state and how that will affect Oregon's budget is kind of to be determined for those who've been paying attention to the legislature and our state budget in the past we we sort of tend to feel the effects later because of our Reliance on income taxes so our Revenue picture might look good right now but that could change if that mild recession leads to changes in people's income the state Economist presentation made it sound like they're not as concerned about that in Oregon at this point because of the because of the continued low unemployment rate so our last recession had a high unemployment rate this doesn't seem like that'll likely to happen this time so we'll kind of see how it goes for us but our dependence on the income tax makes this very very vulnerable to the sort of ups and downs of the economy I mean we just feel it late so we'll just see how that happens but I expect that you'll see a fairly sort of small C conservative attitude toward the state budget by leaders because of that dynamic the major issues I'm sure you all already read this at this point but the governor's come right in and said housing and homelessness are her number one issues it's a Statewide issue it's not a Portland issue it's Oliver and so that'll be item number one very related to that is public is behavioral health overall there's a lot of conversations about Workforce in part because of the tightness of the hiring Market I-5 Bridge replacement was really contentious in the past and didn't happen that's coming back again as an issue our public defense system has been in crisis for quite some time in Oregon and then finally ballot measure implementation measure 114 for example the gun control ballot which I've already seen that legislators are thinking about making some tweaks or changes to that in the session ahead so I can go to the next slide and actually if anyone wants to ask questions on the big picture that would be fine and then we could go into energy topics or it can wait till the end whatever works best for you all and then yeah I think of course um thank you and did am I correct that the Democrats lost their super majority they did yes yes any thoughts on on how that plays yeah I to be completely candid I think that was just sort of a fun media story for the media to talk about I don't think it'll make any big changes in how things actually work there hasn't been much talk about taking on major tax reform or increasing taxes or anything like that and the super majority is only important when it comes to revenue votes there was a big tax measure in 2021 is that right no 2019 that came into effect later which was the Student Success act which was a new corporate activities tax that's certainly been talked a lot about since it passed and that I think it was pretty painful so I don't I mean as far as like how it felt for legislators and and how it's felt since and I don't think that anyone was planning to run up that hill again so I don't think in practice it's going to mean that much but it's definitely something I've noticed the news media really being excited to talk about thank you yeah no problem um and then anticipate sorry I couldn't hear an echo in the room so was there another question or was that just that little Echo no question great thank you so as far as energy topics goes here's why you might be seeing a lot of me or a lot of um our our citing staff talking to you about the legislative session ahead um really there's two top energy issues for this session and one of them is citing reform and we're gonna hear next month you all are gonna hear next month I'll come to um from one of the folks who's leading that particular effort and we can dig in and kind of see where that's headed for now what I can tell you is that there's been meetings with a lot of folks with a lot of different opinions on the line to talk about citing reform um those meetings have been happening for maybe three months now and um there's a placeholder legislation that would actually direct our agency the department of energy to do a study on citing reform um I think that's just a placeholder and that legislation is intended to sort of be what comes out of this group that's been meeting and talking but if nothing comes out of that group it wouldn't surprise me if some sort of study bill is what forward so I don't know much detail about that because it's all kind of to be determined so just know next month you're going to get like a whole a whole presentation on it and can ask questions of the people that are kind of leading that effort um we're tracking it closely me citing staff or paying a lot of attention so that we're ready um and I just want to make it really clear that the Coalition leader that you'll hear from next month has made it really obvious in both how she's acted and the words that she has said that she really cares about our expertise particularly I should say the expertise of our sighting team so I think we're really well positioned to make sure that we're like at that table and that your opinions and the opinions of citing staff and of the agency are considered in whatever is to come and I kind of want to pause and see if anybody wants to ask about that although again we don't know specifics or if anybody from the sighting team wants to say anything about that quickly yeah Christy uh the record talk about the thing I would say on there is uh chair grail for her day job has also been uh sitting in on those meetings maybe not every one of those but I think she's got a good handle on this as well so that obviously helps us in terms of you know her being able to help translate that to council as well but uh at that point I don't really have anything else to say about that I think we can you know unless uh chair grow would like to I think we'll just uh you know wait and hear from uh orianna magnera uh next month I think she'll be able to give a really good presentation on that the thing this is chair Grail that I'd say in addition to that just in general I've said it numerous times energy sexy right now everybody wants to play in our space and it doesn't stop and there are so many people on this meeting that Christy is talking about um that you kind of cringe and say wow it's too much too many um the other thing that keeps coming up is hydrogen now we've gone to a whole conference on that and I think when I I listen to different legislators everyone acts as if we're not doing things right now so I think it's super important that whatever we're doing that we make it clear we're we're doing things to be ready we're not just you know this boom's not coming it's super frustrating I have to be clear you know I'm here for my day job and all that uh but it's it's very fascinating to uh to listen as we move forward of how we're going to be affected and I think that some of the developers might try to jump on board with these legislators who don't think we're acting in in a prudent way quickly but I think our processes are going to be more important than ever to to stand to stand up so just an observation that I've witnessed um the last thing I'll say I watched this uh citizens Utility Board policy conference and for the first time that I'm aware they excluded all the utility CEOs and they made it a community thing and so the pressure with more people being engaged even outside of quote Professionals in the business um I I think we're going to feel a shift that I don't know what that looks like but there definitely are different perspectives that we haven't been engaged with previously if I may just kind of reiterate the point that shared robot up about the sort of narrative that's out there this is also one of the reasons why yesterday you know I felt it was important to bring up the farm and Forest report and also the sort of status of you know f-sec solar projects I mean we have 3.6 gigawatts of active solar right now just under f-sect but those narratives that are out there don't talk anything about what's happening they just talk about the need for you know the future and that's why I think it's important that you know that information gets shared it gets put out there obviously the apartment Forest report will be given to",

        "text": " we're going to work on today you know is the Criterion wait yeah we're going to hopefully develop my charity today if narrative we adopted the full list of eligible measures that are provided in the federal guidance side next slide this is a slightly abbreviated list from the federal guidance measure of Life utility full management vegetation management reconductorate underground a real hardening measures two-thirds of the way down you'll see there's an asterisk on the microgrids and batteries those are eligible Technologies under the program but we have another program I don't know the fund those and the feedback that we got the utilities was to focus more on the hardens and so that's going to be our focus in the first two rounds and also like pulling down for the last measure so the last bullet here new generation and cyber security are not included in this program it's a new generation includes solar wind type the generation projects that could be tied to uh are there any that stand out to you is most interesting or kind of propellant in terms of projects that you were coming in thank you yeah we'll give everyone a moment if it but I really like the list in general I think I think the development of this holistic I'll put a lot of thought I'm into it I'm going to speak for our system just because that's that's what I know um relocation reconducting and Powerline very important to this vegetation management and fuel of management is very important to this Fleet at 1600 miles of power lines that crisscross and the most burgundy service territory surrounding you know 30 foot right away surrounded by 150 foot trees so anything that we can do to mitigate that risk it doesn't really matter whether it's fire or snow or anything or when that's when those trees go down so I like the middle part that listed a lot only speaking from from my viewpoint as as you evaluate some of the stuff I would think that folks in the city may go months and months and months without an average uh folks in the country they may go weeks you know sometimes days depending on where they live so I think it needs to be weighted that day uh a little bit again is speaking for me uh as you're considering that I was uh looking at the actual reliability statistics of the areas that are impacted by it if you're if you're aiming at a more resilient period than the places that are out or should it should be a lot more thank you so I'm looking at uh distributed energy resources including micro birds and batteries and there's like an it's got the same amount of funding as this program focuses on microgrids and renewable energy and for that reason we're steering this program more away from microbrids and towards the grid hardening and so while it's an eligible measure of the program it's um it's not going to be a priority with them small criteria unless we decide as a group that we want to change that okay great thank you Bob is announcement include that in the sum part of it that it's clear that this funding could not be used for certain uh measures like the purchase of solar panels so it's more like complementary measures is that right yeah so that sub is qualifying that last goal of where a new generation is not included but batteries on their own can be considered a distributed internet resource of program will provide a batteries but not new as as we look at the by consequence extreme events that have occurred over the last several years large Geographic areas are are shut down dead bust as part of the creation Public Safety power cutoffs and this program Health utilities designed for intentional islanding like cougar dam was brought back online and I in the heated battle so can this program help BPA and and the core and utilities come up with contingency plans at one of wildfires coming through a particular area or an ice storm or whatever they can you know isolate the threatened areas without losing power to large swaths of Defenders yeah so the monitoring and control technology excluded using and circuit reclosers and all sorts of brain control hanging some of our Utility Partners can speak in that development to a degree that's kind of hard to do the way our system or instructors and so much the model system um so it's you know for us example we can't I don't know it's dark there's the island of portions of our system because there's no other source of wow I mean you could iron a lot of stuff so we don't have generation internally to be able to say you know take this second off but we can back them through here because we have our own generation but building more transition to be able to have loot speeds and other feeds in fact definitely would help them we don't have a lot of distributive generation I know Pacific Northwest National Labs is working on how to Island small Hydro working with BTA and the poor and BLM that might be something to explore yeah good idea but one one thing we had we had a 100 system out of in 2019 due to a snow storm and one thing down about three quizzes and folks didn't have communications infrastructure didn't have enough reliable backup um sustainable so we not only will power we kind of went darker down when system went down because uh you know Jared the college field wasn't fueled or possibly didn't start I can't remember the exact thing you know this could help folks are in the communications and protector and provide reliable backup power so you can communicate because that got to be a pretty hard to stand a system back up when no one could talk on excellent no we have a kind of on the same lines of this fund any sort of backup power or individual not for individual residences but something like emergency response and Communications that's probably an instance where this program could look at batteries and put them in a positive competitive Light Within the Matrix that that's what the group decides we want to um so that's a good example and we're Standalone batteries can bring a lot of value outside of the discussion of microgrids and solar and stuff but just you know electricity along with a tall Vision but one thing that that's notable taught us was all the other utilities right and I says well we're clean water wastewater firefighting all of those without electricity didn't work right so happy Brazilian degree was beneficial but also been having the ability to to stand alone for short periods of time while things are being rebuilt I think is very important for folks to consider as well so could the results of the concept be supported by this or like a community center it's not an individual but a community center would be able to to support the essential services that would probably go through our crap program but resilience novel much more likely to go through that from the town because this could not for example by the solo or any generation for the site um and the feedback we've had pretty overwhelmingly from utilities is to focus on the more traditional we're reliability measures and there's other lots of funding that are focusing on the voting balance that so we've got good opportunities to fund those to stop in this program I think most most Utilities in our headphones we have backup generators to keep things online but more non-resistible will another random is solar with battery storage it's a limit pattern as we started the generator we can run for short average times off of our battery stores and not have to start the generator that's right um order provided and then we also as part of that and provide a community gathering in place for folks during this low-income housing it's a little mobile home trailer parks and things would be a place to town stay warm and more stay cool and get water and those kind of things not for this program we have a couple of questions uh from folks participating virtually I want to make sure to move into so we've got a question on resources to help rural counties plan so they can participate in these programs you know something that we've talked about as potential technical assistance and we've also interacted a number of written documents that will be available like items but are there any additional thoughts on that my understanding is that this does not provide planning funds and instructions my understanding that it really is construction projects plus some Instagram both of theirs so planning that's another thing that we could do through the sea breath program we have planning funds which also build a session a bit of access to provide exponents and penalties you're planning so there are resources getting in that direction but again and then a follow-on on backup uh our wood program Sprint Customer owned backup generators be eligible and I can be a number of this some of the previous questions yeah um customer all resources available in this program the only eligible applicants are electric utility can you speak to you know you're seeking our feedback you know what jumps out at you from this list how are you going to use this input from this open house because you've already submitted your application and presumably so are you just trying to get some of the fine details or are you trying to rank based on our comments what you're going to uh say is the highest use of these types of projects you're going to say you know for example Douglas likes um you know reconductoring so we should move that up on the list in terms of the projects to be funded or how are you going to use this open house information that you're Gathering I guess yeah so we're starting with these sort of broad discussions to get an idea of the types of projects that we're going to see and we'll actually talk about some specific projects in a couple of slides and we want to focus that as we go through today so that in another hour or less we're actually creating a list of selection criteria with the weight for how the competitive review process has been available in this program so that's what we want to build today is the competitive selection criteria get a hierarchy for how that looks we've got some proposed broad categories for those criteria that we'll look at and talk but really right now is our blank page for criteria and that's where we're going with all of this is to establish that process so we have as I understand it we have nine million dollars right here one 19 billion dollars for year one is right now 9.9 it'll get both years in the first okay all right so hear me out so for the c-o-u-n which I'm mostly is that 40 of 9 million you're one right so that's 3.9 million that's Brit is math not mine so we could go back to that budget I'm going to make a point here",

        "text": " of this economic opportunities analysis to try to address some of the concerns that you've had or some of the ideas that that you have don't be shy I don't think anybody any of you are shy well and uh Jerry you prompted discussion on the code itself on the development code which I think at least the EI industrial employment Zone language is um is good is fair uh reasonable I'm I'm not uh necessarily identifying a lot of areas for improvement there per se um but yeah kind of what Bruce is hitting on and and some of the bullet points here uh relating to annexation and infrastructure I think uh would would be really impactful uh and I'm curious you know when you say the Tonkin employment area I'm assuming that includes the the gun um the Tri-County Gun Club is that is that right Bruce well you know and maybe Erica would have a comment about that but I think I think the council was really focusing in this because it doesn't say anything more than this I think they were focusing really on how do we complete the current Tonkin employment area but obviously I'm inter I'm very interested in trying to see if there's some opportunities over time to expand the boundaries of the talk and employment area uh which would then have to be outside the urban growth boundary because frankly I see over the next and and uh next X number of years that The Talk The usable land frankly the usable land and the talking employment area that's of suitable size are really going to be done they're going to be spoken for uh where that's feasible where the slopes are not too significant and where this potential for infrastructure to come come in and and uh and where land can be assembled because there's a lot of smaller properties in that in the interior areas so I I don't know if it includes that but I think your comments with that or that would be appreciated of course yeah well I mean it was kind of a baseline question um back to the uh the analysis of uh of what area we have relative to what area we need by way of office and Industrial uh land and you know I missed a lot of meetings so I wasn't sure uh what was included in that Baseline and and Tonkin is a large area most of which I think is probably in the city of Tualatin anyway sort of east of 124th um but regardless a lot of the developments like hours that you mentioned Bruce the one behind me um you know we had to Annex and um you know that has its own set of um same with uh you know the curb property the the Schnitzer property I think still needs to Annex and I'm looking at a city boundary along that that Eastern side um Sherwood West will need to Annex there's something around annexation that that I think may be prime one of the things that uh caused me uh as the developer a little bit of consternation was not being I had to Annex before anything else um before city of Sherwood say could sign off on a traffic study or utility study or even have a pre-app things like um so maybe there's some flexibility in sort of the sequence and we can get a you know unofficial quote-unquote uh look at some things before annexation uh um what would be an idea around that so I've come across that in other states where they have pre-annexation approaches and I don't know if you can do that in Oregon I'm too young in Oregon well you can yeah you can do a you can do an annexation yeah you can do a development agreement around uh annexation agreement that sort of lays it all out and allows you to to get going um and we've done that elsewhere I have a thought about annexation too I can mention um so whether it's that is certainly one factor is what it's required to be done and how much progress you can make but also just the ease of annexation really varies really widely across the region so some jurisdictions you have to submit a whole application with a whole narrative and have your consultant do all this stuff and it takes a long time and in others it's literally a one-page form with just the property owners information and signatures needed so and that's you know that's that's Happy Valley which is really Pro annexation and has been doing a lot of annexation so you could look at the code and now I think it still takes no I think it's only one hearing so it's not it's still not going to be overnight but if the process is a lower barrier then you might have Property Owners saying oh I could Annex and get zoned industrial pretty easily and then I could sell my property for more money and get that site ready earlier yeah that's a great that's a great Point Louisiana and I don't even know from a policy legal perspective can you Annex a property without the property owner's yeah no you can try to Loop them though that's what they trade with Nike right you can encircle them somehow yeah that still doesn't it still doesn't always work tektronix is another one yeah yeah so what other issues are you seeing that that maybe should be should be the focus in terms of some of the some of the recommendations that we might want to make uh in this in this report uh just based on on experience I mean uh not gonna call on people but I know Colin has been very involved in Economic Development maybe I am economic development for many years and and has seen some some best practices and and maybe there's some things that Colin might be able to suggest or uh Nick from greater Portland uh I'm just throwing out some names here Nick from greater Portland what what he's seeing because he's working to recruit uh traded sector companies to our region to the metro area and certainly sees what they do in in other states uh in terms of encouraging the growth of traded sector and Manufacturing and and tech companies do you want me to go first yeah you can go first Colin sorry yeah I mean as far as the uh the framework for for everything that's here I think it looks fine I think um you know like everything uh like hairstyles and you know jeans uh everything's trendy things change over the decades we all know we see these Trends in our regional economy and that's that that goes for manufacturing too there's there's different types of manufacturing right there's a continued Trend into North America for near Shoring or rear Shore reassuring but also near Shoring you know moving some things to Mexico that were in China and then building more of a uh you know localizing that supply chain so I I think my my perspective is having some larger parcels and by large I don't mean 500 Acres I mean um you know 50 or 80 or 100 but having some larger Parcels where you can have Tech uh diverse Tech Parks I think are always a great thing as our economy changes and more morphs where they're there are many where it's dense as far as I'm not talking about high-rises or anything but I just spent you know uh jobs packed into sites uh in whatever sense that makes but I think adaptability as the economy shifts as we have growth around the renewable sectors things around manufacturing for tied to EB's Lithium-ion batteries and uh you know future Technologies um hydrogen Technologies Etc I'm not I'm not talking about a science fiction novel but just saying as long as you're as long as the goals and the zoning allow for flexibility to capture future growth that's very key and then the other you know I guess I'll go back to the personal size and I think Kirk Kirk could uh chime in on this but I think it's it tends to be easier to develop Parcels that are a little bit larger versus orphan parcels and I know over the years um there's there's been lots of sites around Metro you know 12 acres eight acres here at their kind of infill but if you have some nice sized rectangular or Square Parcels um that would be something to to strive for but I like you know I like your idea of Shifting towards higher wage jobs where you can attract some of the residents of Sherwood I I like every I like where this plan is I like where you're going and I don't have any you know my my feedback for any community in the region is just to be as flexible as as possible provide flexibility because we never know where the market is going to be five years four years three years ago I think uh I was in meetings and people had no idea government was gonna do what it's done so I just the more flexible plan can be and then I would also just one one comment you know there's think back to the trendiness of things the semiconductor task force it's a great uh it's a great vessel or engine but it's it's a bit more of a thought generator they're throwing ideas on the wall that are going toward to the legislature and the governor the new governor is creating a budget these things will all come together and there will be sausage making Oregon still has our tax base that cannot afford a New York state type of plan uh we just can't throw billions of dollars at one specific industry and and I just want to put that reality out there I think there will be some very uh things that you'll see that's my that's my guess and I I'm putting that out there you know publicly I know this is a recorded session but there there will be progress and there will be new tools maybe new tax credits who knows there's a lot of things on the wall but I think I would not develop your plan around this one specific industry in this one specific point of time but having a broader Advanced manufacturing um you know to where you might want to grow that sector of the economy would just being more flexible and more open-minded because we don't know how the tools and policies will really pan out uh I think there'll be a lot of positive energy and activity but I'm not I'm just a staffer you know I'm not making I'm not I'm not an elected official and I think yeah I think there's just going to be a lot of debate and uh there'll be new policies new programs but and and those will be coming in over multiple years and I think the tendency what I'm hearing is that this focus on high-wage jobs and Manufacturing that offer jobs or have a career path for non-majority populations is going to be a Focus right so obviously semiconductor has started to do a pretty good job of integrating women into the workforce of uh black",

        "text": " on um they're they're still working through some really preliminary um contracting um down in california you know relating to the consultants that could hire to do this work so i don't really have too much more to share on this yet either engaging with public outreach with oregon stakeholders is one of the the big reasons we wanted to get involved as well so stay tuned i think is is probably the big takeaway for that i just wanna know yeah there was a couple hands up i saw sean's hand earlier but joshua's hands up right now so i wanted to um go to joshua to see what his question or comment was and invite sean if you wanted to put your hand back up if you wanted to make a comment or question you can do that too go ahead joshua all right okay thanks joshua fan with climate solutions um it seems like you know kind of at a high level sort of in the broad scope of things there's a lot of questions outstanding questions about transmission availability i'm you know i'm a policy guy so kind of looking at this at you know at a fairly high level you know not only questions about if there will be transmission available for the three gigawatts you know that's the but also looking into the future you know 5 10 15 20 gigawatts that's of floating offshore wind um but boom is you know seems to be moving fairly quickly towards possible leases um so i'm wondering if if you are with bone kind of thinking about the of these things making sure that you know as their process moves forward and there's possible leases that the transmission is in place and then also wondering um there's a study that odo did in december on regional transmission organization um that specifically living offshore wind um and you know the cost benefits they could come from sharing that cost among uh different beneficiaries in different states have you looked at that rto study in your in your scenario planning i can start and then maybe pass it to some of my colleagues thanks for um raising those uh questions joshua and especially for um sharing with the broader audience the regional transmission operator study um just as a quick kind of response as we understand from boem their process will take um many years and part of the call area that they're putting out is to understand better what the market interest is from developers and developers will have a bit more detail on sort of the pros and cons of certain locations as it relates to transmission access but there is likely needed investment there as you've heard from from this presentation and probably others um and i'm you know who covers the cost of those investments some are related specific to specifically to a project but also there's some bigger um transmission operators in the region that have been thinking about this too good questions as far as it relates to our coordination with boehm we we have been coordinating with bone they're familiar with this with this study and um our work but i think they're also really looking to the boem call area release as uh to get a better understanding of developer and market interest and then adam and jason well do you want to add anything to that response and adam do you want to say anything more specific about the rto study and i can put that in the chat for people too yeah thanks ruchi and thanks for the question um so i i led that study on the regional transmission organization effort back in the fall for those who might not be aware and ruchi if you could put that in the chat that'd be great i think the issue there um as as i think about this really has to do with so if you look at this map that's displayed on the screen right now the sort of uh pinkish color to our south right in california is the california independent system operator um they have a peak load of i want to say it's in the 40 000 megawatt range it covers 80 some percent of the state of california um it allows them to do more regional planning and understand regional needs you know across multiple utility service territories so contrast that with the northwest but you can see here we have dozens of balancing authorities different utilities that are each planning resources balancing their uh independently so when it comes to thinking about large-scale resources like offer wind uh there has been some suggestion that an rto may potentially help facilitate thinking about that sort of resource planning over over a longer time horizon um i wouldn't say it's a prerequisite but it's i think could be a potentially helpful mechanism should one uh develop here in the in the years ahead thanks adam yeah i can't think of anything to add i think there was a i'm trying to remember it was uh had a multi-faceted question there from josh i believe it was um but i think it's he had some early questions about timing and you know that's kind of why we're here to some extent um of course we're here because boehm um is also here and and starting this process but um it's easy to kind of lose track of the forest for the trees a little bit i think at least i kind of hear a lot of questions about um scope and timing and who's going to buy it and you know are we going to build all this stuff where we're going to build it when one is going to be built the the scale that we need to do to the scale development to kind of beef up the ports um even just the timelines from the earlier enroll study we're looking at like the cost effectiveness of of the technology itself coming down you know 10 years from now so transmission's another long lead time item you know it it takes 10 15 years kind of just to scratch the surface and get get projects permitted and planned and designed before construction even begins and then a few years of construction you can always count up too so it'd be great if if this stuff kind of organized itself but but there's a lot of moving pieces here you know just starting the conversation now about 10 15 years ahead of ahead of when some of these resources might first get built is really is really the first step in kind of making sure that we're thinking about and we are coordinating all these activities across all these different planning entities and regions and um interests and you know the the local community and tribal engagement and i mean there's just this is a big project um or a big big series of projects really big scope and and everybody's kind of doing their best and trying to look around corners and see how we can plan for the future awesome thanks jason i'm gonna move over to sean for for your question or comment go ahead you know i i just wanted to jump in and and first thank everybody for the presentation jason i think is got a provide a lot of good helpful information with respect to what the the northern grid processes look like and what transmission looks like a couple of you know minor points of clarification at northern grid we received only two economic studies and there's still a process that has to go through the the membership and and the state representatives with respect to deciding which of those uh two will uh ultimately end up being selected etc so that like jason described that'll that'll end up having to play itself out one thing i wanted to touch on with respect to you know just offering a little bit of more information or a bit of a clarification is with respect to transition planning transmissions planning you know what the the goal transmission planning is to meet essentially the needs of of at the local level the the transmission provider and at the at the regional level the needs of the membership of that region and and needs are pretty specifically defined they relate to reliability and load service needs and then also those commercial obligations uh that jason described uh so you know read into that as transmission service requests and and so those are the needs that are um you know the uh trying to be met now inclusive of those are your public policy requirements um you know like hb 2021 like ceta et cetera those will drive those needs right you know to the extent that you have new transmission service requests uh you'll you'll have to plan in order to be able to meet those needs one thing i wanted to make sure that everybody understood is not currently part of the transmission planning process you know the order 1000 process as you know described by ferc is interconnections generally are not considered as part of the transition planning process um those come later uh you know integrating new resources into the system uh happen uh or they get planned for as those those transmission service requests get made because that's what you're actually then trying to use to deliver those resources to load um because an interconnection can take on a couple of different forms it can take on just you know essentially what amounts to plugging it in versus actually delivering it to a specific load in a specific location and and because of that that's one of the reasons that interconnections are not something that's typically viewed as as part of the transition planning process and and that's not to say that when trying to interconnect a resource like offshore wind um that analysis won't be done in order to facilitate it it will it's just part of a separate process and um just just uh just a small point of of clarification and and i really want to also uh emphasize the notion of of transmission rights um you know that's uh uh what i was alluding to earlier when we were talking about uh california is potentially being an off taker and you know there's still maybe a bottleneck at the inner tie so the ac the dc inner tie etc because uh in order to uh schedule energy to flow across those those those those facilities those paths you have to have transmission rights that you can utilize in order to do so and and transmission rights the amount of available transmission capacity are the things that are born out of the reliability planning processes and so that's why you know i again i just you know uh wanna and i probably sound like a a broken record uh i just wanna emphasize that um you know before uh uh we get too settled in on on really thinking that you know 2.6 or three or whatever is the number that the system can actually handle that we allow these processes to play themselves out um you know because you know uh just you know you know i don't want uh what i would hate to see is everybody get uh overly",

        "text": " it that was Ryan administrator so and just so and just so I because I have such a wonderful um audience I will say that prior to Juliana's arrival I really want to appreciate Brian zinc's uh support in some of the programs that you are enrolled in you are one of the few cities that's enrolled in the in our green future Enterprise program um and Ryan was really in goal along with um uh Robert Chandler they were really supportive so I want to give a shout out to them because well the mayor's in the room I appreciate that Wendy thank you little I thanks buy all right did you have one working yeah it's just a followup on that so like I want to think I understand it but like I'm not sure I do help me understand what the opportunity or the benefit is for somebody being enrolled both in the the current ly existing program like and the CommunityWide program because like I I guess I'm just stuck like wait they would be it's like the same thing but it's it's not the same thing so uh I'm not gonna say it makes a ton of sense to do both okay what I will tell you though is that you know looking at data across the electric utility industry customers hate it when utilities make changes on their bills to voluntary things without giving them the option right you know like there's a lot of drivers on our bills we can't control we can't control what a particular City's franchise fee is for example that's just going to get passed through no matter what um but we know that opting customers out of a program that they have already chosen to be in is a way to make customers very mad and as a rule we try to avoid making our customers very mad that makes sense okay but like logically it you'd pick one or the other you you wouldn't I mean it seems a little illogical to do both as the individual like subscriber rate pairer the the reason that you would choose to do both is because you want to contribute even more to you know climate change efforts or renewable energy efforts there are also components of our green future program that um are not just climate goals like we have green future habitat that goes to I believe like salmon restoration um things like that so you know you might want to do that because you might want to be supporting um stream restoration or something something like that that this program might not be funding okay thank you all right we are going to bring this portion of the agenda to close we really appreciate you folks all the folks from pte being here I think this is a really great conversation it certainly helped my understanding and I hope that everybody benefited from it look forward to followup conversations as well as we move this if we wherever this thing goes I but thank you feel free to reach out we're happy to have more conversations we appreciate your time thank you so much everybody thank you pulling this all together we really appreciate it thank you all right and with that we are on to item six and I'm going to turn it over to Juliana to take us through uh updates sorry folks let me all right so I'm gonna go through this really quick apologies um so first is did we have any more questions or comments on um the uh reporting metrics for um our oh and this didn't show them how it I'm so sorry um I sent out the email uh after last uh climate action plan meeting um did anyone have questions or comments on the metrics that we' looked at and counselors uh Phillips and Gonzalez I can no longer see you so if you have questions please just speak up testing testing did I jump up we can hear you we just can't see you so jump in if you guys have questions I can't see your hands or anything anybody everybody good on that all right all right sounds good um next we got the draft of the uh airport solar feasibility study they are working on edits they've evaluated eight sites on a few uh metrics including mounting types uh utility analysis glare analysis emission savings financial analysis and resiliency and battery storage and um as alluded to earlier um commissioner Slater did ask for them to uh see if could add in what it would look like if it wasn't just based on net metering um I don't know if they'd be able to add that into um the study at this point but we do have a good basis to start those conversations if that's what is needed yeah so can I okay um so the I think there are two options with the airport um the easier option and the one that we know pencil's out at least one of the options pencil's out is to do a net metering project that would um pay for the cost of the airport operation which was the original intent of this um so the second option which they didn't assess so we don't know if the pencil's out but we would need to talkg PGE is whether we want to look at the airport's a potential solar farm um as one of these under 20 megawatt facilities where we then sell power back to PGE um so what that would give us would be an increased resiliency right because then um you know all our power is shipped in none of it's generated locally so as Wildfire problems increase as the demand for power goes up we're kind of in a situation where we're completely dependent on pge's transmission line so one thing that that would give us is the opportunity to have some local power in the summer when we need it most the air conditioners are running it wouldn't do any good obviously in the winter right but still so I think that's something that that you and the council need to decide if you want to pursue that option I don't have enough information to say that a good option but I think it's just not considered in the report so there is two paths to this and I would just urge you if you look at both of them thank appreciate um the next is the urban heat island mapping so um Noah has a faction that is the national integrated heat health information system and they have an annual application for urban heat island mapping um it is open that application is open in December and they do the mapping in uh July August time frame um there have been a couple done in Oregon last year there was a regional partnership between Hillsboro Beaverton tiger and Washington County and um what our thought is is to partner and make our application Regional as well with Salem being the leading um organization on that uh for direct costs it would be about $220,000 they don't require the cost it is an optional but it does make your um application a bit more competitive so something to think about um and then it's about 100 volunteers that are doing about five volunteer hours each so um another reason for not applying for it this year we want to build for our 2025 to have that capacity and then for indirect costs um the climate action plan did mention that it wanted to be adequately compensating volunteers and so um I would like to go after grants for um a pass through to a community based organization to pay volunteers for their time help offset child care costs and um then have that be kind of our plan for working in the community and then um what I would like some help with is knowing what we would like this information for so part of the application is saying what actionable items would you you use this map for so um I've been talking to Gretchen and seeing how um the homelessness and heat response um could be informed by this type of map but if there are other um items that we would like a urban heat Island map to inform would be really useful to know and for Partnerships uh Maran county is interested in being a partner as well as um Kaiser uh had had some interest in might have interest as well so we're looking at kind of um 100 square kilometers in this area to um get now any indication from Counting assuming the health departments in the counties would be would find some of this information I have not approach P County but they are on the list to yeah definitely talk to that I that and I have some additional ideas about that'll we talk to afterwards okay uh hey julan how how would this fit in with the the U urban forestry grant that we received from USD love that you asked that I'm not sure if we'd be able to do those in the right time because this would be um rolling out 20125 I don't think that there's goes long enough that but it could if it does have some overlap in the time atmosphere it could help with um getting trees planted to where it would have the biggest impact um and then the climate Champion partnership so uh Maran County for um the past uh since 2007 has had Earthwise um they're now transitioning to Marin County sustainable business Network they have over 100 businesses enrolled most of those are in Salem and they would like to partner with the City of Salem to add West Salem um they have a new software called Green Biz tracker it's kind of the standard in this realm it's called um or it's uh from the California sustainable business Network and um they are asking for the partnership be because they can't work in P County that we would do the um audits the walkthroughs the technical assistance guidance and the certification for West Salem and um would also when we have available provide them with meeting spaces then um they have most of their businesses are Salem um and then we would also assist with the business Network and the annual Summit and they would continue to do all of the operations for Maring County businesses um so we are working on anou and it would be wonderful to have your support um if you are a current Maran County Business um or even a West Salem business business you can right now register um they have uh included us in their um in their business software contracts through 2025 after that we could discuss possible uh cost sharing but there's no guarantee at this point it's just have that discussion after can you give us an idea of like what like is that $100 $110,000 $8,000 for Marin County I think that if we were looking at the number of businesses in Sal it would be somewhere around half but I really don't know what that convers and then Community engagement so um Salem 350 invited me to their meeting in January um will at University is engaging with the climate action plan for a",

        "text": "hi everyone my name is Ruchi sudhir and I'm associate director for strategic engagement at the Oregon Department of energy and with me today is my colleague Casey Radcliffe the Oregon renewable energy citing assessment project manager this presentation provides an overview of the Oregon renewable energy sighting assessment also known as orisa which was a multi-year grant focused fees and constraints around energy in continued renewable energy development is anticipated in the coming decades and developing these energy resources involves balancing issues related to military operations land use Economic Development natural and cultural resources and Community needs and interests among others through coordination and processes at all levels of government including Federal tribal state and local specifically a question that we continue to receive is you know we've heard there's a need for more renewable energy development in Oregon to meet the state's energy and climate change goals but how much renewable energy and where is it all going to go while this entire question is larger than the scope of our project it is a question that we're really interested in and our project does provide robust data and information to inform it the project deliverables are a new educational resources communities policy makers developers tribes and government agencies interested in renewable energy policies and potential projects by providing a common understanding through data-driven approaches and enhancing early coordination notification the erisa project was funded through the U.S Department of Defense and it closed in June of 2022 with continued maintenance of the mapping and reporting tool planned to our intergovernmental team including the department of land conservation and development and Oregon State University's Institute for natural resources along with our military partners and local Liaisons at the Oregon Military Department and the U.S together our team worked with State local Federal and tribal governments along with gaining input from industry subject matter experts technical advisors and stakeholders across the the project scope and setting is the state of Oregon including on land and some offshore with broad consideration on Renewable Energy Technologies like wind and solar as well as Associated transmission infrastructure the project approach was to collect a baseline or state of play for Oregon by collecting intersectional data information and perspectives the project was also aligned with other ongoing and complementary work on renewable energy and project citing which is distinct but did inform the project findings and considerations our goal in partnering with the dod is to support military compatibility through coordination and early an early notification and raising awareness about military needs and interests in Oregon I'll highlight a few key points our project deliverables are considered discussion support and Educational Tools the tool is completely voluntary to use it does not substitute for information submitted to Regulatory Agencies at counties or the state for permitting this tool includes mostly publicly available data and information about energy military land and natural resources when a developer submits information about our proposed project to be evaluated for a permitting decision that information typically needs to be much more detailed and a reset project resources can help in the earliest stage of renewable energy development but will not replace the most more substantive analysis that's done in Project citing and permitting supporting renewable energy compatibility through coordination and early notification has been a strong goal of the military but has also become a major theme for others like cultural resource staff at tribes and local governments reviewing renewable energy projects all of whom want more coordination across government industry and communities finally our project engagement and deliverables were heavily driven by stakeholder feedback in order to create a collection of information and a new Baseline about renewable energy in Oregon with that I'm going to pass it to my colleague Casey Radcliffe to give you more project details thanks your G so our poor research was conducted through a series of consultant-led Assessments and an agency-led citing procedures review on the left of this image describes the three assessments that provided deep dives into renewable energy military and development opportunities and these assessments closed in the fall of 2021. key findings and data from these documents will fold into both the tool and the final report deciding procedures review also documented and visualized citing regulations permitting and project review processes the assessments and the procedures review relied on the expertise of State local and tribal governments collected input from industry and Technical advisors along with cross-sector stakeholder and Community engagement for example the opportunities and constraints assessment reached up to 400 stakeholders received 80 survey responses and hosted six Regional webinars with more than 140 different they also collected 650 spatial data sets 570 of which were renewed and considered for the mapping and Reporting the project had two major deliverables shown on the right side of this image which are the final report and the mapping and reporting tool to finalize these products we released the near final drafts and a beta tool and requested reviews and Corrections from stakeholders and project participants we then provided a series of presentations to receive final input and provide information to encourage awareness and use of these deliverables presentations included state agency staff boards and commissions the state land board and Senate energy environment committee government to government tribal natural resource and cultural resource meetings along with presentations to local government renewable energy associations groups together the project included more than 800 stakeholder touch points through 101 conversations surveys sector and topic specific meetings along with key deliverable for the grant was the final arrested report which is complementary to the online tool the first section discusses the project activities and methodologies including best practices for data collection the second section includes key findings from the assessments and contacts for the reporting functionality provided in the online tool the next section highlights critical conversations perspectives and issues from stakeholders and project and in the conclusion and appendices we have all of the assessment reports the procedures review summary Outreach and process documents and Military information along with final feedback from the tool and an index of data if you're new to our project we highly encourage you to start with a review of the executive summary in the report for example one key takeaway is that our assessment found that there is enough renewable energy potential in the state to lead Oregon's energy and sign the gloves while also acknowledging that there are trade-offs related to the impacts and benefits with development that need to be evaluated through sustainable and responsible processes there are notable challenges to renew energy development associated with transmission infrastructure and the citing and permitting criteria that way both policy and legal priorities for more details please check out the full report which is posted on the arrested project website the mapping and reporting tool is housed on Oregon Explorer and is curated by Oregon State University libraries and our partner at The Institute of Natural the tool includes robust data and queries for military Energy natural resources and Community Information along with other important users are able to interact with and browse spatial data they can also create site-specific reports to support early notification information they can review additional information such as regulatory processes Maps assessments and other tools that are not always reflectively the spatial data or part of this project to develop refine and test the mapping and reporting tool the Arisa team led by OSU INR hosted a series of nine focus groups with more than 60 participants many one-on-one meetings with agencies and staff from the Oregon nine federally recognized tribes cross-sector user group meetings and one-on-one beta testing with a half dozen cross-sector during this internet process the team gathered additional input and suggestions from almost 100 participants which informed develop of the final tool and information summarized in the final report in this final tool there are more than 250 data layers and you can explore those in the tool with more than 75 of those data sets queried in the final site level report as of June 30th 2022 the final deliverables were posted with additional project resources provided for reference and will continue to be developed to support increased awareness and use of the report in this room this also includes a new landing page on Oregon explorer that talks broadly about renewable energy features key information on this project and we hope will continue to be a platform for additional resources and tools in the future you can find this site by going to the Oregon Explorer home page and then clicking the renewable energy link ing ahead we continue to plan to maintain the tool we would like to develop new use cases and receive feedback via our online comment portal and we'd like to consider future functionality enhancements with your feedback you can sign up for email updates and you'll be notified of any future project activities or changes in closing the objectives of the arrested project was to Baseline data information and perspectives to create a transparent consistent collection of trusted accurate information in a way that would minimize conflict and support to achieve these objectives our project team and Consultants engage in extensive research and stakeholder Outreach the end result is a thorough assessment of renewable energy in Oregon that centralizes and makes accessible a vast amount of information to inform future renewable energy project and policy discussion we invite you and others to visit our online tool and the report and continue to explore our project website of supplemental information thank you",

        "text": " like to bring that energy resilience into the multi-family space we have programs that do it in single family but for the federal funds we just get a lot more bang for the buck doing storage and multi-family which is why we would like to do it in this program to really stretch those federal funds for and so again here's how it would kind of look where we have a rooftop solar program and that would deliver Bill savings to the residents of multi-family houses and then finally and also on battery storage for energy resilience and that brings us to some questions and the first one is how can the Coalition ensure that the benefits from a solar and storage installation are passed on to the residents of a multi-family housing unit and not just the owner and we have several developers in Oregon that have already done this successfully and we think that we can get this built into a program so that we have a prerequisite that anyone participating is passing these benefits onto the residents and not just the owner and of course this is another reason why we like battery storage in multi-family is that those benefits automatically ask to the residents of the building because they're available as backup power in the event of a power outage and so it's a way to ensure positive benefits right to the residents um again a similar question here how can the Coalition reach low-income and disadvantaged communities should a financing product be developed and how can Community organizations support and benefit from the program offerings so that's the concept for multi-family and I would like to just Rob we have a question in the chat and if someone could read that I don't actually have easy access family vendors leverage meter aggregation and only in that's a good question so the question related to how a solar installation might be um essentially spread across a multi-family housing unit where a lot of cases these multi-family housing developments have very minimal common loads for a solar installation to work on and so if you can aggregate The Meters from all of the residents you bring a lot more row load to the site for a solar project to to be able to support and this is one of the sort of technical questions around multi-family and solar that are you know developers are already facing and so we certainly will be looking at this and as mentioned in in IOU territories we have some meter aggregation programs that have already been implemented and it may be that we can come up with a program offering for investor-owned utilities for Consumer owned utilities meter aggregation is a matter for board or city council or other governing body and so what we would like to do is develop a program that has the flexibility to support projects in any utility service territory and hope that the meter aggregation is one of those items that can be worked out what the developer utility partnership that's put together for these projects but it's a really good question and one of the challenges of solar on multi-family developments so does that answer the question and I guess we can we can yes yes that does answer it okay great um so this slide is just a very brief thumbnail view of the two Community solar programs that we're proposing and it's brief because we will have Energy Trust of Oregon and Bonneville environmental Foundation presenting in much greater detail in the coming slides of What's um what's proposed for these programs but again our objective is to support projects in the Oregon Community solar program and that's the existing program that is already underway and we would do this by partnering with Energy Trust utilizing federal funds to provide financial assistance assistance to community solar projects that benefit participants and then finally leveraging the existing Oregon Community solar um to deliver that and then the other option is community solar and consumer owned utility service territories and this is a program that we'll be building from scratch and we will be partnering with Bonneville environmental Foundation to do that and this will be a new program to provide federal funds to hopefully get community solar projects installed across the state in consumer owned utility territories and just as a heads up Bonneville environmental foundation will also likely be working with other Northwest Regional Partners to develop sister programs in other states and that is um you know we're not sure exactly how that's going to look but it may may give us a little benefit to have a Northwest approach so with that I will pass it on to Ryan at energytrust and again questions can be put in the chat or we can save them for the end or you can go visit the questions portal and answer them at your leisure so with that Ryan take it away thanks Rob um so everybody my name is Ryan Cook I'm a senior manager of innovation and developments at Energy Trust of Oregon and we are excited to talk to you about some of the ideas that we're bringing support Community solar projects in our users territory again as Rob mentioned leveraging the existing Oregon Community solar program to make the best use of these silver all dollars next slide please uh so I'm going to quickly talk just about who we are and then a little bit about background about the Oregon Community solar program and then talk about two different concepts for solar um uh funding dollars the first having to do uh with enhanced incentives for projects that meets the program's carpet criteria and the second having to do with some non-financial technical assistance for community-based projects the feedback that um that we'd love to hear from this group uh next slide uh so infrastructure of Oregon is an independent nonprofit um here you many of you likely know us as the administrator of ratepayer funded Energy Efficiency and renewable energy programs here in Oregon we are also actually part of the program Administration team for the Oregon Community solar program which is overseen by opuc but we're not really here in our program Administration capacity today so we serve 2.4 million customers in Oregon and Southwest Washington providing both Energy Efficiency and renewable energy financial assistance technical assistance and all sorts of other great things and on the solar side we serve customers of Portland General Electric and Pacific Power with our with our renewable energy programs um notably our renewable energy funding that we received through rate payers uh 25 of it needs to serve low and moderate income customers and to date our two main programs that helps achieve this are first are solar Within Reach incentive program for um for single family residential customers which Rob's already talked a little bit about and second project incentives for Community solar projects that benefits low-income customers and the concept that I'll be talking about today really expands that that second strategy next slide please so a little bit about the Oregon Community solar program uh this is a program that serves the three Electric ious in city of Oregon's a PG Pacific Power as well as Idaho Power which serves the the Ontario area and some of the basic program requirements are all projects need to be sized between 25 KW and three megawatts uh 10 of each project is required to serve low-income customers and low income subscribers need to receive a mandatory discounts in the amount that they're charged the amount that a project manager can charge a low-income subscriber as caps for for new projects at for about 60 uh so four percent discount 60 of the the value of the bill credits that the customer receives and as part of the program Administration team there's a low income facilitator which is community energy project who's responsible both for verifying low-income customer eligibility and who also will recruit and refer low-income households to projects that they wanted them to be their projects so we already have a lot of infrastructure that we can use to build towards and meet some of the solar for all goals next slide uh within the program there's a feature called the carve outs um which is essentially for projects that go above and beyond it's serving low-income customers or involved in um in the design of projects there's a few different ways to qualify for the carve outs within the Oregon Community solar program first any project that reserves 50 again the program minimum is 10 any project that reserves 50 of project capacity for low-income subscribers uh would qualify for the cargo second any project that's managed by a non-profit or a Cooperative would qualify and then a project that Partners creatively with a community-based organization in the Outreach of a project would also qualify for for the carabouts the program is a limited capacity program there's 160 megawatts that have been authorized by the commission and about 25 of that or 40 megawatts is reserved for projects that may carve out capacity um now where we are today nearly all of the pro of the product program capacity that's not part of the card out has been allocated uh to projects but very little of the carbide capacity has been so we have 47 megawatts remaining in the program of which 36 megawatts is reserved for carve out projects um so primarily what we're seeing the um in solar for all is to to use the substantial amount of funding to uh to fill up the program carve out and make sure that we're delivering really considerable benefits through the Oregon Community solar program that are in line with the priorities that EPA is outlined next slide so our two goals um are one making sure that we're able um there we go uh one is making sure that we are able to get some more community-led Community solar projects uh built and realize through the program and second making sure that we're able to make more low-income subscriptions available to participants in the program and there's really two different strategies that I'm going to talk about WC is useful here one is addressing Financial barriers with a strong and stable incentive for projects that then meet those carbide criteria that I was just talking about and second by addressing non-financial barriers like program complexity by providing enhanced technical assistance and potentially project matchmaking services to community-led projects next slide so for strategy one and here we're really talking about financial assistance and incentives um the problem that we found is that many carve out projects will require additional funding um to get across the finish line and while there have been paths incentive offers available through Energy Trust through Odo through USDA PCF and utilities to provide grants and apprentices to um to projects many of these are kind of temporary in ad hoc and there's not there's not a long-term consistent Statewide incentive Source uh that's uh that's available to help get its carbon projects developed through the community solar program and so our core concept would be to put together a stable incentive that's available to any project that meets both solar for all requirements meaning that 50 of the project would be available to eligible residential",

        "text": " the the main takeaways from that uh John did you have anything that you wanted to add hi uh good morning everyone um no I think that's a that's a great summary I mean this is pretty Stark uh um you know differentiation between groundbased systems and and you know roof mounted um one thing we are asking our consultants for is uh to extend the study out just a little bit to include the the former Herz property that we did not own when this study was undertaken so um assumption being of course that roof mounted and and covered parking over there would would be the same so um uh hopefully we'll have a scope and a fee for that here this week and um yeah other than that I don't think I have too much more to add um from a sort of a business perspective I like the idea of covered parking with solar panels I know I've seen a lot of other reports with those um because not only does it provide the the climate impact and the ability to uh offset our energy use uh which is a cost savings but it also then provides a customer service piece you know where people can park undercover uh out of the rain and out of the Sun so um kind of a a win-win there but um other than that yeah I don't think I have too much more to add this is certainly not my area of expertise so thank you Juliana for helping helping me pedal through all of this and thank you for the committee to the committee for those of you that um help get the funding for this is really important um I just I wanted to say I mean I agree with what you're looking at here basically looking at the simple payback period with the years uh I guess some of my concerns were it was the roof arrays and the carport arrays that had biggest issues with glare but it looked like maybe they could be addressing those so I think that there is a new tower John please correct me I'm not Tower is moving the federal government is moving our Tower probably to the other side of the airport so glare where our terminal is is much less of an issue for the tower right yeah I think the broad answer to that is once the air traffic control Towers move to the east side of the airport all the existing glare issues will solve themselves and that's not identified in the report because again it wasn't a known quantity at that point sure that makes that makes sense but how far ahead in the future is that it's actually coming up it's in yeah I would say in the next two to five years likely um it's part of the bipartisan infrastructure law funding and and all of that funding is required to be spent by 2030 so and we're already into the uh environmental analysis on the on the parcel on the east side of the airport between the National Guard and Garmin so we're we're moving along at pretty quick Pace I would guess in the next two to five years we'll have a a new tower up okay uh the federal incentive is that where's that coming from is it grants or is it from the infrastructure I think that that one is um part of the irs's direct aay program so um IRS typically you couldn't as a government entity you don't pay taxes so you normally couldn't get those benefits so IRS created direct pay which is the ability to directly pay government entities for um their efforts like uh solar panels and okay we have solar panels on the new police St yes um they actually asked me to get that information to the Consultants help them get that we have been a variety of places okay okay thank you I guess um I just one other question is does it make sense to make parking better I mean are we undermining are we doing a good thing with having more solar but yet incentivizing more people to drive the airport like I'm wondering so what's the current alternative is it R share because then that would be two trips as opposed to one two trips each way as opposed to one well currently most people do people because our our airport is so convenient and Cally located we're not seeing much parking and so people are just getting dropped off because it's you know basically 15 minutes from anywhere in town to our and so we're getting we're seeing very little parking Revenue because of that so it's not even ride share necessarily I I think it's just family and friend um but so I'm wondering I don't know I just I just tossed that question it just seems counter other efforts not that I'm opposed to Sol because I'm absolutely not course I don't know I just it's good question I mean I do think people are getting dropped off up well I think is the airport expands services and will attract more people people from outside the area that'll make a difference I mean people that at train station for example because of the convenience it has um there might be more people there I think that's a great Point counselor and I also think that there's an an opportunity down the road when we have um a need for increased parking that that covered parking then could be offered at a premium rate uh and so then covered you know more distant from the terminal would be maybe an economy lot as opposed to a a short-term you know premium parking lot yeah I think that a future without any cars is very hard to imagine I think um I'm with you where I'm trying to figure out the I mean we have something tonight on our agenda and Council that's hard for me right because we're trying to you have all these competing things happening but um I think yeah I think it's something that um actually the climate lens would actually help us get through something like this and kind of get to the bottom of it um but I also think that as the climate intensifies in its extremes I'm having covered areas for people might actually be needed and if we do have them that it is creating energy um again right I mean it's it's all hard yeah it was just a thought in my mind wanted to pass out but I like the idea that John your suggestion about the premium parking um that sort of thing I know that's popular in Arizona if you can get your car under also in places with giant hail if you go to you go to really bad with the big you know because people will go on flight come back in their car will be destroyed when they have those giant Health firms I had a question about this kind of solar on our um city owned garages we don't have roofs I know we don't have roofs or coverage right now well I'm just saying like if we put a carboard type thing on a on a city-owned parking garage would it work to do over there the only like thing that adds some complexity is you have to check and see if it's structurally is structural Integrity is enough to support that additional weight I guess we could just not have Pary up there and just make it roof or cover parking and then everybody would have cover parking sorry we just people the park thanks everyone I've got the fa waiting on the other line so I'm gon to go ahead and log off thanks so much thanks John all right update on eecbg and municial energy master plan are Fe a lot of letters but not a lot of words uh EBG Energy Efficiency conservation block crant and then um the energy master plan we had an RFP that went out we were unsuccessful on that one and we tried to have a large economies of scale thinking that if we just did the go of the whole city that we would get some um you know some price reduction in that but unfortunately that didn't have a price reduction and it also didn't have the expertise required so instead of trying to shoehorn those proposals into what we were looking for we decided to um look it at it from part A and Part B part A being uh buildings and Parks or things that are in the general fund and Part B being um Municipal operations for uh portable water Wastewater and transportation signals and street light and that could be done through utility funds whereas the part A to be done through this brand so that is currently what we're thinking and we have it under review with World Resource Institute and um Energy Trust of Oregon so hopefully they can provide any additional feedback that might make this this round of RFP a little bit more successful any questions or comments on that thank you on to Energy savings Contracting so if you look um past the minutes on your agenda they have uh provided us a little back sheet the US Department of energy is asking if we are interested in being um a partner or a sponsored Organization for this program where they are trying to get 1 billion in measured and verified savings uh by 2030 and I gave a graas here because I am not good at explaining it without it so what Energy savings performance Contracting is is they do technical audits of your building portfolios and that gives the Baseline energy cost and then there is a private company or an Esco that comes in and pays for those upgrades to make it more energy efficient so you have in that in that green the dark green and the light green those are your cost savings from that energy efficient upgrade and then from that you pay with that darker shaded green and sorry wasn't the best graphic the slightly darker shaded green is what you'd pay back that company that UPF front paid for those upgrad and then at the end of that contract you would take back over the operation and maintenance you would during that contract you would receive a portion of the Energy savings and at the end of it you receive full Energy savings minus whatever it costs for operation that's the part I'm confused by what do you mean by we would take back the operation cost of what of whatever upgrades they did so normally they do like a portfolio of upgrades of both small short paybacks like LED lights and big long paybacks like furnaces they look at your building portfolio they figure out what you can improve the Energy Efficiency of they pay for that they get those upgrades and then you pay a portion back to them from those Energy savings is there a front cost no what's the downside it requires so the I guess there's an upfront cost in it you do have to do technical Audits and those are expensive but that sometimes can be looped into your contract um but it is just the administration of it uh you are looking at measured and verified savings so you have to have uh programs where you can",

        "text": "'s protected area standard protected areas uh in um under council standard is they're kind of designated or listed as certain types of areas that are considered protected areas i have a map here on the screen that shows the identified protected areas within the analysis area which is 20 miles in this kind of tan color um proposed facility is kind of right here located in the center table three over here is pulled from the proposed order and identifies the protected area and the distance from the site boundary so um the two um closest protected areas are this devil devil's garden lava bed which includes derrick's cave um and conley hills c rna and a c e c is an area of critical environmental concern and an rna is a research natural area so that's what those abbreviations mean based on the review of the applicant's view shed analysis and the assessment presented in the proposed order the department recommends that council find the proposed facility would not cause significant adverse and adverse visual impact to any of the protected areas in the analysis area further underneath the scenic resources standard which we'll get to here in a bit the applicant describes in the recommends that council require the implementation of measures that would minimize the visual impacts caused by the facility which are using um earth-toned uh colors on um you know buildings and structures and uh shielding light so it's directed downward and managing uh fugitive dust during facility construction underneath the uh protected area standard there are no conditions recommended this is the only slide i have for protected areas moving forward thank you the retirement financial insurance standard requires a finding that the proposed facility can be restored to a useful non-hazardous condition at the end of the facility's life should either the applicant stop construction or opera or the facility cease to operate the standard also requires that an applicant obtain a bond or letter of credit in the form and amount satisfactory to the council to restore the site to that useful non-hazardous condition underneath the standard the department recommends retirement uh conditions one through five which also mandatory conditions which i noted that relate to retirement of the so decommissioning of the decommissioning activities generally uh it's kind of like the reverse of construction or if you were looking in the proposed order under the description of the facility so the solar pv generating equipment and the relating or supporting facilities which include that transmission line access roads the o m building substations all of those it's kind of think of it in reverse all everything that went into building those now needs to be undone so um it involves site mobilization electrical disconnection and dismantling work above ground structure removal which includes foundation removal road and site restoration re-vegetation and hauling on and off-site um with disposal so the proposed order explains that um and as noted earlier the facilities located in agricultural use zone um it's also within odf and w's uh mapped big game winter range habitat so big game winter range usually what we talk about here are elk and that's considered category 2 habitat but in retirement financial assurance condition 2 uh which imposes a mandatory condition um the department notes or it requires at the time of facility retire retirement which is represented as 30 or more years in the future a retirement and decommissioning plan would have to be reviewed and approved by council and that plan would essentially finalize the retirement and restoration requirements uh which would include establishing the conditions that constitute compliance with this standard so what it means is um but in the future because as as ever as we are aware that um you know land use changes and so essentially the framing of this condition is to not necessarily say that all um retirement should be or to make it back to category two or 2 agricultural use but in the future based on in the retirement plan council and the applicant would be able to determine what appropriate what would be appropriate to re restore the site to a useful non-hazardous condition and what the definition of that would be in the and thank you for that and i'll just go on the record and say that we've talked a lot about uh retirement financial assurance um lately over the last several meetings so i would hope that uh folks understand and recognize where this council is on on that topic thank you and then um recommended retirement and financial assurance conditions one through three are the other mandatory conditions that relate to decommissioning the facility um recommended retirement financial assurance condition 5 requires the basically this is the amount um that council is determining to be adequate to restore the site um to a useful non-hazardous condition and this is the amount that would appear in the bond or letter of credit that total is 28.8 million dollars um part of that total uh that or what's included in that total is the the department recommends that council apply a 10 future development contingency for solar facility components this is based on the availability of historic decommissioning data and institutional knowledge of other solar facilities um and then the department also recommends that council apply a 20 contingency for the battery system components uh and this is due to just uncertainty of the environmental regulations where currently those really focused around the transportation and handling of battery storage requirements but to contemplate um future uncertainty of what that may look like the department is recommending um that there be a 20 contingency um for okay so the um ability of the applicant to obtain a bond or a letter of credit there's also a recommended retirement financial assurance condition for is the mandatory condition that requires the bond or letter of credit in a form and amount satisfactory to the council um and to demonstrate its ability to receive an adequate bond or letter of credit the applicant provides a letter from heffernan insurance brokers which states that they're confident that the applicant would be able to obtain that decommissioning bond councilmember condon yes thank you um just a question with respect to this i i understand that construction can't be started until the actual bond is issued and as i expressed before i have concerns about this um if i'm reading this correctly so we have cafernon insurance as you indicated but hevernan insurance is not a financial institution that's pre-approved approved by the council or that the department is not familiar what's the basis for the comfort i guess from heffernan i mean to me um the a letter might indicate that they've done more analysis of the financial health and strength of the organization but given that they're not on our list we don't have experience with them what what's the basis for accepting a letter from them for comfort well i think it's a derivative of what we're using with the existing rules um and and all uh secretary cornett and uh sarah esterson can uh pop in here um but as um really the i i don't believe i don't have the rule in front of me but i don't believe that the existing rule requires that these you know comfort letters or this this letter um be on the council's pre-approval list um and it doesn't necessarily designate that must be met to demonstrate this um i don't know if todd and sarah want to supplement it so really what is in is um what was provided understanding that the backstop is that the facility cannot be constructed without that bond being issued and it can't be operated without the bond being um you know updated adjusted for inflation and maintained throughout the life of the facility um there's also other um mandatory conditions or specific conditions there's also other conditions that that when read and again i don't have them in front of me but they also function as a backstop of what provides the council the authority and regulate retirement activities okay thank you i you know for me that i guess this just appears as a bit of veneer and so anyway i'll i'll leave it there thank you yeah i guess it's it's hard because that's uh you know at this time for what um you know what the criteria that the rules provide i guess there's just not um that's that's uh thoroughly enough i i when i read that they are not an approved financial institution and not known to us it's what's the basis for accepting it so thank you you certainly answered that any other questions on retirement oh i didn't want to note um this the 28.8 million dollars this is based off of a decommissioning estimate which again kind of like is the reverse of like decommissioning each of the facility components so it gets into this pretty detailed table slash spreadsheet um and this is just as as a reminder kind of going back proceed in the procedural history the department deemed the application complete and then when drafting the draft proposed order we actually needed some additional information so what is you know part of the record is the application the complete application and also this supplemental information which did include some additional details relating to retirement um which is reflected in that 28.8 and in the the table the breakdown of those activities and decommissioning the decommissioning facility components so that's what's um that is where that number came from okay moving on to the council's fish and wildlife habitat standard let me check my time here okay um so the council's fish and wildlife habitat standard require requires that the council find that the design construction and operation of the facility is consistent with the oregon department of fish and wildlife or odf and w's habitat mitigation goals and standards odfnw's rule creates requirements to mitigate impacts to fish and wildlife habitat based on the quantity and the quality of that habitat as well as the extent and duration of the potential to that habitat um underneath this standard the uh department recommend recommends conditions 1 through 11 to meet the standard um the map here i have up demonstrates shows permanent and temporary impacts uh you're like okay i see the permanent it's yellow um and then it says temporary and it says blue and you're like where is that it is related to this transmission line and you'll see in my next table i i do have a breakout of the permanent and temporary impacts from the facility whereas the temporary impacts minimal that's because the applicant is basically representing that everything within the site boundary aside from avoidance areas should be considered treated as and mitigated as such as a permanent impact so i noted on this earlier in that one of those very first slides you see these areas where there is no yellow um these areas correspond with you know these sand dunes i'm going to call them sand dunes um there's also a little nugget right here which these are areas that",

        "text": " map and take Community input as one of our ways to you know determine these disadvantaged communities so I think that fearing your experience with federal dollars at eweb actually makes me give me some concern that maybe they won't give us the flexibility we ask for but we'll see and that's one of those things we just have to wait for the usdoes response to our narrative to see how flexible we can be there yeah thank you Thomas and I know that we have someone on the phone who had a hand raise I wonder if he could bring them off mute can you hear me folks yes we can hi perfect perfect um hey this is Rohit Nair from Pacific Corp just had a great conversation uh appreciate the discussion just had a quick question regarding um buy America requirements um the Pacific Corp has made some you know group applications but as part of the uh proposal as part of the iij and the statute itself um uh for Prospect we can ask for an exemption and re-exempt it for from buy America but that might not necessarily be the case for formula grants is what I've been hearing any any thoughts on that um if utilities are going to be um to follow that by America Emily would you like to respond to this from odo's perspective I can give some general guidance on the approaching but I think this might be more about whether and it oh I'm sorry for the delay there um I don't know that we have um better guidance to give from our perspective than um Christy that you might have um I'm happy to speak to it yeah happy to jump in I just so my understanding is that yeah it is required there is a process for um a waiver and I you can submit one so there I don't it does have to be approved by usdoe it will have to go through Odo in order to correct but it is possible to apply for a waiver so we do have and Bryson if you haven't yet maybe we can share the website link to it we do have steps in guidance included for what applying for a waiver would look like um we can provide that link it's posted on odo's website and just kind of what steps you would have to take but it will have to be considered a wave of would have to be considered first by Odo Odo will submit it to usdoe and that's that's kind of the process it would take so we really we want to encourage it wherever we can it's really only an extreme case cases that we would consider it but the goal is to try to adhere to it as much as possible okay perfect no and uh just just a quick comment on that um so I was in uh Washington DC last week and I spoke with the good deployment office and also the individual from the White House of OMB who was responsible for reviewing the um the exemption request for by America so there is going to be some guidance that is going to come up uh and some instructions on what what process or steps to follow to request for that exemption through the good deployment office for the formula grant my my question was also yes I really appreciate you providing some clarification on that and I you know we'll take a look at uh odo's kind of process to request that exemption uh the follow-up to that question was uh is that going to be part of the start of the auto scoring metrics right so for example you know if you see a competitiveness on two good projects but one one project has more foreign sourced material versus the second one which has uh more by America inclined material so does that uh do you anticipate that to play a factor into determining which project gets the funding would you also if you have immediate thoughts we did things I was like nobody has thought of that but now it's on the list of considerations so one of the things that we did talk about um and I think through the application process so we don't we can't give you a firm answer yes this is required and no this is not I this is a federal requirement you know we only have so much control over that but I think one of the things we tried to do and discuss is put together um in our scoring criteria there's an option for it you know do they have a thoughtful plan to demonstrate that they will have the capacity to implement this throughout their project so it's not that you have to in your application be able to say yes we are going to do it this is how we're going to do that and have that developed you can still apply we'll look at all of the different factors of the project this will be one of them um and then you know we will work with you we will kind of you know build this with you to say like okay have you thought through what the constraints are what the conditions will take what steps he'll take to try to mitigate them I'm kind of build that out through the application and conversation process I think that answers it perfectly yeah thank you thank you for those questions um and I do think I will say you know I think that goes back to the selecting criteria piece as well as you know these are federal regulations there is only so much we can do and have so much control you know how would you weight them or what would you consider in developing this criteria what should that look like um and how should we weight them so if there's no other questions right now maybe we move on to the last couple um tables here again these are specific to a program that we've got up and running that at a certain you know step 40 requirements from the Oriental legislature but on this one I'd like to point out letter k project assists applicant in achieving goals in a natural Hazard mitigation um this is where we might be able to address the projects that are contributing to Emergency Response within a community something like this I think can bring out those Community benefits associated with The Disaster Response so just wanted to highlight that long here's some more of the benefits associated with cost savings Economic Development sounded like we were getting to a place um you know very low population service territories where costs for upgrades are socialized amongst a less smaller group of great payers but there may be some value in trying to identify projects that you know minimized rate impacts for utility and then finally we have the geographic and technological diversity now there representing five percent of the points in the program I think that we would like to having a means of spreading projects around what I'm doing like healthy or utility service territory that we wanted applications to run for utility and then they you know next round they can come back again I don't know there's ways we could do that but um yeah I think with that we can maybe move into just a discussion about what the criteria should look like they've got a lot of happiness we have identified at least two main bodies of criteria one is describing technical viability one is describing Community benefits we can add other discussions to this as well but with that um you know we have these prompting questions first one what criteria should we include and how can we score it and then kind of a process question um how can we make this as easy as possible or constrained staff to come in and apply be Sonic work so so I have a quick question 85th or columbia-based electric is is Oregon Department of energy contemplating two separate application processes one for large utilities that are going to fit under the large utilities since that's pretty limited on the number of utilities and they can be identified pretty easily right and then and then there's everybody else I and and I wasn't sure if that was what you were contemplating on that side um or not because truly the evaluation process is going to be completely different I I think not completely different that's not fair but the projects are going to be in looking at them I would assume it's a really good question and it came up yesterday and and on one level we would like the ability to move funds between the two pots of money and in this case we actually have four utilities because you can tell uh qualifies as a large net four million megawatt hours per year has been cut off and so you know if we had common criteria and let's just say the ious in some scenario went out and found their money from some other Federal sources only one came and they said we needed a million dollars and it leaves 8 million on the table in the rest of the program we would want the co use to be able to go in and compete for those funds in that round but the way that the federal requirements set up this program it's based on percent of customers served and so these the larger utilities essentially have a carve out because of the very large percentage of customers so I would put that question to the table and see if you have thoughts on that I I think a trilateral I think I think what you're going to see is the large utilities because we can't duplicate efforts across federal and state funding applications we're going to carve all types of projects for each so it's not I don't think you're going to see a Pacific War or Idaho or even the Nutella not put in good projects under the state program so it's I think there can be a lot of opportunity to like ship funds you know yeah aggressive too the the split was right around 13 and seven for the funds with the 40 carve out which was you know considerably higher than the share of customers and we made that argument in the narrative development um so I think that's something we're going to have to continue to work on but we would like to maintain flexibility in the larger budget to move between pots and the other way could happen too where cou say it's more trouble than it's worth and and then we have funds that we can put in the other direction you know there's scenarios that we need to plan for in the program so as long as we have that flexibility um manage the budget I think we'll be open to further ideas I I think that you're I think you'll be over subscribed if I'm a betting person I'm going to put all my money from all the other programs so far is they're all over subscribed yeah right there's just so much meat out there so much you know need for yeah in this work that we haven't been able to go to yeah and and what are the benefits of this um and I I think I've discussed this before when you're talking about matching funds at at 33",

        "text": " problems we've um I did survey uh residential uh landscapers in uh Portland to see how they've adjusted to these are these are uh electric um they use they use almost entirely electric uh and what are the what are the good things they found what are the what are the bad things they found so I sent out a survey um and that's kind of the results is uh they they all use none of them have those big trucks that have uh uh uh solar panels and then you know there's some big companies that can do that and they charge them as they go but but all of these smaller companies use uh multiple Spar batteries and I went to a webinar and they talked about how really you have to you have to focus on having one company so basically you find a company like steel that you really like um and steel has you know really tough good ratings for commercial use and then you get you can buy all your batteries from them so you can interchange them and you buy all your equipment from them um and then they have warranties in their batteries so they have like a fiveyear warranty so that's about how long you can expect the battery to last um but they all manage the batteries by using 100% multiple spare batteries um so they they expect to use two to three batteries for this job because the batteries only last for an hour or so um they have mostly found the equipments reliable and efficient um they have not really noticed recently uh battery life improving um but you know this is more of a short-term thing um greatest Advantage they had 37% less noise 25% less maintenance um and then the startup cost is the big problem and the thing with the startup cost is that one and a half to two and a half years before you uh basically start getting a return on investment because it's a lot less U maintenance that goes into it um and they're just they last longer than than the the gas power Lea blowers just they just last longer the batteries are not out it's not so so um so the startup cost will take a year and half to two and a half years before you can pay for it but then it starts to be actually more cost effective after that so that's the resource identification and uh the last thing was the pros and cons analysis um and um I'm having a lot of trouble with any kind of financial stuff because I don't understand how the City Works so um he wanted to talk about the uh direct and indirect cost uh impacts to the city so I would need a lot of help of that so I don't really I don't know how that works but the performance of go ahead sorry well so I was goingon to say Debbie in terms of in terms of those cost right I think get as specific as you can right and what that might be is startup costs are big right and like that's that's kind of the the extent we can get um so so that's that's just my guidance to as the committee right get as specific as you can I am not anticipating you're going to have dollars and cents spelled out in terms of um you know the the cost uh to the city um and in the budgetary there yeah so um but the electric costs are the more upfront costs um so you know that's that's we have to make the investment the beginning but the way to work around that I think is it's going to be to phase it in um and to to really focus on replacing as as they as they fail um but as far as performance goes um electric is actually performing as well or better now than gas Consumer Reports has has put out a thing that electric is actually in a lot it depends on the brand you choose but it's in a lot of ways it's uh it's it's it's very powerful and it could do just good of a job the big problem is the batteries um and you're talking you're talking about an hour um maybe two hours of of battery work kind of what they're looking at one of the things to look at when you look at brand names is the American green zone Alliance EXA which is a nonprofit that does uh P robust testing they certify electric products uh for commercial use and they go through there then they certif once they certify them then you you know you kind of know that they're they'll stand up to the abuse of the kind of thing that we find in our parks in our city um and and steel is a big one ego and Makita that they've certified um and um I talked about the return on investment one and half to two and a half years or so but the real Advantage is that electricity is cheaper than fuel um it just it's overall and it's going to and it's going to get cheaper as we turn into more renewable energy um they don't need oil changes they don't need tuneups they don't need any of those things repair costs are are a lot less and they and they operate a lot longer they have a longer operating life so and then the infrastructure is something that I already mentioned um going on to look at um you know how do you bring three batteries out to field and uh where do you charge all these batteries up do we need 220 volt charging so that we have faster charging wherever the wherever they bring their things back to so and just the workflow um is something that would need to change and I just need to know how far we've gotten into that what the experience has been of the how much electrical equipment do we actually have because I I think that letter from um was no no Noy that letter from Noy said that at the time they were looking at trimmers and um and the uh saws the chainsaws we've implemented some stuff us and urban forestry and I think there's something more recent than that but let me let me back so I mean since 200 to is there an inventory like you have inventory of all the small tools yeah I mean I think my recollection of what was sent was how urban forestry the types of equipment they're using how many they have stuff yeah I mean for going evaluate cost in the long term like you have so much you know weed eaters shears all that yeah that I don't I've never seen that if they sent it to JN I didn't get a copy of it but that would be wonderful have excellent well thanks Debbie any other um any other thoughts for Debbie the committee there Juliana go ahead yeah um so the electric costs actually are going up they have been going up there's been like about a 40% increase since 2017 we're going to continue to see that as we uh get our PGE grid cleaner um Salem electrics grid is continuing to stay a little bit below uh the price of PGE so something that could be considered is if there's a way to charge in Salem electric grid so uh basically Riverfront over to West Salem and then a couple places in North Salem uh it we could look at something like that it could help so it might also be considering where we'd have uh cheaper electricity to charge at okay unless it would well you have somebody has to drive clear across town to charge their batteries and stuff and you have efficiency issues and you know running from across town to do that so I think those are just all things that yeah what about a really long extension cord yeah exactly work no it's good thought thanks stebie for that discussion U villan I know I saw you you need to hop out so thanks for coming in and chatting um here Zachary needs to hang off too and so that will uh end our Quorum um and so that's uh fine we got through the Committees that are here um Zachary I think given Woody has stepped away uh is no longer on the board um if you can maybe we can plan on having you join Allan um and his uh committee um and and make that connection um to help fill that spot and give Allen somebody to help work with but see you dlan go ahead and Hop Off Thanks staff thanks everyone appreciate itk you yeah no I was gonna suggest that Mark uh we got a bunch of input on the on Debbie's committee already and Allan and Woody Woody's off of it so I yeah love to make contact with Allan and see where we're at on materials use and capital project stuff and get back to you all cool thank you for that hey thank you for those updates everyone that was really that was really good thank you so much I am gonna hop off though because I do have a meeting with a couple of students here so thank you so much everyone excellent thank you have a good afternoon uh and we'll go ahead and close out the meeting now that we don't have a quum anymore um thanks all for the discussion uh we did not get around to chatting about um Allen's committee or um uh the neighborhood association Outreach um but uh Rob if I can ask you to maybe send around that schedule um as a reminder to the group again of um the neighborhood associations that we would like folks to reach out to yes does that feel like a advance that that was kind of the primary part of that discussion being on the work session is to see where folks are at on that and remind you all to be doing that and remind myself to be doing that um and so I think Rob if you could just do that via email that might um at least help on that front a little excellent I don't think I can ask you but I'm going to anything else for the good of the order before any other discussion items okay thank you all for participating sorry I did not come to see you uh in person today um hope you all have a good rest of your Tuesday",

        "text": " the council mandating use of of one of those methodologies or or adapting one of those methodologies for use in the upset process and maybe while you're thinking about that Fuji I did see that you're so go ahead very well folks are thinking about that I just want to correct Irene it wasn't 100 25 miles from the interpretive center it's 125 ft it's just that's okay but uh um I think if there was to be still some variability in the methods I'm not comfortable really with that but that at a minimum they should stay the most updated uh manual um when I'm talking about cherry picking I'm talking about you know things that I'll just say it Idaho Power has used in the board Hemingway uh analysis so we'll go for 1974 in the forest service we'll go to 19768 I mean it's 86 and the BLM blah blah blah so it needs to be the most updated if you're going to use those resources and then this term of significant as Irene is talking about even if you use well or the the blms and you have high impact high impact high impact high impact and then Odo comes out for no significant impact how can you come up with no significant impact when all the other metrics have said high impact so I think that it's really difficult because Scenic is a subjective thing maybe Dean can help us a bit with this but I think that this there needs to possibly be some kind of a um a panel or some kind of independent look at those analysis let's face it Odo who's doing the review and putting out the draft proposed order and proposed orders are being paid by the developers we know this there seems to be an inherent problem in this whole process so if there can be some little independent of something to look at the data and say okay what's the conclusion rather than the conclusion being oh no significant impact Almost 100% of the time then uh you know I think that might add a little validity to the process anyway I'll leave it at that you guys know this is a Hot Topic for me sorry ranting here you go yeah this is Dean again I I have been having trouble getting my hand up again I I thought I had solved the problem and now it's not helping me anyway the prop gu go ahead de I have work I work both sides of the fence currently I'm working for developers who are trying to develop offshore wind uh on the east coast and I have worked for developers in Oregon as well I've also worked for the opposition on projects so I'm not I'm not here as an advocate for anything in particular just for a good process um you know H having said that uh there are some things that that you can work on I'm talking about FC um to really improve things and one of the areas that I think should be looked at is it's a really important Clause that you have that says if there is I don't know if I'm going to get the terminology right but if there is a significant adverse impact on visual resources you don't leave yourself any out the project has to be turned down just on that basis or won't am I correct that um yeah it would well there is um a method through which um we could do a what's called a balancing determination and applies to at least some of these standards well one of the one of of the issues that I've encountered is that because of that particular standard it makes it difficult for a developer and their consultant to do a fully throw honest assessment of visual impacts because if they do and they find it's significantly adverse they're kind of derailing their and we you need some kind of out clause that allows mitigation to happen including off-site mitigation including payments to the community or the people affected uh you need a way to um allow for a a more honest assessment that's not deliberately kind of downplaying the impacts that's one thing the other thing is uh was it Fuji I think was saying that uh having some sort of independent assessment particularly in any kind of controversial project I think is really important uh to be able to pull in one or two outside experts who aren't paid by a developer who are you know are not paid by Advocates who are trying to stop the project to have them come in and take a look and see if the assessment was done properly and see if the findings are defensible uh might be a good a good process for f FC to consider um that's thanks Dean and I will just make one point to address that I should have said mitigation can be considered when we're making our final determination of significance um and that would usually things like include things like like sighting conditions to eliminate facility components from certain areas or design conditions to use you know um design features that are more visually subordinate um but that does vary significantly from Pro but there there are going to be times and places where you are unable to mitigate a project down to something below significant adverse um these projects are big they take up a lot of space they're they're seen from a lot of areas and um so I'm just saying that you you you can't rely on that Clause uh that you're going to be able to mitigate your way out of it you might not be able to mitigate your way out of it but you don't want to to be a make or break for the entire project you want to be able to still approve the project but find other ways to compensate uh for the problems that it creates great thanks um Jon thanks Chris um this is Joselyn P's outside council with power um and I just wanted to respond to your request Chris for a developer perspective um and i' note also that a number of folks on the line today have raised some specific um criticisms of the B2 process and I don't intend to get into all of that here in this setting um I I don't think that's really appropriate for for this discussion but would add thank you for that Jo when um Idaho Power was um was approaching developing a methodology uh initially my understanding is that initially they had used one of the federal methodologies and the feedback from Odo was that that methodology didn't adequately account for what the council focuses on which is the definition of signific if in the rules and so I think that that's one thing to be mindful of in looking sort of outside at Federal plan at Federal methodologies is how how that fits back in with what the council's looking at and I mean I I I don't have our our visual resources expert on with me today to weigh in about um the various methodologies that are out there but I guess I would say another consideration that was relevant for b2h as well is looking at a large scale linear facility where you're Crossing multiple um Land Management jurisdictions including both BLM and Forest Service um and trying to come up with a um an approach for evaluating uh res sources that that are under those different management jurisdictions um so I I just offer those um General General comments and if there's anything um specific that you were looking for Chris um as far as input I could see if I could help out that um thanks JN yeah no um I I think it was just looking for General feedback there but I I think what you raised is very very helpful and um I I think we're probably about ready for a break so to kind of um is that we we've heard a lot that that we definitely need to have some methodology and or maybe a menu of methodologies that are accepted uh for the council process but at least something so that there's some uh meaningful Clarity in what is required and then um johon I think what you just kind of brought up and maybe this is consistent with what Irene was saying was that if we are going to specify a methodology be used that we should also be using that methodology's determination of significance and maybe make sure that we're not circling back around to the the council's rule and kind of overriding something um or at least confusing the issue of what that means um uh which I think is very very good feedback and something that we'll have to look at carefully because I don't know if that's something that we had previously um and it looks like Angela has your you have your hand up so I'll give you the last yeah thanks I just briefly um i' like what you just said about a menu of options I think that's especially important since different resources have very different types of visual impact so I like that menu idea great well um with that thanks again I think that was uh very very productive and we got a lot of good uh impact there and definitely have some homework to do on this question um our next two issues again are are related to the identification of resources so um let's come back and start working talking through those and um does does a 10-minute break sound okay to everybody I'll just assume you're all shaking your head so uh what's reconvene maybe in 10 minutes that would be uh 5 till 3 o'cl okay we're and it looks like it's just about time so hopefully most folks are back that's break my present again okay um so welcome back um hopefully you all were able to stretch out and get a drink of water um before we start our discussion of our issue uh which is um whether applicants should be required to review state Land Management plans when are tring to find significant or important uh Scenic resources um um so the current Scenic resources standard protects Scenic resources and values identified as significant or important in local land use plans tribal management plans and Federal Land Management plans um uh and an analysis is required for impacts to those resources um there are some State Land Management plans which establish Scenic corridors and bikeways and some other Scenic resources that are not currently included in the rule but are generally uh still reviewed for impacts um so we are asking specifically whether or not um those State Management plans should be included uh We've also had a comment from our recommendation from one stakeholder that um Regional and Interstate plans such as the Columbia Gorge National Scenic area management plan um should be included in the rule um so we'd appre any feedback on that recommendation and then a few folks have questioned whether or not um the basis using Land Management plans as the basis for uh the rules is appropriate at all so in our discussion questions for this uh particular issue um we have three questions that we kind of like some input on one whether Scenic resources a yeah so one whether there is",

sense of the number of people interested in giving public comment and so as soon as I can look at what I'm G to do for both those of you who joined us on I'll take a show of hands um let's see okay so so it looks like on the zoom interested in public comment is I'm not sure how to say ca sa Jodie H okay very good and in the room is anyone here hoping to provide public comment uh just sending in is that right great anybody else interested in providing public comment got some hands here can can I have a first name Carrie and anom thank you s Mr not at this point okay thank you any other people interested in providing public comment okay one two 3 four five we have five three I think we might be do you want to do two minutes or three minutes of public comment time with five interested speaking um let's say let's say three copy that great okay and then and then I'll turn over the meeting to you I'm sorry thanks for watching the door for us no worries so I want to welcome everyone who's in the room and also everybody who is online to this meeting of April 24th Human Rights Commission so we kind of have a special topic today and we are going to go over Gaza Palestine we're going over that whole thing today um I just want to encourage everybody uh first of all please say your peace I mean we're here we're here to listen we're here to talk so by all means please do that but I'd also like to encourage everyone to please be respectful like there's I mean we can disagree without being disagreeable that is the number one thing it's perfectly fine to have a differing opinion I personally feel that if we have different opinions then that's an opportunity to learn and to grow because no one learn no one gets it right on the first try there's always a chance for more information so by all means please respect everyone um want to hold hard and fast to that um number three um as you guys might have heard we're going to try to limit to three minutes um I know this is a very touching a very personal subject for everyone and I understand that you know emotions are going to rise they're going to follow we might want to be a little passionate and we might want to go over but if I am like waving at you or giving you a funny look or a funny face is probably because we're coming up on that whole three minute thing so don't take a personal I just want to make sure that everyone has a chance to speak okay so H forgive me I forgot I also had somebody call and had notes that they'd like me to read but it won't be three minutes okay but it'll be quick okay no worries so with that being said um we would generally do um do we have time for that I don't think so if you want to get to the so we're going to skip the introductions if you would like to know who we are and that sort of thing then stick around I'm always down for a conversation if it's about food I'm not going anywhere so it's kind of how it goes be know which one um Can Commissioners can we like something so so you know who our actual are so then I guess from there we're going to go ahead and Skip forward to our public comments or actually yeah our public comments so and I wrote down the names so if you like I can call names and run a timeline if that sounds good um why don't you go ahead and read the the ones that you had first and then we'll go make sure it's right yeah I've got CA jod H Jenia Carrie and enan and then I have a one from a Michael too that works um did you want to read the one the call in sure would you like me to do that yeah do that then we'll go in the room all right and I'm I'm turning the timer on to to be equable so I received a phone call from a Community member named Michael Slater um Michael asked me to share that he feels it's not up to the human rights commission's credibility to meet on Passover he urges everyone to strongly consider avoiding weighing in um to the overall topic and conversation as it's so far outside of the purview of the City of Salem he said if you do weigh in he believes it would require extensive consultation and public engagement process he also observes that this is landing at a time with a lot of contentious issues and upcoming election facing our mayor and city council further Michael went on to read the draft statement in our meeting packet that was drafted for consideration and comments he said he's very concerned makes no mention of the right to Israel to exist or be safe or defend itself nothing about the history of genocide against Jews or anti-Semitism nothing about the right of Israel to defend itself and protect itself um Michael says these omissions are very significant and undermine The credibility of any statement nothing about the tax on Jewish civilians by Hamas while many Jews would Express displeasure at the government's current approach in gosma a statement of genocide would create significant problems for Jews in Salem if you go ahead and adopt it and he said he sincerely hoped something like this doesn't pass on Passover like a vote tonight and then only able to talk about something that passed already next week okay we still had we were within the time so I'm gonna go ahead and address that so I just want everyone to keep in mind that tonight is further in the process we are not hard firm like this is what we're gonna say this we have one more meeting for that um it's going to be a week out from today so for today it's really just another opportunity to give for voices to be heard before we go forward so I just wanted to make sure everyone knows that that it's not like today is not a hard F all right with that being said let's go ahead and go to the first one okay um sa and I apologize if I said your name wrong hi um it's um okay um I do I just like start whenever or yeah go go ahead I'll restart your timer we've got three minutes for you okay thank you so we live in a time where genocide is being broadcasted all over and our world leaders are doing nothing about it people who have power choose to say complicit and there are people in the streets being harassed arrested and assaulted for speaking up and doing what's right people are spoonfed to believe calling for an end to a genocide anti-Semitism people are so desensitized to what is happening this level of dehumanization is called Soul loss a term widely used in indigenous communities people have been trying to find medical reasoning for the atrocities we are witnessing but what it is is white supremacy and colonialism this level of violence and soul loss is required for colonialism and white supremacy to Triumph in order for Humanity to win and for Palestine did not just survive but Thrive we need to denounce the aparti S say Israel denounce white supremacy and denounce Zionism it's very important to know Zionism is not Judaism rather a political movement the history of Israel is very violent and has built its existence on the colonization of the Palestinian people with attempt to obliterate their history their culture and their land this first happened in the Naka in 1948 where villages were burnt women were raped and people were killed the so-called Southern State Israel has been pushing the Palestinian people out into an open air prison and now we are complicit Witnesses of them turning everything to Rebel the Palestinian people have the right to resist and if Israel wins they are not just and are not recognized as a state they won't have that right the Palestinian people will be annihilated and we will have lost our Humanity that's why it's very important to follow the demands of the petition urge the Biden Administration and Congress to call call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire an unrestricted entry of humanitarian assistance call for the restoration of access to basic necessities like food water electricity and Medical Services denounce us complicity in Israel military campaign and Gaza and West Bank and call for an end to all US military aid to Israel call for an end thank you call for an end to the apari and acts of genocide against the Palestinian people was violates international law and affirms the Palestinians right to resistance and we need the city to affirm its commitment to support the safety of all of its res residents and condemn anti-arab racism anti-Semitism islamophobia any form of racism xenophobia and discrimination I think it's really really really unfair to say people are anti-semitic for calling to for calling to an end to a genocide thank you next we have jod H and Jody give me just a second I'm struggling with my timer okay I'm ready when you are um I would like to start with a land land acknowledgement before we begin um we acknowledge that the history of Oregon of Salem was fundamentally tied to the First Colonial developments in the Willet Valley of the caus umaa waa Wala peoples of the Confederates tribes of the umaa Indian Reservation um only from this perspective can we proceed to have a conversation that is firmly rooted in stewardship and um return of rights to the people who the First Peoples of this land um I would like to say that within the last week that we've talked in this commission meeting um 88,000 buildings have been destroyed in Palestine in Salem we have 66,800 household units so all of that would be bombed by now including 20K more buildings what I have seen in this past week what a lot of us have seen we've seen 300 bodies zip tied with their catheters in with patients doctors children elderly still in their hospital gowns with their organs taken out people being dug up like we don't need another to decide we need to decide today we needed to decide six months ago we needed to decide last week so in in what world are we okay with this where we cannot make a decision as adults on a human rights commissioner board that says that we we focus on rights I mean I'm disgusted I'm angry I'm saddened I'm sadden for the Palestinians in the room and the",

        "text": " soils um the applicant's assessment of potential potential impacts to soils and compliance with the soil protection standard are included in the application exhibit eye however the department also pulls and synthesizes and it's also just soils are discussed further um in the proposed order under other sections and in the application an exhibit g which has information on materials and k which has information about land use um the map here shows these soil map units within the site boundary and identifies the the soil types these soils identified within the site boundary uh which is important are designated as the highest ranking for susceptibility for wind erosion the department recommends soil conditions one and two be imposed to meet this standard so construction and operation activities that would impact soils um would be from grading that would happen for uh access roads and facility components such as the o m building substations uh the collector substations the step up substation battery storage and the inverter and transformer units associated with the solar modules other potential impacts include erosion from wind and water accidental chemical spills noxious weed infestation or revegetation failure mitigation and best management practices or bmps specific to soils include the applicant's pollutant discharge elimination system or nifty's 1200 seed permit application which includes the erosion and sediment control plan or escp um under recommended soil protection condition one this requires uh the results as i noted under the structural standard that the results of the site-specific geotechnical work um be included to update any of these mitigation measures to minimize impacts to soils additionally to minimize and control dust from wind erosion generating generated during construction the applicant proposes to implement a dust abatement and management plan which is recommended underneath the public services standard and this plan would require the implementation of stabilization measures dust control through daily continuous uh using water trucks and notification procedures for issues with dust and i do want to note here that um do i want to note this yes but this is also related um to one of the contested case issues that jessie's going to talk about later so a spill management plan is attached as uh to the proposed order as i to the spill management plan describes material handling and management procedures training requirements and and reporting recording reporting requirements for both uh construction and operation of the facility and it includes language to serve as the spill control and counter measure plan or spcc um under uh the soil protection condition too the department recommends that regardless of whether or not an spcc plan is federally required um that in order to implement the applicant's proposed spill management and hazardous substance program that that be included and provided as part of the and that is it for soil protection again jesse's going to be talking more about this um in his presentation thank you the land use standard requires that council find that a proposed facility complies with the statewide planning goals adopted by the land conservation and development commission or lcdc the council may find compliance with statewide planning goals if the council finds that a proposed facility complies with the applicable substantive criteria from the affected local government governments acknowledge comprehensive plan and land use regulations that are required by the statewide planning goals and in effect on the date the application is submitted in council's rules this date application is submitted it specifies that that is the date that the preliminary application is submitted or the pasc this is uh established as what we call the goal post for the land use criteria so the pasc was received in september of 2018 the governing body is lake county of of lake county as the lake county board of commissioners which council appointed as the special advisory group for this review under the land use standard the department recommends conditions one through seven to meet the standard so the proposed facility would be located on agricultural use a2 zone land in lake county under the lake county zoning ornament ordinance which is lczo which is kind of a tongue twister for me but that's okay uh section 3.01 the agricultural youth zone the purpose of the a2 zone is to grazing and other agricultural land the a2 zone is considered as a qualifying exclusive farm use efu is owned by lcdc therefore it's subject to the provisions of oer the oregon administrative rules chapter 660 division 33 which specifically apply to these efu zoned plans table 2 here that i have on my screen is the applicable substantive criteria identified by the applicant so i'm going to just note um a couple of items about um lczo section 2419 this is also related to contested case issue 2 which jesse will expand on in his uh the proposed order evaluates the lczo section 2419b which requires that within an a2 or a1 or a2 zone uh non-firm uses would not demonstrate a serious interference with or significant increase in the cost of accepting accepted farming practices as defined in ors 215 203 sub 2 sub c on adjacent lands devoted to farm use the underlying landowner of over 2 700 acres of the facility site commented on the record of the dpo that the lands are not feasible for establishing commercial a commercial agricultural operation because of the poor soil quality and inability to get a water right he also explained uh that he had attempted to use the land for grazing but that was not a viable use for the so we had mentioned soils previously soils within the site boundary are classified by the natural resource conservation services or nrcs as classification 6 which fall into the definition of non-arable soils or land which is considered by lc dc definitions to be not suitable not suitable for cultivation oar66033 130 sub 38j this restricts a solar pv uh generating facility for using occupying covering more than 320 acres of non-arable land this facility as we are aware uh would cover would occupy or cover um over 3 900 acres of non-arable land and therefore would not comply with this acreage threshold oar 660 33 130 38 sub k outlines that an exception of the acreage threshold may be taken under uh rs 197 732 and chapter 660 of division iv as evaluated in the proposed order the applicant requests that council take an exception to the acreage threshold based on a reasons exception um which council is familiar uh hearing about and discussing the state policy embodied in gold for goal 3 is the preservation and maintenance of agricultural land for farm use so in order for the council to turn to determine whether to grant an exception to a statewide planning goal the council must the applicant must provide reasons justifying why the state policy embodied in the goal three should not apply and then there's also other criteria that is evaluated and looked at by council as well the applicant identifies that accepted farming practices on surrounding lands include irrigated agriculture and grazing and ranching activities this is uh also related to contested case issue four so jesse will get into this in more detail i just wanted to note that in the proposed order the um reasons that are evaluated are the minimal impacts to agriculture and the local economic benefits reason under the local economic benefits reason the proposed order explains that as identified by the applicant local economic benefits would be by the underlying lease payments to landowners the creation of the construction jobs community service fees paid to lake county through a strategic investment program or sip and uh under this sip agreement the applicant maintains that they would pay two thousand dollars per megawatt annually for 15 years additionally the applicant also commits to remitting payment of ten thousand dollars per megawatt to the north county or north lake county school district foundation um totaling up to four million dollars and these are um recommended under land use condition as noted uh there are other criteria that are evaluated for the goal exception that jesse will touch on later council if council has questions or one that's kind of that's a lot that actually is my conclusion for land use um which there's a lot in there but a lot will be uh discussed later but does council have any questions any questions for kellen chair girl this is can't i don't have a question but i have a kind of a little statement here i think i'd like to make i think it's an appropriate time especially after just the discussion on under landis i had a long career in land use and um what i saw over time was how more litigious things got and so i think it's appropriate to make this comment that is as litigious as these citing applications are becoming as comprehensive and complex as the requirements are it's incumbent upon the applicants to provide complete thorough and detailed information and reasoning so that we can make robust findings of fact and conclusions of law that will withstand challenges the burden of proofs on the applicant this is a plea do your homework many of the land use standards are not clear and objective uh they're quant they're not quantitative but they're qualitative um and so don't provide conclusory arguments but give us the detailed facts and reasoning on how the applicable standards are met so just a heads up to future applicants up your game thank you ken good feedback thank you uh council member howe marcy this is yes haley and i and i'll follow kent's comment um but i'll do it uh when we talk about the contested case i have similar comments as kent's maybe a little bit more uh thank you thank you thank you councilman remember jenkins other comments on land use okay moving forward uh the council's protected area standard protected areas uh in um under council standard is they're kind of designated or listed as certain types of areas that are considered protected areas i have a map here on the screen that shows the identified protected areas within the analysis area which is 20 miles in this kind of tan color um proposed facility is kind of right here located in the center table three over here is pulled from the proposed order and identifies the protected area and the distance from the site boundary so um the two um closest protected areas are this devil devil's garden lava bed which includes derrick's cave um and conley hills c rna and a c e c is an area of critical environmental concern and an rna is a research natural area so that's what those abbreviations mean based on the review of the applicant's view shed analysis and the assessment presented in the proposed order the department recommends that council find the proposed facility would not cause significant adverse and adverse visual impact to any of the protected areas in the analysis area further underneath the",

addressing non-financial barriers like program complexity by providing enhanced technical assistance and potentially project matchmaking services to community-led projects next slide so for strategy one and here we're really talking about financial assistance and incentives um the problem that we found is that many carve out projects will require additional funding um to get across the finish line and while there have been paths incentive offers available through Energy Trust through Odo through USDA PCF and utilities to provide grants and apprentices to um to projects many of these are kind of temporary in ad hoc and there's not there's not a long-term consistent Statewide incentive Source uh that's uh that's available to help get its carbon projects developed through the community

available to eligible residential participants and also csb carbon criteria which would be 50 slogan participation uh we're interested in targeting a mix of small community-led projects as well as larger potentially private sector projects and I would be intending to offer an incentive to uh to any project that's able to meet that 50 low-income participation threshold uh while delivering those mandatory Bill discounts we also know that to enable some of the smaller Community skill projects there might need to be an additional incentive that helps address some of the higher construction costs and currency go down in size so we're looking at a long-term stable incentive offer that would help fill out the problem with the um the community solar program prep out next slide the the second strategy that we're looking at getting away from Strictly financial assistance is thinking about how to overcome some of the non-financial barriers in the program so we do know that the Oregon Community solar program is a complex program to navigate especially for a community-based organization that is not a professional seller developer and who might not be well suited to be a long-term owner manager of a project so as energy trusts we already have a few different technical assistance tools we've put to use such as early stage Community Solar Development assistance as well as Project Specific coaching and technical assistance which we partner with bef to deliver to help some of these community-led carve out projects come forward but we have seen that that's not enough and that there's still a substantial unmet demand from Community groups that would like to make Community solar projects work but have both financial and non-financial barriers so we're really interested in using this funding as a way to dramatically increase the technical assistance that's being offered to to community groups that may want to be parts of the community center program and we're also considering taking a more assertive role in the program and providing sort of a matchmaking service between project developers cbo's and project managers and I'll talk a bit more about that on the next slide so next slide please so the way that this could work this sort of enhanced matchmaking service um Energy Trust would first establish Partnerships with Community organizations that want to bring Community solar to their communities who are willing to support Community solar customer enrollment and who can I mean who represent communities that are eligible for solar for all dollars but don't really have the um the the interests or capabilities to be a long-term manager of a project uh we then use slur for all dollars and potentially other dollars to manage a procurement process um to uh to develop Community solar projects by energy trust's trade holiday Network for example on non-residential facilities that might lack the the on-site that might be a good candidate for solar but not have the on-site load that would make a traditional net metering installation work well then we would separately procure in contracts with one or multiple organizations to serve as a project manager or some of these uh projects so we'd be separately building Partnerships and then um and then aligning both the three organizations the community groups that would bring the communities to the to the projects the trade Ally contractors that would develop the projects and the project managers that would be responsible for them long term and there's still a lot of a lot of dots to be connected here for example how project ownership work for some of these projects but we're interested in using this as a role to really identify what is the right role for community groups to play in the program and then helping bring the partners to make those projects be realized next slide please so there are a few requirements of solar for all that need to be navigated and aligning it well with the Oregon Community solar program we'll talk about a few of them here the first is that there's different income criteria in the Oregon Community solar program and solar for all the requirements for the income based requirement for solar for all is generally a bit more rigid and so not all participants that would qualify as low-income customers in the community solar program would qualify as eligible recipients and solar for all and that's when they would need to be navigated both by the program and by projects um second is the geographic requirements of justice 40 which Jen already mentioned uh 40 percent of the total spending uh would would need to benefit customers that live in designated Justice sporty areas and we imagine that requirement of flood would flow through to any Oregon Community solar projects that receive funding and this could be especially tricky to make sure that we're complying within PGE service territory where there's relatively few Geographic areas of it that are identified by the by the justice 40 tool so that's something that would need to be navigated as well and then third There's an opportunity to use to live for all dollars to um to integrate storage and to install Surplus storage on critical facilities and provide um uh in times when the grid goes down which is something that is technically allowed within the community solar program but there isn't a clear pathway to make it work um so some CHC so some uh some program revisions to the community solar program would be necessary to make it possible to enable storage and that's something that we're interested in seeing if there's a possibility to to make it work next slide and so some of the areas we'd love feedback on from the stakeholder communities is first is the core incentive concept that we're proposing viable see we think that's going to be an effective way to fill the program carve out and really deliver Community solar to the desired populations second is the matchmaking concept that we laid out both needed and viable third what else can we do to address some of the non-financial barriers the small scale Community solar projects encounter and then also what other ideas and suggestions do you have um so that's it for me and back over to Rob's transition to the the cou side alrighty thank you Ryan and yeah we will move right on to Bonneville environmental founder or Bonneville environmental foundation and Evan will walk us through this concept thank you rob um and everyone here on the the webinar uh thanks for joining I see a lot of uh friendly names in the chat um a lot of experts in community solar and would value your input as we move this program forward here um move to the next slide please I'm going to start with a little bit of an overview of the Bonneville environmental foundation and our work and how that relates to community solar and and where we're going to go from here um just to recap I'm Evan Ramsey I'm the senior director of the Renewables program here at bef I've been doing solar for over 16 years and we've been working with many of our consumer and Utility Partners in Oregon and in the region to assist them in scoping and delivering Community solar projects among other Technologies but this is the brief overview of what I will get into and at the end you know certainly want um your input on how we're designing this program to serve consumer owned utilities these are really projects that are enabled by these utilities when there's no mandating policy from the state it really is up to our Utility Partners in how they design these projects and we want to provide the right kind of support and resources to them as we move into this five-year next slide please so organizationally bef we have a focus on energy carbon and water and we have a National Water stewardship program energy education program our Renewables program is very focused in the Pacific Northwest here and then we do also deal in renewable energy certificates carbon offsets and water restoration next slide please our Renewables program has had a core focus of late in these areas we do have a strong focus on our consumer-owned Utility Partners both in Oregon and regionally and we've helped them in a variety of ways from feasibility studies to technical assistance and project grant funding we've done most of our electric vehicle programming in partnership with with utilities we have also been advancing tribal renewable energy projects and have been involved in low-income solar programming and projects for about the past seven or eight years next slide please um when we when we focus on low-income benefiting solar we are really focused on providing um really what the goals are of this EPA solar for all program which is economic and environmental benefits to disadvantaged communities and bef we do that almost exclusively through strong Partnerships we are always working with utilities tribes local governments affordable housing providers other non-profits the list goes on we really feel like we can go further together and we rely on our partners to um help new spreadsheet I'm really proud of myself I feel like yeah Richie you might want to mute there some of the services we provide are in the the right column there it runs the gamut from you know early scoping financial analysis all the way to project management and um uh contractor selection and even some of our energy education programs now this is this is what we have been doing historically and in the past um moving forward the role we feel um might might look a little different within Oregon's program and regionally um and that's hopefully what we can help co-design and plan for uh moving forward next slide please uh just to illustrate uh some of the Partnerships that we've formalized over the years you know this is even a small smattering of the partners that we've engaged with um and this is a little bit of a dated slide but um you can see that the range of Partners from non-profit to public to um and I probably could have five more slides listing the great Partnerships that we've been privileged to participate",

        "text": " that California or Canada that's they're all in Canada except for this one has a draft that's local but not out yet um um so these are some examples of questions that could be asked you'd want to know like what the policy is have them describe that how does it contribute to Salem's climate action plan and Emissions reduction goals um are there climate mitigation or adaptation measures implemented into the plan give a little more detail on if so what are they if not why not um will this initiative result in an increase decrease or the same amount of emissions and then if unknown how would that be tracked so again we're not asking them to have any details on that specifically I can go in and help them look through that and there are tools that I can connect them with to get more details on that um and then how does this option compare to other options clate impact what factors are considered in selecting this option um are there opportunities to enhance this project what are the associate costs and implications how will it be monitored and evaluated um for alignment with Salem's cap what natural hazards are in this initiative or are this initiative resilient to um what measures are in place to ensure that it remains resilient and will be able to adapt to a changing climate um and then how does it engage with and address concerns of vulnerable populations and ensure uh Equitable access to benefits on action um so if we're looking at those two types of tools the quantitative tool and the qualitative tool both make climate action a priority for the city they both or uh they can both provide data on emissions reductions but it's not required in the qualitative um and then the quantitative is less susceptible bias uh they both embed climate impact into decision-making process um the expertise that's required of other staff is only in the quantitative one uh well whereas the qualitative does not require outside staff to have that expertise um the policy Nexus is uh for the quantitative tool would be for bigger programs for the qualitative it's more flexible to be for smaller programs it would require less lift and then um the administrative burden there would be a lot Upfront for training other staff for how to go through a quantitative one versus a qualita questionnaire um and then there's more alignment with limited staff time in smaller programs as well as smaller municipalities or more of a qualitative ones so that's kind of the overview on both of those so with that in mind do we have any thoughts of what we would like to have this I'm having a little bit of a hard time wrapping my head around it so I'm not quite ready to say because I haven't quite wrap my head around it um I think I mentioned to you in our pre meeting the other day that you know we've done some similar work with the equity scoring and stuff with our Transit and I think that that's been a great process and I so I think modeling it in some similar fashion to that I think would be helpful where you can of I think I think a program something that's as objective as possible you know is always helpful and less um open to scrutiny once we agree you know what that would look like and that sort of thing but I I can't I haven't quite wrapped my head around enough to say more detail about go back to the SL the um what I what I really like about the quantitative is that I really think that this is a data driven issue and should remain so um it's really not up to debate we need to follow the science um I am concerned about the The Upfront lift for staff obviously um we have concerns there um but I'm also interested to talk a little bit more about the flexibility of the qualitative versus the quantitative if that makes sense um because I think when you get to this level of government you really do need a lot of flexibility to handle uh some of the smaller projects some of the um smaller issues throughout the city um and so I'm interested to find ways that we could maybe merge the do um right is there a third path but um but if if not I'm I'm I'm really interested in how do we make the quantitative able to be fible for the needs of our city if that makes any sense absolutely yeah so um let me just give an example there was uh a couple months ago someone had reached out about a project they were doing for Grant and they had asked how could it be evaluated for it being beneficial to and so I went through their proposal and I was able to get a rough estimate of greenhouse gas contributions they had a couple different options for that project so I was able to rate those options based on what is the best for climate and what would be the worst and I had um the opportunity to give some suggestions of how it would be more beneficial and so I could get that qualitative uh bit where they didn't have any of that information coming from it they could just say hey could you look at this and then I was able to bring back in that quantitative data science of how it would potentially play out in terms of emissions so yes we can do something like that yeah yeah I'm really interested in in kind of going down that a little bit that path and trying to figure this out I know we're not going to decide anything at this meeting I know it's going to be probably several meetings before we come up with something but in my opinion we should try and go down that path um I am really very very leery of bias in this whole um and I also want to L are you concerned that I am concerned when we talk about the qualitative um I think that um we're going to start having some really hard conversations about climate change and the impacts on community um not only because our climate is changing faster than I think any of us um are ready for um but that the changes that need to be made are going to have impacts on how people live um and people do not like change and they don't want to change we saw that in the information that you gathered from the open house in the surveys um I think they all are smart enough to know what needs to happen but knowing what needs to happen and then sticking with it to make sure that it happens and then adjusting your own life to the new reality is going to be the hard part of this conversation and that's where this is going to come into play and I think this needs to be um I don't want to say firm enough but strong enough um in order to endure that kind of um public struggle did any of that yeah makes a lot of sense yeah I mean I agree with both you I was going to mention the equity scoring thing because going through that and how successful it was to look at the projects for the bond especially um and the whole incorporating elements of both the quantitative and qualitative tool I need to go back and look at your slides again you know this is a lot to digest really quickly um in terms of bias um I mean even the economic impacts um versus Lifestyle Changes and uh as you said a lot of people realize what we need to do as long as somebody else is doing so yeah no other than so again not making a decision today but just so I'm reiterating what I'm hearing um is there a thought that anybody is more leaning towards having the climate lens upside or is is the thought that what I was hearing was kind of more universally like anytime can be applied by it and say that's for me I think that climate change is underlying every single issue that city council cases whether it's our unhoused crises to our transportation system to our planning for our future um the underlying current of all of it is climate and I think it should be agre you name it great so what I heard what I've kind of been hearing is that we'd like kind of a third option something that kind of incorp the best of world yes I will look into that and I will we like Perfection from you I was just going to share this has not been leadership this was fresh offer conference this was a great tool using so it's very hot very hot um okay so we are is that anybody have anything else on that one before we move on when can what are the next apps what um I'm guessing it now needs to go to leadership kind of get vetting there or do some more work and then take it to leadership yeah we'll be trying to develop the hybrid Perfection something that can go to Le team additional betting and so we'll just get an update our next meeting great thank you sound good I really like your example with how you approached that proposal thank you incorporating both I think that's a sort of thing do all right so we're now on to strategy1 reading implementing oh no we just did that one sorry climate actual plan updates do onil thanks John for staying on this long um so we recently finished the uh feasibility study and what I have here is one of the tables that they provided in the report and um based off of the payback period and a couple other factors kind of the financially viable option is for solar cover parking um and then in addition to providing some energy benefits it could also have improved resiliency if we pair it with battery storage or some type of Micro grid uh technology and then um either from directly the solar panels or based on having the conduit infrastructure there we could also incorporate e charging um and that was kind of the the main takeaways from that uh John did you have anything that you wanted to add hi uh good morning everyone um no I think that's a that's a great summary I mean this is pretty Stark uh um you know differentiation between groundbased systems and and you know roof mounted um one thing we are asking our consultants for is uh to extend the study out just a little bit to include the the former Herz property that we did not own when this study was undertaken so um assumption being of course that roof mounted and and covered parking over there would would be the same so um uh hopefully we'll have a scope and a fee for that here this week and um yeah other than that I don't think I have too much more to add um from a sort of a business perspective I like the idea of covered parking with solar panels I know I've seen a lot of other reports with those um because not only does it provide the the climate impact and the ability to uh offset our energy use uh which is a cost savings but it",

        "text": " is the need for additional transmission analysis so don't remember the exact phrasing of the comments we heard earlier today but the need for reliability analysis and power flow modeling to really see how the system reacts and whether there is transmission service rights i don't know if that's been mentioned yet today but you need to have transmission service rights as well which is kind of an accounting method for keeping track of where the power is being sold and allocated to which has a little bit different function to it um than like the physical limitations and where electricity actually flows but they're they're kind of related um so kind of with that in mind um i'll talk a little bit about northern they're the regional transmission planning entity for for the pacific northwest region as well as the inter-mountain region they basically perform analysis that examines interactions between all the local transmission plans of the region's transmission providers which there are are many some of them are listed here um bpa pacific or pg idaho power puget sound vista some of those have a lot more transmission mileage and bigger systems than others i think sean mentioned pge's transmission system you know is maybe not small but it's certainly not as large as bonnevilles or pacific cores in addition the location of where these transmission systems exist um has has some you know key overlap with with the floating offshore wind topic um bpa and pacificorp have a lot of coastal transmission and transmission in southern oregon and so those are going to be some key entities that were already raised you know for their importance and significance on continuing the conversation on floating offshore wind this trip the local transmission plans i alluded to those those are done by every transmission provider and they identify transmission upgrade and expansion needs necessary to meet transmission service requests they've received they've received from power power projects um or another way they kind of embedded that with that or the interconnect that people looking for interconnections into the bulk transmission system and so the term interconnection cues uh maybe some have heard of the herd of those um but there's like long lists of people waiting their turn in line um kind of like imagine it like going to the bakery and getting your bakery ticket um and then when it's your turn you have the option of picking you know something from the bakery and you may not want it depending on how expensive that item might be um and so there's studies that kind of do some analysis of what the upgrades might be to interconnect certain sizes of generator projects um and all this kind of stuff works together so that that kind of gets to a little bit to mike's question um i think if i'm tracking the right mic in the right question in the chat um but i think there were some questions about cost allocation maybe which i can say a few more words about but i kind of get in the deep end of the pool pretty quickly on this topic um and so if sean or um anyone from bonneville or pacific court is on the line um maybe after after we roll through this um these next maybe four or five slides or maybe i'll just go through everything and we wait until the the time slot for additional if we want to talk talk about more specifics but um the the purpose of this slide here is to kind of you know it's helpful for that background um and and i can say a little bit more about the background but the real purpose here was to highlight that their transmission planning cycle this regional transmission planning cycle is just getting started for the 2022-2023 cycle and so i have a couple or i think i have one slide that sums up an important piece of that that relates to offshore but before that let me let me say a little bit more about regional planning the purpose of this regional transmission planning is to facilitate compliance with uh four quarter 1000 requirements and so the federal does have some jurisdiction when it comes to transmission system planning um and cost allocation for that matter i don't i don't necessarily know if approving um is the right word um but but but maybe um so regional transmission planning um assesses the reliability impacts efficiency and cost effectiveness of various combinations and interactions of the identified transmission projects you know from from those local transmission plans for each transmission provider the northern grid entity this planning region each region has planning entities northern grid is ours and they promote collaboration across these individual transmission providers to coordinate on essentially a regional transmission plan that is reliable efficient cost effective and accounts for public policy goals so they'll various combinations and interactions of identified projects and then they also provide a form for cost allocation and a method for cost allocation for these new transmission so that's kind of probably enough just to what people's appetite for more try for more information but it gets complicated pretty quickly um so circling back to um this planning cycle um in addition to the transmission providers that are part of the northern grid entity there's also a state representation that's part of northern grid and so state government reps from the states that are covered by the northern grid footprint are are involved with with kind of these processes and and one of the avenues and opportunities that states can get involved with is by putting forward transmission projects that they that they would like to see studied oregon washington idaho montana wyoming utah nevada each have state reps for oregon we have state representation from the oregon public utility commission and also ourselves oregon department of energy and so we submitted a transmission study request um just the other day there was a march 31st deadline um and i'll i'll get to that specifics um so here's another map that's helpful kind of likes maps they're nice to look at and they can kind of say a thousand thousand words pretty quickly um you can kind of see here you know i was talking about the different transmission planning entities um this gives a good snapshot of a lot of the big transmission players in the um and so here's here's some details pretty high level of our transmission static study request which was itself pretty high level and so we submitted this just recently and it's being considered by northern grid along with um i think several other study requests i'm not i haven't seen the other study requests so i'm not too sure what those entail but probably the bottom line is that it's still to be determined if our requests for this study will be accepted and actually studied um but what we were thinking was um kind of relation in relation to those comments about the winston and fairview substations are you know what what are the substations going to be i guess we don't really know we don't really know if these areas are going to be leased or how these project economics pencil out who would be paying for the transmission likely the developer um but there's probably some nuance there and and the scenarios are are another question you know how much and so just to try to understand get a little bit more data you know do some reliability analysis and further further this body of work we thought it'd be interesting to put forward some scenarios that kind of bookend the two to three gigawatts we've talked about from the other studies in the the one and a half is kind of easy to understand it's six plus nine um the 600 plus the 900 fairview and once and we thought that would just be a starting point to check to check what the system can handle when you account for power flow dynamics and transmission service rights and then then we just kind of thought well let's put some other numbers down and see what happens um with impacts to the system with with larger scales so that's kind of really high level what we submitted wish i had more information for you at this point but it's kind of all tbd but i thought it was good information for this audience and then another transmission another in process transmission analysis that can build this transmission body work is some efforts by california that oregon department of energy is partnering partnering on the department of defense and they have an office of local defense and community cooperation one of my favorite acronyms that i like to say old cc but the old ccc um and they've been um involved with department of energy and and we're working with them kind of on a continuous basis to promote early coordination on energy projects of any and scale but kind of wind turbines and towers are a concern with their height and how they could impact radar and flight flight paths and things we've already heard about today so and what what happened here was um you know old dc is also concerned about energy projects in california just as much as they are here and up in washington you know their reach is pretty pretty far and um domestic security is a pretty important issue and their training is critical so um they've they've worked with odo on the orisa project oregon renewable energy siding assessment for example and so getting down to california they're interested in how offshore wind could impact stuff down in california and since northern california is so close to southern oregon um we we jumped in and are part of this as well and so you know kind of summarized it here on the slide at a high level but they're going to do some detailed technical analysis with some grant money from old cc on transmission infrastructure limitations and opportunities maps of the existing infrastructure current capacities provide some technical data and assistance to further assess the potential potential impacts of offshore wind um that's probably you know at a high level what's going on um they're they're still working through some really preliminary um contracting um down in california you know relating to the consultants that could hire to do this work so i don't really have too much more to share on this yet either engaging with public outreach with oregon stakeholders is one of the the big reasons we wanted to get involved as well so stay tuned i think is is probably the big takeaway for that i just wanna know yeah there was a couple hands up i saw sean's hand earlier but joshua's hands up right now so i wanted to um go to joshua to see what his question or comment was and invite sean if you wanted to put your hand back up if you wanted to make a comment or question you can do that too go ahead joshua all right okay thanks joshua fan with climate solutions um it seems like you know kind of at a high level sort of in the broad scope of things there's a lot of questions outstanding questions about transmission availability i'm you know i'm a policy",

up with would include everything needed to to build that so yeah the equipment would be included thanks i'll just mention that sean gibbs from south coast development council put a link to the um study in in the chat as well another question from ashley in the chat is is business oregon slash port of coos bay considering the hb 2021 labor standards that someone referenced in an earlier question thanks for that question ashley we'll put we'll put a link to our website that talks a little bit more about the hp 2021 labor standards um but i'll check to see if sean or or if anyone from the portico's base on the line would like to talk about that i don't have enough knowledge to i think we think that if it wasn't in our draft literature report i think it was though um at least we had a mentioned mention of it somewhere um and i admit it's going to come up in the feedback we receive too so it's good feedback maybe that's a good segue um jason to the slides that you have yeah i i mean i think sean might leave us here in the next few minutes um and i was kind of looking ahead to those slides in anticipation of maybe any other questions that might come up um you know regionalization on this economic development kind of like with the multiple ports sean i don't know as do you know anything about any engagement to cr have you been contacted or is there any kind of any thoughts on on that kind of multiple coordination across different ports you know whether it's in oregon or outside of oregon um i i haven't really i haven't really seen any developers that are have inquired about other ports outside of coos bay they're mostly right now targeting the coos bay area i you know the other the other site or the other port that's under consideration is humble in in california and that you know it seems to kind of be the two bookends of the of this area i think the general consensus is that as we reach critical mass with this industry that you know we'll continue to build out and attract more supply chain companies uh to service this industry and you know manufacture parts and pieces of the of the turbines and and don't necessarily have to be located at the porta coos bay they could be located uh elsewhere in the region or elsewhere in oregon too transport those into to the term manufacturing terminal at the portuguese bay thanks john and we also had some feedback on uh potential you know we've been talking about maybe the economic benefits from offshore wind but um we did get some feedback about kind of balancing and looking at like the net benefits i don't know if that's something that business oregon would take a look at or would it be a different different entity maybe not a state entity maybe it'd be a private study or something but net benefits as far as yeah so like you know as i understand business organization you talked about the green economy and some of the sustainable economic development so you're interested in economic development and then does that kind of factor in the industry you're trying to maybe help that we got feedback that supporting an industry or bringing on another industry kind of have trade-offs i guess would be one way to put it but um there could be maybe negative impacts to other industries and trying to figure out how best to balance that is like the optimization is that tied to part of the analysis that business oregon has typically done for some of those industries that you've looked at in the past or would consider doing for like offshore wind yeah i think it i think it's under cons you know it's under consideration uh you know we're watching closely uh you know this study and and other studies from bowman etc that and and taking into account the the other industries and how they're affected um you know yeah maybe there's more analysis like i mean i don't know if you've thought about that or you know not to put you on the spot i was trying to jump ahead i think jason's starting to cover some of the topics in his later slides because he's worried he won't be there um there are a few other uh comments here in the chat i just wanted to um surface and um looking to take a lunch break here in the next 15 or 20 minutes so um yeah i wanted to make sure we had time for that um in addition to the hb 2021 labor standards question that ashley asked she asked um if there's any considerations about community benefit agreements um i also added to the chat um a website that odo hosts on the hb 2021 labor standards attestations that toxic that basically is our to comply with that part of the the statute which is that any person who constructs or repowers a renewable energy generation sequestration or storage facility with a capacity of 10 megawatts or greater in oregon is required to comply with hp 2021 responsible labor standards and then shannon asked whether boem could comment on the potential for multi-port collaboration and the scope of their pacific coast port assessment um so whitney i'm not sure if you um have the chance to do that now before jason jumps into his slides sure so um i don't think shannon thanks for the question i don't know how much i can can share there is a study in procurement right now but in looking at a regional assessment with california so it's not a pacific coast wide it's focused in in california as a part of sort of as in coordination or collaboration with the state of california and ab525 uh runfies asked whether there was a link to the procurement for that study whitney in case you or one of your colleagues have that link available for the chat um go ahead jason oh i was just getting us ready uh yeah and shawn you know thanks a lot um if you need to depart um we may lose sean so thanks again and i'm gonna shift into the feedback we received so the bill specifically listed jobs is something for us to take a look at you know kind of in in the threat of the benefits and challenges analysis so the department asked a few questions about about this topic you know are there local job forces that might benefit from the type of work activity that offshore wind could bring to the um how could potential economic development benefits accrue to different communities and states we talked a little bit about that from sean's our economic benefits expected to primarily be confined to port areas where the floating offshore winds deployed could there be trade-offs between the economic benefits of flooding offshore wind potential effects to existing port economies something i touched on and then how could uh floating offshore wouldn't lead to a net positive economic benefit so that that's kind of a refresher of questions we asked um i have a few slides just summarizing the themes we heard so economic benefits are going to be significantly tied to the ports um that makes sense that that was kind of a finding from the literature review as well but there is an opportunity for the supply chains to kind of spread further and reach beyond reach beyond the ports and then you know there's also the opportunity for multiple ports so port upgrades could also benefit other industries including fishing and marine transportation that was flagged i heard a reference to john gibbs being on the meeting thanks for joining sean um i think you chatted something earlier with your role down down in that south coast area you may be able to add more to this channel modification project if people are interested in that but um i'll just keep moving on for now and get us to the additional feedback period um but this this channel modification project was flagged as something um it's been in the works for a long time and you know it could be it could be um a springboard or you know something that has synergistic benefits floating offshore when we're ever to come to coos bay um there could be some some value to that project going forward but we also talked about the dredging concerns so lots of issues bundled up there flooding offshore wind can do this to bring the supply chain growth and i think we've talked about that enough um so location of economic benefits we had some themes around this topic we talked about the supply chains collaborative regional approach um we talked about you know at a high level some of the pros and cons of that but that was feedback we received and then there'd be also additional economic benefits from transmission upgrades around the interconnections in other parts of the state potentially if floating offshore wind were developed at scale there's been studies that indicate the transmission system would need to get upgraded as well so different aspects of economic job development potential here's here's the net economic benefit feedback we received as you can see there was different views and these views need to be balanced at the end of the day um if floating offshore wind you know does does kind of it could could bring benefits but it could also have adverse impacts to existing industries such as fisheries some of the opportunities for offshore wind would be to help complement cyclical downturns in existing industries such as timber and fisheries overall i think we got a few pieces of feedback highlighting kind of both sides of this and then other pieces of feedback talking about these opportunities to create mutually beneficial strategic partnerships across different industries indirect economic benefits was also service industries like hospitality and recreation other support services if there's an influx of",

        "text": " as well for the city because it's on city property even though it's done and and it's fair to say some Gardens are um addressed in a better fashion than others um so yeah I'm thinking about the art project I just know and I'm not speaking as an artist or for artists but have heard comments about people keep asking us to do painting you know for nothing and this is their livelihood so I was just thinking thr possibility of having students do it maybe partnering with um our teachers and maybe wouldn't get quite as much money for them but it's also involves education could involve education about parks and keeping them clean and that kind of thing uh not sure where this is to go in something for don't to take into account when we were talking about transportation and parking lot stand and stuff but I can recall when the Riverfront Park was developed and the sidewalk was put in there and tiles were distributed to elementary kids and they made those tiles and they've been placed in the sidewalk there along river front I think that's treasure I think it's wonderful and that's that's an engagement that will continue to connect those people with that spot for the rest of life um that kind of idea wonderful I would like to encourage as much as possible so that when we develop bicycle hubs yeah sidewalks extensions we try to keep in mind some kind of way to engage the local residents especially youth but local residents in inputting to it in some way that the tiles that are mounted in the sidewalks in River Front are typical or great example but I I just think we it adds ownership and when people own something they protect it they value it you respect it so I I hope we can do that kind of thing off as much as possible I think those kinds of things are good and we we've had um bike like share stations and things like that in the Parks I think just and and just to keep in mind it doesn't mean these aren't good projects to move forward because I think it we have to look at how we Implement those and what the expectations are when when you put things in like that um if you're talking the tiles when those tiles are damaged or when those tiles become an issue whose responsibility is that to replace and quite honestly a lot of those become Parks responsibilties so what you've done initially with a very good idea and very good intent becomes a burden to Parks operations then to have to to replace and to deal with it so those are all but you're 100% right on the engagement in the community and all of that so I just think in in the The Bike Share hubs that we've had when those bikes get stolen when when they get vandalized and when the hubs gets things it's in the park whose responsibility and in some cases that becomes our responsibity so I think you know you just have to be careful when you put those kinds and do those things of what those contracts look like what's the expectation who's going to be responsible um if it is you know doesn't come off as we hope it will um and some it just depends on the location where it's at so those are all great ideas and and good Revenue things but we just need to make sure we put the framework in so on the back end it doesn't become an issue for for parks and and historically that's that happens with a lot of those things yeah I would just be clear I'm not going to go to B for all these ideas was so starting the conversation I figured there'd be some holes and whatnot and I'm sure some of this is underway like you mentioned like the stride costs and so this was meant to be a starting point of conversation and hopefully we can all use this to build on it and keep thinking but I do like your past idea your past idea on the strike because that is not like something that we've that we've thought about just you know the individual events and obviously the uh the type of the run whether it's a 3K 5K whatever 10K um so your past idea is that is a is a nice one as we're looking at incorporating those to no I don't mean it like that I'm just saying as we're doing the stri ones that's another concept we hadn't we hadn't thought opportunity to do that and and your comment is um is with regard to you know some people do like to pay things one time and then they don't have to worry about it and they're good to go so I like that any other quick thoughts on on these Revenue discussions right now well I guess I put a question to you as the chair or the member of the committee like how can we all keep sending ideas to you to take on yeah so that that's how I was going to close it out is to say as as you think about this more right as you brainstorm we are very much in the brainstorming session uh of of idea generation around ways that we can generate revenue for the city so as Dylan said I'm on the revenue task force for the city uh we've had our first meeting uh just a couple weeks ago we have our next meeting here at the end of the month um and we're looking to for new sources of revenue to generate $15 million a year um that's the that's the deficit for the city over the next uh uh I think in two years that's kind of the Outlook in 2026 so um so we got to work cut out for us on that um but open to to any and all ideas that's kind of where we're at right now is exploring those uh broad spectrum of ideas and uh in ways the city can can generate some more Revenue within the constraints that are currently exist in in state law Eric yeah uh my only concern you know always keep in mind don't put any of this burden on the people that can afford it the least um and uh so you know as you look any any item of Revenue how does this affect the people that cannot or would hurt their their ability to food and PID certainly something to always keep mind and I think this is something that uh so kind of moving into the board member updates right this is my update to the board I'm on that task force uh so please do kind of keep these ideas coming as as things hit uh hit your mind um no idea is a bad idea send it in to me uh happy to to make sure it's on our list of considerations um particularly as it relates to to revenue for the parks um if that be dedicated Revenue in in the our Parks maintenance budget 9.3 million well not next c9.3 million right so of that 15 I I know that in part because it was one of the examples of like well if we don't have that $15 million what do we lose and it's all of the parks maintenance and something else was paired with that I don't remember what it was in the example but that was one of the examples thrown out there right so um so it's a chunk it's a chunk of money uh the cities need to look for and Mickey's doing her end on the budget side uh to to to fix that and I'm on the on the revenue side uh for it so um so that's that's my board member update uh Other Board member updates Debbie I was going to call on you specifically about the the class you attended in Eugene if you can give a quick update on that yeah I went with Rob and Juliana um and it's the green cities project in Eugene uh and it's an undergraduate project uh with University of Oregon uh School of planning public policy um and management and we I just listen to all these people um coming up with these students coming up with ideas and uh working on uh the city solar initiative um is what they're focusing on it sounds like and um more specifically on gear Park and ways that they can um bring in solar panels or uh different kind the micro grid idea that was brought up earlier um and so it's kind of a it's a course that they do that you know we get free advice from them and they could do a lot of the research you know that we might need and uh hopefully help us to come up with some ideas that become practical and and possibly ways to pay for them uh through grants and things like that um so it was it was very interesting um just this undergraduate class full of people spending their their term trying to do practical things you know um put to put to take policy and to put it you know and and make it work so it was um part of a year-long project that Salem has been chosen for excellent any questions for Debbie about that all right thanks Debbie appreciate your participation in that that and that work um another board member update uh is just the the spiff committee met and so that was uh myself Dylan and Allan uh met with Staff last week the February 1 Thursday Thursday last week yeah um uh and reviewed all the fifth grants I think you had a report on that in your in your agenda packet here um so you can kind of see the outcomes of that but U good discussion there from that committee uh any other board member updates just add to what you said that we had historic um application most applications we've had which I feel like really speaks to all the work we did so kudos to everyone here I like we did all that Outreach and people responded by submitting request hopefully our neighborhood AR yeah like it thank you for the award wel excellent uh I am losing track information reports uh those were written reports sub any comments or questions on those information reports question yeah maybe I should hold until any other questions coming up because it's not directly related to those I just had one small it's just following up what I said earlier Rob I don't even here with the plans that are the master planning processes once again for if we already presented to a neighborhood association if you could just send us a personal reminder for that so we can try and just keep doing our due diligence the paying them on that I think that'd be great so long that's easy enough and just so understand so when when uh when we have when we're going to engage neighbor Association you You' like us to let you know no more when these processes start and so let me just pull this up here L drive cost when so the Fairview Park on January 26 oh no sorry that's um so there's the online survey for Fisher Road M Park master",

        "text": " have more time on it that study was more of a broad in terms of contributions to the grid some of which being resilience reliability related but but the study wasn't necessarily concentrated on that however as we move forward what i think what the collective um understanding how that how that is evolving um is very much along the lines of reliability um and resilience and uh this is an area of active research and and um certainly a big part of the study we have ongoing right now other studies that are happening down in california and and i also spend time working directly for the department of wind energy technology office and this subject of reliability um through coastal uh power generation and reversal of power flows uh sort of we're still understanding all the benefits that could accrue uh as well as as adverse impacts so it's um it's an exciting area to uh to be working in right now please next slide you very much so i guess it's like i could cut off a little bit sorry about that but um if we just start on the left half of the of the slide uh to begin with the first two statements i'll just read those uh most of the clean energy goals which are shown in this insert diagram here the clean energy standards and any offshore one specific legislation at the state and i believe jason you you overview those before i hop on the call but most of those uh which are which are prevalent uh in the western uh will be met through variable renewable energy resources and the scale at which they will be end and the speed with which the accelerate the transition will our formidable challenges to the power sector and specifically there are challenges around resource adequacy so the ability of generation to serve load at any given time so the timing of production the timing of loads the flexibility of loads is part of that conversation as well and that's that's evolving over time and then also you know grid reliability and resilience aspects um which are have more to do the various reserves that are required across the system to balance side intermittency any sort of supply side and transmission contingency events you know operational impacts which accrues that just the reality of operating a power system um there are a lot of moving pieces uh that are required that we have a certain thank you for moving it over that's pretty cool you can do that live um there are many many pieces that that are inter that uh interplay and the sort of the interplay of those pieces has sort of evolved given a certain mix a certain generation mix in a certain demand uh footprint and and temporal uh all those things are changing and and certainly on the supply side changing drastically quickly that's what the plot shows and everyone's tracking that i think um so it's really a new world and so now moving to the right half of the slide here uh what's the role for offshore one we have a bit of a clean slate right now particularly out west there are of course people tracking call areas that have been announced um in california first but then also most recently draft call areas in oregon there's an opportunity here to to kind of cultivate um some resources to find those that provide benefits beyond energy beyond you know we know that offshore when right now floating offshore wind doesn't provide the most competitive cost of energy resource but that is changing rapidly as patrick uh discussed and has projected in his work but beyond that the energy production value but what else what else is it how about the temporal value what about the capacity value um of the resource particularly as we move to a world with less and less dispatchable generation so these are the questions we asked these are things we're interested in what we studied in 2020 and um and then what we talked about last week in san francisco at pacific offshore wind summit and what we're concentrating on right now um with our work so what are we interested in um is is correlations with with load and net load as especially as vre variable renewable energy resources become more and more prevalent on our system and then we also think about future emerging variable renewable energy production that will be decided to you know in compliance with house bills 2021 um so and not to mention the pure economics of power generation when what is the capacity factor certain key times of the day and year and then specifically what are power flow impacts associated with place and generation in a spot where the grid did not evolve to take it yeah that's that's the big change here um so there's an opportunity with existing uh um transmission infrastructure in oregon to incorporate power flows on the order of two gigawatts um and that's uh and then you know that actually correlates or corresponds with an installed capacity that's higher than two gigawatts but when we think about actual power flows onto the system um we have a couple of studies now kind of pointing to around two gigawatts of a flow directly to on existing transmission networks but i will say and that's that was kind of the focus of of the study and and and some other studies at that time but now we're moving to think about think a little bit bigger you know what now knowing that number what would it take uh capture some of these benefits at a larger scale and that's that's sort of where the conversation is shifting but the house bill 3375 number came out of these uh was partially motivated by some of this work in in early 2020 please next uh please move to the next thank you so just just to touch on a few elements of that study and then mention the the current study and then i'll i'll hand it back to jason um one aspect of this study was this kind of review of inherent correlation or complementarity of generation of just the natural timing of the natural resource so this is without energy storage just just you know what is the natural inherent complementarity of offshore wind with loads across the major balancing authorities in oregon and and the pacific northwest and then also with uh existing and emerging variable renewable energy resources so we ran one aspect was a vre somebody used that term a lot variable renewable energy um a complementarity study that study was based on the uh the resources that are shown in this image here um so of course we had four different locations that span the oregon coastline astoria newport reedsport and port-au-prince all located these are offshore wind queries of offshore wind resources offshore wind speeds namely at 100 meter hub heights and those were those are all approximately kind of ranging between 20 and 40 kilometers offshore into the ocean but that's the offshore one footprint at the left side of the slide and then we looked at some in the green both the green dots i come from the onshore wind industry so i'm very familiar with the columbia river gorge uh footprint we queried three different sites in that in that area and southeastern washington there's there's another cluster of you know strong wind resource there and then of course any pacific people on the phone or or specifically ratepayers um you know really strong wyoming wind resources that are wheeled to serve loads in the in the pacific northwest so we consider the temporal and spatial aspects of those resources and then full credit to oto here on this on this part of the study they pointed me to utility scale pv power production in central and i guess it's south central um oregon um i always forget about that old half of oregon that's the east of the the the nevada boundary there the nevada california boundary but really it's kind of kind of central southern oregon there's some utility scale uh pv uh project development so these are the resources we queried over time and we ran these um sorry to show some math but the the pearson correlation just a simple pearson correlation coefficient which just looks just tries to quantify in one number how two different series of data correlate with each other um and we did that on an hourly basis and group the results by season and i'll show some of the high level high level findings there but i'll i would refer to the published work and happy to take questions afterwards so we don't end up down a rabbit hole taking everybody's time just a quick quick note here that complementarity these what motivates this sort of a check you know we'd like to see that it would be interesting to note uh any inherent correlation of resource production with load right that's that's helpful if in time loads or generation is available when loads are available that's capacity value and um and that's that's an adequacy good type of contribution so that's valuable from a reliability and resilience perspective um and then also you can think of you know everyone's probably familiar with this idea of the duct curve or intermittent generation with solar is really predictable so you have a sense for a very clean diurnal profile most of the time um if you can find a resource that comes in in the evening hours in particular when the when the solar resource is receding that's valuable right because that that maybe limits some of the strain on hydropower or other other kind of dispatchable resources um to help fill the shortfall there so that's that's another way of thinking about the implications of complementarity to reliability and resilience next slide please so we made a bunch of the slide 51 i guess this left prior thank you so much so in the in the report here um which i have referenced in these slides if you'd like to find it we provided parallelograms or we we did this kind of hourly complementarity put them on a matrix there was one of those on a couple slides back it's kind of colorful matrix just to show um the the the the qualitative um uh alignment with loads hourly and uh hourly production or of of gener of electricity or consumption of electricity depending on what um which item you're looking at on the corollagram we made these um by season using multiple years of data and we came up with the following conclusions here um just some high level conclusions there are other conclusions in those corollograms but first starting the left side with resource complementarity so again this is how supply side resources might work well together or not uh the first one that we noticed was that offshore wind um there was much there was a great degree of alignment hourly across the full oregon coast um not a whole lot of variation there that which was interesting um but there was some ability inherent ability of offshoring to help balance onshore wind in the columbia river gorge and",

triangles i know it's hard to see but the green triangles represent the wind turbines themselves and the dotted line that runs north west is the overhead transmission line and the attached black and white line represents the site boundary itself and if at any point council has any questions for me don't hesitate to ask this slide um is our procedural history and i apologize this is rfa 7 procedural history not rfa 6. didn't catch that sorry the department received the preliminary rfa for rfa7 on april 19th 2022 and following our review uh we deemed the amendment complete on may 12 2022 and we a complete request for amendment 7 also on may 12th on may 13th the department issued its dpo recommending that council approve rfa7 as well as we issued the determination that type b for this amendment request was justified additionally on that same day may 13th the department issued a notice of public comment period on the amendment request and on the dpo itself the comment period extended 24 days from may 13th through june 6th no comments on the dpo or on the rfa were received during that comment period and i think i will just go into well and we're there we're here today june 24 um for council's review of the proposed but i did want to describe the differences between the type a review amendment review and type b amendment review council rules describes the differences in review or type a and type b review paths the type a review is the standard or default amendment review process for changes that require an amendment one of the key procedural differences between the type a and type b review process is that type a review requires a public hearing on the dpo and provides an opportunity to request a contested case proceeding on the department's proposed order whereas a type b review does not there's no dpo hearing nor the opportunity to request a contested another difference between the type a and type b review process relates to the time afforded to the department in making its determination of completeness on the amendment and issuance of the dpo this next slide um is an overview of the proposed order and a summary of the changes made from the dpo to the proposed order as mentioned at the forefront of my the changes made in the proposed order administrative um there were updates made to the introduction section uh as well as section two of the proposed order which is the amendment process section and lastly uh administrative updates made to the scope of review of the request for amendment section which is section three the proposed order itself was provided to council as attachment one of the staff report for this agenda item so that's agenda item e and that was provided two weeks ago onto the next for this presentation to counsel and as i presented in the proposed order itself the department wants to note that although a full review of all applicable standards was conducted and and presented in the proposed order the department concluded that the changes proposed in rfa 7 would not result in impacts necessitating new or amended site certificate conditions and that to the extent applicable previously imposed conditions would continue to minimize potential impacts under the following applicable standards and requirements listed on this slide with that the department does not plan on discussing these standards any further during the presentation today however if council has specific questions about any of these standards the department would be glad to discuss then the following three slides provide the department's substantive changes um i'll go into that so this is moving into your review of the proposed order and the standards that the department uh have substantively evaluated in the proposed for the general standard of review the department recommended council amend condition 137 to remove the wind turbine dimension specificity and rather rely instead upon council's mandatory in division 25 the mandatory condition which is division 25 006 sub 3 sub a would or that this mandatory condition requires that the facility be designed and constructed substantially as described in the site certificate the existing site certificate condition condition 137 contains a summary of wind turbine dimensions based on the current condition and if repowered this recommended approach to remove specific dimensions from 137 would remove the automatic site amendment triggered by the existing condition and would would allow some flexibility in the if a change is minimal enough that impacts to resources protected by council standards would not on this screen i have the department's proposed strike through an amendment to the condition which removes the height requirements found in a and c well and b for the land use standard the department recommended in the proposed order that council find that umatilla county has not adopted any specific standards or code provisions that would apply to dimension changes proposed in rfa7 no amended or new conditions were the last standard that i'm going to be going over today the public health and safety standards for wind energy facilities for this standard the department recommends council find that there are adequate codes and engineering evaluations that apply to the evaluation of minimum above ground blade tip clearance and hub to ensure continuation of minimal health and safety impacts to the public from blade or tower if the turbines are repowered and that the change in minimum above ground blade tip clearance would not warrant any new or changes to devices or design layout with that unless there are additional questions or comments i will move into a council's decision on the proposed the department recommends council adopt the proposed order as the final order in grant issuance of an amended site so i'll leave it there for you chair grail thank you chase are there any questions or comments for chase adam chair this is henley chase in the proposed order that i have a copy of um it references a condition 137 and on page seven it just says there's and there's no preceding reference to condition 137. it just says 137 say that it's the condition 137. yes it's line 39. i guess i would just suggest that you add the word condition in there so that it's clear i think it's fairly clear because it is referenced later as the condition 137 very first reference doesn't call it a condition it just calls it by number so i might add that uh council member jenkins can you um indicate the page number sure it's on page 7 and it's line 39 of the proposed order that's what you have what's that does that match what you have um i don't have it up in front of me right now but i just uh in case so i assume that if somebody makes a motion they're gonna make a reference to that to make that change in the final order and so i just wanted to get that clear um for the uh the motion language any other questions comments sure i'll give it a try um madam chair this is hanley i'm moved that the council adopt the proposed order as final order and issue the seventh amended site certificate or the state line win project and include a addition of the word preceding um so it'd be on page seven line one third of line 39 it would read amended condition 137. thank you yeah madam chair this is kent and al another question comments mr secretary please call perry choctoot and buyer cindy condon hanley jenkins marcy graham yes kent howe yes jordan truett motion carries madam chair thank you mr thank you chase madam chair this is patrick rowe yes patrick councilmember buyer's vote on that action item was not audible for those of us that are participating remotely and so i suspect that means it's not going to be audible on the recording you may want to redo that make sure that her microphone is on thank you and just a reminder so there's always myself included there's always just a split second delay when you turn on the microphone and when you speak so you know i think it's just sort of give it just a pause for a second and then just lean into the microphone and then that way it'll ensure it catches so just for the voice vote on that so i'll recall that so and buyer for the record empire yes thank you you okay our next agenda item is a demo of mapping a reporting tool from wally adams odo operations and policy analyst he will present a demonstration of the oregon renewable energy siting assessment mapping and reporting tool good morning wally good morning council and chair grill just need a second here to get set up and to start sharing my screen when we're totally remote we don't have to have the time to physically switch okay thank you again um and good morning so about a year ago actually i did a presentation on the oregon renewable energy siting assessment project to council and i'll give you a brief refresher on the project but at the time we said that part of the project was to develop a mapping and reporting tool and that is now done and has been launched and that's really the purpose here today and we'll jump into that pretty quick and",

        "text": " and the lighting under the cumo of effect standard which we just reviewed um and if I could get the next um we will say we we don't have a recommendation on how that should be done we don't think there were practical measures raised in the comments that can be easily implemented without um adversely affecting the operations of the facility so but I we did want to scope out the issue more for you and and see if you had additional ideas wanted us to go further um this slide shows the current state of energy development in the vicinity um you can see that this uh facility is proposed to be cited uh obviously adjacent to the other Wheat Ridge facilities towards the the left in the yellow um you can see the striped uh components of the proposed Sunstone solar project and the proposed Wagon Trail solar project um also close to the bombing range um there's an existing or multiple existing local jurisdictional wind farms to the north of the project and then the proposed no one Hills uh facility would be going into the East um if I can get the next slide um we don't really have the capability of doing the visual impacts analysis in house but I did want to show that we we can see where turban locations are uh in the vicinity so you can see the green and um uh locations different color uh it kind of throughout the site boundary here and then you can see where the existing um other turbine locations are to the west and north of the facility um so it does add a significant number of turbines to an area that's already uh experiencing sub substantial energy development um people have uh arguments on either side that that's a good thing that's not a good thing um so this is just what it is uh I guess going back to the comments about public utilities I do also want to point out that the b2h line is proposed to intersect with this site boundary um and would cross the uh transmission line Corridor and the alternate route to the left of the main Green Line there I think is what's being considered under Amendment three two two not not there yet um okay if I could get to the next slide um this is the certificate holders uh zone of visual influence um modeling for the proposed facility and just the proposed facilities turbines um and I just want to show that that the turbines would be visible from most of the northern part of the county um as well as much of uh the northern part of umill County the the vicinity um what's indicated by the coloring here is how many turbine locations are visible um I do want to point out that distance attenuation and topography May screen well may make some of these turbines less visible this is really a bare Earth analysis um I think you're familiar with these kind of analyses now um the uh uh yeah I I go into more specifics about um the Le and but turbines but we do believe that them being prominent in their geographic location they would be be visible for much of the green areas um at least closer to them so uh if I could get the next slide please uh so this is the certificate holders visual simulation um of what the turbines or what the facility would look like from just north of the Confluence of little Butter Creek and butter Creek um it's hard to see with the lighting in the room uh but there are multiple turbines visible on the um north side of Le and view uh and then on the top of the The View as well um this is from a distance I think of two miles um have to check exactly uh so you can see there will be turbines visible um there will be a number of turbines visible not just the ones on the top of the but um uh I guess that is for one reason I I guess I I wanted to bring this up in part just to show that eliminating the turbines on the top of the view wouldn't necessarily eliminate all of the visual impacts from the facility the horizontal line represents the height the horizontal line represents um where the components are in the viewshed so it's really hard to see now but on the very Left End it there is a turbine visible on the top of the but and then on the very right end of it you can see portions of turbines or turbines blades that are cited uh moving down that Ridge Wine okay um if you oh that's not the height that they're going to the height they would go the distance yeah that's just where they are in the viewshed um great so next slide um and again this is just another depiction of the map of the turbines on gleum but itself you can see um uh towards the lower right hand side of the slide is more of the peak of the but and then there's these turbine strings going down the fingers of the be um Topography is not great and then of course there would be this access road going to the um uh proposed lay down yard in the middle um uh so yeah this is all really just for your reference and kind of to give you some scoping we did want to hear if you have any additional input or or would like us to dig into this further um because of this particular layout uh it does it's it's not clear how many turbines would need to be eliminated to to Really mitigate the visual impacts um and so I think the council's decision on what's practicable really becomes comes into play with if we're looking at any kind of mitigation for elimination of turbine locations and if there's no Council sort of two comments one big umbrella we did hear comments on cumulative effects of energy development in this part of the state and we heard that from a couple of commenters um during our meeting in Heron and that's a separate bit that we probably need to have a discussion about without decisions at this point but to to be thoughtful about it because that landscape has changed fairly dramatically in the past 20 some years on the recent you issues um our standards are pretty clear on what's protected and what we have to respond to the cumulative effect standard probably allows us some discretion but as you pointed out what that looks like is is pretty pretty hard to determine and thinking about that um I I don't have a an easy solution I certainly sympathize with the property owners whose whose world is changing but I'm not sure that we have the tools um in our standards to address that and correct me if I'm wrong but as I read through things that's kind of where I'm landing I was this is kanton I was thinking this we don't really have cor correct me if I'm wrong design review standards for something like the number of towers on a landscape uh at what point do you reach a saturation or you know something that visually becomes um something we'd want to regulate I guess I'll to secretary as but uh chair how that's that's a question I I oh believe I agree CH okay uh uh councelor CH to I see you there thank you chair how for the record this Perry choc I want to make the aware that uh in the last 10 years we've lost 37 species of birds across the planet and these wind energy projects are a big contributor to their death so any type of studies or analysis that can take place to curb that death of what the tribes consider a sacred animal Birds they're they're incapable of sin they carry our prayers to heaven we we need to look and make sure that we're not putting pure poison out there on the landscape I have I heard that uh down in California one of the wind energy facilities uh made a false statement when they talked about the fatality of birds of raptor and it was it was Eagles and it was a massive amount that was killed in the facility so I just wanted to make everybody aware of that that um these these projects have the capability of doing Mass damage and being on the Flyway doesn't help them very much so so anything we can do to protect these animals that that don't have a voice we have to have a voice for them so thank you for your time today thank you counselor chak toot um any other comments from Council I'll just respond um to your question and I think at least from my perspective that visual impacts cumulative or not is one of the hardest environmental impacts to evaluate because they're we don't have as the department of energy specific criteria at which point I mean what we do have is the definition of significant and we have seen some developers break that down to evaluate this in combination with one or more factors is it significant to that that's being impacted whether it's a person or a resource um but yeah I mean we don't have a metric that says at certain height with certain infrastructure now it's significant or ACC cumulative impact so it's a difficult question and standard the cumulative standard doesn't have division 21 information requirements which further limits our ability to go well what was it that they were supposed to do in the first place to evaluate the standard um but thank you Tom for looking into that any other comments chair how yes um I I don't have a comment specific speically for this project that we're looking at right now but more of a broad comment about cumulative effects and um you brought up that word significant seems to be the the real matter it's hard to really um understand for me it's hard to understand how do I how do I look at this as a significant issue enough um when I don't have anything to go off of um but yet at the same time the landscape is dramatically transforming in front of my eyes so something is happening but there is no I'm not in a place to where I can actually give input to what's happening I don't know if that makes sense or not but I I'm um I'm hoping that this cumulative effect is um more thoroughly looked at during our role making um because that's probably the most appropriate time for that to happen so um but I do also sympathize with um the comments that were brought up um during public comic period and just um how dramatic it really is um and want to make sure that that's that's known by this Council thank you okay right uh thank you council members thank you for the discussion um I won't revisit it I did want to respond to council member chak T's comment that there there are uh and I think uh council member devilin is raising his hand maybe more physical councelor Devin we see your wanting to say something oh councelor delin can you hear me is he muted can you hear me now yes we gotta I must have been muted there",

        "text": " it's not on there because that's what people are going to think because I know I can pay a lot of my notifications so I apologize Cub Scouts out there that want to meet with me before the meeting so Keith can you finish up running a meeting yeah oh go ahead I'm sorry I'm not paying attention to No Worries so on the um the proposed new build just uh towards the bottom after the total amount due it says make check payable the city of sure would include account and customer number on check so I see an account number where's the customer um and then page four of the presentation what's the back of the bill um right above Street fees definitions that if you read that sentence I see a problem with that there's at least that type well there might be another but that you know we're not doing anything in Hillsboro so there needs to be some is that what our current bill says because that mailing I had to have been anyone actually changed the back of this when they were giving me this information so yeah I I mean from a purely practical stamp well it's it's using the word Hillsboro it's so sure well that but it's missing something but if that is the case and this is the first time we've heard of it then that means we're wasting so much time and effort printing this like maybe we're but if I I don't know I just if we use this one every thousandth time so it's the back of a bill in the bill so it's it's instead of the blank back of the bill people are getting this stuff I think it's valuable I will confirm but I I think I don't think it says Hillsboro on our current bill but I could be wrong we have read this thing over and over you don't even know right I think it's just important are you saying uh council president that it is no more expensive to print two-sided than it is to print one-sided no I'm not saying that but I think it is important for those that are still getting a paper Bill okay that the um our customer service can talk with them okay it does not I'd be in favor of knocking uh 50 cents off my bill every month if I go to Electric I'm just saying incentivize the people shut down the Paper Factory here I right we have done nothing to incentivize people to go paperless and just I don't know if you've heard that so on our current bill ability so this is I knew you know I didn't look this over as close because bed mailing grab some information off of a Hillsborough bill I think that's what happened because we did have to make a few changes and we just missed that word we'll make sure we get that fixed so we don't use that yeah painting up those are just the two things that were just kind of but like oops and then this is just a side by side um the only difference is on the new bill we rolled up some of the charges but the total bill is the same yeah thank you for putting this together and then lastly this is what the we all love this this is the Sherman Broadband Bill and Ben nealing they did this 100 I don't know yeah non-resident yes people get broadband and nothing else is not anymore actually there yeah yeah and by the way when you went back to the I had I didn't have any problem with the current bill but I do think that the new bill is easier to read and it I like all the numbers in the one column on the you know what I mean like yeah I think that's much better well and there's also I mean like Ben Bailey is supposed to provide us a couple recommendations so there's even the possibility of using two additional new samples of something completely different I don't know yeah I find with the look of the new one if if we I mean and even if we can't but if we could split out the Clean Water Service in the city I think I think that's good for people to see yeah somehow but still maintaining a two-page bill not every page if there's a way it has to stay away yeah we can't add a second page it cost is stupid so for my clarity number one criteria my number two criteria is if you can break out the charges and I think there's space to figure it out yeah and for me like I trust you figure it out I don't care you guys are the experts exactly do do is there value in somewhere making the statement that folks know that you know these are dedicated fund dollars that are paid they cannot be spent on anything other than these things in which they're as defined is that maybe that's in the back boilerplate to say yeah this is our cover funds yeah good when you when counselors when you talk about splitting out the fees so are you suggesting that there be a line item that shows the city of Sherwood base sewer fee instead of it being um shown together correct so I bill is consumption cos city of Sherwood I know that that's being built by city so I know that my bill when people say Sherwood is so expensive that happens but a good chunk of it is because it's a password from Clean Water Services you can't tell that on the new bill now I don't know if it's a big deal it just sum that stuff out to me yeah I don't my feeling would be I mean until this meeting it well it didn't even occur to me that it wasn't just the check I'm writing to the city of Charlotte you know it's all just right so you sure would and I but that is one thing I actually point out to people when they say wow a water bill's so high and I say take a look at it and you will see that a good chunk of it is a pass-through between water services it's not this would be a short list yeah the flip side of that though is people see two ion items I think they're getting double checked yeah totally as well so why am I getting charge points for sewer do I make a terror twice for whatever yeah so I think there's six one yeah we hear both sides I would say the breakout is on the back just say you know hey this is the pass-through I I don't know there might be you don't know what portion of separated out I mean the system so it's broken down in the system so we can say okay this person's Clean Water Services version is sure what it's just to make the bill look cleaner and you know less line items because when you start looking at all these charges and being nippled and dying just what people feel that less so other counselors what do you think do you like it rolled together as suggested or broken out Renee what do you think go back to it Ager and I would refer to what staff they're the experts okay Dan what do you think I like the new one and I think that there's the coupon Services broken up is still on one page for that would be nice I think even on one page if you have a second column first columnist city of Sherwood's second column that's Outside that you have numbers and vote columns you're not adding any additional space it could be a messaging opportunity too if we do decide to do a roulette just to kind of get ahead of those questions we can put something out there saying if you're concerned about the breakdown you can call in and we can give you that breakdown over the phone or something like that frankly you could just say a lot of but that's where the URL could go right for more detail you go to the URL right or I don't know if everybody has the internet but this bill on the right for me from a user experience and uh UI and the cleanness and everything I think it I think it reads better I agree I agree and that's the idea of a yield the idea of a URL that would give them more detail or something um I'm supportive of that the idea that if if you did that then you would be clear that those City charges are the city doing what are contractually required um to be done by with clean water services or something like that and the federal permit that clean water services has to abide by I think our biggest challenge and educationally it's the amount of people that call this the buttermilk is and our lives by water about 200 miles so your water boat isn't doing it the water bill was 75 dollars right it's a really good point to get that a lot all right we're button up against seven o'clock so Craig and team do you need more and and key some team do you need more feedback from Council what the next step is well I'm not really sure what this meeting am I cut a half and half split so so if you can do it you can do it if you can't you can't and I'm one of those on I can go either way okay I think I think we got it we know we can follow up with Council once it is and then if we collectively can create an incentive for people to pay online and get their bill electronically I think that's a good thing I.E you can create um yes a discount for paying online or something some incentive and if and chronic customers you don't get a choice and I don't know where I'm even nicer not auto pay I don't want to be on auto pay because I don't trust anybody else money on my account I want to go into the websites they pay my bill on the fifth did I do that Northwest if it is",

system this will provide real-time characteristics of Wastewater to detect unusual pollutants discharged into the system and to ensure the most appropriate treatment options are an inventory of trees and parks is planned for fiscal year 2024 to provide information about species condition and health of trees and high-use parks based on health Tree ratings treason Parks could be more closely monitored and managed including those that are in poor condition and those that are susceptible to pests the current tree inventory has over 38 000 asset points primarily collecting Street tree data in the city's rights of way this effort would add more Park Streets to the a number of large maintenance and repair projects at Willow Lake are included in the proposed budget repairing and recoating of concrete tanks and replacement of mechanisms and four clarifiers is anticipated clarifiers help separate and collect sludge and other components that need to be removed from Wastewater two digesters will have repairs performed on the roofs and inside the tanks digesters collect and help break down the sludge which produces methane biogas and Powers the co-generation facility which helps power the plant also included is a paved biosolid storage facility to increased storage capacity for periods during the year when biosolids cannot be applied to fields and with that staff are available for great thank you so I do have to say that counselor Hoy and counselor Gwen and I and my kiddos we all got the chance to go out and take a tour of Willow Lake that place is amazing it is amazing I think the three of us just kind of um you went at a separate time but I was going to go with you but got sick kids and so then we went together and we just kind of stood there and just kind of shook your head it's amazing to see what is there and I say this often as being a city councilor you don't understand what makes the city tick and tell you really get to go on these tours of facilities like this and realize just how much is going on under our feet and close by so it's amazing yes any of you who are interested in touring any of our facilities let us know and we will be happy to accommodate you and do take him up on it it's really quite amazing any questions I know I'm going to have there's a lot of good stuff in this one again I know every time I read it I thought of different counselors who are I know counselor Varney I know some of this stuff is really um important to you and things that you're working on um I am yes remember Cohen thank you chair I have a series of questions so I'll just take it one by one um is the Willow Lake Center is that owned and operated by City of Salem yes so it's owned and operated by City of Salem and I saw on page 83 that um it serves Salem Turner Kaiser and unurbanized areas of East Salem are those uh cities in unurbanized areas of East Salem pain into the operation of Willow Lake through utility fees and is that shown within our our budget that transfer of funds Brian coming up thank you Ryan good evening everyone Brian martinek and Public Works director yes they do pay in they pay rates just like every other user of that facility is it is it reflected in the budget uh it doesn't show them separately they're they're just uh yeah it's all combined into one only three can be on at the same time sure there we go uh first night technical issues um thank you for the answer uh second question I have is on the Salem tree canopy I saw that we have a goal to attain 28 of the canopy by 2030. how are we doing considering the trees that were damaged in February 21 I did see also an update that uh through 2022 we've replanted some a decent amount of trees so just want to see what we're doing status wise with the replanting the trees I think mylan's here in Milan while you're answering this one could you also answer mine which is about the emerald ash borer kind of where are we at on that process as well uh Milan Davis Urban Forester I don't I'm not involved as much with the canopy but I can talk to you about questions related to how many trees we planted from the ice storm we lost about a thousand trees in our city streets from the ice storm and we actually got funding that Council approved last year to hire for limited duration staff and as of six months into the the program we've already sort of achieved most of our goals of replanting trees we've already replanted the trees we lost a thousand trees and ground a thousand stumps and so we'll continue planting more trees as this next year comes along and part of that is establishment period of watering the trees as well so yeah and emerald ash borer just an him or dashboard was detected in Oregon this year coming from Michigan and the start of the 1990s it's a pest that damages ash trees to a 99 mortality rate to affects the vascular system of the trees and basically within two years time the trees will die so we'll we have quite a large population of Native Ash that will be concerned about in Salem about 1500 Street trees will be affected by that so we're creating a management plan currently it's not expected to show up in Salem and for another five years probably but we're working closely with odf and Oda we're meeting with odf like weekly trying to figure out you know sort of a management plan next steps we'll probably do a lot of remove and replace because like like I said a 99 mortality rate when it comes it's going to come and it's going to affect every ash tree and town and if we do want to save ash trees it'll be you know a time period that we can manage through injections of of herbicide that that can retain some of our canopy if we don't want to lose all of our Ash canopy if we have important Ash canopy and some of the some of the streets with larger trees that we want to maintain some of those for a few years we can do that through some easy injections that will save be cheaper than removing the tree so we hope to come forward to to my management team and and then to you guys eventually with with some of those ideas on on how to manage that but good news is a lot of funding recently from the federal government that odf is going to be able to access to help us with a lot of that so we'll let you guys know about that and as far as the canopy goes I don't know if someone from the climate action team can talk to that and just to be clear odf is the Oregon Department of Forestry correct yes thank uh Brian Martin to get what I wanted to point out was we do have a tree planting programs it's in the capital budget so it's not necessarily reflected in this this work area but we'll be getting to that next week and um we have a three hundred thousand dollar investment in planting trees out of the storm water fund so we are planting trees I I don't know that I have the numbers as far as how much we're gaining in canopy each year especially with the trees we plant are smaller and it takes more time for them to grow and actually expand but we could certainly get more information on that for you for the Supply to Josh and provide it next week great thank you did you have any more questions yes I had one more question thank you chair and I'll save my other tree question for next week um I saw in here and I I'm super excited about it and I was hoping to hear some more information on Oregon's first Community micro grid is there a status update on that I think we have some staff here I see Ellen moving Alan good evening Alan Dan and acting city uh the community microgrid project for those who don't know is uh a grant award that we won from the Oregon Department of energy where we're partnered with PGE and it'll fund battery storage at a facility near their substation on Oxford Avenue near 22nd and that storage will power a feeder that goes up 23rd to our new Public Works operations building that work will get started probably later this year excuse me kind of hard to breathe we just got the grand agreement from odoe and uh we'll be bringing it to the city manager for signing and then the work should get going with design and then construction later this year early next year and Allen the odoe sorry Oregon Department of energy great thank you that is a really exciting program uh that we have them that's really great any other questions member Phillips yeah this is a kind of a comment question to highlight and also just to make sure I'm keeping my bearings about me so at the beginning of this uh manager Keith Staley you had a preamble that kind of highlighted some of the big things and one of those is the adoption of an increase to our operational fee and we saw some ft's attached to that are any of those ft's in this part of the budget like is the park rangers under this or is it under a future section Josh could you help with that question they were reviewed in the previous action welcome local community so none of those positions are in this result but they were on the one that we discussed earlier tonight the first one yeah are all of those in that uh four SOS members uh two code enforcement officers and two Park Rangers AA positions were in last the last results area okay so I guess I'm just late but uh I still want to highlight it I think it's really important and exciting that we're adding things like to uh or looking at potentially adding two essential things like Park Rangers uh it's my understanding that prior to this potential expansion we've only we only have one is that accurate that is that's correct and we have 92 Parks 91 yeah 91 in the low 90s yes okay so I think it's it's about time uh to expand that um and I I think on our scoring you know the parks are pretty high up there so uh I'm I'm excited by",

        "text": " want to unmute yourself hi good afternoon um I guess my biggest concern on this is the requirements and the money allocation um $50,000 in my experience is not would not even come close to covering the requirements for this so I'm just really curious how um others or brainstorm on leveraging you know does the technical assistance does that count against the $50,000 is it included in it like what's the Matrix to actually make this work I would imagine the majority of counties don't have a person who does energy resiliency so there's not there's not an entity within my County that's like oh yeah this makes sense I would have no idea how to write scope of work or even um you know start this project and then $50,000 to bring on a consultant to run it for me completely is not even close to that so how do we leverage the funding um Andor all of the things that have to get done when um this is kind of outside of normal scope of work currently yeah that's a that's a great question um there's a lot in there I would say um one option to that I know some counties are exploring to make those funds go a little bit further is the cohort option um and pooling their funds to hire a technical assistance provider um yes a technical assistance provider would be that that would be coming out of that $50,000 is the attention of those funds is to pay for County staff time or technical assistance provider both um and you know we are keeping our eyes and ears is open for potential matching fund opportunities um for the actual planning work that will certainly be something that I will flag and share out if some come through the door that I learn about um and you know in terms of like where to start how to draft that scope of work perhaps that's something where you know you submit your application I connect you to the staff at Energy Trust and they might be able to talk you through a little bit more of what that looks like I understand there you know it's can be a big learning curve and um I think it is you know is a technical field um so we would just do our best to support you in getting those questions answered and helping you feel comfortable to move forward with that planning work I think that's part of the issue though is uh I'm going to be requesting information requesting money to do a plan that I don't even know if I can do right so you and I so I think that's part of the concern is not um in order to take this to my board for money and Contracting you know I'm telling them that I can implement this plan and then that I would have any general fund or out of my budget to be able to support whatever components to meet the requirements and I can't say that right now I couldn't go and apply for the funding um to verify to them that with the $50,000 and even any of my time that I was uh not going to charge against the grant just to manage it I right now cannot meet the requirements of that plan with the and be able to say that confidently to accept the money to then start drawing down on technical assistance um and then go that far and then find out well actually we don't have the ability the time um I think Greg put in about trying to finish before August because even if I started now I only a few months before Fire season again for us down here so I just have concerns about like I don't want to waste opportunity for quote unquote free money because I think these are plans needed for sure but you're gonna it's just nearly impossible I feel with maybe exception of a few counties uh so I have I just have a lot of concern on that front um and while the cohart idea sounds great we're also now going to ask a lead County to take on a fiscal responsibility for other counties to M to be able to implement that plan and adopt it and now I'm held on like I'm going to be held responsible quote unquote as the Contracting entity to take those monies and make sure that the plan is implemented in the other cohort counties um so that's another difficulty another difficult component um when you're talking about funds has there been any applications submitted by counties at this point no not yet but we do know that there is interest and you know several counties particularly in cohorts have expressed interest in moving forward um you know we have a long application window so I don't think it creates a ton of pressure to get it in the door immediately which is okay however you know the sooner applications come in the longer that planning window is I hear your concerns I think they are valid um you know it's valid to be concerned about making sure that you can deliver on what you're moving ahead on I get that um and you know we are working with what we are given and doing our best we will have an opportunity to provide feedback to the legislature make suggestions for the future I really hope that as many counties as possible can take advantage of this opportunity and there is an opportunity for us to provide feedback on this important planning and make potentially some changes for the future um in terms of Greg's flag in the comments about August 2025 um you know there is some flexibility in in the deadline as I mentioned there is a potential to extend until December 31st 2025 even at that point we have created what we call the good faith clause which is if you reach December 31st 2025 and your plan is not complete if you can demonstrate that put in good faith effort to complete the plan in the time provided meet those requirements and you just you know for various reasons haven't been able to if we're are not going to revoke the funds we'll say please continue forward continue with your planning um so Our intention really is to be a good partner to counties we understand constraints we just really want to get some great planning done um on the work and as you said Hol is really important so um we have a a few hands raised and then also a question the chat so um I think that um we're going to go in order so Sylvia and then um Greg and then melind syvia do you want to come off mute sure thank you um I have two very short questions so I hope you'll forgive me for having to but um my first question is is it the August dece are these August and December deadlines statatory or do you have flexibility on that because you know I I I hear I don't remember um back there's a couple commenters who have expressed concerns with being able to pull that in a year even a year and a half might be tight and so to the extent that you have flexibility and again I don't know if this is in statue that it needs to be by August or December or if if this is a programmatic decision so that's my first question and the second is uh the statue calls on the utilities to cooperate with us on uh information um in your conversations with the utilities have they identified wanting to go to like what one point of contact for requests related to this program or um do we just go through our usual channels um that we have as as local governs thank you great questions I'm going to answer your first question I'm also going to look to Max um for his response as well so it's a little bit of both this program sunsets in statute um January 2nd 2026 so it is a limited duration program within that there are some programmatic choices around the spec specificity of those deadlines but that is why we have have that extension because we also have concerns about the timeline being a barrier and it's a you know a program rolled out for the twoe bium so a little bit of both um as I said we have that good faith Clause we really are trying to be cognizant of the fact that there is some pressure around that timeline and you know we have um our due diligence to the legislature and to the statute and uh to the program that we need to do on our end as well um and then in terms of the utilities we um have done some Outreach to our um consumer owned utilities through utility organizations but not directly to each utility trying to lift some of the burden um in terms of Outreach on their end so I would suggest that you go directly to your point of contact however if you have questions um you can direct them to me I can also connect you with staff at Energy Trust potentially to think about who the best contact might be if you don't if you have concerns about going to your normal contact or wondering if there might be someone that's a better fit so happy to talk through that oneon-one as well and Max sorry I didn't leave for you no no that's okay that's all good um I agree with I agree with what you said Hannah um I would use your regular contacts with your utility companies um which is probably more straightforward for electric or natural gas for fuels uh you may have to talk if you don't already know you may have to go talk to to um I don't know maybe your Public Works departments or whoever is the buyer of fuels for your fleet vehicles or something like that um that might be able to connect you with your fuel provider and you know for the bigger counties it might be multiple companies that provide fuel um so that's not that might just be something to navigate through if you do run into to just second what Hannah said if there are if you really aren't sure who to contact uh let us know and we'll see what we can do um Odo has relationships with just about every Energy company in the state and can probably help make some connections um okay thank you uh Greg go please feel free to unmute and then I'm also recognizing we have eight minutes left and there is a um two questions now um in the chat um great uh so I just I I fully get where this this whole program is coming from and where it's what what the intent is I'm just wondering um you know for for example I'm in Maran County and it we are just getting a Contractor on board from our 2023 uh June 2023 grant funding Point um because it does take that long it took that long for us to go out for to find a contractor to get it all approved to get it through our process to get approval to even apply",

        "text": " all right thank you one one other thing this is ken it might be that some of the response from what do i want to say here the the the applicant i guess will do maybe not wanting to annex to the district is because we're talking what 4 000 some acres but and that would that could be a big price tag to annex uh to the fire district possibly i don't whereas the structural fire protection would be just a portion a small portion of that area a contract for services with that fire district might be a lot or something that they could uh as opposed to annexing the entire boundary of the yeah so what you're recommending is um that that would be an ore or or a contract for structural protection yeah i i think that's i think that gets at you know what my concern was is structural protection going to rely on sarah to help me with these notes to address what i think um i think we want to be able to move forward and i think that maybe we'll con this and council will proceed maybe through jesse's presentation and then maybe we can bring this back up which means we would i'm i'm a little bit unsure let's just let's just continue forward maybe sarah can look at this or maybe we just uh take a break before i move on to the next what do we hey kellen why don't we move forward because i think you can kind of conclude the rest of it relatively quickly and then when we get to essentially the you know straw poll on the material change we can defer that either you know before jesse starts if there's enough information because we're going to need to take a break here pretty soon or if we need to we can go through jesse's presentation and before the material change hearing we can move back to this okay um thank you this is good good feedback um under the council's waste minimization standard the council must find that the applicant would minimize the generation of solid waste wastewater um and that managed would be our waste would be managed in which the department recommends waste minimization condition one which has measures for recycling reusing um segregating materials from hazardous or non-hazardous um and collection of uh of waste any comments on the waste minimization uh there's the signing standards for transmission lines um this has a nexus a mandatory condition um listed or imposed underneath the general standard of review that requires the applicant to develop and implement a program that provides assurance that you know fences cattle guards trailers anything that could be inadvertently charged would be grounded um but to further reduce the risk of induced current nuisance shocks the department recommends recommended sighting standards for transmission line which requires um property owners uh within a half mile i believe 500 feet um of the transmission line to be provided a map of potential um safety issues with induced currents this is the only standard that is uh or condition that's recommended under the standard any questions under uh other applicable regulatory requirements which has this nexus with the general standard of review which requires the preponderance preponderance of evidence on the record supports that the applicant to demonstrate that they can meet the council standards but also other applicable laws um that apply to the app the that would apply to the site certificate underneath this and council's familiar that council reviews and offers decisions on the interpretation and compliance with the oregon department of environmental qualities noise rules for industry and the deq does not administer or fund um in any involvement or um implementation of its noise rules however they still are rules that are on the books that apply to council's facilities so noise generated by a new industrial or commercial source located on a previously unused site which is the applicants considering this to be a previously unused commercial or previously unused site so it's a new industrial commercial source they must comply with two deq noise standards and one is the maximum allowable noise standard and then the other is the ambient noise degradation both of these standards represent allowable noise levels at real properties normally used for sleeping and we refer to those as noise sensitive the deq noise rules list exemptions one of these exemptions specifically exempts noise caused by construction activities construction noise um is not um you know or it's basically exempt from that maximum allowable and from the ambient degradation standard so those standards don't apply to construction noise um and of note there is often noise that's associated with construction one of the noises that would be most apparent from construction is that they propose that they're going to use a pneumatic pile um to kind of pound in the solar posts and so this kind of could be a loud repetitive sound associated with construction so but the evaluation provided here underneath the the noise rules and the construction related noise evaluation in the proposed order is also relied upon under the um recreational resources standard and protected areas where construction noise associated with the construction and operation of the facility is also included in that so based on the applicant rep applicant representations the department recommends uh council impose recommended noise condition one which would reduce the potential impacts associated with noise construction and this provides a noise complaint response system um which includes notification to nearby residents of certain construction locating noise generating equipment away from residences and the time restrictions for the use of that pneumatic pile the ambient noise degradation standard uh associated with operational noise requires a demonstration that noise generated during operation must not cause the ambient hourly l10 and l50 noise levels at any noise sensitive property to exceed 10 dba above the ambient noise levels and this is the ambient is based on measurements from a particular location on um property to establish kind of a baseline or the ambient uh noise so the applicant identified 17 noise sensitive properties uh by using aerial photographs and on-site inspections to determine what is a residential structure um so that it's not like a uh gear shed or something would not be considered a um noise sensitive property because it would not be normally used for sleeping normally um noise generating equipment equipment that the applicant included in its noise assessment um includes the solar array inverters and transformers the substation and the battery system inverters and cooling systems so this is all the noise generating equipment i have a figure here that kind of has this sound sound levels radiating out here this is so um this here has like the most noise would be generated from the substations and then noise as it attenuates or moves outward reduces so based upon the applicant's noise analysis and noise contour maps the maximum increases in ambient noise from the proposed facility operation would not exceed 9 dba so therefore the ambient noise degradation standard would not be exceeded which is basically over 10 so um and so would not be exceeded at any noise sensitive property during maximum operation and rainy conditions so they would not exceed this standard so yes additionally the applicant's noise modeling results show that noise generated during operation would not exceed the maximum allowable standard of 50 dba at any noise sensitive property because the maximum statistical noise levels were modeled at 34 dba which is less than 50. so the maximum allowable standard would not be exceeded uh to afford the department the ability to verify compliance with the deq noise rules um because we because under the ambient um it was at a at a nine um a dba increase of of nine um the department um recommends noise condition two which required the submission of a summary noise report which would basically present the sound power levels of the equipment that they actually uh select based on final design um that is what i have to say about the det noise rules and are there any other um applicable regulatory requirements for this facility are um the oregon removal fill law um which is administered by the oregon department of state lance or dsl um the proposed facility describes that there's 35 non-wetland playas which are kind of these seasonally flooded lake that are within the site boundary there's no wetlands um or other waters of the state but playas are considered waters of the state and subject to regulation by dsl so the evaluation is whether or not a removal fill would be required the applicant represents that only the social solar module rack support posts would be installed in these playa areas and that the estimated removal fill impact would be 14 cubic yards which is less than 50 yards and so um the there would not be a removable fill permit um governed by the council at this time and that's what i have for removal fill under the general standard of review as we've made note the council has to find that there's compliance with other statutes and administrative rules which would also include the oregon water resource department um rules that uh that administer and cover water rights and water permits or water right transfers and if there was a water permit a water transfer or a surface water permit that permit would be included in the council's jurisdiction and governed by the site certificate so the department recommends counsel wait oh this is my okay i do have this okay sorry um there's two conditions that the department underneath this other applicable regulatory requirements water rights and water use are related to contested case issue nine so jessie is going to kind of dive into those more i do provide a table here that is pro that is provided in um the water rights section which designates the annual water usage for the facility now they did represent kind of going back to that public services that it would take um up to two years to construct the facility and under worst case um this is a worst case scenario um for those two years for construction it would be about 34 gallons of water over that period of time the applicant states that it would purchase water from the christmas valley domestic water supply district water existing water rights from that district and the applicant provided permit in the application and then the department coordinated with water resource department to confirm those and other permit numbers um that that the water district could provide the water under um the applicant also says that it could possibly get water from um the the city of la pine um and then that was is limited to that representation so this corresponds back to public services and there is a letter from the water district saying that under um you know average circumstances that they would be able to provide the water however the applicant may need to have a water service provider the applicant is representing that it would also like uh it would also construct on up to two on-site wells um that would uh help provide water for the construction and operation of the um the let's uh a water resource department",

of Salem I'd like to enter the staff report as attachments in all public testimony into the record uh since this has had sort of a complicated logistical background I'm going to kind of walk you through having back here so the applicant originally submitted their proposal to install two security gates and replace the front entry child back in April the application was due completely at the end of May uh and that notice the public hearing was sent by the mail at this time but on June 5th the applicants submitted a request to increase the scope of work to add consideration of their to add new signage to their proposal and further requested that the hearing be opened on June 15th and can be continued to July 20th which it was uh then the hlc canceled their July meeting and a notice was sent um notifying folks that the curators continue to this evening uh and the the notice was sent out and signs were stood on the study so I also just want to State for the record that the applicant extended the state mandated 120 day deadline which originally was September 21st out to November 20th so that we would have adequate time to go through all our processes so the property hopefully most of you are familiar with it it's uh downtown in our downtown historic district located at 456 and 466 Court Street Northeast it's contributing to the downtown historic district here's a picture of the primary facade and most recently I think they came before you it was the kitchen closed unfortunately um so a little bit about the history so it is an Annex to the odd photos Hall so that building was designed and constructed in 1900 by Architects from Turkey in Portland and John Gray of and it was originally known as the mother lodge number one of the independent order of odd fellows in the Pacific Northwest that held the Grand Theater in the main Odd Fellows fall and according to nomination documents the portion of the building that we're considering tonight a one-story brick Edition when flat roof who's known as the annex was built in the fall of 1900. initially there was only one entrance on the northwest side of this building and in 1922 an addition was added and in 1936 both editions were refilled at which time two engine sort of created in the trains and windows and canopies were also added in 1961 the storefronts were all replaced and reconfigured and this is approximately when the the tile entry was added portion of what you're going to need so now I'm going to go through the proposal we'll talk about the signage first so the applicant is requesting approval for one under earnings sign which is metal round and approximately 28.8 inches by 29 inches and the sign is attached with the existing brackets under the awning at the front entry and the second sign is a wall signed so in the same location if you remember the previous time with the kitchen report above the awning against the wall uh the base on that North facade were traditionally there's been signage for the instruction attached flush to the wall with horse 3 8 inch three and a half inch light bulbs and neither of the signs will have any kind of Illumination for lighting so then this second portion of the proposal two metal security AIDS made by Dynamic enclosures are proposed each measuring about 12 and a half feet in height and 25 feet across and will be located across each storefront entry when they're fully extended pH is proposed to be attached to motorized telescoping tubes within the steel mounted casing which will be secured to a beam with bolts on the ceiling of each storefront entryway the metal bar will be installed at the base below and at the at the front of the recessed entry where the gate will be secured and then the last portion of the proposal is the ceramic tile so as you can see from these photos the tile is showing where it's in poor condition and the applicants proposing to replace it with a new clay stone tile with a glaze to non-slip cooking and it's proposing to match the existing triangular inlay design that proposed Styles will be approximately one inch by too much of the center and the inlay around the perimeter will be the larger tile to match the existing sign about two inches by two inches so I'm going to go through the applicable criteria so first we'll find the criteria in 2304od storefronts and uh one thing at a time so the materials as I mentioned the tile entry will be replaced within kind material and the material for the security gates uh is metal which is a compatible material for this resource and the strategy and historic district and the design itself the 1961 entry Tile Design would be retained and and the security gate design is compatible with the resource and the downtown security the downtown historic district so I I am recommending the landmarks commission adopt a condition for the installation of the gate on it to ensure that the actual the installation of the bar doesn't adversely affect the tile entry design there is a gap between the Inland tile at the entryways and the larger square tiles that actually were installed by Urban Development that go into the right-of-way so there's a good location for this bar to be placed so it doesn't obscure the replace tile entering and the condition reads as follows the applicant shall not install the middle of security gate Base Bar on top of the inlet late style at the store from so then the the second applicable criteria are in src-230.056 signs and Commercial and I'll take it one thing at a time again materials and design so the proposed materials for both signs is metal which is a compatible material for Science and in our downtown historic and then the proposed design as I mentioned it's going to be attached under the awning on existing brackets for the underlying sign and the the sign the law sign will be attached flush to the front to the side and no character defining features with Spirit or damaged and there's no illumination proposed so there's been no public comment there's been an email and support from Michael Livingston from the candy neighborhood association uh both the fire department and building and safety division stated at the time of permits to Middle verification will be required for the occupancy type they stated that security gains are allowed for the vfm and S occupancies but not allowed for a and the planning division has moved concerns however the applicant must obtain a prior and sign permit spending Public Works has no concerns within the So based upon the findings in the staff reports staff recommends that the landmarks commission approves a proposal with the following condition one the application modern solve the middle security base bar on top of the Inland final episode entryways thank you Kimberly do any Commissioners have questions for staff that's a quick question um do you attached an illustration or actually kind of a photo first metal security is that so but they're the drawings they actually included were sort of an open slab you know what they're actually and then also like speaking of that you had mentioned it with some sort of a I'm not aware so that the spec sheet for the actual date it should have put them in the application materials that you sent and so that's where the description how it it works in terms of the photo of the example so the so the drawing right um that you have in there with the arrows on it right that's from the spec sheet the photo is from one actively that they have installed at another well I guess so this looks like a standard kind of boiling security grill right which would just be really you know wide open I mean that the photo is it's kind of super attractive at all so I just wanted to see if that was something that you had recommended that they use that or if they're just good to have kind of a standard security so this this was done by Sierra who's not able to be here um and when I asked her I just simply asked for an example of one um this type of product that's been installed that they're planning to use in this location and that's what she said okay because the drawing makes it kind of difficult yes um and I'm not meaning just a second guesses because you know more about this than I do but I'm just wondering if it's really necessary to make a requirement on where the bar sits um I'm just thinking that they'll you know where it lands on the on the pavement or the you know on the ground whatever you call it right there is going to be mostly dependent on Words and I just I guess I question giving them any more constraints but it's already going to be pretty tricky to get that fit on Space you know space yeah certainly it's up to the landmarks twitching about whether you adopt that condition the reason behind it just so you understand this in order to better meet the applicable right criteria relating to ensuring that any additions or alterations don't obscure character",

        "text": " of these standards are met and there's a little back and forth that goes between us and the applicant to get it to what we call once we have a complete application we issue another notice we post it on the website and again there's a public comment period on the formal application we will then review all that information and prepare what is called a draft proposed order and that is a fairly technical document that summarizes each of those 16 standards I mentioned and our evaluation of that and we give recommendations to our Council of whether or not we think that there are either conditions that need to be prescriptive kind of conditions to meet the standard or if the standard has been done but there are recommendations and we take that to our Council the council reviews it we have a public hearing and when we have the public hearing we'll be back down here to have it and we take all of that comment from our Council from the public from the reviewing agencies and we have to basically issue a revised document which is a proposed order and then that proposed order and you know that intent is that it combines all of this information makes a final kind of recommendation to our Council and then it goes back to our Council to consider at the time that we issue the draft propose order we or the proposed order we also issue a notice of contestant case and that means if if party wants to contest the correct the findings of that proposed order they can request a contested case there is no contesting case we will issue a we will take that proposed order to our Council and recommend that they consider it and adopt it as a final order the council has not made a decision until the final that they make a decision on the final order so a lot of the work that the citing division does is to go through all of that information file it make those recommendations answer those questions that come back work through the contested case process if we have one and then Council will ultimately make the decision and just you know up or down of whether or not to Grant a site certificate for a facility in the state of Oregon so a notice of intent is valid for two years so the applicant has two years to decide whether they're actually going to proceed and submit an application sometimes they do sometimes later so it at this phase that's what I would say to be determined and it's not our decision that they're going to submit an application it is um the project proponents decision whether or not to move forward from notice of intent to application and at this point I am going to stop talking I'm going to turn it over to Sarah asterson who's going to speak more to process a little more about what we do and how we do it and then I'll come back and open up the Q a at a certain way but thank you good evening again my name is Sarah esterson I'm the senior policy advisor with the citing Division and we're very happy to be here as Kate said thank you very much for taking the time to come and join us tonight um on this slide is the seven that's process step uh citing process for an energy facility to seek review and approval or denial of a site certificate and I just wanted to highlight that you know notwithstanding the two-year time frame that an applicant has after they submit a notice of attempt to actually decide if they're going to submit an um generally the process could be three to five years to go through the whole thing before you actually have a permit and then it could be two to three years before it goes into construction so this is a long detailed review that we're going through here um so I'm just going to cover a couple of topics if you would go to the next slide please um your bar permitting process requires the department to see comments and Technical input from State local and tribal governments and these entities these agencies have a specific term in our process Kate just referred to it it's called a reviewing agency some examples of reviewing agencies that are applied to the proposed loan Pine to Whetstone transmission line include habitat biologists from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife specifically their local Rogue Watershed jurisdictional coordinators from the Oregon Department of State lands staff from the Oregon Department of Agriculture specifically the native plant conservation program and the land use and water planning coordinator so those are all examples of state agencies were required to coordinate with tribal governments include contacts from tribal councils and cultural and resource departments so for this proposed project the tribal tribal governments include Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Indians the confederated tribes of selects and the confederated tribes of Grand Ronde um so during the notice of intent phase which as Kate mentioned that's the phase that we're in for this project that's why we're here today we prepare a contact list of state local and tribal government agencies and then we prepare formal letters and we send them and we say help us understand what are the applicable regulatory requirements help us understand the resources that you're aware of identify permits statutes rules ordinances anything you think that applies that you have expertise or jurisdiction of please help us and identify those things so that we can incorporate that into the review specifically a document called the project order and then that sets the stage for the next step there are several more Milestones that we showed on the prior slide that require that department staff seek review and input from these reviewing agencies this is the first step so we also have a unique um term in our process called a special Advisory Group and that applies to the local governing body within which the project is proposed to be located those entities they're called special advisory groups and this applies uh this is a designation that our Council applies and appoints to these um these entities and then it applies for the life of the facility and future changes so the role of a special Advisory Group is unique we ask them to identify the applicable land use permitting requirements for the proposed facility so an applicable permitting requirement is based on the use the proposed use of the energy facility and the zone and then the requirements that apply to that proposed use in the proposed Zone and then those are the requirements that are established in a local government local zoning and comprehensive planning so for this project the special Advisory Group we call it a sag but I'll try not to use acronyms at this stage are the City of Medford city council and the Jackson County Board of Commissioners those have both been identified and appointed by the energy facility setting as Kate mentioned the notice of intent for this project was received on April 27th the notice of intent is a physical document it includes data and maps that are based on rule requirements and we do have it available on the website and a copy here if you'd like to look at that but so we sent formal letters to the reviewing agencies and to the special advisory groups asking for input on those the notice of intent materials that we will then be able to consider in the future future phases so right now we're kind of in the middle of the review and comment period We are continuing our Outreach efforts with all of the reviewing agencies and the two special advisory groups um and we want to make sure that these entities understand what we're asking of them and that they understand the project and of their opportunities uh just so you know our process does allow for reimbursement for these other um just want to make sure everybody knows we offer support and and the complicated requests that we ask of these entities financial support next slide please so the next topic we'll cover is um the topic of study areas so in a notice of intent an applicant is required to identify resources within a specific distance from the boundary of their proposed facility these are called study areas I wanted to note another important term in our process it's a site boundary I'm sure you've heard it here tonight and on the maps the term site boundary it's in our rules it refers to the boundary of the proposed facility any supporting facilities and temporary lay down areas and that will be used throughout the process the site boundary of the proposed facility so the study areas that start in the notice of intent extend from the site boundary the study areas are established at a default distance and we've shown here on this Bullseye so for different um the study areas differ I wanted to know that the site boundary for this project is defined as a 500 foot wide Corridor that extends the length of the two routing options so 10 and 12 miles in length sometimes we have 40 000 Acre Site boundary systems a little different for a transmission line um so then back to the study areas uh what we're looking for in these study areas and the notice of intent is to make sure that all potential environmental resources within a certain distance that could be impacted by the design construction or operation of the facility are identified if there are resources outside of these default study areas that's what we're trying to figure out now that could be impacted then we want to know about them and we would expand that study area to capture an adequate impact area similarly the study area could be much smaller an example for protected areas which is a term in our process um if if there are no protected areas that could possibly be impacted by construction or operation of the facility Beyond two miles we could reduce that study area so I wanted to give you just a couple examples this shows that the study area for the land use evaluation for the Wildfire evaluation and for fish and wildlife habitat impacts extends from the site boundary out to a half a mile so this means that the applicant and the notice of intent needs to evaluate fish and wildlife habitat and species out to a half mile from that site boundary similarly for Wildfire risk they need to evaluate vegetation and risk out to a half mile and so forth so this is It's something we think is quite important for the notice of intent and it's a part of our Outreach with the reviewing agencies and the special advisory groups as they have the local knowledge of the resources so we're working very closely to see are these study areas adequate to capture the impacts very importantly are Jackson County and City of Medford where we're really wanting to make sure that the land use and public services evaluation and the study areas is adequate for members of the public are welcomed weigh in and comment on resources in the same way that we ask reviewing agencies and special advisory groups any resources that you're aware of that you feel should be protected or that you have knowledge of you are welcome to",

here in the room for coming to our meeting my name is Kathleen Sloan I'm a senior sighting analyst with the Department of energy the Oran Department of energy the first thing I wanted to do was just go over a couple of overview slides but first I wanted to do introduction so I'm Kathleen floan sighting analyst to my right is Todd Cornett he is the secretary for the energy facility sighting Council he's also the sighting manager and Nancy hatch is our Administrative Assistant who is our technical Wiz for all things setting this up for our meeting so thank you I have omit is in the back she is one of our new members of staff and she is a um analyst as well and then we have one council member from the energy facility sighting Council that decided to attend this meeting in person and I'm going to introduce her and that is an buer council member Ann berer so thank you Ann for being here and that is it for the Department of energy side I'm going to turn it over over to the applicant team to introduce themselves I'm Matt Hazard with IPA power I'm the project manager for summmer hi folks uh Sam Littlefield I'm Executive Vice President of development for ipop power I oversee our project development uh Pipeline and um Matt is uh on on my team um we ultimately have 28 uh project developers land agents uh and government Regulatory Affairs Personnel that that uh help us see through um these complex but ultimately uh important projects so thank you very much for being oh hello my name is aab j and you can call me AJ uh I work with tetratech environmental Consulting and I'm the project manager on this you know the environmental Consulting uh side that helps write the application and hi there my name is John vandery I represent IPA with kind of Permitting management environmental Affairs um some of the study work that goes into the application for site certificate um and just helping to manage kind of the complex permiting process okay thank you can you go to the next slide Nancy so we did our introductions I'm going to do a little bit of a overview of the meeting itself and the flow of the meeting I will also present on the sighting process for the state the department of energy sighting process and then I will turn it over to the applicant who will present on their proposed project which is the Summit Ridge renewable energy facility so this is a notice of intent that they've submitted with the Department It's Beginning a whole process to obtain apply for a site certificate and then we try to keep that relatively brief my presentation and their presentation so that we can get to the public comment period in the meeting which is the purpose of us having this meeting is to provide information and allow the public opportunity to ask questions make comments and I'll talk more about the comment period in a minute and next slide and I guess I would just say we ask that we hold your comments and questions until we get to the comment period okay so this is an meeting it is for the purpose of informing the public about this notice of intent to apply for a site certificate for this new proposed facility we call it an noi for short so if I switch to acronyms that's what I'm talking about I'll try not to do that um it's important because the of the site that it be clear that this is not a contested case hearing the participation in this meeting is not required to preserve issues in a contested case that comes later on in the application process and like I said we're asking that you hold questions and comments till we open up the comment period at the meet at the end of the presentation and we just ask that people be respectful um everybody's trying to do their jobs and we just ask that people not be disruptive or rude in our meeting okay next slide so just wanted to clarify what this meaning is for and what this meaning is not this is the public information meeting on the notice of intent to apply for a site certificate for a facility called The Summit Ridge renewable energy facility it is not about the Summit Ridge Wind Farm project um and the notice of intent is really the first step in the FC review fr process and I'll say fsec that is an acronym for the energy facility sighting Council they're The Entity that has to review and approve a site certificate from the state for an energy facility that falls under their jurisdiction and the applicant team it is the team is with Summit Ridge wind LLC and AA power so just a really quick overview about the Summit Ridge Wind Farm which many of you are familiar with um the certificate holder did submit an application to terminate that site certificate on March 88th an public notice on that request or the application to terminate was issued on the 13th of March that public comment period closed on April 1st so it is closed and it will go to council for a possible decision at the April FC meeting to be held on April 19th and I believe that's in Salem it's in Salem so you can participate remotely if you don't want to drive to Salem if you're interested okay next slide is there something I missed oh okay all right so back to us and why we're here um a little bit about the energy facility sighting program so we oversee the re the review decision-making compliance for large scale energy facilities and infrastructure in Oregon the energy facility sighting council is the body that actually makes the decision on an application it is a seven member board Council they're appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Oregon State Senate um and they serve terms the Oregon Department of energy staff staff who we are we work in support of the fsec and we help do the technical and environmental review and document prop that goes into all of these applications all the review process that we have to go through in order to make sure that our standards are met so basically in concept we are the a Consolidated review process so it consolidates Local Government Review State other state agencies within the state that might have a a role in a in a resource and the purpose of that is to eliminate duplication speed things up make it a little more streamlined for both review decisions if it goes through judicial review We review the compliance aspects any applicable Council standard applicable laws and rules that we have to consider um our process also has built into it a public participation process it's very important to our Council and our process that the public be allowed to participate and pro be provided information and opportunities to provide comments and it happens at several stages in our process and I'll go over that in a little bit and then we also coordinate what we call reviewing agencies which are those other entities within the state or maybe a local government we have special advisory groups which are the local counties that may have County jurisdiction in the area and we also consult with tribing tribal governments coordinate with them on comments that they might have on our review next slide okay so what is an FC facility um there's several definitions the one that this facility this proposed facility really meets is that it is an electrical power generating plant with an capacity of more than 50 megawatt of power proposed for a Wind Facility the applicant is proposing an estimated Peak generating capacity of 201 megaw or an average generating capacity of 67 megawatt from the facility from wind and therefore it is an fect jurisdictional facility under this order statute 469 300 subpart 11 subpart A subpart J all right so when a proposed facility meets that definition as an FC jurisdictional uh energy facility the applicant must obtain a site certificate from the energy facility sighting Council um before it can construct or operate that facility and to obtain that site certificate the applicant must demonstrate that the proposed facility meets the standards we standards based process and I'll have a slide on that in a minute um set by Council in chapter 345 of the oars the Oregon administrative rules and other applicable Oregon statutes and land land use planning goals and as I said because we as staff serve uh as supportive Council we will conduct a lot of the technical review of the information that's submitted by the applicant um as part of their preliminary application at this point like I said we're at a notice of intent stage so we step one they've submitted a notice of their intent to apply for a site certificate so we're really at that first step next slide so this is my favorite slide because we can show kind of at a glance um the whole process in one slide so the red box is where we are as I stated we're at the notice of intent stage there are seven major steps in this process that goes all the way to a final order and a site certificate at the end there's a couple of things I want to cover on here the notice of intent submitted by the applicant the Department issues a public notice and it opens up that comment period the public comment period is is open and it closes on May 3rd um and then we hold an information meeting and the whole purpose of that is in all of these green boxes is that there's opportunities for participation and then we are also coordinating at this point with those uh reviewing agencies that I talked about about the proposed facility about the notice of intent and all of that information will get summarized in what Odo prepares which is the next step which is the project order and the project order is something I will prepare as the signing analyst and gets reviewed and approved through our department and we prepared that project order for the purposes of giving it back to the applicant and that project order will contain really specific information about what needs to be included in their preliminary application so the applicant will be working on the materials for preliminary application and they will submit a preliminary application should they choose to um based upon what they're required to submit and it will be in the project order and that project order is underway and it will be issued in the middle of June is the deadline to to issue that to the applicant and then it come starts the application process so the first step is a preliminary application the applicant submits to the perment a preliminary application with all of the required exhibits that cover all of the 16 standards that we have and",

in now clerk must could you do us the honors yes Dr Harrington uh the Washington County Board of Commissioners is now meeting this regular session as the Washington County Housing Authority board of directors director Sava here director Roper here director trees here director Willie here director Rogers here director Harrington here well good morning everyone thank you for your for your patience as our work session ran over and we were all just collecting ourselves as we're feeling a little underwater so to speak to use commissioner Teresa's analogy uh of moments ago because we are in the midst of budget season for our agencies so my head is still swirling in in all of that data so welcome here we are the Housing Authority board of directors uh uh director Roper is attending uh virtually with us today thank you and director savara is here in the room with us uh oh yes and director Phi is excused today uh the next item on our agenda is Public Communication this is an opportunity for members of our community to come and speak to us for up to two minutes clerk moss do we have anyone who wishes to come and address the Housing Authority board of directors thank you director Harrington I did not see anyone in the room sign up would any member like to provide comment to house Authority on any housing related topic for up to two minutes we'll look for a raised hand or standing up not see anyone there would anyone viewing this meeting online via Zoom wish to provide public comment to the Housing Authority for up to two all right we have one hand i'm chair uh jinda can you hear us all right please go ahead for up to two thank you um dear directors my name is and I'm a coordinator for the United Oregon leadership development programs I am also a resident of Washington County and a housing advocate unite Oregon is an organization that advocates for justice for black indigenous people of color immigrants and refugees rural communities and people experiencing poverty in Oregon I would like to share my thoughts on some of the housing initiatives that you are working on we are aware that there is a critical need for Equitable and affordable housing in the county with at least 10 000 more homes needed for those with modest incomes firstly I would like to provide some feedback on the progress made under the Metro affordable housing Bond program which I had the opportunity to tour recently I'm delighted to learn that the general contractor for the two South Cooper Mountain projects is locally owned and it was inspired by the dedication and commitment of locally based developers reach and also resident services provided provider Venice star this supported residents throughout the county during the pandemic preventing evictions and partnering with the county on public health efforts related to As you move forward with the remaining Bond projects I urged you to ensure that all developers and their Partners share the same level of commitment and in order to increase equity and opportunity in the county we along with other organizations working in Washington County would like to collaborate with you to ensure that the design leads up and operations of all new homes are Equitable we recognize that many of the organizational Partnerships approve our new and will require time attention to develop we appreciate the work you're doing to build capacity among Service Partners and to improve Workforce pay Equity I have more but I see the times is up so I will send my note to um Kevin Moss if that's okay yes that is great thank you very much would any other members viewing this medium Museum like to provide comment for up to two minutes give you just one more moment to utilize Ray's hand not seen any additional Hands director thank you clerk Moss moving on the next item is our consent agenda today's consent agenda consists of four items two sets of minutes and two different contracts what are the wishes of the board a motion to approve a second we have a motion and a second to adopt today's consent agenda all those in favor please vote by raising your hand or saying I thank you directors any opposed the motion carries to four six six to zero thank you I wanted to make sure I double checked my numbers next we have one action item and this is to consider adoption of a resolution in order to amend the rules of procedure for the Housing Authority board of directors uh first uh we have a brief staff report from our very able staff welcome director colavar good good morning Jay Harrington good morning Housing Authority board of directors I'm joined with by Andrew good morning chair Harrington and board of directors for the record my name is Andrew Crampton development manager at the housing authority of Washington County we have a short presentation on the Housing Authority rules of Presidio prepared by legal counsel but we'll go through the presentation and then legal with chime in so uh Comey give us what we don't have that presentation so through here okay quickly for context this is a rule of procedure that has come up in response to the wood Springs Apartment acquisition in particular the acquisition of of tax-exempt bonds The Authority is uh engaged in bond Council which reviewed the the rules of procedure in particular it's related to the suspension the ability to reconsider a previously adopted amendment that can provide complexities for Bond capital and bond issuance as folks know the woodspring acquisition will be funded in part by issuance of a tax exempt Revenue bond which essentially exempts taxes on uninterest payments for the Project's permanent debt allowing for higher debt on a project because of that reduced tax section 9 of the Housing Authority bylaws that you have in your packet provides for a reconsideration process for after resolution would be adopted which would really limit the ability to be able to close on on bond financing as those rates are are locked in a reconsideration process would put those those locked in rates in in question um so the The Proposal is absent a motion to consider is really previously that they'd be able to take effect 10 days after adoption and then a limit the ability so it you have in your packet the section 9 proposal that was reviewed by both Bond Council and county legal counsel to strike uh subsection uh D and then a portion of of subsection e as well that that motion for adoption would would become final without reconsideration um so the the next steps in the process would be to really approve the the bylaw Amendment changed as proposed and then move forward with with the project um on loan documents both with ohcs for um acquisition or the preservation loan to the preservation pool but then also in relevant to this context with Banner Bank on low loan documents for the tax-exempt revenue Bond um and then final loan documents will be prepared and reviewed as part of project closing and that would include an authorizing resolution for the housing authority to issue tax-exempt bonds that are that are backed by uh expected project revenue and then backed by a deed of trust on the property itself and then again property acquisition is scheduled to close between mid-june and mid-july really depended on timing on loan documents being prevailed prepared and reviewed by by the state State and by doj and then adopted by your your board upon acceptance and that concludes my presentation Okay so yes yes I do want to um to turn it over to the full board for questions I just want to also add that well actually Mr Carr with what you shared at our work session could you share that with this full board it's in one part of the financing is tax-free bonds those bonds will be issued at closing uh if the the board will of course approve issues of the bond prior to closing under the current rules that any decision by the board could be reconsidered at the next meeting of the board since this board only meets once a month that would be mean that if you approved it on in June it could be reconsidered in July which would make Pro closing problematic it would raise questions about the authority to issue the bonds so our bond Council asks that we eliminate that provision and that's what that's all that this amendment does the the history of this is that the uh the the the Housing Authority rules the procedure were adopted by this board uh just to mirror the board's own rules or procedure there were no changes made the the so the reconsideration provision derives from a similar provision which are in the rules of procedure for the the Board of Commissioners or County Commissioners there's only been one change to the Housing Authority Board of Commissioners rules as far as I can tell and that change is to change the date of the meeting so there's never been a substantive review of these of these rules since they're adopted I believe in 2006 but I could be mistaken about the dates but it's been some time so what we're asking is that that in the realities of how financing is done for the Housing Authority it's important that decisions of this board have a have a clear final date and that final date is 10 days after the board adopts it under this proposal is that what you need Catherine that's exactly what I wanted to have brought to life thank you thank you uh and of course if uh in the circumstances of operation if the Housing Authority board of directors after that decision had some big problem then we have communication means set up so that we can bring that forward but it is I've I've never known such a thing to be Revisited because we go through a very thoughtful process of of deciding we want to pursue something then going through all the motions and then making that final consideration so I'm I'm really glad that we're we're making this clear and distinct okay come board any questions or comments just a question Tom um I agree with us doing this and certainly to facilitate the financing package and don't want to delay this however we are taking out an um an opportunity for future decisions to know to not be able to be reconsidered and so it would would it be just as easy to say we suspend this policy for this particular period of time or do we actually have to eliminate it and then if we decide that was a year from now we'd really like to have that back can we put it back the latter uh I explored a temporary a suspension of the rules with Bond Council and they were not thrilled with that and as you know bunk council's job is to make sure that that everything is set and they do a great job at that that's why we hire them and",

        "text": " and depending on the nature of of the fund and the federal requirements the state may combine the federal funding with other state or private dollars to invest in the work and at the end of the day because the law that is authorizing the funds is federal some of the funds are restricted in what they can be used for and that comes straight from the law that congress passed additionally federal agencies can set rules and issue guidance to further clarify the parameters of what's allowed under these federal funds as a result of that certain parts of the infrastructure investment and jobs act will have more flexibility in what they can be used for than other pieces of it but ultimately it all stems from the law authorized by congress so today we are seeking your input so that we can develop guiding priorities that will assist the agency with all aspects of our grant seeking for these federal funds in doing so we've been speaking to energy suppliers and developers energy-based or community-based organizations and local governments just to name a few to get their impressions of what we need to consider as we work to bring these funds into our state in the next few slides we'll cover at a high level what some of the federal investments are as we go through this information please consider what you think may be missing from the list of items we'll be and in addition to that if odo could pick only one thing to invest in what would be the best thing to do we'll be asking for your responses in just a few slides so based on what we know we believe the state energy program will receive an additional boost of about 6.5 million dollars which can be used for a broad spectrum of items and investments in clean energy energy efficiency and resilience activities we estimate that we will be receiving approximately 3.2 million in funding for energy efficiency programs related to a revolving loan fund and the energy efficiency conservation and block grant and the energy efficiency conservation and block grant program will have sub-awards out to to local governments in addition additionally the weatherization program that is granted to the oregon housing and community services is expected to receive about 34.7 million in funds to help low-income households with weatherization services we also anticipate that the oregon department of transportation will about 50 million dollars related to electric vehicle charging stations and we anticipate receiving at odo approximately 50 million for grid resilience investments uh just a note on that the application from the federal government to the state is currently open and we will be working on that application over the next few months uh there will also be a public hearing specific to the resilience and reliability item that you see there in in the uh months ahead we're still working on nailing down a precise date for that hearing though um lastly we do anticipate that there will be a competitive application for energy auditor training up to two million dollars per state and energy auditors are an area that we have heard um is a high need area for workforce development related to the energy system so with that i would like to pause to see if there are any questions based on on that information so just as a reminder you can put your question in the chat or raise your hand not seeing any questions jen we're good so moving on um i just wanted to mention that there are quite a few other funding opportunities that are available under the infrastructure investment and jobs um these are just some of those that are available at the federal level as you can see there's approximately 100 billion dollars in additional funding related to these various topic areas some of which state agencies may be eligible for some may be eligible through nonprofits or universities or other types of entities so these are all some of the opportunities we'll be watching and trying to communicate out jen we do have a quick question the energy auditor training funding is available for homeowners and business owners is that um the energy auditor training program is a competitive grant application that's that's not open from the federal government yet but it will be to support workforce development to train um a variety of energy auditors related to both the residential and commercial um i want to be careful to distinguish that from one of our current programs where we actually we have a current grant through the usda which supports the cost of doing energy audits for rural businesses and agricultural businesses so we we have uh several programs that may may be aligning here soon so i'm happy to um clarify if there's any additional questions there great thank you i think we had a typo in our description of it there is another question in the chat is odo attaching any standards for contractors who will perform these projects within iija funding because the root of the funds are federal um at a at a bare minimum the requirements of the federal funding source which will come with with different compliance related provisions will flow down to any sub-recipients of the federal funds and some of those may uh also apply to contractors depending on the scope of work that that is contracted out for for example if there is a contractor who is hired to perform any sort of construction under the federal funds we do know that based on the law that davis bacon wage reporting requirements will apply and so that is something that a contractor that would be responsible for doing construction work would at a minimum need to comply with um but yes there will likely be various aspects of of things that will need to flow down to the different folks depending on what the individual scope is so we'll move on to talk about community so based on what we've done so far we've had some discussions with our energy advisory work group and managers of community owned utilities as well as some community-based organizations we've also reached out to tribal governments and are scheduling some follow-up conversations we've also had a meeting that was specific to workforce development that was a specific to a priority that we heard coming out of january's meeting in the future we want to gather feedback from the portal that we have so that we can create guiding priorities that can apply broadly to all of our grant seeking under iija to the extent that is practical within the scope of the federal requirements we also anticipate that there will be further conversations around the hydrogen hub and around the grid resilience opportunity under which we will need to have a public hearing for jen we have another question in the chat there is a big list of things that communities might apply for is that something that odo will guide or should folks work directly with their communities to advance those i would say it's one of the reasons why we asked that question at the beginning is to get a better sense of the capacity within communities that may apply for some of those funds but odo does want to help we've actually submitted a legislative concept to additional resources and a staff person at the agency to do just that to help communities navigate federal and state funding we don't have that position yet we are looking to be as helpful as we can with our existing staff um so i definitely reach out and be in touch if you see something that you your community might be interested in applying for and we'll also do our best to promote opportunities that we hear of as and feel free to add to that jen i think that's great i think in order to maximize the funds that we might be able to bring into the state it's going to be a collective effort of any type of entity that may be eligible for any fund trying to to work together with partners to coordinate and collaborate so that we prepare competitive proposals so moving on um just to give a quick overview of where we think we may be able to focus some funding and provide examples of how we could shape our proposals at the state level to focus on certain opportunities as an example we could use some of the federal dollars for additional research or studies and that could support things that address uh statewide issues such as transmission capacity that we've heard about before or it could be for supporting community level planning or projects we could also propose programs that direct benefits to individual customers and focus on energy efficiency in homes and businesses or renewable energy as well as personal or community transportation programs with all these options however we know there's also not likely enough uh funding available to do everything that we desire so we must set some priorities as to how we use these funds so in our conversations to date we've heard about the need for greater workforce development for energy related occupations and the skilled trades that support many aspects of any energy we also know there's a keen interest in making sure that energy workforce programs have strong diversity related to workforce is also a concern about supply chains making it difficult to conduct the construction projects that we need to shore up our supply chain problems in order to get the equipment and the workers in place to to do the necessary infrastructure work we've also heard a desire to increase resilience efforts which includes both the large grid and the community level forms of resilience undergrounding power lines is of particular interest to some of our utility partners lastly we've heard an interest in programs that benefit renters as opposed to homeowners who have long benefited from energy programs additionally we heard there's a desire for navigating aspects of energy information and understanding the various incentives that could be stacked to benefit a specific project whether it's on an individual home or a public and we've also heard that there's a strong desire to simplify the funding process wherever we can so based on what we've shared are there any topics issues or pathways that are from the previous slides and it looks like where you just launched the poll to get your feedback in response to that question so if you have a few moments please go ahead and type in your response if there's any topics that jump out to you that should certainly be on our list and i think we'll give folks about a minute and a half to enter your responses here and as a reminder if you are feeling pressed for time or you want to think about it more you can feel free to respond to these same questions on our portal on our website okay let's keep it open for about 30 more seconds so people can enter their short responses okay you've got about 10 more seconds to finish your response and press send and stacy go ahead and close the bowl all right thank you we've got some really good responses here aligning and combining with existing promoting these wins for oregon as we finish the projects maximizing climate and environmental justice benefits large building systems maintenance and replacement program concerned about permitting assessment work that will delay projects um encouraging us to advocate for expedited timelines great",

        "text": " go through this the biden administration is has been referring to this funding under the infrastructure law as a once in general once in a generation investment in our infrastructure systems and energy is certainly included as part of that overall investment the biden administration also has concerns about investing these federal dollars so that the benefits serve communities that have been historically disadvantaged while there's many details and definitions still to be set at the federal level it does look like the biden administration intends to direct 40 of the benefits of these funds that are energy related under the infrastructure investment and jobs act disadvantaged communities and so here at odo we'll be keeping this requirement in mind as we shape up all of our relevant proposals and program and you can see some of the federal executive orders that that touch on some of these issues related to disadvantaged communities and serving those that have been historically underserved and that aligns with some state priorities because here at oda we recognize that historically there have been certain groups that have been left out of the decision-making roles when it comes to energy policy and it's our intention to do better to address these equity concerns with these fundings however we recognize we have much to learn as we go forward in addressing some of these issues and much work that lies ahead of us as we start to roll out these infrastructure funds in our communities and start to see their the difference that they're able to make and so all of that brings us to the reason of why we're here today seeking your input through this webinar and the portal as well for some of the higher level context the funding that we're talking about today is federal funding and this graphic actually comes to us from one of the federal funding streams that we expect to receive a boost under the infrastructure investment and jobs act but it does have a nice graphic that represents how we anticipate the funds will reach oregon at its source the funds are appropriated by congress where they are then assigned to a federal agency to administer from there the funds are granted to the states through either formula or competitive grants and that will depend on the nature of the exact fund and the federal requirements that are set by congress it's also possible that because the funds are federal in the nature that federal agencies may set additional requirements or issue additional guidance that directs the the purpose of the funding and some of the requirements as well as what the funding can be used for as a res um because of this the state may have some more flexibility in certain federal funding streams than in others as far as what we may be able to invest these these federal funding streams uh dollars so today we're seeking your input so we can develop guiding priorities that will assist the agency with all aspects of our grant seeking for these federal in doing so we have been speaking with the energy suppliers and developers community-based organizations and tribal and local governments just to name a few to get their impressions of what we need to consider to bring these funds into our state and put them to the best use in the next few slides we'll cover at a high level what some of the federal investments are and as we go through this information please consider and think about what might be missing from this list of items that we'll be discussing in addition if odo could pick only one thing to invest in what would be the best thing for us to do we'll be asking for your response in just a few slides based on what we know we believe the state energy program will receive an additional boost of about 600 or 6.5 million dollars which can be used for a broad spectrum of items from investments in clean energy energy efficiency programs and resilience activities we estimate receiving approximately another 3.2 million in funding for energy efficiency programs and that will be a combination of programs under a revolving loan fund and other portions that will be available for direct grants to local governments under the energy efficiency and conservation block grant program in addition to that we expect that the oregon housing and community services agency will receive somewhere in the neighborhood of 34.7 million for weatherization and energy conservation programs for low-income households we also anticipate that the oregon department of transportation will receive approximately 50 million dollars to assist with electric vehicle charging and uh as a recent update we anticipate that oda will receive approximately 50 million dollars to allocate for grid resistance uh resilience investments and that um under that particular fund we will be having a separate public hearing on that coming up in the near future later this summer as part of the application process for the state to apply to the us department of energy to seek those funds to invest in oregon and lastly we do anticipate a competitive training opportunity that's specific to a need we've heard about which addresses the need for additional trained energy auditors and so states will be eligible to apply up to two million dollars to help train um energy auditors that can help with additional energy efficiency programs and so with that i think i'd like to pause and see if there are any questions that have arisen in the chat that would be a good question to address at this time thanks jen i don't see any questions in the chat but i'll invite people to raise their hands if they have any questions about what we've covered so far knowing that we'll may answer them later in the presentation so you're also welcome to hold them until the end or put them in the chat as you as they occur to you i'm not seeing any oh i see one raised um stacy can you please take joshua off mute there we go go ahead joshua hi thanks this is joshua bassifen from climate solutions um thanks jen for that presentation can you clarify on the resilience and reliability piece is that something odo still needs to apply that's a discretionary grant that you still need to apply for is that graphs uh so actually with the grid resilience fund the resiliency and reliability that is mentioned there that is approximately 50 million uh that is a formula grant that is open to um states and and tribes to apply for and we anticipate an annual allocation of approximately 10 million dollars for five years each to reach the cumulative 50 million dollars so while it is formula we do still need to prepare an and in our application to the us department of energy we'll need to describe some of the criteria in which we will choose to invest that that funding into areas that can enhance our grid and so that's actually the topic that will probably be the prime focus of the public hearing that will be happening later this summer uh this information is all relatively new to our agency um the official funding opportunity only released last week and so we don't yet have a date set for that public hearing but we'll be sure to let everyone know as as soon as we're able to um provide a date for that great thank you thanks jen and we do have a few questions that have come up in the chat one request to go back to the previous slide if you can so go back to slide 10 for a minute and just as a reminder to folks on the phone all of these slides are up on our website we have a question about whether the auditors are state auditors or utility-based and i'm not sure we have an answer to that question yet because we haven't set up a program but i'll see jen if you have anything to add anything to offer you know um under the energy auditor training program it's a really a workforce development focused opportunity so it's about how do we train energy auditors wherever they may land in employment um ultimately we we want to make sure that the folks that we invest training dollars in are hopefully gainfully employed at the end of that so i think there could be a wide um array of opportunities under that fund and that's also one we are seeking information on and kind of preparing for a competitive opportunity that we anticipate will open up in in the future great thank you um and i see that we have a another hand raised and john we will come to you in a moment in the meantime jen we have a question in the chat will the state be administering the energy efficiency loans or just providing funding to organizations to administer the energy efficiency loans i think that's a question that we are still working on the exact determination since it is a loan there are lending requirements and that's a topic we are are certainly exploring um in our capacity to lend or whether it makes more sense for someone else to be a third party lender such as a grain bank so all topics we're we're still great thank you and um stacy can you please take john off me there you go john you can ask your question question about the state energy program the 6.5 million funding uh and and can you describe a little bit about what the you know envisioned as the the use of the 6.5 you supporting uh you know investments for clean energy is that to create like a think tank or study on what directions you know the state should be going in or kind of you know what is that uh 6.5 uh how's the use of that is envisioned yeah so um as from a a federal perspective which is where the underlying uh statutory authorization comes from the state energy program has a pretty broad basis for the types of projects that that that funding can be used in so it can be used for energy planning activities it can be used for studies and it can certainly be used for on the ground investments in energy efficiency type programs there are some limitations that are specific to that to that program um but it is perhaps i i think one of the broader applications of of the funding that we see before us as an opportunity under the infrastructure investment and jobs act so i'm i'm happy to follow up with some more detailed information about that but the the list of authorized program activities is quite long all right thank you jen um i think we've addressed most of the questions and feel free to keep them coming in chat um but in the meantime i will turn it back to you to go to the next slide and just as another note um overall the act includes nearly 100 billion dollars for additional funding for infrastructure projects and some of these um are items that we are hearing about from other agencies and other entities that may be eligible to apply or are starting to think about preparing their applications and so these are just some of the opportunities that are presented to to folks that are available under the infrastructure",

meeting minutes everyone had an opportunity to review the minutes um chair this is hanley i moved that thank you hanley i'll second thank you kent we have a motion and a second do we have any further discussion on the minutes hearing none mr secretary please call the role mercy grill kent howe hanley jenkins cindy condon perry chalk too motion carries madam chair thank you and i will just say that i will absolutely be depending on staff and anyone else to for those wishing to speak because i clearly can't see anything at this point so i apologize for that at this time mr secretary if you'd like to present your council secretary report thank you madam chair um let's first start with staffing updates so on march 30th i sent council members an email um indicating that chris clark is our new senior citing analyst so we've been looking to fill that position for a little while he formally started in the position on april 1st i'd say it is of course for us a mixed blessing and i'm sure for council as well so we're very happy to have him become our newest senior sighting analyst because i think he'll be great in that position his learning curve will be short but it also means he'll be moving away from doing the rulemaking uh he's done an excellent job in the rulemaking got a lot of projects completed and been very kind of inclusive and i think just done an excellent job so it is it is certainly a mixed mixed bag for us um but just so council knows he chris is the appointed rule-making coordinator so just because he's moved positions that hasn't changed yet um council will actually need to appoint a new rule-making coordinator at some point in the future and as we seek uh his replacement we have begun that process of seeking his replacement chris will still continue to keep the rulemaking projects that are currently active going and he will still officially be the council's rulemaking coordinator so just wanted to make sure you all knew that so we weren't falling behind so his transition will be really related to you know how long it takes to get a new uh rule-making person on board so we'll we'll start working him on projects but he'll continue to do rule making projects as well one other recruitment so we are currently recruiting for a limited duration compliance officer position so somewhat similar to dwayne's we've actually had the ability to recruit for that position for this biennium and last biennium we've not done that because we didn't have the foreseeable work for many of people within the division um you know we we're largely fee based so about 75 percent of the funding for all of our position comes in from fees so we have to have the the forecast that we actually have the workload necessary to you know have those positions or fill those positions we currently have a lot going on there's a lot of construction going on you know for projects and so we definitely have that forecasted need for the compliance officer we're also making the request for next biennium for that position as well because we see the at least for the next year or two beyond this biennium the need for that position so i'll keep you up to date but we are still just sort of at the beginning stages of the recruitment for that position the questions before i move to project okay secretary cornett this is kent and um i just like not a question i just like to echo your comments uh about chris he did an absolutely fantastic job on rule making projects that he worked on couldn't have been better it was thank you and chris is on the line so thankfully he can hear all these nice things that people are saying about him so and and they're all heartfelt too thank you all very much and looking forward to that chris now you get to wear two hats all right thank you vice chair howe uh moving on to projects so the first is the port westward renewable diesel project so on wednesday of this week we issued a draft of a proposed order slightly different than the draft proposed order because this is uh there's really just the proposed order kind of requirement but we issued a draft of that for public comment um so the project capable of processing 50 000 barrels per day of renewable biomass feed stocks would be located in the port of columbia county at port westward the applicant is seeking an exemption from fsec so what that means we haven't had one of these for quite some time but there are certain projects that meet certain requirements that they can make a request to not have to get a site certificate from fsec and this is one of those projects that that at least theoretically can meet those requirements and so that's essentially what's happening is they submitted their request for exemption we're in the process of reviewing that and ultimately it will come to counsel so the authority for that exemption or exception as it's indicated in statute there's a slight difference in is allowed under organized statute 469 320 and then in rule it's the oregon administrative rule 345.015.0350 and those indicate the types of projects that allowed to request exemptions and then the the steps and the requirements for each type so in order for this type of project to meet an exemption they have to show that they meet five specific criteria and those are the source of the materials for conversion to a liquid fuel and i'm not going to go into the details we'll spend more time on that next month i'm just kind of giving a preview so that's number one number two is that they've received local lane use approval number three is that the project does not require a transmission line or a pipeline that itself would qualify as an f-sec jurisdictional facility number four is that ninety percent of the fuel that is produced will be used within one mile of the production site it will be transported from the production site by rail or barge and then finally there is a specific emission requirement that they have to show that they meet as well again not getting into the details of this we provided that notice to council i believe it was on wednesday um and all the details are in there so the applicant is next renewable fuels oregon llc and then the remaining timeline includes we sent out the notice with a comment period or a written comment period so the deadline for receiving written comments will be may and then may 13th for our production cycle for that council meeting will be the first packet so we will turn around those comments and then make any necessary updates to the proposed order and and send those to council on may may 27th is the next council meeting we will present an overview of the project the requirements and if you feel you have enough information at that time you can make a if not you can certainly continue it to a future council meeting as well but that gives you just a kind of an overview of the timeline and wally adams is the project lead for this any questions on that before i move to the next one the next update is the nolan hills wind power project so on tuesday of this week we issued the draft proposed order the project is a combination facility which includes 340 megawatts of solar or uh wrote that down wrong i think it's 300 feet maybe 340 megawatts of wind 260 megawatts of solar i may have flipped that and 120 megawatts of battery storage the facility is proposed in northwest umatilla county uh nolan hills wind llc is the site certificate or applicant they are a subsidiary of capital power so the draft proposed order public hearing will occur at the next council on thursday may 26th starting at 5 30 p.m and that will be at the red lion in pendleton and kate sloan is the project lead for that project",

        "text": " know after I had searched um contractors are more price competitive but I think what you'll find is that um you know Tesla and large companies that have economies of scale are much more price competitive than kind of smaller contractors not to say that's not wrong to support local contractors and local businesses that have higher operating costs and don't have the same economies of scale but again I think it's following point two costs haven't gone up therefore the program is not um padding contractor bottom lines I I think that that data does not support the conclusion that's implied um because I think I can even today if I were to look at solar and storage from Tesla I doubt there's single contract in the Portland metro area that can beat that cost even with these incentives thanks for continuing to advocate for this I don't want to be in the position of Defending it or not or whatever so um but I will just say thank you for continuing to share the thoughts and I think there's some more chats um that you seem to be reading just fine so um maybe just one on that topic about the cost of Steel going up during the um I don't see any other hands up I don't see any other comments um I James I could turn it over for you if you want to talk a little bit about next steps and then we can hang out in awkward silence for a little while um after um we kind of close things down just in case there's anything else because we really do want to hear your opinions yeah definitely um so it's just uh as a reminder uh we're kind of really early in the rule marketing process and we wish want to gather as much feedback as possible uh so we're holding these sessions um and we're also recognized I know everybody can make these sessions I think of things after them so if you have any comments you want or have questions uh please drop me an uh hoping to get them all in by the end of the uh October Friday October 6th the end of the week so we can start moving on to the the next um Next Step which is kind of starting to gather in this reviewing all those comments and drafting up um the Draft rules um which will then kind of go out for public comment once they're filed with the Secretary of State um and they'll be another comment periods where you'll be able to submit written comment and there'll also be another opportunity to provide some moral comments as well um on the Draft rules and one step um kind of filed so I want to thank everybody for and if there's any questions about the program or if people want to learn more visit the program's website and um or ask the program staff uh Dale and um drop them an email at the team's email address as well which is on the screen here um and uh as you said we're happy to to hang out if people have more um but if not have a lovely rest of your day and thank you now's the part where you all can go and we'll just stick around in case anybody has any other questions or comments on their way out the door thank you so much to members of the public contractors Advocates we really appreciate you being here today thank you hi Caroline yes I just finished inputting the email addresses thank you um and I'm curious as to um where I can read the procedure to the rule not just the rules but the procedure the steps it will take to accomplish this project yeah I think what you're asking about are you you're a customer and you want to get a solar rebate in reality I'm a home care worker and I would like to share this information with those whose emails I have so that they can at least know about the possibility if they are in a position to do something about it and share the word around so that's why I'm here I have to own my own home with my partner and uh changes in when it when change is happening I don't know when state in my own situation but other people may be at least interested in learning about this yeah that's really great to hear um what I'm wondering about is if Katie or Dale one of our two staff members might be just we have your email address if it might be helpful for them to follow up with a link on our website to where there's kind of some basic information and to kind of answer answer any questions that you have okay I have I think that seems like the best approach we've given you my name properly spelled and my email address because you do actually have it yeah and I think Katie might have already emailed you with the PDF of the list of contractors I'm here and not in my email address you see yeah yeah that's fair so Katie can maybe also follow up with just like a general link to our website since she's already started talking with you um to just suggest like here's the link where there's some information on the program we have a flyer that she could send but I think that would be the best approach to get you what you need all right and then you'll lose somebody to ask questions too I thank you and it's nice that there's it's practical the time frame is practical you're using the time that people have questions and ending when they stop their questions yeah that's just seems like the way to go yeah um yeah Katie's gonna get in touch with you super thank you for the info and uh thank you for having this opportunity to yeah no problem thanks for coming today by making note Katie Katie to contact me super I do see Angela Crowley cook from OCS on the line too and she's just um you can take that list of contractors you have now and getting three bids from solar for getting three bids um uh is always a good practice and she also put a link in the chat about not sure what it's for the RC it says here someone said direct folks through the Energy Trust of organ site to request bids I uh respect the Energy Trust of Oregon if it's the one I'm thinking about yeah yeah so I guess they have I when I click on the link I can't open it so maybe when Katie emails you she can also send that link and have it be one I when I try to open it I can't so okay uh but that might just be me and maybe I've already gotten it I don't know I'll just rewrite it thanks Carolyn and sorry for having your name wrong earlier such as life uh my own typos I should have rationally thought it was Carolyn I just couldn't get past the the D well don't worry don't worry all right well anyone else have anything I don't see any other hands up well appreciate everybody who's here and we'll probably go ahead and drop off so we don't have any more questions I don't want to have the four people that are here just to live it around have to wait around give everybody an extra 13 minutes back to their day",

        "text": " of that put out a couple of calls for people in different parts of the state representing different demographies to participate in one of the issues we ran up against probably a third of the way through the project today is integrating tribal perspectives in the Statewide process and it is it is because of the government-to-government relationship that Tribal Sovereign Nations have with the state of Oregon that was difficult to incorporate to date from our perspective in level on this process there was only one individual at the start of the project that was representing one element of a tribe and as a consultant to that tribe and not a tribal individual themselves that we're not comfortable in terms of representing tribes um and didn't feel that that was an appropriate function for the advisory committee so at some point the Oregon global warming commission is going to need to engage at the state level with the tribes in on that process but one of the things that we've struggled with a little bit throughout the process is the confounding of political and policy processes with our task which is science based so what INR and what we're working on it's all science-based we're looking at science peer-reviewed Publications the best data the best information but while that's been going on there's been a legislature in process there's been you know there's there's all kinds of discussion about how do we incentivize this how do we do this and that's outside of our scope so we've decided to resolve that by welcoming if someone's got a policy statement they think is really important on the advisory committee no problem we've got a separate document where we're capturing those policy statements and we're just going to package them as such for the Oregon global warming commission at the conclusion of the project so we won't lose those good perspectives but we also want the global warming commission to recognize our work is science-based it is not policy or political based the second um task that we're working on the activity-based metrics uh in Baseline the prospective funding that could be associated with specific Industries whether it's the Tim you know the the timber industry or AG industry or whatever type of Industry that can tend to try to confound our process as well could make the process be something more than what it is and right now we're on a science-based mission here to get you good information so we just wanted you to know we're trying to keep those separate as well any potential funding for anything doesn't influence how we portray that science to you the Oregon global warming commission Pro proposal goes to measure carbon and greenhouse gases relevant relative to different scales and activities on the ground so we just want you to know this accordion scale that we're dealing with um it's it's a challenge to think about you know the work of a small Woodland landowner versus state forests in their significant acreage versus you know there's all these different kinds of scales and activities across these land sectors in that's been it's been a challenge um emerging science and existing it's always going to be a challenge for Oregon it's going to be a challenge for any state that does this um and we just need to acknowledge that up front and you know this is a really interesting one it's really important that the commission knows that land sector Industries in Oregon want to be recognized for their contributions big or small to carbon storage and greenhouse gas emissions goals so we may be able to identify let's just say five or six really big things that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and store carbon that's great and we want to do that but let's acknowledge all of those other contributions uh big or small that that these industries and folks that work in these sectors want to be recognized for because they do contribute even in some small way they're additive um and the last piece is just acknowledging the crossover and sector-based emissions in agriculture so DEQ has its role and they've got an agriculture sector and we're working on agriculture in the natural and working lands piece and so we've had some good conversations with DEQ about hey just recognize there might be a little bit of overlap here and DEQ has been great about that in fact they've encouraged if the AG sector or any other sector wants to suggest any practices that might overlap with some that are already in the AG Transportation sector or whatever they're fine with that in terms of community-based metrics um just wanted to emphasize understanding and developing a framework for Oregon is going to be important for agencies and communities versus just specific metrics um thinking about scale again that accordion for considering uh impact and thinking about metrics for different purposes like the urban forestry program versus maybe the city of Portland urban forestry program versus a local community it's it's really important because those metrics are are important for all three of those different types of entities and again it's that accordion effect in terms of Workforce Development and training needs it's really important that all land sectors are represented in that assessment in gaap analysis because it can be really easy to overlook any one of those sectors just because of the size and history of some of our other natural and working land sectors but if we really want to make a difference in Workforce Development with this with the proposal that the global warming commission developed all land sectors have to be represented we just need to acknowledge that the data and the information might not exist at the same levels across those sectors ensuring a new program is not created rather creating efficiencies across all existing programs and I mentioned that in my earlier statements we have some people with a lot of horsepower in Workforce Development in this state and they're pretty excited to see the potential for what can happen with organs natural and working legs land sectors and lastly the inventory methodology we do lack a lot of data in information that methodology is going to evolve over time we fully expect it to it's not going to be perfect coming out of the gate and we just need to acknowledge that the scale of data is not the best that we want it to be but it will get better Through Time and there are privacy issues with private lands and we all need to acknowledge that the good news is that there's a numerous programs that exist nationally and internationally where we address those private issues uh on privacy issues on private lands so there's lots of models to deal with that issue and lastly there's going to be a lot of assumptions with the inventory methodology because it's such an emerging type of issue for our state and numerous other states to address in acknowledging those assumptions and then using an Adaptive management approach where you modify and do course Corrections over time are really going to be the key to success so I have run out of air and that is all of the quest the all that I had to present and Kathy I will turn it over to Thank you Lisa great job I I would like to maybe just take a one or two clarifying questions if anybody has it before we go to Break um and then the other piece just on the last section that Lisa covered in terms of the somebody is typing um so if somebody could go on mute that's typing that'd be great but the inventory information um one of the things that DEQ has shared with me which makes me feel a little bit better about the fact that we don't have all the data that we would like um is that you know that's been true of all the sectors that we've done developed inventories they've they've started we're in the best place they could and the information's gotten better over time and so I think we will be following Along on that same model now commissioner Ford yes thank you chair McDonald uh and Lisa thank you for the presentation it was very informative I just have a quick question um on the second last slide that you were talking about definitions um you know related to the inventory data and I'm just I'm just curious uh we're not the only state that's looking at inventory um I know California Washington in particular are looking at these issues and I'm wondering uh did the work group that's working on this look to see if we could create some consistency about these definitions so data can be looked at uh in the context of what's going on around us yes absolutely um and those definitions are posted on the website so we started with California uh in their greenhouse gas inventory glossary we wanted to use a state closest to us just as a starting point and one who had already used ipcc and other definitions so our definitions build off of California's some but not any that would be considered hugely significant if anything there's just some additional terms that were added that folks in Oregon felt were yeah great thank you I think I think that's I think that's great and I think clearly needed that we have some consistency so we can compare data sets and roll data sets up really looking out just at Oregon but looking at our region more broadly so I think that's very helpful thank you there definitely was um interest amongst our advisory committee to refine definitions but I think overall the committee felt like we should stay as consistent as we felt um we could with definitions used by ipcc California and other states it's a good really good point clarifying questions seeing none oh uh director Bateman thank you um thank you for both presentations this morning I just wanted to note our ongoing interests from dlcd um particularly as you know the land use approach that we take is really table setting that it you know provides the backdrop and the context for a lot of these conversations and we're particularly interested in um being part of the natural working lands discussion wherever possible helping to set that Baseline and making sure that our Coastal program that we're responsible for implementing is is fully at the table there so I just wanted to throw that reminder out and offer our help wherever we can and that that piece but we're very excited about um both this and the previous conversation just in terms of how Oregon is is positioned you know we've let the Oregon way so we've got that that basis and that history of connection with um our communities and and then we've got our land use system that's um you know really well positioned to provide kind of underpinnings for a lot of these conversations so um wherever we can plug in please let us know we're available and interested thank you great thank you director Bateman and dlcd was very helpful in the development of the uh natural working lands proposal that we adopted in 2021 and has been providing some really helpful input in particular on the coastal work uh but also you know on how the land use laws benefit uh working lands uh in in farms and forests and and natural land so really important person about",

        "text": "DP I want to be clear that I'm not sorry uh critiquing going to businesses it's just a point of sometimes we know what we want to accomplish we want to get people off the road and going to business but instead of saying that we're saying all these other things and then yelling equity in the middle of it and then trying to shove all these additional things in there so I think some clarity on what we're trying to accomplish not that I'm upset we're going to business groups I'm just saying it's it's a it's a conflicting message and if you tell me you want to try to get to people off the road and into businesses it totally makes sense to go there I just think what we say matters and we can't just throw equity in as an afterthought or think we're checking the Box and maybe to add to Adam Tara was saying thank you Tara um just a couple of pieces and as an example just thinking about the you know Tara mentioned the federal criteria we have our hands tied a little bit when thinking about what's more ready the federal criteria right now you know we all as Regional partners are really interested in in future connections and supporting the 2040 growth concept and we're definitely on agreement on that that Federal criteria focuses much more on current ridership today so it's one of those things where even though we're balancing both and we want to be both thinking about what's going to be most um eligible and competitive for federal funding to implement the vision while also keeping an eye on these future connections we sometimes have our hands tied a little bit because the federal criteria does have some um particular things it looks at like current rather than future ridership and that's another reason why we we know definitely that we're going to be seeing growth throughout the region and a lot of these places but another reason that we do end up seeing the tearing look like what it does so that's what Tara is mentioning when she's saying the the federal criteria and some of the limitations that were coming up against and then um just expand a little bit on the Readiness yeah we definitely wanted to look at um similar we've been talking about the the cfec the climate-friendly Equitable communities um because especially with rapid bus which we're considering now rapid bus is really a partnership because we are using the roadway and we are looking you know there's the the features that TriMet provides like the articulated buses and and some of the station elements there's there's definitely key features that aren't in trimet's wheelhouse which are things um or jurisdiction like the space and the roadway to be providing that Transit priority to make sure it's getting that speed and reliability you know whether that's a bus lane um working together for the transit signal priority there's things the buses can do but have to have this you know work with the signals to do and then there's access to the stations and Corridor as well and so thinking about making sure that they're people that are walking and rolling can get to the corridor and so some of those less quantitative measures that we looked at are bringing all of that into account in some cases the in some cases we have some more work to do as far as policies that would really help support us get there some cases too it's the policies might be in place but we're waiting for those um through things like the the market to show up so there's definitely some things that we're looking to do together to really be supporting um all of the corridors and that you're you're seeing in the tiering results as well really in line with that policy and I just build on that quickly can you guys hear me now I can hear you and you can hear me that corridors that are not on that map that you just looked at could very well still be better bus also known as Etc enhanced Transit corridors or some of those corridors that are on the longer term list that are tier four further out those could be very good candidates for where we would make some of those Transit priority Investments to speed up existing buses on those roadways and so though it might not be a light rail or bus Rapid Transit Corridor in the near term there are still Investments we could be making to really speed up Transit that is not a federally funded high capacity Transit project and so you'll definitely be hearing from us and Metro soon about the next phases of that process for better bus programs specifically and that just because a corridor isn't on this draft list for HCT Vision at this point or as later down the list doesn't mean that it's not ripe for additional investment to speed up transit to make it a more competitive option so I just wanted to make sure to put that out there as well all right because we're running a bit behind so I gotta move this along uh so I'm gonna go with uh mayor Serato then mayor Rosner then Kessler Rosenthal um thanks Frank I appreciate the situation that you're sitting in unfortunately there's no such thing as a history pill if there were I would like to dispense it amongst all of the elected officials attending today um these Corridor questions have um been on the on the radar for over a decade the Southwest Corridor for example has been if you will um gone all the way from concept to the um and recently or relatively recently was not accepted by the voters the Southwest Corridor would have addressed many many many of the issues that we're presently discussing and uh having been a member of the original trimat board on the Southwest quarter and then as it evolved to the Metro side also on that again I wish I could share information with you all about what was collected what was done what was dispersed how we got to the point that we did of bringing it to the public for a vote including having lined up uh Congressional delegations uh at that time representative DeFazio was a very powerful person in Congress with regard to transportation funding we had Senators Wyden and Merkley involved in in the southwest Corridor and then also on on the um 99w uh the 99w project has been a high profile with the Mayors in the communities that have affected it um most of you know a lot of those Mayors are now new so again there's history involved here which we can't share immediately but one of the biggest things that we ran into with Highway 99 is the city of Portland and peabot um the fact of the matter is that Highway 99 is uh um it's not it's not high Transit capacity capable it was not the infrastructure was not built in there all the area around uh Fred Meyer on what was what we call Barber Boulevard is all substandard for high capacity and we'd have to go back in and do infrastructure it's not just a matter of building the the roadways for for for buses for example and it's something that uh mayor Lowe brought up you know when we look at that map all of those Maps the Southwest portion of Washington County in the South uh pardon me the southeast of course portion of Washington County in the southwest portion of Clackamas County is the only area in the metropolitan area that's not served by TriMet I mean excuse me by by Maps we have no light rail out here um and that was supposedly going to be addressed by the uh Southwest Corridor so what I'm trying to say is here is let's not try to reinvent the wheel there's been a lot of work that's been done over more than 10 years to try to bring high capacity transportation out to this portion of the metropolitan area um and a lot of it a lot of the cast of characters have changed all the way from the hierarchies in metro to the hierarchies and trimat but there is a lot of a lot of work that has been done trying to achieve exactly what we're talking about um having said that I'm going to defer back to you chair because I know we are running late in time and I said I could go on on the history on this for quite a while and I'm not going to spare you all uh where'd Tim move to where'd you go oh I'm gonna bow out in interest of time sorry I'm good all right Council just a quick comment I I appreciate the the presentation that Ali made it's a very complex process I'm hoping that we can get a little bit more you know dig into details on each of the individual quarters I I want to support uh mayor Serato uh I'm quite committed to pushing forward on the Southwest Corridor because I think that's a tier one and I think it needs to be moved forward I agree with all the I basically I agree with everything that the mayor said of all of you basically in particular the comments that we need to think larger rather than incrementally we're going to be limited by funding in the long term that's true but we need to think of what the the future is going to bring I have a bunch of other concerns but I will probably address those either with individual jurisdictions or and also with staff because you know I can always uh set up meetings to talk to ali uh you know easily so I will do that and rather than take up any more time right now but I think Wes is something that deserves a lot of issue Highway 99 deserves a lot of concern the whole added population that we're putting out on the far west side deserves a lot of concern and the Southwest Corridor deserves a lot of effort so those are the things that I'm really going to be focusing on here's back up Tim I'm sorry I'm just just a couple seconds here and and I thank you uh Garrett and I it and just I think this was said but I just want to say it again I remind staff at City all the time that we need to be Grant ready you know we never know what funding opportunities are going to pop up and uh you know so making sure that we have the focus the planning done to you know for the projects that we need to do in these corridors to make things work so we're ready when the funding opportunities arise because it may not be funding opportunities that we know about today and I know we've seen a lot of that in the last three years where New Opportunities have popped up and if you were ready you got it if you weren't ready you didn't get it all right I just got two quick things uh everyone else covered what I want to talk about as for Ali as far as uh Tim's request about come out to Sherwood did you",

        "text": "ations provided that there is um there aren't any constraints on on the trend or failures on the transmission system north to south along the coast that power should go to the coast um and the coast should see a direct benefit and that's kind of uh you know i think the system operators have to keep that in mind you know to make sure that you know the coast can be served reliably and and but the benefits are are system-wide i mean everyone benefits it's not like i know that's that's a common question it's not just the coastal folks get the benefit or just the i5 folks get the benefit i mean it's been it's a it's kind of a rising tide you know we we all benefit from it and um but there are some acute power quality benefits that would be experienced near where the interconnections happen so that is a bit different in terms of you know um some things i mentioned in power quality so the to the the the stability of frequency and voltage you know you know along the coast particularly in radial extensions on the coast where maybe they're down down the road on a 115 kv line and it's somewhat un unreinforced i mean i think everybody's power quality is pretty good but it could be better potentially with with coastal generation it might make the the job of the system operator utility a bit easier um in some ways not at all but uh in terms of the other benefits um you know that really we all get them and uh it's just a matter of of building out the infrastructure the transmission infrastructure to make sure there are constraints and things held up along the along the line so to speak yeah i'll just add i agree with everything travis said about the way the regional grid works um but that there are some interesting ideas just um around sort of design characteristics that might involve some complementary battery storage or other sort of design characteristics that might help with more local resiliency that you know if a specific project was proposed could explore um there's a few other comments in the chat that i'm going to review um i'm going to go to kathy and then shawn to break it up a bit so go ahead kathy okay um yeah i had i had to concern first of all thank you on your slide 53 for putting in the megawatts as well as making us try to figure out how to get from volts to capacity so which the bomb charts never never did that but you know i am concerned about the fact original charts showed assume that you could use the full length of oregon for for your transmission but then they cut their call areas down to just a very to basically getting to two of them and so i was disconcerted when bob was asked about that in one of their meetings saying well that's a state issue um so i'm hoping there's going to be communication between odo and all those other groups and boom before they actually go out with something that can't be met the other thing that and this is one that might help with the the uh on the on the coast for for you know worker development um hp 3375 included specifically generating hydrogen with excess um but also you know the more we see the difficult um situation you're wearing from the ipcc the more it seems like getting involved with direct air capture is something and that's one that could also use a lot of renewable energy in order to operate so that could be done right on the coast so that might be a consideration of what what can be used locally to use excess yeah that's a great point um hydrogen is sometimes considered a form of storage it's a it's a great point coffee yeah no i mean that definitely that's in and and as i said that was included you know brock smith included in his bill um but but the direct air capture is one i haven't seen that being considered and and i think that that's the sooner we can get that online the better off we're going to be that's great thanks thanks so much kathy i'm not sure if um anyone from baum is on the line this time but you're welcome to add to the chat um uh colleagues from boehm if you wanted to um have a little bit more or provide a little bit more information on the call areas my sort of basic recollection is um boom did consider you know sort of the areas with the best wind resource and that um to explore in a call what developer interest is but um you know call areas could come further north in time sort of an ongoing process as far as i understand today i'm going to go to sean next go ahead first i want to say thank you for the presentation it helps clear from my mind what i've a disconnect i've been having with respect to um where the call areas are that volume is moving forward with versus the amount of capacity that the indicative study was identifying may be available in the in the system today and so that helps helps me understand that you looked at the entire coast and not just the southern oregon coast with respect to where potential um resources may connect so that's pretty helpful um i you know and i i don't i definitely don't want to be a wet blanket here i just want to try and caution everybody that um you know understanding that economic dispatch and pcm studies are are a bit of a different animal than the reliability studies that the transmission planners for these for the transmission providers to reach the coast and understand pg e is not one uh you know we don't have any lines that that go over to the to the coast and and so you know while we'll be involved in the regional context you know we we don't have the expertise in those areas um you know we'll need to get pacific war in bonneville uh heavily involved and and but i just want everybody to understand that those reliability studies are going to be critical to understanding what is actually able to you know potentially interconnect in those areas so uh just you know hopefully everybody keeps that in the back of their mind as we as we move forward there there is you know some potential we just don't know exactly what what that is yet and then the second thought i'll i'll leave with is you know just to sort of uh uh leave everybody with the understanding that there's been a an economic study request presented to northern grid um which is the regional transmission planning organization and uh some more work will be developed there and in just an informal conversation that i've had with with with our neighbors uh bpa pacificorp um there is definitely an intent on studying it i know both pge and pacific it sounds like are are likely going to consider it in terms of the irp processes so we'll understand what the resource uh uh can mean in terms of load service um uh but additionally there's you know there's lots of discussion around you know the actual transmission providers who serve the coast uh you know performing some of these these analysis and these studies to really drive into uh what the system is capable of today what it would mean in terms of flows etc so i just want to make those comments and i appreciate the time and you know i thank everybody for doing the work i you know uh i think this is this is very good information on could potentially be great for for the state of oregon so that's great sean um thanks for sharing i'm going to turn it over to adam for a response yeah thanks john and you uh you took my punchline a little bit i was going to respond to this flag for folks that um we did last week with the puc submit a request to northern grid um to do exactly some of that kind of analysis so and i know jason has slides on it coming up later so look forward to have a chance to preview a little bit of that because i know i'm not sure that many folks on the call are aware of it thanks adam and i know we have some slides on that study coming up in the next section um a couple other things from the chat that i wanted to make sure we called out in case you're on the phone and reminder for those on the phone that you can press star 3 to raise your hand in star 6 to mute or unmute um there were some comments about earthquakes from mike from earthquakes about are one factor in evaluating transmission vulnerability at the coast those factors are earthquakes and tsunamis as well and and some discussion about vulnerability of store-based infrastructure needing to operate and maintain floating offshore wind should be considered in terms of mitigating vulnerability of the east-west transmission system and then mike also commented that yesterday a dutch offshore wind turbine came apart and triggered a no sail zone for vessels in the area and was wondering if evaluation of risk and vulnerability considerations on unintended unintentional failures of a floating offshore wind facility might compromise power supply and other economic activities thanks for that question mike i don't know if our study will go into that level of detail i wasn't aware of the dutch offshore wind turbine so thanks for for sharing that um there's a couple of questions in the chat about links to uh various studies that travis uh mentioned i'll just note for everyone that slide 57 and 58 has a pretty good list of references uh with links in it that you can click on using the pdf version of the slide deck on our and just to jump in richie the 2021 reference that i think is throwing some through me too when i was trying to think about answer the question that's just a publication of the 2020 work so it's not a different study there's a study in 2020 which we did in our you we we put out there through boehm and then through pnnl technical report literature and then we took it to a peer-reviewed journal in 2021 and now we have a new study that launched late 21 early 22 on the southern oregon northern transmission then maybe to the the to mike's question about the the failure of um you know any single generator i mean the way floating officer win will have to comply with the the same requirements of any generator so you know if a natural gas plant fails it might be you're right that there are different you know it's not failing in the ocean and maybe it doesn't create a no sales zone so that that piece is different but in terms of the power system um and that piece should should be considered of course but in terms",

        "text": " into the conditions like that the department has to approve so and that's not a checkbox approval it's we're approving something substantive that wasn't figured out in the permitting process uh so it's it's quite detailed and requires a lot of coordination um typically uh We've interwoven other agencies to help in that review approval ODFW is the obvious a lot of times the local government the special Advisory Group entity um and dogami are are standard agencies that we build into that process takes time um so just a couple of examples I have more listed on the slide then I'll go into but of conditions that we're evaluating at pre-construction compliance one of our favorite and applies to every developer is the the decommissioning bond and that condition if you're familiar I mean is typically a half a long makes sense to everyone right but it doesn't uh and so we where we the council would approve um the methods for estimating that decommissioning estimate and the unit costs and so really all that is supposed to happen at preconstruction is you can adjust the number of components if you don't build battery storage you don't have to pay for it if you don't have a 100 wind turbines you only have 41 you can adjust that well what ends up happening is a complete redo of the decommissioning estimate and you're like what is going on here that's not right go back and then maybe they would say well can we do bonding in phases or and so you're working out like no all you can do is update the number of components and we will confirm inflation and then oh by the way you have to use a council approved Bond or former financial institution maybe then they need to pitch a new institution or bond form changes and three months later we might get through this condition so that times 40 um anyway so that's just one example there's you know every every uh substantive preconstruction condition has a lot of back and forth in review to get it where it's at uh rarely do we have an instance where what we get is what it's supposed to be and we can move forward on that day okay so facilities I believe the next slide please thank you very much so facilities that are currently in this um amazing preon construction phase are the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line which I believe everyone's familiar but that is a 500 KV transmission line that Council has approved it extends across five counties Umatilla Union Baker Mal here and Morrow County um so we're it's incredibly complicated to do preconstruction compliance for a project of this size while at the same time processing requests for Amendment too um that's interesting but it's were're actually experiencing that on more and more projects where they just need approval of changes while at the same time wanting to move forward on another arm and then the other project that's in preconstruction is the madra solar energy facility that's an approved 60 megawatt solar in Jefferson County um both of those projects I shouldn't talk anyway I won't I I'll tell you about that on the next slide and then we expect for Wheat Ridge renewable energy facility East which is a 200 megawatt up approved in Morrow although going through an amendment to initiate preconstruction imminently like tomorrow um next slide please okay so then we'll move into the construction arm of the program so once we've verified preconstruction requirements construction is authorized to commence either for a portion that they went through preconstruction or for the entirety of the site our role then becomes that of um conducting inspections and receipt and review of semiannual reports semiannual reporting on construction compliance is in Rule and then it's often implemented in a condition as well um as I mentioned earlier we have uh you know we we are getting support from our environmental consultant Haley and Aldrich to help with construction inspections they're more frequent um and so we need a little bit of help to keep up with the frequency needed if it's on a monthly basis and we do have work order contracts in place for projects expected to go into construction for people that live out closer to the facility so that we can reduce costs like for example obsidian solar in Lake County that would be an enormous burden if we had to send someone from Salem every month you know with a 9-hour commute back and forth so we are are working to get localized people they're not exactly right there but they're much closer than Salem Health member buyer just a quick question I know some of our conditions are implementing other government requirements so storm management um do we do those inspections does DEQ do those inspections yeah so I think what you might be referring to is where we have conditions that require compliance with the 1200c storm water uh permit and so I I believe we view the role of FC adopting that condition as a site certificate requirement to be different than what deq's federal permit requirements are covering so where the adopts that permit in compliance with that permit as protection of erosion and soil agriculturally sensitive soils and DEQ is looking at it from a water quality perspective so I mean it ends so we do inspect for compliance on that and it was you know going back to the Golden Hills complaint I mean it was that permit in compliance with that that we then both had issues with I mean we look at it for different things but you can evaluate the issues in the same way and if one agency has a problem so do we but our regular Ator Nexus is different it's definitely created challenges because people don't understand that and tell us to go away when we try to press and we're trying to sort of continue to delineate maybe we don't even refer to the 1200c and we have our own things so that no one is confused right right right yeah yeah um okay next slide please so Dwayne mentioned this but just a quick overview the facilities that we currently have under construction are two oven grid backed projects the bakeoven solar project is 60 megawatt solar and and Daybreak solar 140 megawatt solar they're adjacent to each other in Wasco County they're getting close to completion construction's been a little bit delayed because of the panel issue in Imports which is interesting um but we've generally been having our consultant conduct monthly to every two-month inspections out there to keep an eye on what's going on and Reporting back and then we issue inspection reports and then the other project that is kind of it's quote unquote in the construction phase is Summit Ridge Wind Farm um they initiated construction several years ago on like a small phase and then never moved forward with anything else but it forever lives in this phase until something else happens we anticipate three projects moving into the construction phase this year which is the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line um that would be about a 2-year construction duration the madra solar energy facility about a year and then Wheatridge renewable energy facility East again about a year so it's a lot it's fast I'm scared okay and then next slide then moving into the longest lasting phase of a site certificate it is the operational phase um it has a similar scope as construction what we do once a facility is in operation is our role becomes receipt and review of annual reports those come in on April 30th generally and they are intended to have a complete evaluation of compliance of the prior operating year with all applicable onm conditions um we schedule and Implement site inspections we conduct the inspections and then we track and remediation and you know plans that have come from non-compliance findings of non-compliance there's 28 operating facilities 28 site certificates that are basically Dwayne's responsibility to Monitor and track and you know I mean basically a facility takes us about two to four weeks to get through so if you do the math with 52 weeks a year Dwayne can never take any vacation which is not true but um it's just a it's a very big uh scope of work there uh and then so some of the issues that we've been working through that we have brought to Council meetings I believe in Secretary reports we tell you of incidents and of findings of non-compliance um just to highlight those that we've identified in the last year are um failures to uh control control noxious Weeds on these big sites um failure to uh Implement habitat mitigation plans in a manner that achieves habitat enhancement um non-compliance with long-term Raptor nness monitoring requirements and then um two others uh failure to ensure that all equipment is locked to preclude um access by the public and failure to have adequate turban aprons I'll let Dwayne talk more about that but that's important for many reasons uh buyer in particular and catching of um oil spills that could happen chair car council member Conan uh thank you um I think you um just said on the last the annual reports are all due on April 30th um and I I don't know that it would be helpful but would it would it help if those were staggered throughout the year yeah and that April 30th date is in rule it's in our division 26 rule um we stagger we have to stagger review of them so that's kind of how it ends up happening and it's you know it another maybe rule thing but it's like reporting of the prior year so it's it is a challenge I mean once we finally get to some of the and we we prioritize them based on age of the facility those you know on if you're 10 years and younger you're still trying to achieve mitigation so we want to focus and prioritize are you going to be able to do this the way you're supposed to um and then those that have lesser maybe you're basically all done with your mitigation by year 10 and Beyond and so those would get the back end of the prioritization thank you helpful secretary cornette for the record Todd cornette um thank you council member con for the question I'm going to take this opportunity to express even more complex comp lexity in the compliance program since you asked the question so you know think about it if you know an incident occurred on the facility that or maybe some you know some change that they don't think requires an amendment or is an incident could occur in January of a year they're not going to report that until April 30th of the next year and it could be six months until we're really kind of getting into that issue so there can be a very big lag time we",

team and um other folks that'll stay in the background from our Odo team help answer questions and uh and help run the run the webinar as well um we opened this first round of funding on March 15 making almost $19 million of federal funding available to Oregon's Electric utilities for grid resilience projects if you are with an electric utility hopefully you've had time to review the information and documents and start an application if you're a utility customer interested in following this program we're glad you're here and we encourage you to engage with your utility to be part of the process um the main purpose today is to quickly get to your questions but first I'll run through an overview of the program and highlight the application requirements including where to find everything on our website again thank you very much for being here here's a quick guide to some of the features in WebEx attendees are off camera and muted but our host will be able uh to unmute you for questions on the right hand side of your screen in the participants panel you can click near your name to raise your hand there's also a hand icon at the bottom of the WebEx window in the reactions bar click that hand to indicate you'd like to ask a question and feel free to use the chat function to ask questions please send your chats to all panelists or to everyone so that all of the AO staff can see it and help responses if you joined from a phone press star six to raise your hand um we should be able to unmute you from our end uh but in case that doesn't work and you're on a phone then you do we try star three but hopefully between Patricia our host's help and uh and you on the phone we'll be able to do that it's oh it's I'm being corrected star three is to raise your hand on your phone if you're here if you're hear from a phone it doesn't look like the four participants we have so far are on their phone so I'll let's keep going um we we are recording today's webinar and we will post the recording to our website along with the presentation slides again please put questions into chat at any time but please wait to speak until I finish this summary I promise I will make it quick and we'll get to question and answer for the majority of our chrisy yeah before you get going to start um start with your presentation or quick presentation I should say I think it'd be nice if folks could introduce themselves in the chat with what organization or utility there with just so we know who we're talking to okay great thank you and we'll ask that you do the same um if you are going to speak um and ask a question that way if you just give a quick introduction to yourself um after you've been uh um unmuted and asked to uh to proceed with your question thank you all right I'll start the summary now this program is funded under the infrastructure investment and jobs act also known as the bipartisan infrastructure law and will include five years of funding this eight .9 million is the first of the first two years of funding and we expect about $50 million of federal dollars over the life of the program so if the firstr application deadline on June 14th won't work for you there will be more opportunities so please continue your project and application planning for a future round we've set aside 40% of the funds for projects from small utilities defining those as selling 4 Mill million or less megawatt hours annually the law requires a one-third funding match of any subgrant award to the small utilities and large utilities must match 100% of any subgrant award all of the application documents have been posted on our website since March 15th so hopefully you've had time to start and here and are here today with questions about those documents and other aspects of the process our application submission portal is still being developed but is not needed to start your application the portal will simply be a place to upload your completed application documents and to lock in your submission with a dig digital signature before the deadline after the deadline on June 14th we will start the application review and selection process we plan to notify selected Utilities in early October the law and the US Department of Energy's implementation of the law created this grant program to provide utilities with money to improve the resilience of the electric grid and to encourage the selection and development of grid resilience projects that prioritize disadvantaged communities our first objective gets right to the resilience improvements by looking at how your projects will decrease the frequency in duration of grid disruptions the second objective is to see how and where projects improve grid resilience to benefit disadvantaged communities in in this program disadvantaged communities are defined and identified by the climate and economic Justice screening tool up with we will look at how your projects will decrease the frequency and duration of good distri ion specifically in disadvantaged communities where that applies um I won't get into the details of the climate and economic Justice screening Tool uh today that's um the links and stuff are available on the website along with a lot of documentation around that program the justice 40 program and and everything related to that and the and the climate tool but we're here to answer questions around that today too and then our third objective is to select project that maximize Community benefits overall so we'll look at your community engagement and any Workforce support and development aspects of your projects will your project reduce the use of fossil fuel generators we will also look for project measures that support emergency preparedness and Emergency Operations and we'll also consider project diversity in geography Technologies and scope as well as the type and size of the utilities for the applications that we receive in the first round this is a list of the eligible measures from the federal guidelines if you have very specific technical questions around these measures it might be better to put those details in an email so we can research and provide detailed answers um the main point to make about the eligible activities is the scope of the project using one or more of the listed activities should reduce the frequency in duration of disruptive events New Generation and cyber security measures are not allowed under this program I mean they're allowed but they're not eligible for uh funding or for Grant funds um now I'll quickly discuss some details here's the homepage for the Oregon Department of energy the first column on the left lists our incentive and efficiency programs and here you'll find a link to get to the grid resilience grant program page handy a little red arrow to show way on the other website or one other website navigation tip the blue Banner at the top stays with every page in the on the Odo website so as you move around the website you should always see this blue banner and see these menu choices at the top including incentives when you select the incentives um menu choice at the top you get a drop- down list of links to all the incentives programs just like on that column that I previously showed you including another link or another way to get to the grid resilience grant program and then after you get to the resilience program this is what you'll find um the program information is in the center column and the left column has links uh the left column has links to other programs the program schedule is in the center and will be updated as needed so always return to this page for the current and official dates and deadlines for the program the application documents including instructions are on the top right hand side of this web page as mentioned earlier the application submission portal is still being developed but it is not needed to complete the application documents the portal will be a place to upload completed application documents and to provide a place for a dig digital signature to lock in your submission by the 1pm June 14th deadline so on that right hand side of the web page this is um you'll find all of these these documents linked and so here's here's a list of them again just so they're easier to read um they're all available on that right side of the website the exception is there is no template for the grip letter grip refers to the grid resilience and Innovation Partnerships program also from the iig that was a program where utilities and other entities could apply directly to the US Department of energy for very similar funding um but it's in a different section of the law also referred to or the section number is 4101c and sometimes the whole program is referred to that 40101 c just like our program is often referred to as 40101 D because that's the section in the law that derives the program if your utility has applied for funding under the grip program a letter is required giving a summary description of the project for review to the US for review by the US Department of energy and just a another reminder and a reference back to the schedule even after we have selected the projects we would like to put forward we have to submit all of those project details to the US Department of energy for their final approval before we can proceed with a performance agreement um and that's referenced back on the schedule but I just wanted to to mention that again here and that's it that's the whole summary so uh we can get to your questions now um I'm taking a look around for either raised hands if you want to come off mute and ask a question we also looking in the chat for um any questions we have so far so far no hands open and no chats hey yeah that's what I'm seeing as Chris we sit here in awkward silence we'll get that here we got a question so um are projects that integrate existing renewable generation into a micro grid with battery storage eligible for the program yes is the short answer the devil's always in the detail um and so we'd have to take a look at that the um the it would also have to be uh micro grid design specifically to support the resilience and reduce the effects of grid disruption um so as long as that was built into the design and planning of it um what's not allowed is New Generation so um if it's a so a micro grid um where the resilience generation is from solar um the solar aspects of that are not eligible funding but aspects of the micro grid would be great the next question is could you please repeat what is not allowed that you mentioned previously so I don't know if it's easier",

        "text": " is asking for is the unobligated from tranche want so not just tranche 2 but what's unobligated from tranche one what can be spent based on Treasury guidance for the critical facilities yeah it's not to say I want to do it that way I just need this is an option we're talking options at this time and what is that amount they're tranche too no unobligated they're going to come we'll know that on February 7th yeah all right and I have a question go ahead thank you Tanya could you speak to why is it unobligated or is that gonna be addressed that'll come to that meeting yeah commissioner if I I'd suggest we uh put your question in the parking lot because my answer is going to lead to additional questions from you and also board members I'm confident so we'll we'll make sure we Define what obligated and unobligated is relative to arpa at the February work fair enough thank you go ahead commissioner Rogers wild idea they don't even have to listen but I'd like you to play it through before February 6th because all of this Justice Center and law enforcement that that's for countywide benefit that isn't just for us and that's for everybody as I recall I think I asked you this was a little over 50 million dollars of Harper money that hasn't necessarily been committed I know you don't talk about that but there is and I know we've got a 24 date that we have to have everything committed by and some spend out what if we had a wild idea and we took All 48 million dollars out of arpa we took and had some interest rate to pay ourselves back meaning that forget the game share because I don't know if it's coming again that would just be a bonus and so we would pay back that 48 million dollars to the respective funds where I think you have in a separate fund and some reasonable interest rate two three and so what we would do is as we took uh through the years and got money we would just pay that debt back so it says paying 80 some million dollars of which about what 32 or 34 or whatever the number comes out of interest to a bank or investors would pay it to ourselves at a different rate so it'd be less I but we would obligate it for federal purposes and that's all we got to do been borrowed from ourselves pay it back to ourselves now we can certainly do an inner fund loan sure yep and so then it would be taken care of I appreciated why I was asking those specific questions on the contingency any it's kind of like building roads if you know what happens if they cost less who gets that any savings would come back to us obviously as a County it seems like if we could do a hybrid and uh get exactly where we want now some people say well why would you take our performance that doesn't benefits heck it doesn't I mean we're not none of the none of the cities have jails none of the cities have Harkins house I mean they're all depending on us to do that and they should be so why couldn't we take that 40 million to do it we're not worried you know get those contracts out through it the Harper fund or whatever you want to call pay ourselves back I'm being redundant pay ourselves back over some general fund amounts over the years and so what we have and that's the same except we money that we from ourselves could you put that option yeah we'll we'll put the options so what we'll come back with February is Clarity of what uh what if the 48 could we use arpa for under treasury guidance and so we'll come back with that option and potential options for execution of that the only other thing I would add in that option was a game share money would be committed to repay the loan to ourselves so we'd have that money coming in so if a game share doesn't come back then we haven't hurt ourselves I mean we it was just a source it does it helps pay the debt down now I understand it commits future boards but these projects are big I mean they're going to take a long time and there's probably more coming game chair no projects yeah you're right yeah that's the beauty of it in terms of it doesn't obligate future boards to the same degree no not law right so yeah that's that's my concern and I I appreciate that wild option I appreciate hearing about it because one of my concerns is to is I when I look at uh debt was more interesting to me than taking future revenues that doesn't mean all the way to the left but in that in that middle part and the reason being is it it feels cleaner in terms of what we have to do right now and as we move forward instead of obligating future leadership to uh a portion of their potential Revenue so so and I this option is really interesting to me as well might be wild but I just think it would work we'd get what we need to do I could I'd happen to alter cities on the basis Etc expenditure and we do need to pay it back because I mean these funds should be come back to the general that general fund should be getting money paying back into the art or whatever you tag and title it in the future I care so the pain or self-interest doesn't it sounds a little bit like Arbitrage and we're not doing that so but we can pay our self-interest oh there's not a Arbitrage only occurs at Bond issues right there yeah I get that but I think this I think uh state budget law says reasonable rate yeah so a reasonable rate is you know the the I mean one way to say is the amount we're referring in the pool well that'd be about 191 yeah but if you paid two or three I mean still it'd be half the payment well the purpose is the intent that's right and the recognition not necessarily the amount but okay so I'll add um another reason why I like the pursuit those the two options that you've laid out is well or part I do like but don't like I don't believe in counting your chickens before they hatch and we don't even have the eggs I think we have the chickens so uh we we don't have another gain share so I don't want us to be counting on something that flat out does not exist could be one thing if we were about to have a public hearing and Adoption of such a thing but we don't and so I think it's a Fool's errand for us to be counting on something we don't have I appreciate your putting it in there as a hopeful option but to me it doesn't feel uh but I do like the The Twist that commissioner Rogers put on that any future game share could be allocated to the repayment process there that that is not um assuming that it's going to be there it's it's potential yeah I will tell you one more thing I in this economy with this what's happening I for one would not feel real great about going out for a bonded right now and and then paying five percent we don't have to do it and if we could come up with an alternative well especially in light of the needs for you know we've some discussions already about expanded new courthouse uh expanded jail capacity let alone notion of espd and some of the other things that we will look to depend on I think when we go out for a levy that that impacts what they what what our other opportunities have been and the needs to stay the same we're still trying to get the cat capital investment Gap closed and making sure that we're well positioned for the operations of that so we don't want to over subscribe all of our tools all of our financing tools because your needs ahead very helpful for me and I will certainly learn more February 7th but I feel like we've got to get this figured out PDQ pretty darn quick in February March and the communication around what the needs are has been held with our municipalities correct oh yes I just want to make sure that yeah a jail posted tour I had gone over it with our Mayors uh happy to and I guess I wasn't so much asking you thank you but I was really asking the city managers and oh yeah yeah okay yes the city managers in addition to the police Chiefs that's great okay that's just such an important piece as you look forward we try to have some things in Canada and you do a great job at that I just wanted to make sure that it was brought forward that's great happy glad you asked keep asking so we don't forget thank you thank you keep up the good work thank you really appreciate what you're doing and I want to thank you for for the pre-work that you did with me and I assume others as well that really allowed me to be able to look at this and be clear about what my my thoughts were thank you so we're going to take a break and uh do you want a 15-minute break or a shorter break the next item doesn't it's supposed to just be a half an hour yes is call me ready if we if we'd be a little bit earlier than four o'clock or you're right let's call me ready uh at the ready or is he expecting four would suggest we take a break but 15 terrific thank you that topic is probably one of that's a good definition they're having are you ready there sir we are ready so call me did you hear our thank you earlier today oh that was so hard it was so exciting thank you all I appreciate same here feeling is mutual but you will find a ball and chain that we've installed it'll be fun it'll be all your favorite got a fuzzy lining yeah change is the only thing is constant okay well welcome back commissioner Rogers will join us uh shortly so hello Andrew hello call me at first I'd like to introduce Andrew Compton uh our new development manager the new China thank you very much welcome good afternoon Jay Harrington and Commissioners so I'm coming caliber housing director and with me is um I'm Andrew Crampton development manager all right so we are here to discuss the Metro affordable housing Bond and so this slide is just trying to see where we are now we've spent about 89 percent of the 116 million we were allocated and so we are course to meet or exceed all the go all the the goals we have just about two units to go on the overall seven units to go on the two and the 14 for the extremely low income the",

        "text": " set out today that the analysts are working with the public saying here are the tools we have Ava and how is the rest of being introduced I guess to to members of the public I'll I'll take the question I I think um you know once the aresta tool was created you know there was um some education and Outreach but I think it's been a while since we've done that and so um you know om car you know our new um operations and analyst you know who's largely doing process Improvement I I literally just had a conversation with her in the last couple of days saying you know maybe we should do you know some type of you know YouTube video you know to better explain how the tool works so I mean I think we can get you know you know sort of forget that you know this isn't you know something that people use all the time and they they should automatically know how to do it which is why I wanted to bring it up here today cuz and clearly people don't know don't understand you know the level of you know sophistication and the amount of layers that are in here and the things that you can do with it and you know definitely we have much more work to do on creating that education so you know we we put the link in the in the notice and I think that's valuable but there should be you know and we recognize that there should be a link to the the map but also probably a link to how to use that you know better better education better opportunities because it is a very sophisticated tool it has a lot of opportunities that was the whole well that was it was the military that paid for us you know for this and and they wanted it to for the purpose of being you know making sure people knew that there were you know important military assets that could be nearby that needed to be evaluated but we leveraged it for the purpose of getting this kind of data out there and so we do have a need to do better education and the reason I asked the question is when I heard um crer speak and um read the letter um that I knew the arest a tool was out there and so do they not have access to it and I knew it was public on the um and how that really played out for the public so I I think it would be good to pursue a tutorial of some kind yeah and and we think we need to come back also and have this on a council agenda item and just walk through you know some different sort of scenarios and how to utilize the data because I mean I think it's it's helpful for you council members to be able to go on here and you know and find information and and do some kind of you know work and Analysis on your own because it's available to you as well yeah I will say I have been out to it and it is somewhat daunting I mean yeah if you're not used to to working with it yeah I mean the value is it has a lot the problem is it has a lot you know it's just I mean the same thing you know that creates difficulties is it can be overwhelming because there's a lot of information in here and it does take a little while and if you're not you don't have a background you know with with GIS or mapping it's it's you know some of it's pretty intuitive but but some of it's not and I think some help uh is that's on our responsibility to kind of help bridge the gap for people just to Qui uh yes councelor berer um just I think it's a great resource and just even the topographic maps because so often you can't can't get a sense of where this place is um but the education piece will be just critical and having gone to the public information meeting in doofer that's probably not the right time in place to introduce the tool because it's too early um but then you don't want to wait until you know it's too late because then people aren't aware of the tools so an online tool that's fun and not daunting um is probably the way to go but um a I know I appreciate sort of sitting and watching somebody manipulate the tool so different people learn differently and it will take some exploration but it's it's a wonderful tool and if we can maximize the use of it I think it will alleviate some of the public frustration thank you okay 3:00 Council L do we need to um make a motion to address okay I need a motion who wants to move we heard one earlier that would work so coun this is counselor buyer um I move we um do not allow an extension of the 45-day comment period for the B2 H to um project um and retain the 45 DayDay comment period that ends on May 30th 2024 um my comment on that is that I appreciate um the time that it takes to review these but that Council has already or the department has already granted the 45-day period instead of the minimum 21 day period so do I have a second I sh conon um thank you um Cindy Cardon um for the record I second that motion then I'd like to discuss for a moment uh we've got a okay discussion so I just want to be clear so the 30th is the last day of the 45 day period right um and so if there was some concern still about the need for an extension could the party then bring It Forward on the 30th and ask for an extension for instance if the the tool that we've just been talking about that should be so helpful wasn't operating I mean that might be something to consider so there is another bite at the Apple um so it's all I have to say Okay um we've got a motion and second secretary esterson could you please call the rot Cindy Condon yes Katie Imes yes Anne berer yes Richard delin yes Perry choc toot yes and Kent how yes motion carries Mr chair okay I believe that completes today's uh meeting is is there anything for the good of the order a last minute thing to say oh yes yeah let's get it off happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday Todd and happy birthday to yeah speech no quick yeah okay with that uh the time is now 3:04 and the April 19th 2024 meeting of the energy facility sighting council is adjourned well done",

still none Nancy okay we'll the time is 10:27 and we'll close the uh public period the next item is the wheat wheat Rich renewable energy East request for Amendment one review of the draft proposed order Christopher Clark senior sighting analyst will have the floor I thank you thank you chair how members of the council for the record my name is Christopher Clark I am a senior sighting analist for the Department um as chair how just mentioned I'm here to talk about um weid renewable energy facility East and um assist the Council with your review of the draft proposed order for request for Amendment one I can get slide um thank you uh so I covered a lot of this material at the March council meeting uh so I'm not going to go over it in detail but feel free to stop me if you would like um but this request has been require uh processed under the type A Amendment review process which included a public hearing and public comment period uh which concluded on April 4th and we got certificate holder responses on April 8th um during my dis my presentation today I'm primarily going to be um focusing on the public comments received um rather than the other findings in the draft proposed order that we reviewed in March um as far as the remaining steps in the process um after we hear the council's feedback um we will issue our proposed order containing our uh recommendations on uh findings of of compliance with standards and conditions of approval um uh the type a review process allows for a possible contested case on the proposed order um and I'll just note that only those persons who raise a relevant issue in person uh on at the public Hearing in March or in writing by the comment deadline May participate or may request to participate in that contested case um and then if held the contested case would be overseen by a hearing officer appointed by the council um after the deadline for contested case hearing requests um has passed the or the contested case proceeding has included the council will then review the proposed order and issue your final order uh approving or denying the request for amended site certificate um I believe you're all familiar with most of the history of this um proceeding so um I'll just start with uh at the um March meeting we had the public hearing um and then the comment period for written comments closed on April 4th uh after that the council did leave the record open until the following Monday April 8th to get uh certificate fer responses which they provided on that date um so today then is your chance to review those comments and the DPO um and provide feedback on what you believe should be included in the proposed order um assuming uh there are no significant issues raised or anything nothing needs more time uh we would be expecting to issue that proposed order next Friday uh or next week I should say um prior to April 26th um if that deadline if that timeline holds uh then we would be looking at a deadline for contested case requests uh on May 27th um right before your May meeting which is scheduled for May 31st um at which is the earliest State the council can make its final decision just note that all of that is really contingent on um the discussion today as well as whether or not there's any contested case requests um after we issue our proposed order slide please um just as a brief reminder um the facility we're talking about today we Ridge East was originally approved as part of the Wheat Ridge Wind um and that facility was approved in 2017 and has subsequently been divided into four successor facilities Wheat Ridge 1 two and three and then Wheat Ridge East which we're discussing um Wheat Ridge East uh or Al uh was a separate turbine group to the east of the Wheat Ridge facilities uh connected to the main sight with a 31 mile transmission line um which actually if we go to the next slide see a map thank you um so you can see uh in sort of the northeast corner of the map on the slide are the wind micro sighting uh corridors and then the remaining um fordor going to the South and then the West is the interconnection transmission line Corridor that's a overhead 230 KV transmission line um this original facility was approved to include um 200 megaw of wind capacity as well 20 megawatts of battery storage capacity um within this 4582 Acre Site uh the site's located in both Morrow and County um the next slide please as you can see in rfa1 the certificate holder is requesting authorization to expand the site um this includes of a different couple types of expansions um and we got some comments that this wasn't entirely clear uh in the previous STP propos order so I'll try to um lay out how how we're intending to explain it in the proposed order but hopefully also give a better idea of what's Happening um so from that 4,582 acre approved Port approved site boundary which uh is the same as the micro sighting bors um currently the certificate holder um proposes to expand the site boundary out to the property uh lines of their lease boundaries for the facility and that would occur both in the approved portions of the site um to the north of butter Creek and then in these newly proposed areas uh to the South uh and along the old the approved transmission Bor route um I'll give the numbers in a minute but I just want to make sure that that's clear and that's represented by the dark purple line uh which goes out from the blue to the dark purple within that expanded sight boundary the certificate holder also requests to um expand their micro sighting corridors uh to accommodate up to 41 additional wind turbines um and that's reflected by light purple uh filled areas on the map um so in addition to expanding the site boundary and the micro sighting areas um the uh certificate holder would also be realigning the proposed transmission line Corridor around a new route um it's not entirely easy to see from this figure but most of the route does follow what was previously approved there's a little bit of a difference uh in the middle part of the site but most of the differences are on the western edge of the site where it's just the transmission Corridor and you can see those purple areas um as the transmission line approaches Highway 20 great um to break this down more numerically and if I could get the next please it's okay um this would include an increase in the site boundary area of approximately 74,400 Acres um and then an increase in the micro sighting areas by about 10,000 um and those are significant numbers and I just remind everyone on the council that this is Wind Facility so things are dispersed um so I did think it would be helpful to look at the actual disturbance Acres the um facility components as proposed in request for Amendment one would occupy about 165 Acres um that includes wind turbines and their Associated Footprints as well as the substations um and the uh uh transmission line Port poles um that's an increase of about 118 Acres over what was previously approved and it's about three and a half times more permanent dis disturbance area um as what was previously approved um there would also be an additional 635 Acres of temporary disturbance during construction of the facility um and that uh total 1, 121 Acres of temporary disturbance is the area that would need to be revegetated and stored after construction so that all makes sense and if I can get the next slide as far as the facility components themselves as I mentioned um the certificate holder proposing to add 41 uh new turbines the turbines would also be redistributed throughout the site so uh the they're not all I guess not only 41 turbines would be cited in the new areas um but this the facility would be kind of reconfigured with this new um total uh amount of turbines and a total of 300 megawatts of total name plate capacity um to accommodate the larger energy facility there's also changes to the related or supporting facilities um this the request for Amendment eliminates uh previously approved overhead collector lines the low or medium voltage 34.5 kilovolt collector lines and um expands the underlined Underground collection system uh as I mentioned the request uh proposes to realign the transmission line um that would go down from a maximum of 32 miles to a new 26 Mile route um that's located entirely within Morrow County um and then the access road system would be expanded uh to include 76 miles of permanent access roads within the site and then 15 miles of temporary access roads needed for construction of the um transmission line so next slide please okay um this slide shows the layout that was proposed in rfa1 um generally layouts are uh just proposed and they're provided for examples because micro sighting forers do allow for micro sighting flexibility after construction we do want to say or just mention that um we believe that this layout is should be fairly close to the final design um of at least portions of the facility since the certificate holder is planning on building or beginning construction um as soon as they can after the council makes your decision um just to point out a few features on this map I know it's not uh very easy to see but um there are are more than 107 yellow dots representing turbines on this map and that's because there are some alternate locations so not all of the turbine locations would be um constructed uh you can see the proposed transmission line carridor um reflected by a red line covered with uh little triangles going through the center of the site um and this is kind of helpful to see where the final alignment was proposed on the western side um it has been rerouted I think to avoid um both some agricultural features and then other energy uh facility development associated with the other wheat rdge um and uh you can't see it very awful but I do have other slides showing where the proposed substation sites are um so actually yeah if you can give me the next slide Nancy great uh yeah so uh as you can see there the site with the proposes change in RFA 1 would include two substation sites uh one on the the left side of the slide is north of uh of butter Creek uh sorry and uh that",

        "text": " these legislative slides because we already talked through a lot of it but this was just an effort to try to um take what the bill says and what we would need to do through 2024 to make it um so uh the last bullet is the one that is kind of up to the Commission in terms of when it thinks uh their an evaluation report needs to be done on the goals based on the best available science there is a minimum threshold but the commission also has the ability to provide a report as needed so that's why that one is in italics the rest are things that we would very much um we would be required to do and then also might need to have some conversations around in particular the um the fourth bullet the discussion of regular agency reporting and review of reports that something that came up in the road map and uh wasn't fully defined and might need some more conversation with the commission about frequency and what the structure is obviously leveraging existing uh reporting that the agencies are doing and not trying to reinvent the wheel there and then uh a big bucket of work uh potentially coming with uh SB 530 um again we walked through these earlier so I'm not going to go through each component of them but there's um things that will require Consultants to help with and then there are reports that were required to do potentially rule makings um determinations around funding allocations and of course uh continuing to support and um helping appoint natural working lands advisory committee so taking all of that there's a lot of work to do just um potentially in what we have in statute and then or what may be coming in statute and then there are these policy topic Focus areas that I've heard through uh chair McDonald's and others that folks wanted to dive into one is climate impacts covering some of the most recent uh science that has come out around climate change and then also uh the work of the ocean acidification and oxia Council which has been very involved in doing great work on mitigation and adaptation efforts another bucket that um folks have expressed interest in is energy planning uh generally energy decarbonization planning uh the state energy strategy that uh commissioner um director Benner uh mentioned during the conversation on the climate pollution reduction Grant work um and then all the integrated resource plans and clean energy plans that uh are coming out around HB 2021 and the overlap with those with the climate Protection Program implementation uh to round out that topic area uh somewhat related was uh interest in talking about renewable energy citing um the orisa project that uh the department of energy did has been done but there was interest in getting a report and a Showcase of some of the technical abilities that that project provides for folks who are interested in renewable energy sighting talking about transmission and then also the national working lands interface with renewable energy sighting and then uh there's particular interest in transportation sector emissions and strategies so uh talking about progress on the Statewide Transportation strategy and the transportation emissions dashboard that um ODOT and a number of other agencies work together on that uh came out earlier this year and talking a little bit more about the every mile accounts work that has been done through the multi-agency partnership there then the last two that we had uh one was talking about the building sector emissions and strategies uh we heard earlier today about the buildings the legislative buildings package that may be coming and there's just uh hasn't been as much attention on building sector emissions and strategies at at this level and so there's um interest in continuing that to have that conversation and to be able to uh dig into it a little bit more there are a number of recommendations in the roadmap related to buildings related items as well that could benefit from having more conversation with a commission and uh the last one but certainly not least is equity um the commission was really strong during the road map conversation around uh wanting to understand um the Equitable um benefits and impacts of uh climate actions and to explore those a little bit more and there's efforts underway at the city state agency level to develop an environmental justice mapping tool so um there's a lot to be able to discuss and and dig in on there more and then of course other there's probably many other topics that folks are interested in so just uh put that bullet there to say that this is not an exhaustive list at all and um we can add and subtract and prioritize as needed so I'm just gonna end here with some resource considerations to tee up then the discussion which is um we're potentially looking so right um you know we're currently staffed with 0.3 FTE there's a potential for four new full-time positions related to the work that we talked about in the legislative side and so Staffing is a question about you know how much staff will end up with which then plays into how much we can do or not moving forward or how we need to there's also um a number of Contracting needs uh related to the um the forecast of emissions and some of the natural working lands related items and again uh some of that is dependent upon uh how the legislative session shakes out and then if um SB 522 passes the commission may be expanding and so there may be some uh there'll probably be some onboarding and need to integrate folks into the work and also potentially provide some room for new priorities from the voices that are coming into the commission and so those are kind of big picture things that um would affect our ability to carry out the work and to what scope and scale we can do the work so just planting that seed and there may also be other considerations which we would love to share from you all so with that um think would love to open it up to discussion these are the you know questions that we thought of but there's probably others and maybe just uh before diving and if there's something that uh folks wanted to connect on about the climate pollution reduction grants um just because we didn't have a chance to field questions on that well exactly first step I we kind of I forgot to call for any clarifying questions maybe just password clarifying questions from what Zach just presented if if folks have questions from from that presentation and then we then I think we can go and see what the if there are questions on the grant any clarifying questions and again oh there we go commissioner sure um so Zach in you know you had a very long list of of topics um of potential interest to the I mean some of those are topics that you know um I could see the commission digging in on maybe producing recommendations work research you know work of subcommittees others you know sound more like this would be a good agenda item to have the right people or you know organizations come in and present on is there a way in in the discussion we can sort of distinguish between the two because obviously the resource needs and and everything are going to vary widely you know considering that's a great Point commissioner Sharon you know something that I think we should give more thought to as we build out a draft for review um and and then as I was looking at this um I think we don't want to necessarily duplicate although there might be times when duplication would make sense but we don't want to decision making and recommendation development that would be happening in other parts of state government for example you know thinking through the IRP that are submitted that's more maybe a focus on the topic of is there are there lessons learned that we would want to think about as we developed complementary recommendations if that makes sense but I'm not sure about it yet and I'm getting an echo um so um but Zach if you've got if you want to add to that please do I think that's great and a good point commissioner Sharon thanks and I think um you know to the to the extent folks want to weigh in on how to balance that now and uh would be great and we can also um give some more thought to it too well since I started the thread and and I think uh you know uh the chair was sort of you know uh heading there I mean there are some of these for which you know there could potentially be duplication of efforts so you know for example the irps and the ceps clearly that Authority rests with the Oregon Public Utility Commission very extensive processes guidelines and rules in place and so that would be a great example of one where it's like you know having utilities come in and present on that work and explain it and um uh you know for informational purposes would be great but um certainly not replicating the work through the global warming commission or creating parallel processes that would be confusing for stakeholders because you know there's already a process of place where you know those stakeholders are are intended to participate to effectuate the outcomes of the IRP and the clean energy plan yeah a really great point I in my mind it's would be you know honoring kind of that first recommendation in the road map which is how can we make sure that the policies and programs that are already in place are operating as well as they can and you know Gathering any Lessons Learned through those other processes that that you know might inform um how we educate folks or might inform you know as I said kind of complementary recommendations I think would be the way I'd want to see that Focus other uh director Bateman thank you on that note I think related um I would hate for the work of the um the interagency work that was completed uh recently to get lost in in Translation so we have the climate change adaptation framework which is you know not only a response to climate changes but also you know feeds back in and helps with mitigation as well um when it's seen all the way through and we have um you know more than a dozen I think it's 18 or maybe 21 state agencies that worked on this together um and and as have and has a really nice series of recommendations in it so maybe a featuring that or presentation on what's in there might be helpful as well but I think it goes to not duplicating effort and making sure that we've gone back and picked up some really good ideas that are already on the table my cat has joined the meeting I'm sorry um you know one of the discussions that's come up from time to time from that staff interagency staff group is you know is the global warming commission a place to kind of hear that integrated and identify needs because there might not be",

        "text": " do that do you guys have any questions about that where what we've done this last year council member buer chair gr um when I listened in on the Lexington public hearing one of the comments was about the Drone from batteries associated with storage for solar so just want to make sure that that's considered as part of the noise update I think in 2004 we probably didn't account for that it may just be background noise um I I don't know but since that comment was raised it's probably important to have um a noise analysis or measurement of of that kind of constant noise which yeah absolutely so just to be clear the uh the carve out sort of so to speak for the wind rules did not like negate the need for analysis for wind turbines uh and nor will it negate the need for noise analysis for solar projects it's just a it's just a change from the base assumptions in terms of like the noise floor uh for the ambient noise and uh I don't know if you want to speak to anything more beyond that yeah there's really um so there are sort of two thresholds related to noise um for any any industrial facility kind of in a sort of a new area and the first is that you can't um either you can't exceed 10 DVA above what the current um Baseline is and then the second is there table that there's a maximum not to exceed um because it has public health and safety impacts so the what the wind um change did was it allowed for the applicant to use an assumed Baseline um and then that way they didn't have to spend as much time you know and money doing um upfront work so they could use the assumed and then if they're um go above 10 DBA from that Baseline one they're either precluded from doing that and this is related to a noise sensor receptor so house a school you know a church something within proximity um and so that that modeling is desktop versus um on site um there still has to be you know actual modeling later on but in that sort of front end they can use the assumed DBA and then you either can't go over 10 you know increase it by 10 or if you do you have to get a waiver from the landowner that waiver process could be the land owner doesn't care they're fine or they request new glass new insulation some sound wall something to mitigate the the impacts but but that ability for the landowner who's going to be impacted can negotiate whatever it is that they're interested in to ensure that um and then um so it's really that two things that using that assumed DBA Baseline and then that waiver process proc that only exists currently for wind because that was it the specific carve out that Tom's referring to so our proposal is to make that same those same elements applicable to solar um a solar panel does not create noise but the inverters the Transformers the electrical lines the battery storage 100% those make noise and in most circumstances that we've seen you know in solar projects those exceed those not to exceed maximum thresholds at the point source that doesn't mean that they're NE necessarily impacting you know adjacent um noise sensitive receptors because of attenuation by distance you know that goes down but it means that that needs to be evaluated um because the location of houses you know you know can be in close proximity to some of these facilities so so again the base idea is it's worked for wind um it doesn't doesn't remove any standards or requirements um it just allows for some more flexibility uh for the for the developer of the project um and then um one other element is you know these are not Council rules as you're aware they're the Environmental Quality commission at the Department of Environmental Quality rules so we may be the only ones implementing these days I don't know um but the you know because this is not your rulemaking we're not asking you to have this on the list we you know have um had a conversation with the EQ they're interested moving forward but what they said is hey we haven't implemented these rules in 20 years or something so you know you have the experience this is really more oriented towards you know your stakeholders so while they are going to be the decision makers we're going to be doing much of the leg work um and you know a lot of it was done before we're not CH we're not proposing anything really any different than what the wind rules say so it shouldn't take much um substantive work on our part but it will take some sort of procedural effort on our part that's why we want to make you aware of it because you know even though it's I would say probably hopefully minimal it's still going to take some time and so you know that's going to be primarily Tom's time so that does um remove his ability to work on some other things at the same time CH Grail just to follow up yes so thank you that explains that it's sort of A Safe Harbor for the developer um the Baseline measurement um and then I think these are the standards we applied for the transmission line for correct okay okay so yeah it's the same it's the same overall standards that apply to any facilities whether it's wind or solar or uh transmission lines or any type of facility the only difference is based on those 2004 changes which are only applicable so this is to update to apply to solar and thank you for doing the work of an agency yeah council member pan thank you chair gr just a question and um came up in B2 discussion as well with when we noise the noise standard seems to be directed at human um impact is there any analysis done I don't think it's in the standard at all um for wildlife not explicitly but implicitly um so you know this standard is for sort of you know either new industrial uses on you existing industrial locations or you know nonc currently industrial locations so creating you know a new kind of big um you industrial use and what's that impact and it is primarily oriented towards and it's not Construction in its operation primarily in fact exclusively oriented towards um you know impacts to you know people um we have noise is is an issue that is evaluated in protected areas in Recreation so those AR those don't have to meet the DEQ noise rules they're just hey what's going to happen with this project is it going to impact a protected area that part of that protected area is related to you know keeping the noise down we look at that we look at that same thing for recreation um implicitly you know that also would be an issue for wildlife so that would be part of the evaluation on the fish and wildlife habitat standard there's nothing in there that says that but if you're creating big booming noises you know in a particularly sensitive location that is for whatever reason sensitive to noise that will be part of the evaluation you know of that impact to um the habitat thank you chair gr Vice chair how one one last quick question is this going to be a DEQ noise rule or is it an FC rule um thanks Vice chair how uh yes DEQ only so it's currently only a DEQ noise Rule and that's why this case it would be either the director um or the Environmental Quality commission making changes should they agree with these rules so we've you know we you FC has been implementing their rules as your noise standard for a long time we did look um early on could we create our own noise rules um that created a lot of complexities and problems because the DEQ noise rules don't go away they are directive um in statute and if you created your own noise rules um we would either have to go back and have DEQ through the statute make reference to that and create the carveout for us and then create our own new set of rules related to all of these uh and so we did look at that as an option but essentially all of it goes back to DEQ so you know the idea was even if we wanted to do our own thing we would first have to make that resolve through DEQ otherwise we had DEQ noise rules and fsec noise rules and there was any kind of conflict um you know the initial assessment was the DEQ noise rules have more Authority because they come out of Statute yours would are do not would not come out of Statute they would only come out of your your ability to create rules public health and safety that is generally your Authority through statute but not specifically noise so the resolve was really what are we trying to get to most of our projects are solar these wind sort of carve s have worked well for a long time let's just do this in a very surgical Manner and just make this you know applicable to just solar is what we're primarily seeing right now so that was but we did a a pretty significant amount of research to come to that conclusion yeah quick followup yes um are we adopting the rule or we making a recommendation to DEQ and they'll adopt it just DEQ okay yeah so I'm working with uh some folks over at DEQ um they're essentially doing they're doing a lot of the procedural stuff too so we are sort of acting as subject matter experts on this R making and then we're working together to actually get it out the door but then they'll be DQ will be the ones approving the rules any more questions expecting so much feedback on that one uh okay uh next slide did she get for doing so well on the previous agenda item I know okay so here's the uh here's the exciting slide this is proposed projects for 2024 and you'll note uh this is a substantial list given the number of projects we completed last year but we are going to just you know do our very best to get out as much role making uh work as we possibly can um pending sort of as you see here we basically have racks for all of them so that's sort of the kind of main factor in my mind in terms of the ability to actually uh accomplish this work or at least get it started in 2024 depending on how far down this list you go um so um you can see them here but I'm going to go through them one at a time so let's go ahead and go to the next slide so starting with the uh site certificate uh Amendment rle making uh we sort of pitched this last year to be on the 2023 schedule it it is you know sort of pushed to the end of of of last year we started on the",

        "text": " construction related uh projects listed in our Capital Improvement plan you've heard some of that this evening the solicitation was released on December 7th and closed on January 24th there was one responsive proposal and because of this our procurement and contracts Department reviewed the process and determined that the lack of response was not due to anything that was actually within chariots control just the vendors decided for whatever reasons they even opted not to so we did proceed under the single bid there were six primary projects of varying complexity complexity and stages and those are the bus stop Improvement plan which we'll be renaming to the accessibility Improvement plan the South Salem Transit Center the deltweb facility and gate security improvements the Del Webb service room construction the compressed natural gas fueling replacement station a reconfiguration of the ch2 office fifth floor and future projects that'll be identified through our CIP process and future Grant and funding opportunities as we move forward so with this contract with Matt McDonnell we will have access to a dedicated project manager assistant project manager contract administrator and several engineering leads along with some clerical assistance along with gaining colleagues and contacts who will be subject matter experts in our building and construction fields which really is invaluable to us as an agency so partnering with a vendor that specializes in complicated navigation techniques is really imperative to the success of this project planning and implementation and project management must be done concurrently to ensure that we are making adequate progress and managing cost increase the longer projects that the more they potentially can cost our project manager for Matt McDonnell along with Associated staff will be providing some of the same some of the following Services Clockwork property negotiations and Process Management oversight and engineering and design phases the National Environmental Protection act or NEPA compliance all matters related to the Americans with this Disabilities Act prevailing wage monitoring documentation construction closeout and really a myriad of other tasks that they'll be helping us with excuse me I'm getting dry so a lot of our most of these projects are funded through uh quite the Menagerie of Grants with local funds covering the match these grants used for these projects are from federal sources ODOT funds Statewide Transportation Improvement fund discretionary and formula funds most of these projects are included in our adopted budget in the capital program section and these projects will be carried forward as you'll see coming up at the budget hearing very soon so staff recommends that the board authorize the general manager to execute a contract with McDonald LLC for project management service for a four for a four base year and three one-year contract extension for an amount not to exceed one million six hundred and eighty seven thousand dollars and with that I'll answer any questions you may have any questions director holmstrom yes thank you uh very much so first of all I'm happy to see that there's uh provision made for potential future projects here so we're giving ourselves a little bit of flexibility for some future things and I'll see a couple ideas in there I think that lines up with what president David supposed to talk about earlier too so that looks good to me um I just had a question about and I'm sure there's a very reasonable answer here to the South Salem Transit Center and some of the work that's listed here my understanding is that we already have pivot architecture under contract to do some of this work yes I imagine it's all figured out who's doing what and there's no conflict there right there's not so it's very clear everyone's role pivot has a very specific role with regard to design and architecture and uh so think of it this way so Matt McDonald serves as basically the employee representative so he will represent our interest chariot's interest in managing the project and making sure things are tasks are getting done milestones and deliverables so and we here at Jerry is me at this point we'll be making sure that that happens that's sort of how that relationship works thank you director Carney thank you president um I have a question about well some of these projects um are kind of one and done right South Salem Transit Center is a big one but it's just one um but something like bus stop Improvement is iterative and ongoing um and both require different levels of Engagement with the community and especially those that are going to be um directly and our neighbors things like that how does McDonald kind of integrate with that aspect of our capital projects sure so uh Ron why don't you come on up and let me talk a little bit about that Ron makes it much more seamless because we had some some of the packages already in process but as far as the community most of the time you know we get the the locations from the planners but when there's issues like parking removal things like that we'll send somebody to the neighborhood association to talk to people I think you know and you you met one of our project managers at one of them and kind of talk them through what what the needs are as far as planning the locations you know that gets handed handed to us but but we will be involved with the Chariots on on the needs for the site planning manager French do you have something to add oh okay director Kearney um and just kind of thinking through that engagement piece um how easy or difficult would it be for your team or your staff to handle a situation where somebody only spoke another language exclusively would we be able to engage with that group yes we have multiple people in our office that can handle different languages I have a assistant project manager that is very fluent in Spanish she was the one that handed out flyers you know construction notices that way if there was any questions you can answer that and I've done that too Within so if we do run into it then we know ahead of time we'll make sure that person out there but if we do run into it and that person outside doesn't have that skill we'll get somebody there super thank you director Duncan I feel like I asked this question a lot so I apologize for those of you who are tired of hearing it but um we have very specific populations that usually attend our neighborhood associations and there are quite a few populations that just really do not attend rather because and a lot of those have to do with age but also sometimes has to do with the type of jobs that they're holding people that have you know evening work schedules usually can attend do you guys have other methodologies that you're able to use in order to contact people aside from just those in-person groups and how do you use those to reach these different populations well personally I've I don't remember what neighborhood association was it's like Chemeketa I went out after six o'clock and did the Flyers and talked to the individual people about what the impacts were you know they want to know what they could tell on the construction is going to take and and why do we need to take a parking and we explain that to them so we do do it after hours to catch these people at do you have any digital Outreach uh we in the past project um chariots handled the digital part they would give us the Flyers door hangers those kind of things and then we provide those but we can do that if we need to yeah I just wanted to add on so uh irrespective of the fact that we have Matt McDonnell that does not absolve us from still communicating and attending uh neighborhood association meetings I think I'm going to one here in a couple of weeks so uh it really is a partnership so it's not solely the responsibility of uh of the vendor well that sounds great thank you thank you other questions I have a question for uh UW general manager Trimble so obviously we've worked with Mount McDonald in the past from all I've heard wonderful reviews I'm excited to prove this contract but it it appears to me that there could be some efficiencies by bringing additional project management in-house and on this list of projects here you know the the future projects line in my mind could be quite large and so could you maybe talk through some of the philosophy behind obviously we're committing to this for the duration but at the expiration of this contract at what point does it tip to where okay no it makes sense we now have the scale to and the the consistent flow of capital projects Capital there's another term that uh manager kid used capital I forget show Capital purchases purchases thank you uh yes uh where it makes sense to bring this in-house so one of the things and thank you president Davidson so one of the things that we're looking at is we are actively recruiting for a capital excuse me a um Chief project and a pre oh my goodness what is that Chief Planning and Development officer made up the title I forgot about it um so looking at competencies and skill sets that that individual would have to help offset uh some of these things and some of it really is Project Specific so you know the more things we do the better we are at sort of understanding how to do them um the you know the more things we build the more we understand so it's at some point there's some you know economies of scale and scope that that would sort of engage in those processes so you know what's great about having mat McDonald or agencies like McDonald as they have this sort of cafeteria of of other people that they can bring in where those were direct employees of the district it would be sort of quite costly and you know we're not primed we don't build Bridges and we don't build roads and infrastructure so we don't do that many uh you know maybe in the future as we look down the road and start planning some of these other things but that's how I would categorize it so we will get some of that with the new uh with the new Chief but um but I think there will always be a need to have a partnership uh with uh with at least Mount McDonnell for the next seven years should this be approved and but uh vendors uh of the like great thank you very much other questions okay see no questions who would like to make a motion director Duncan I move the board authorized the general manager to execute a contract with Mott McDonald LLC for project management services for a four-year base term and three one-year contract extensions for an amount not to exceed one million six hundred and eighty seven thousand second we have a motion in a second any seeing no discussion all those in favor please say aye aye aye any opposed I no opposition motion passage unanimously thank you very much next we'll uh hear about the battery electric",

Health she is at the session as power grid issues are of concern to the health and well-being of people in her region Central and Eastern Oregon and hearing more about the just general resiliency Thomas elzinga at Central Electric Cooperative uh interested in where the program is going and how CEC can take advantage of the funds with shovel ready Christine Golightly from Columbia River intertribal Fish Commission Michelle Detweiler a renewable hydrogen Alliance in Portland interested in improving grid resilience and how hydrogen specifically can be a solution for that Dean and Jack from the Columbia Basin Electric Cooperative interested in grant tip note uh David Evans Association looking to learn how they can support Co-op clients apply for funding opportunities Dave Modell from Energy Trust of Oregon um interested in community energy resilience Federal funding and Clean Energy Solutions and bayoair from Energy Trust of Oregon interested in community energy resilience I know we have one additional participants the wrong map manager of stakeholder policy and engagement for Pacific Corps I'm super thrilled to be here so thanks for having me thank you all oh we have one more Amy schlesser with Odo uh policy analysts interested in intersection between Community energy resilience grid modernization and clean energy transitions thank you all yeah all right then I think at this time we'll pass it over to Emily who's joining us virtually today to provide a quick refresher on iija in 401d funding good morning everybody before I jump in can everybody online and in the room hear me and her okay she had a new herself okay it's it sounds like folks online I think we are having we are having trouble hearing you in on the in-person session I don't know if anyone virtually is okay okay I might need to unmute Emily we can hear oh so maybe we need to unmute one of ours so that we can I apologize in advance if this causes so you'll probably have to put your name you probably have to put your computer's volume all the way down maybe mine is now muted okay can anyone but are we here Emily and Castine can you hear me in the room okay thanks Emily yay love technology good morning everybody so happy to be here with you guys virtually um and uh we will jump into the meat of this conversation in just a little bit and talk about you know equity and those Community benefits and um of course the scoring criteria that we really want your input on but just to give a really quick refresher on where this funding came from um the program was funded under the infrastructure investment in jobs act also known as the iija and the piece of legislation includes 62 billion dollars for the U.S department of energy to deliver a more Equitable clean energy future for the American people by investing in American manufacturing and workers expanding access to Energy Efficiency and clean energy for families communities and businesses delivering reliable clean and affordable power to more Americans and building the Technologies of tomorrow through clean energy demonstrations and the purpose of the fund specifically for the 40101d formula grant is going to be outlined by the department of energy to improve the all hazards resilience of the electrical grid against disruptive events generate the greatest Community benefits and reducing the likelihood and consequences of those disruptive events Advance the department of Energy's Equity environmental and energy Justice priorities including the justice 40 initiative which we'll talk a little bit more about a little bit further down the road here and invest in America's Workforce all right and the application was due um they've pushed the timeline a couple of times it was due to the Department of energy on May 31st 2023 for the first two allocations of funds under the federal program we have already submitted our application that was submitted on April 18th and you can see our um the link to our our application is on our website if you're interested in reading more about that under the program States tribes and territories apply directly to the federal government once awarded these Grant recipients can then run processes to issue sub Awards to entities eligible as sub-recipients such as electric grid operators electricity storage operators electricity generators transmission owners or operators distribution providers and fuel suppliers Odo is the state agency that will apply for receive and administer these funds and it is odo's intent to focus on electrical thank you and although this legislation contemplates allocations over five years the US Department of energy intends to issue the first and second allocations of funding at the same time accounting for the extended application deadline that they gave us so the first two allocations for the state are listed on the slide there both a little less than 10 million dollars and as I mentioned we'll get both of those allocations at once in this first funding round and we're required to pass 95 percent of these funds through to our sub-grantees program does have two match requirements first the state or tribes are required to provide a match of 15 percent and then secondly our sub-grantees will be required to provide a match as well which would be at a rate of either one hundred percent or one-third depending on their electricity sales in the previous year so that's just a little refresher and now I will pass it back to the room for Rob gilmar to take it from here thank you Emily so photo began work on this program last summer and developed the draft program narrative focused solely on Wildfire mitigation which was presented at a public hearing last and we've done a lot of listening since then including a request for information that we shared with utilities in December and another public Hearing in March and the result was a final program narrative submitted in April that was significantly different from our original draft in August primary changes to the narrative include expanding eligible measures to address all natural hazards and not just increasing the funding allocation to small consumer owned utilities removing the maximum award cap for small utilities and proposing some flexibility in how communities to find defined disadvantaged populations and this is just a good time to note that the narrative that we submitted went into doe and they have an opportunity to come in to get back to us before the final program is approved by Doe so in a waiting order which we hope to get later in summer here's a budget summary showing the carve outs in terms of percentage of sales and also in dollars and so you see the approximately 20 million dollars that comes to us for the first two years of funding according to Federal requirements we would need to spend at least 25 percent of this with small utilities because that's the share of customers that they serve in Oregon however we propose upping this to 40 percent of the funds because of the unique channel is the small utilities base for the procuring federal funds and also with vastly distributed Distribution Systems that results in about seven and a half million dollars in this first round first of all utilities again we've removed the cap and we're hoping for somewhere around 10 projects in this first round and so if you do the math that's somewhere around you know 750 000 per award on average we could do more with less you know funding per utility or we could BPO with large rewards but wait and see what comes into the program um and so that leaves about 13 million dollars for the investor of Utilities in their pot of money so absolutely they narrative also included in a program objectives including mitigating risks associated with natural positives delivering benefits to disadvantaged communities maximizing Community benefits associated with these projects and finally operating under a continual Improvement model to ensure that the program continues to fund the best projects in future years so that gives us flexibility to workout program design as we go this is a list of eligible activities in the group science grant program it includes a lot of the sort of bread and butter reliability projects the utilities have to do just to keep the lights on you know utility poles undergrounding monitoring and control Technologies um you'll see about two-thirds of the way down there's an asterisk next to some distributed energy resources including microgrids and batteries that is included in the list it's included in the federal eligible projects but I put an asterisk next to it because these are not the types of projects that we really want to focus on we have other funds for supporting microgrids and batteries and so we really want to focus more on those you know vegetation management to Natural Hazard mitigation projects and finally at the bottom of the list are what's not included in this program that includes new generations such as solar and also cyber security and again those have different funding screens associated with them so not in this so I know we have a couple of questions here just to kind of um you know in terms of what you're most interested in on these eligible measures I think what might be helpful is if you go back to that slide and just get any thoughts and reactions or answer any questions that you have and similarly in the chat if you want to comment on these or have any questions that you want to ask feel free to put it in the chat we'll watch where I will try to bring it up in conversation as well yeah I do have a common Channel um that it's around microgrids and other you say you know say that those are and I certainly want to say is that those are in the Federal uh grants that we go after which is true um those grants are highly competitive The Residency grants uh national competition as you know there were seven to ten Across the Nation so you know one of the strategies that we took you know when we looked at what's eligible for funding under these the resiliency grants and things that we're talking about undergrounding of uh electrical lines and some of these other things are very expensive we put those into a large National Grant award because it we just can't do much for the states on so we're going to get you know exposure to limited dollars if you have 10 million a year um well I think we can do microgrids for emergency resilience centers and and critical equipment and stuff like that with with the funds um so that that's the strategy we're taking that you know what can we do with the state funds and make an impact versus what could we do with the federal funds that make an impact so um you know that's probably what we're going to submit uh for this event that some of our like I said the larger prior qualifier protection things",

        "text": " jason okay um you know this is kind of a format for anybody who's in the march meeting that we're just repeating for this meeting um these numbers that you'll see throughout kind of these um introductory slides where i refresh on the key topics that we're going to talk about and that we receive feedback on they correspond to the prompting question document that the department put together early on um back in the beginning of the year and so if for folks that wanted to follow along or want to refresh on the complete kind of list of questions that link's available for folks to uh to to click on um via the pdf of the slide deck that's available on the website that richard just pointed out um and then and then yeah this one only had basically one big question with a few you know strands of questions bundled into it but it was basically you know asking folks how do they expect floating offshore when to contribute to to these 100 clean energy targets so these were the themes from the comments that we heard um i'll probably just kind of paraphrase these um and not necessarily read them all for everybody but um it's almost just easy just to read through them floating off your wind is going to be critical to meet oregon's clinicals studies that i kind of just referenced in addition to other studies they do show this tremendous scale of gigawatts necessary to meet those targets and that offshore one can contribute um floating offshore wind can balance with solar um so we saw those maps where solar and wind are available on the west western landscape and they kind of balance each other out they specific some some folks specifically noted the ability to um contribute energy during the winter peak season here in the pacific northwest but when our heating loads increase and our solar kind of disappears and the days get shorter flooding offshore one could also be part of the solution to help oregon and surrounding states meet their clean energy and climate goals and some amount of floating offshoring can play a role assuming minimal impacts to the environment and ocean ecology then we have a few other ones floating after it represents a great replacement resource a gigawatt scale for regional fossil fuel and hydro projects that may be retired this gets back to it's called capacity credit um capacity factor is another term they're kind of related but different but they generally show um you know when resources are available to meet meat load and produce energy so floating offshore wind has high values and i think that's why the comparison is made to fossil fuel and hydro projects because they're also available many hours of the day um floating offshore wind is projected to serve a diversity role in economy-wide decarbonization so i think people um are in agreement with kind of the studies that have been done in the studies that i also uh referenced in the draft literature review load growth and use electricity so that's that's the electrification pieces i talked about earlier and then floating off sherwin in the ocean offers benefits to optimize the amount of land used for solar and wind development on land so that's another kind of key feature for offshore wind is it gives us kind of a not only a new energy tool but a new place for that energy tool that's different than how we've currently approached building energy projects in the past so that's that's kind of a quick wrap up of uh really the common themes i mean we got probably other feedback um on that topic that maybe wasn't seen on that on that slide deck but um a lot of the stuff overlapped and i tried to capture as much of the things that you know people are constantly hitting on in their comments for everybody's benefit here great thanks jason this is uh the opportunity that i mentioned for additional input on this topic so like i mentioned we've kind of gone through different we have identified different topics for today's meeting we're trying to focus the feedback on those topics i know that some folks are sort of tuning in and out based on which topic we're on in the agenda so we're trying to keep to that as much as possible knowing that we're continuing to welcome written feedback on all of the topics on our portal so if you have ideas here for additional input information or perspectives that differ from the feedback that jason just synthesized on clean energy targets or if you would want to emphasize a certain part of that we've heard some emphasis just on the sheer scale in the chat for example that the modeling shows maybe would be needed to meet um the the clean energy and climate change um requirements in the state if you have um topics for future study or engagement on 100 clean or other thoughts we really would welcome that in the chat or um in uh in by raising your hand so i'll we'll just pause here for a bit to give people a chance to think not seeing any rays oh i think uh i see a raised hand from harvey harvey i think you've been unmuted go ahead with your question or comment yeah i got some comments i i sent an email to jason yesterday because i had there was a technical glitch i couldn't get my comments in but i just want to uh i got received that report they sent me a link on that and an nrel report technical report on the uh the wind generator tower and with its configuration of the dimensions the mass it's i would say it's a feat of engineering i can say that uh my comments and i sent some um technical literature about this and my comments is you're out in the middle of the ocean uh you're exposed to uh storms the wind speeds can get over 100 miles an hour you've got a real long i think it's like almost 474 feet if i got that correct 32 foot diameter you got this long slender column i i think you need to look at a way and i said i sent jason some technical literature about this uh ways to reduce the drag forces on the that column uh turn especially the storm because that that wind drag can push that thing over plus uh wave the impact forces those maybe 30 40 foot waves on that structure can push it over and it may uh i don't know what your anchoring system is maybe you're going to have to do a very good design anchoring system according to that report that uh colin weighs three million pounds so you could push that over uh i was suggesting maybe look you look into putting uh either grooves on the column the skin to reduce the drag reduction i think there was one technical report you can reduce it says uh it was a journal of fluids you could reduce they had a reduced drag from uh from a smooth cylinder using grooves a lot on the skin the other thing to watch out for and i saw that and i mentioned this to jason's and my email is that uh there was an example there's a in england there was a company built it was a chemical plant they put in installed a 300 hot foot high cracking tower it was 20 foot diameter i believe on the base 300 feet uh they installed it and it was a 30 mile an hour wind and it had a resonance frequency they called vortex shedding and it started popping six inch diameter bolts on the base that was bolted to a concrete foundation and they had to put a crane in to stop it and the reason why there was a 12 inch and six inch pipe on the outside of the this column otherwise it was smooth that caused a resonance section uh condition or a vortex shedding and that caused it to uh vibrate and uh popping those bolts you know uh so what i'm saying is you to be very careful i'll do a wind tunnel very carefully design this thing to make sure you don't hit a resonance frequency because that could uh seriously uh do serious damage to your yeah it's uh quite a if you can pull this off it's quite a engineering feat i think you're going to need to do a lot of design to make sure that the platform the support platform is stable uh if you're using ballast you might want to put it ballot uh baffles to make sure that the ballast doesn't see water doesn't slosh around adding to this rocking motion so you gotta be very careful about that design and it was gonna be quite an engineering um feat to be able to do that but uh i really i think that that nrel's report is excellent i really uh it's a very good report but this is a massive structure so we need to i would suggest a wave tunnel away wind tunnel and wave wave tank studies to be done before you do their final design and that's my main comment on that that's great um i i'm sorry about the technical issues and i'm glad that you got in touch with um jason it's almost like the um comments that you made were just uh totally ready for the next topic in which we actually have folks from nrel on the line um to speak to some of those topics um i see patrick from nrel i think has his hand up if you want to respond briefly patrick and then maybe reserve the bulk of the discussion for for that topic um go ahead patrick yep you can hear me great uh yeah i think those are all very important considerations in the the design process both for the turbine itself and for the floating substructure there are a number of different companies and engineering firms and and standards agencies like the international electrotechnical commission which have a set of established design standards for offshore wind turbines and floating offshore wind turbines that are informed by many of the concerns that you described thank you great and i think we're going to hear a little bit more about some of those topics um later in the agenda so looking forward to that um thank you very much um i wanted to just review some of the things in the chat as well um the uh there has been a good discussion about transmission uh so i'll just mention that has been continuing as well as comments around needing to consider the scale of the fisheries that will be impacted by the potential for that build out questions about accountability mechanisms in place to ensure tribal consultation labor standards and protections for ecological and cultural resources we mentioned that we covered some of those topics at our last but want to continue to receive written feedback on those topics through our um we also kind of talked about the in the chat the development of all energy resources except for maybe energy efficiency and conservation have the potential for adverse impacts solar has significant land use",

        "text": " portland and diane is in corvallis we have staff in washington and montana and we engage in policy and regulatory work in all four states and speaking of that policy and regulatory work uh regulatory work is really our bread and butter um we do a lot of engagement at state utility commissions um probably the oregon commission most of all but also the the washington utc the idaho puc the montana psc and a lot of that tends to focus on the sort of central regulatory process for electric utilities of doing integrated resource planning where the utilities assess their their needs and come up with plans for how to meet those needs on a lease cost least risk basis then flowing through to rfps where they actually go out and try to get the resources to meet the needs and finally looking for rate recovery for those investments after they've gone through the rfp process um at our organization tend to engage less with the rate processes but the irps and the rfps are a big part of what we do we also do engage in policy work we help develop the 100 clean electricity policies currently in place in oregon and washington um and have worked on their implementation we're getting close to done with the implementation of the clean energy transformation act up in washington and are just kicking off the hb 2021 implementation process at the oregon commission and we do engage with other policies relevant to renewable energy um such as citing including f-sec rule making so uh we appreciated uh your consideration of some of our suggested edits to the um protected areas rules um that were discussed earlier today then finally that last bucket that you'll see on this slide here markets and transmission is a growing advocacy with multiple efforts on going in the to try to stand up an organized west wide electricity market or possibly even transition to a regional transmission organization one quick caveat is that we very rarely engage on specific projects we will only get involved in anything relating to a specific project if there is a likely strong statewide or broader we often try not to even pay too close attention to what's going on with specific projects um our developer members are competing with one another and we like to you know keep a pretty strong arm's length from everything that's going on in that space and work it on things at a more kind of systemic or holistic level so that's kind of what we do and i'll pass it over to diane to head into great thanks max uh so as mentioned we're hoping to just give a broad overview of the renewable project um just to give some ideas as to what is really happening outside of the fsec process that influences how the projects are coming to you maybe for amendments or extensions but first what i'd like to talk about is why there is so much development give you some ideas as to what we're that's driving this um then we'll dive dive into the timeline focusing on some key areas not the whole thing there's a lot to cover and then we'll of course have time for questions at the end but i would like to flag please feel free to jump in as we're going through the the points if you have any questions along the way so first some thoughts on why we're seeing so much development right now kind of looking at this in different buckets first the policy drivers for that we're seeing for development uh of course house bill 2021 which we talked you all talked about earlier today setting some benchmarks for non-emitting electricity in the state within that there are some there is language about preferring in-state builds to see local benefit and economic and so forth as practicable so that's also influencing the amount of projects we're seeing in state or in the and then also neighboring state policies are also requiring clean energy as well uh all of this ties back to climate change mitigation efforts and we have before we had these policies in place and these still exist the voluntary renewable programs so this could be pge's green tariff or for example the blue sky program at um at pacific core as we're thinking about this it's worth mentioning that yes we're thinking about replacing these emitting generation for organ that serve oregon customers but also to recognize that as we're trying to move forward in mitigating climate change impacts that it means electrification of other sectors so as there's greater adoption of electric vehicles or as industry moves more towards this is going to greatly increase the demand of electricity in the region and in oregon and more broadly as well over the years we've seen a not just pretty and a noticeable decrease in the cost of renewables making them competitive and in often cases the last least cost resource in many situations so that's just a bit of the background and i'd like to dive now into the timeline and put together with input from our members kind of these different we can put these into buckets recognizing it's complicated it probably involves a lot more nuance than what i've captured here on this slide but i thought this was a great starting point and we're not going to talk about every piece of this at depth today as some of these you might be familiar with because they appear in the afzec process but there are a couple areas that are really impactful on the projects especially right now with some current um some current uh um happenings around the world and locally so we'll stop on those so first i'll look at this first line right here um on the next slide more in depth as a developer is thinking about developing a project we're going to start here at assessing the market and understanding the resource so you know todd did a great job of showing kind of the the market how it might have shifted over the years with the wind and the solar um so we're going to be looking at what is the demand what what's the situation on the ground and then also looking at where can we find the best quality resources so where is it the sunniest of course that will lead us most likely over to eastern oregon where we've got some great solar potential out there and then also the windy areas but we'll also be considering the technical specification specifications uh what's the slope or pitch of the ground is it going to be a difficult place to install things um are there other considerations that need to be taken into account for the technical aspect of it and then of course the transmission feasibility how far is this site from a transmission what are the cost implications for trying to connect is there even space on these lines that we could connect to so there could be a great site in terms of resource quality and maybe not requiring a whole lot of cost on the technical side of things but it may be far from transmission connection possibilities making it less cost competitive so once you find that site that takes us to the next step of securing the site control and local so this could be with private land or even public land we're seeing some projects that are using pieces of or parts of public lands but managed by the bureau of land management certainly we see this in other states as well in the southwest it's also worth noting that sometimes these agreements with local landowners it might be speculative in nature a developer might engage or establish agreements with multiple landowners but not necessarily end up using all of those leases or agreements to develop in the future so there's that aspect and then of course starting to talk with the local uh local government the planning um or maybe trying to start um thinking of what other considerations they need to take into account as they move and this will change be site dependent of course and then that naturally rolls into starting impact studies and assessments and of course all of these it's not a discrete like one ends the next one begins it's all kind of uh ongoing and trying to get things done in most efficient manner so impact studies and assessment environment and wildlife aspect and cultural resources are part of this um among other aspects that might come and then as todd mentioned we we're not necessarily going to dive into the fsac process but this is where it would typically flow in the timeline when you start putting together your all of your requests your noise and um consulting with f6 staff and getting things together for your the next slide these are two big areas that we thought it was worth focusing on because this is typically happening the after you see the application uh what is happening in the interconnection and transmission space and then also this big piece of securing off take so i'll talk a little bit about the interconnection transmission and then i'm going to pass it over to back max to talk about the securing off-take piece so first when we're talking about interconnection and transmission we're talking about the process of getting permission and negotiating with the owner and operator of the transmission and distribution lines so typically um pacific core or pge or even bonneville power um so this is a separate process even from negotiating the sale of the electricity that's going to be generated from the from the facility and while not uni not unique to oregon there is limited availability uh when we're talking about there is a finite amount of space on these transmission lines and many of these lines are subject to the ferc jurisdiction federal the federal energy regulatory commission or council sorry which i'll show you a flow chart on next on the next slide to talk through that a bit but in general the process starts with a request from the uh i guess in this case it would be the applicant so the developer who's going to be generating the electricity there would this would initiate a study and this study process would determine all of the different parameters or costs that would go into an interconnection agreement or their transmission rates here is a flow chart and i will mention that this is for large generating facilities partly the the facilities that you'll be seeing in the fsec process are these large generating facilities that will be connecting to the transmission uh versus smaller ones that could connect directly into the distribution system which doesn't necessarily fall under for jurisdiction and the point in showing this flowchart is more about there are a couple different places where projects can kind of fall off of of this interconnection process first it um these are all sorry let me just go back to my notes here for a second so interconnection requests are governed by what work we call oats or open access transmission tariffs which in this case doesn't mean but it means in how a utility interacts with and charges its rates to the customers so it's determining the relationship that it will have here between the utility the or the provider",

        "text": " a time frame that is being built into this process you know the report or a complaint comes in has to be responded to within so much time is that part of the it is so there are in in our rules are requirements for reporting in some cases and when they have to report what is a what gets a little fuzzier is the timing for having something resolved um and so i think in the sense you're we wouldn't have like a hard and fast time built in there what i think is important though is that we know that there is a plan and that we're tracking that there's closure on these things i i think in the past that i'm not saying we weren't doing it but i don't think we were sure that we were doing it but now you know if i go back to the scrum meetings what do we do in those and the first thing um pull up the incident log and we look at what incidents are open and what should be happening on those and there's a status in them they're they're gonna be open or they can be closed basically so if they're they're not closed then there's some action that we're still waiting on and we shouldn't allow things to fall through the cracks at least with the way that we are tracking these now and i would have not felt as good about saying that before we went through that exercise okay thank you uh just another question on the last item um you just talked about is the developing how council evaluates an application how how would you go about that as the council members change and might look for different information and the guidance that you're you give and yeah i i'd have to kick that one over to a sighting analyst to answer i think i think i'm not the best person to answer that i think it's a good question and will be one of the challenges in trying to prepare a document like but i think it can be done we certainly should be able to i mean and i think from a developer standpoint they would say well you know if you can't provide some basic guidance that you know fall and give me some guard rails at least then um you know are we being consistent enough or is the council being consistent enough and how applications are developed are evaluated so i'm probably not answering a question real well but that's the answer i can give you well the reason if i can um the reason i asked the question is um as council members come and go um we have different perspectives and whatnot and that it's a document that is given to somebody as opposed to just counsel as to get counsel from the analyst as to what's going on right now unless that document is kept pretty darn current i think it could be problematic thank you councilmember condon that's a that's a great point we'll we'll have to be careful putting it together and you know there'll be areas where maybe we can't give them a lot of guidance because it would be difficult to reflect change i don't think we want to try to certainly we're not trying to put something out that takes the place of the council evaluation but again it's more what information needs to be provided for the council to do their evaluation you know we're not certainly don't want to get into the area of trying to give people you know legal advice on how to put together their application we would steer clear of that but thank you for that input and the the wise warning thank you record todd i can address that to some degree as well and i think the value you know of this idea is you know we see some patterns of consistent um issues where applications are incomplete and i think it's those areas where we can focus on to say look you know we see more often than not here's an issue that comes up where we're gonna you know deem your application incomplete and ask for additional information so if we could provide some better guidance to them the idea is to get the completeness um and we can tell them you know how to better go about that and to wally's point absolutely we have to be very careful that we're not providing you know legal advice or you know indicating if you get to this phase that's tantamount to approval because completeness is simply enough information with which to evaluate the request not enough information to deem or to determine that the um the request can be approved so so that's really more for the value of the uh applicant and try to you know to resolve some of these consistent patterns of incompleteness that we see for the record this is marcy grill if i'm may cindy what my suspicion is it's the title because it says how counsel evaluates versus um thank you chair girl i was thinking the same thing as i reread that i thought i gotta rename that one so i didn't would have i would have would not have had a comment for the case thank you comments or questions for wally yes anne and wally thank you for the presentation new to the game so this is probably the wrong question but the scope of the program assessment is is there an outline of that somewhere thank you councilmember buyer yes there is um and i'm sure it's um in one of the folders from a prior council meeting but i will find that and make sure that you get that so you can review it i'm just curious more than anything thanks much uh for the record todd cornett just one last point on this and i think um it's important is so this is our um you know what we are planning to do but i also want to make sure that it's clear to council members if you have thoughts and ideas for us to work on that aren't on here you know process improvement activities you know related to anything or you know applications amendments for how the public participates how we work with reviewing agencies or you know how we work with council and provide information to you please let us know i mean this is the stuff that we see but we're one component of this overall process and we recognize that we don't know everything we don't see everything so should you have thoughts and ideas that aren't on here please let us know anyone else thank you ali the next item on our agenda is the echo solar project appointment of special advisory group this is an action item we have christopher clark odo senior sighting analyst who will recommend that the council appoint the morrow county board of commissioners as the special advisory group under ors-469480 subsection one for f-sec proceedings related to the proposed echo solar project chris welcome all members of the council uh for the my name is christopher clark and i'm uh here for this agenda item and my capacity as a senior citing analyst excellent um thank you for doing with my technical issues um so i'm here today as uh madam chair grail uh said to recommend that the council appoint the special advisory group for the echo solar project it's a quick overview of this project um the echo solar would be a 1.25 gigawatt solar photovoltaic power generation facility with up to 7.5 gigawatt hours of distributed battery storage capacity the proposed site consists of 10 900 a predominantly cultivated efu land in morrow county that's about 17 square and the applicant for is echo solar llc which is a wholly owned subsidiary of pine gate renewables llc i've included a vicinity map here you can see the facility is located just to um south and east of the boardman bombing range highway state highway 207. i've included another view here just to show the proposed facility site boundary in relation to um other energy facilities in the vicinity you can see the wheatridge facilities in orange and yellow um there and as i think wally showed in his presentation um the site boundary kind of interlocks with the proposed wagon trail solar project which is in the red hatching i know that's a little hard to one thing that's not shown on this map this proposed facility would interact with the existing uec transmission line sort of at the north west corner of the site boundary yes thank you marcy so is the proposed site boundary in black sorry yes uh councilmember jenkins the proposed boundary is the black bold outline there thank you are there any other questions from the to the northwest of where the those facilities what's all that shaded area to the northwest is that bombing range yes it to the northwest that is the boardman bombing range you can also see i don't know if you can see you cannot see my my quicker the cardi reservoir um up here to the northwest so the the boardman bombing range is that uh um but it's not that entire darkly shaded spot i think that's a maybe an artifact of the gis photography so christopher this is handling um the transmission line is the purple and white dashed line the uh i've cut off the key on this view here but i'll leave it the purple and white dashed line is proposed transmission lines and i will look to someone else in the room that may be the route of the proposed b2h line i see when a fossum has her hand raised and she she may know the answer oh that's okay i thought the blue and white was labeled as existing right yeah so i think you have this blue and white line which is the existing uh uec blue ridge line and then the purple and white i believe is is a proposed transmission line and i believe that's the proposed v2h1 i'm just really quick so in the middle that where the orange so there's the outline of the project area and then the little square in the middle i yeah uh thank you councilmember condon i believe uh that the other site boundaries are clipped so they don't appear in the middle but there may be some there is some overlap any other questions about this map and i will point out the um we did we received this notice of intent on may 10th it is available from our website if the in if the council member does have questions on it um i think there will be further opportunities to review this um and certainly it's out for public comment now oh and we do have a public information meeting scheduled on this for uh later in july in boardman um i can get that exact date well i will continue with my presentation i believe it's july 27 but i don't want him to speak for the record todd cornett and and you know if any council member would like to attend that either in person or virtually uh please let",

        "text": " before you take action on the amendments to propose revisions to Marion County codes sections one seven one one nine zero two zero and one seven one one nine zero two five arise out of a Greenway permit application that was filed by a private entity to build a structure in the purported right-of-way between my home and Ms putnam's home in butteville the application was improper for many reasons starting with the fact that it violated existing county code because it did not include our signatures as property owners the private entity apparently convinced Marion County staff to ask you to change the code to permit them to proceed with the project on our property without our permission or signatures we oppose this project because of the damage we've already sustained as a result of the early parts of the project since the county and this private entity began installing Park amenities in the small strip of land between our homes it has become a magnet for illegal drug use garbage dumping excessive noise additionally people attracted to this area now trespass on our property with frightening regularity at all hours of the day year round we ask that you reject the proposed revisions to Marion County code sections 17119-020 and 17119-025 which have the sole purpose of making it easier for the county to allow a private entity to impair property please see the letter submitted by our attorney for more details on why this action is improper and why the project is attempting to facilitate is unlawful this would affect not only our property but all properties of the citizens of Marion County who could potentially be affected by this code Amendment thank you thank you Julie any questions I don't have any questions for Julie yeah I have a question for Brandon as I this I don't remember talking specifically about this issue with regards to this change this change is broader than any impact it might have on this issue isn't that the case that's correct could you talk about when it was presented to us could you just sort of remind us about why is it necessary so what emerged from a recent louva decision was that we don't have a parallel in our code our code has an application can be made by an application can be signed by so a property owner can make an application the property owners signs it we currently have it where a governmental body can make an application but no one can sign and so we're we're making that parallel happen so in the future we we are able to bring forward land use cases like an easement where the board and others can consider making decision on Marion County owns a lot of right-of-way with easements like the state will often just own it outright but when we have working in easement say if we're adding a travel Lane and an easement it requires a conditional use someone has to be able to make that application and sign for that application for that work in the easement now when the actual decision or land use case comes up and there's a decision is to be made then we can evaluate how the criteria apply to that whether or not this is the proper use of the person making the application and signing it all of that gets evaluated as part of that land use and this is like we had a situation where Marion County foreclosed on a piece of property a long time ago before any of us were Commissioners and we own a a strip of land that's like 46 feet long in between two properties and we were talking about whether we can sign an annexation agreement to basically allow it to be annexed in the City of Salem right so that the development can go on there so I think this is a little bit broader than than just uh the butteville issue I'm sorry no go ahead thank you you're fine so what we're doing today is we're adopting a broad generalized code but at some point in the future once this is passed if it passes today an application for a land use case and that her particular situation scenario could could come forward to the county and go through the standard procedures we're not saying today that what she's speaking to is finalized correct right okay I just want to be clear that while I understand what you're saying this isn't a saying go forth and do great things with some easement in your front yard this is much this is Broad to the entire County and our ability to do our work in the county and then there's these um procedures that have somebody has to make an application in your case in order for anything to happen in the future once this passes well my understanding is currently the code states that all owners of the property must sign and we're the underlying fee title owners the county has an easement right away over basically over the top of the property but we're the feed title owners So currently we need to sign off and agree that they can make these changes the county wants to remove the requirement that we sign off on this on the changes they've made I I don't want to get too deep in the weeds here it's just caused a lot of problems for us as a community because of the Marion County allows this Park that they've installed to remain open 24 hours a day and I don't want to get into the details of the future case please I I just want to understand Brandon so she's saying that this ask in this particular code change is removing their ability to have a say is that well no I don't believe so because when when the application came forward we still have to make a determination for instance that the appropriate local government for say agency has made an application for Public Works project and so an opponent could argue you know this is not an appropriate Public Work um but this and then a signature of The Brokerage state agency for that or the public agency this allows an application to be brought forward to build and make those determinations have those arguments have the pushback it preserves all the rights for Neighbors opponents property owners to have their part of the process to appeal and to come before the board for a decision so I I want to add this because I'm reading 17 119.025 it says application shall include the following signatures and number one is signatures of all owners of the subject property so this change isn't eliminating that requirement but it is saying for an application filed by an entity authorized by a public agency or utility then then that that agency or utility can sign the document so I don't know that it's having this the effect that maybe you're concerned that it is well maybe Brandon can clarify it's my understanding that it is removing the signature requirement of the property owner that's correct the properties wouldn't have to sign for a public works but the it still has to be a public agency project and they can still argue that this isn't an appropriate public agency project there's ways to still be involved in that process I want to clarify though the the public agency would have to own the property that they're applying for though wouldn't they public agency has to have an easement right to do the project it's a type of ownership yes this is why we're objecting because we are the underlying fee title honors and the county is not and so there they've done something that has caused harm and they want to do and actually it's a private entity that's doing these actions with the counties so this is the improper action did you well this is kind of did you purchase the property subject to the easement or did you did you grant the easement after you purchased the property no um I purchased the problem question because you asked TS too right okay I'm sorry so did you purchase the property subject to the easement or did you grant an easement after you purchased it I did not Grant an easement so you purchased the property subject to this easement I didn't really know about the easement when I purchased it um but is that that's identified in the deed isn't it yeah yeah so it was in the record that you received when you purchased your home in the deed we deal with this a lot with citizens a lot around roads in Marion County and most homeowners don't read Deeds personally there's actually a lot of debate about that it's an historic home from 1886 that my great great grandfather built so there's we've had different title what's the word like Fidelity do research and they come up with it's very difficult to determine from the documents that were established in those it's very very confusing sure I believe and it's not actually in my property deed that Marion County has an easement there's nothing like that so I don't think we can get into your specific issue here but I do think there's this question we have to consider which is a public agency be able to sign a land use application and it just seems like there's so many other issue places that we run into this where we own property that if we don't have the ability to sign a land use that really prevents us to use to use that property I think if you own it outright that's one issue but the problem here is Marion County does not own it outright and so it sounds like Brandon you're you're saying you this these amendments would the requirement for all Property Owners to have signature Property Owners within an easement would not have to sign but the public agency that has the right to do certain work in the easement does have does have to sign well again I don't want to get into the weeds but there are many other codes that are being violated with this project so now what is to stop Marion County from coming to you with any of the codes that they're violating that they don't like and now having you amend 10 other codes Marion County codes that's the problem I foresee Gene can you speak I don't I mean it's not a practice of Marion County to just go and violate codes and ordinances like I've only been here two years but we have a pretty stellar legal team that makes sure we don't do that I think there's a I think my understanding of the underlying case wasn't that funny was that we didn't have the authority as an applique as a easement holder under our code to be an applicant and what Luba said was if you want to be an applicant you have to amend your code so that's why we're here today it's not that we're we violated anything it's that we were directed to take this action if we want to be an applicant thank you can I ask a question Brandon so is there a way in this change to make sure that we're not removing the and I don't know that",

        "text": " of fires associated with construction activities um and then so the department took those representations and compiled it into what we call a fire prevention suppression and emergency management plan which is attached to the dpo so part of that plan has a construction component and then there's uh also the operational component because as we are aware this is a big complex facility there are facility components generally that have an electrical component so we have transformers transmission lines um the battery storage components um the the wind turbines all of these have some electrical component and there are fire risks associated with them so in this plan we basically break out and talk about the potential fire risk from certain facility components and then measures the applicant would do to reduce those risks um the applicant also uh provides um oh it's like a table of contents from an fire management plan uh and that includes those and so that basically a finalization of this final plan would include all of the details from the application and then a more a bigger build out of that table of contents that they provided which has a hazard risk and vulnerability assessment training and exercises um how like information on how that plan itself would be updated um and then it includes tactical response procedures for structural fires evacuations medical emergencies etc okay that was public services going on joyce minimization um council has a waste minimization standard it's pretty straightforward um it encourages reducing and recycling waste so that waste actually generated from construction and operating of the facility is as minimal as it possibly could be um very typical of ethnic energy facilities um is a condition that has a construction waste management plan which functionally um provides an updated list of the the quantities that waste that will be and identifies methods how the applicant will reduce and recycle waste and ultimately dispose of the waste the disposal sites and this is that nexus with public um the disposal sites are columbia ridge and findlay buttes landfill which over in the in the application in exhibit u public services there they provide correspondence with both of those landfills that indicate that they have um more than sufficient uh space to handle what estimated weight waste generated um there's also uh wasteman condition three which is related to um the potential for concrete washout and whether or not a deq exemption permit exemption would apply to the facility um further under wasteman which is um interesting right because we have a solar facility and a wind facility and as an op as the operational aspects of of those of that facility um it includes um sometimes the solar panels need to be replaced sometimes there's wind facility components that would need to be um replacing these facility components um on a cyclic or ongoing basis as part of the operation of the facility and so these conditions are really intended to make sure that the solar facility components and when facility components are going to be um recycled to the greatest extent practical practicable and then where they're disposed of the disposal would be in a licensed or certified facility or method and method okay council has uh division 24 has we kind of move out of division 22 of like the standards now we're looking at standards that apply to certain types of facilities and we have a wind facility so there's the public health and safety standards for wind energy the impacts or risks that we look at underneath the standard is specific to the wind facility components but so what we look at and are evaluating are structural failures mechanical failures um we also look at collapsed turbines or a blade blade fro the first part of the standard requires the applicant to demonstrate that it can exclude the public from close proximity to the wind turbines and electrical equipment and so the evaluation in the draft proposed order you know says this the facility is going to be located on private land um you know trespassing is a thing but the public is generally supposed to stay off of of private land so that in itself is a way of precluding the public access to these facility um there would also be fencing and gates a lot of this depends on what landowner preferences are and where they would want them but there's going to be fencing and gates um excluding the public also like on the winter by doors um they would be locked and the substation is going to be fenced um and then there's also for the uh the wind turbines there's um setbacks from public roads which is talked more under the land use section the second part of this standard requires the applicant to demonstrate that it can operate the facility to prevent structural failures and also um there's this component that requires safety devices and testing procedures um and this was kind of a cool like a cool condition to work on um because i think that we have a really interesting condition here help the department um track when there's issues and also if there is an issue with the wind facility the the reporting aspect and understanding better why something went wrong so um this condition one just to save you from reading that whole long thing so we're we're recommending um that it'd be required to develop and implement an operational safety monitoring program um the office operational safety monitoring program includes elements um such as conducting inspections and testing of the wind facility components consistent with the manufacturer recommendations but also on best engineering practices um and then maintaining records of those inspections and tests those records would be available made available to the department upon request um and then those that uh those results would also be uh provided in uh the annual report that is that is also submitted i thought that i had another oops oh my gosh what happened where'd it go oh gosh nope okay that was it okay um and then there's also part of this also is if there is actually an event the reporting requirements and what we what we look for to be included in that as well and now moving on to the cumulative effects standard which is the other standard that applies specifically to wind energy facilities requires the applicant to design and construct the facility to reduce cumulative adverse environmental impacts including but not limited to the list of items that you see here so really the emphasis is using existing roads to the maximum extent uh practicable um using existing substations we're minimizing the amount of stub substations um constructing the facility to avoid impacts to wildlife minimum lighting this standard is limited to environmental effects that an applicant is capable of reducing and does not require the council to find that a wind energy facility has no cumulative environmental impacts um and so under this section in the dpo and i'm sure a lot of this kind of looks familiar to council members but we we point to or reroute to findings of facts and recommendations in other sections that really focus in on this specifically like reducing risk to wildlife we kind of re-route to the fish and wildlife section the minimum light necessary for safety and security purposes um lighting's talked about in scenic and protected areas under the and same thing with the visual features under visual features but ultimately um the faa is is the agency that determines the lighting for the wind facility structures and those met towers and so that for like those for the wind facility components that is the lighting that's necessary for safety and security and that's talked about under the public services traffic safety however to be consistent with the standard we do recommend this condition um underneath the standard which really requests and it requires the applicant to really take a look at existing roads understand what existing roads are on on within the site boundary what could they use um and then basically to provide a map set to demonstrate that um that that for the new roads that those new roads do avoid um resources that are protected under council standards um this is going to be a fast one deciding standards for transmission lines we've kind of talked about the various transmission line routes and but there are several transmission line components including the um collector signing standards for transmission lines um has a nine kilovolt per meter at one meter above ground surface an area is accessible to the public that is the standard here's a table from the dpo all these numbers are less than nine it meets the standard we recommend the standards bet all right um everybody doing okay all right we're almost there you're doing great okay noise control regulations gets a little bit complicated but i'm gonna try to keep it um not simple but just straightforward and easy to understand i'm gonna try i'm gonna try it um so these are other applica applicable regulatory requirements under council's jurisdiction so the annoyance control regulations are actually rules that fall under um the jurisdiction of the department of environmental quality but deq does not admit administer or fund this program so d-e-d-e-q is like not helpful however these rules are on the book on the books so that's why council evaluates deq's noise rules because they are applicable rules to the facility in deq noise rules we look at the rules that are specific to industry and commerce um to apply and evaluate um always a noise assessment for a large energy facilities also underneath the underneath those noise rules and the vast majority of the noise analysis all about the potential noise at what are called noise sensitive properties um so they're noise sensitive properties we also call them nsrs noise sensitive receptors i'm going to call them nsrs a noise sensitive receptor you can kind of see them in the map here's an nsr and there's these are all nsrs nsrs are basically houses they're is normally used for so that's some terminology um you know quick cut is that there's two standards that are really that are are looked at and evaluated one of them is the maximum allowable noise um and that's 50 dba that is the maximum that your energy facility can generate without not meeting that standard the other one is an ambient noise degradation standard and this is where a uh an energy facility in any one hour cannot increase the ambient um noise level by 10 dba so asp 10 or lower to meet the standards so those are the two the two standards that are another interesting thing with this is that we are talking about a wind facility and the deq noise rules does have um a carve out and kind of specific rules for wind facilities um and some of the aspects that maybe differ from if we were just looking at a transmission line or a solar facility is that the what differs for wind facilities are some assumptions you can make about baseline uh baseline or ambient noise and then if there is an exceedance of one of these noise standards that there's a there's a waiver process in that too those are just some of those differences so um underneath so the maximum allowable the 50 dba

contested case order if there is one or Andor review of the proposed order and the issuance of a final order which approves or denies the application for site certificate this slide represents the procedural history for the wagon trail solar project the department received the applicant's notice of intent in November of 2020 following receipt of the notice of intent an amended notice of intent was provided to the department in June of 2021 and in August of 2022 the department received from the applicant the preliminary application for site certificate in January of this year the applicant provided the the the preliminary application was deemed complete and the applicant provided a complete application for site certificate and just earlier this month the department issued its draft proposed order on May 7th and today as highlighted and indicated here in red we're at the draft proposed order public Hearing in the next step in this procedural history table is the close of the public comment period which is next Friday June the 7th following close of the comment period and uh we anticipate F FX review of the DPO and of public comments to occur at the next council meeting which is June the 14th as I just mentioned on May the 7th concurrent with uh the Department's issuance of the DPO a notice which included information on the ASC the public comment period ways to

the record at the conclusion at after the close of the record the other two criteria relate to content of comments for consideration in the contested case issues raised must be within the council's jurisdiction and must be raised with sufficient specificity so that the council the department and the applicant understand the issue raised and are afforded an opportunity to respond to the issue to raise an issue with sufficient specificity a person must present facts that support the person's position on the issue and with that I think we're I'm ready to turn it over to you chair how this is a public hearing on the draft proposed order on the request for a site certificate for the wagon trail solar project I Kent how energy facility sighting Council chair am serving as a presiding officer for this hearing today is May 30th 2024 the time is 8:02 p.m. this public hearing is being held at an energy facility sighting council meeting in person here in the riverfront room at the Port of Morrow in Boardman this hearing is also being held via a WebEx webinar with a call-in option for those who cannot participate in person or via webinar tonight's hearing is being recorded the presentations written comments and oral testimony are part of the decision record for the request for the facility the purpose of the public hearing is to provide an opportunity for the public reviewing agencies counsel and the applicant if they wish to do so to present oral and written testimony on the request and the Department's draft proposed order the 31-day record of the public

the certificate hold Holder will be allowed to respond to any comments if attendees wish to submit written comments at the hearing to staff they may do so I will call on each person interested in providing oral testimony starting with the certificate holder and then members of the public here in person and then onto the webinar and then onto the phone for any individuals wishing to provide oral testimony during tonight's hearing for the record please State the following with your testimony full name with spelling name of organization or group if you're representing one and the physical mail or email address so is the applicant here tonight and do they wish to provide testimony hi my name is Ryan Hill that's r y a n h i l l I'm representing the wagon trail solar project I just want to say thank you to the council for coming out here spending your time to review our application thank you to chase for all the good communication and uh thank you to the public for coming out and you know having interest in our project and other projects similar thank you yes sir before I open the hearing up to public testimony I want to remind the public that prior to the close of the record you may submit written testimony in a variety of ways the comment portal email and handing in your written tonight I'd like to get a sense of the number of people interested in testifying to determine if I need to set limits um I've got three here um could you raise your hand if there's any more that want to looks one two okay so maybe five and do we know how many are on the phone and on the web X I've got one person with their hand raised okay um same time five okay so with that um we're ready for Miss Tamara mbit nice to see you okay have you started the clock yet okay very exciting I don't often get to sit on this side of the table so it's very exciting um thank you chair how and members of the sighting Council and staff my name is Tam mbad I'm the moral County planning director today I just want to uh Briefly summarize moral countyy is very supportive of this project and we've submitted comments I believe three times formally into the record and uh the Board of Commissioners will consider uh an an additional letter um the next time they meet which will be Wednesday June 5th again the County's very supportive of the process what I want to call to your attention tonight is this um complicated conundrum with a goal three exception um I think this is the time to get it right and set a a a good precedent I think your staff has it correct in their analysis of goal three they reference um a court of appeals case about whether or not goal 13 compliance with Goal 13 um is sufficient reason to justify goal and they concluded it does not and we would agree with that um I spent the day today with some of your agency counterparts Department of land conservation and development the entire day was looking at solar sighting rules we had a lot of discussion about goal five protection of other resources and balancing that with Goal three I think the I think the process works for the most part um but um and in the past most recently with the um Oregon Supreme Court ruling in favor of the the state and the sighting Council where you did not Implement local standards I think this is a time when you can um agree that there is an appropriate place for local government um the staff I think has done a good job um recommending some mitigation um to offset some of the impacts to removing Farmland from production um I'm just not sure that that's the right formula and what I would like to see and I um I expect the Board of Commissioners will have it in some um formal written letter next week is that we maybe make that a little bit more formal instead of off the cup so we have another solar development in moral County they've taken um great steps to quantify that impact and they also work very closely with staff and our elected officials we have a formal agreement their application will come before you rather soon that gives the county the comfort that that exact number is the correct number and this one um seemed not not completely arbitrary but it's not as quantifiable as another project so um again moral countyy is very supportive of this it's really good business for the underlying farmers and the land owners we just think that there is so much to be considered by setting a president with Goal three we'd encourage you to think about that and maybe give some direction to staff in the developer um to formalize that mitigation program happy to answer any questions questions thank you Miss mavit thank you Cameron Krebs thank you chairman oh sorry you have the floor all right thank you chairman uh I my name",

        "text": " provide us some flexibility there um but at most it would be a one: one ratio of solar panels to battery storage uh as I mentioned that it's on the BP uh excuse me the BPA uh system our Pro so BPA allows us to choose two pois or point of interconnections our first is along the bucket of grizzly 500 KB line number two which is directly adjacent to the project uh we would effectively be what's called tapping the line or constructing a new substation on site uh and having our point of interconnection be on site with the project the other option we are exploring is running about a 4 and a half mile Genai North into Buckley substation in Sherman County um this is something that is not yet it is something we're looking at it's something that we're doing our diligence on uh it's not something we fully yet secured um so we'll continue to look at this as an option uh but for now we do have an initial uh point of interconnection secured at uh the and then quickly just on permitting and site control so site control being um you know the land that we have under control we have the full amount of land 8,075 Acres there about um and are have interconnection secured and this past summer we uh completed all of our field surveys and studies in preparation for the F permitting process so just a quick T quickly touch on product Milestones our timeline uh some basic stats so at 800 megaw we are looking to power 182,000 homes with uh renewable energy 8,75 Acres all in Wasco County uh the expected life of this solid project is 40 Years of operation and at a project of this size we expect a capital investment of a billion or more uh by the developer by ourselves so we were able to get all of our land under control earlier this year um and field studies wrapped up at the end of fall and as all you know the reason we're sitting here our notice intent was issued at the beginning of October so that kicked off the fet permitting process the ASC or the application for site certificate that's really as Kate mentioned that is the full site uh permitting application we're aiming to have that done by the end of January next year hopefully sooner uh but there's a lot of information to gather there so that is about a two-year process so we're estimating our permit to oh to have received our permit by the end of 2025 and we're looking at c commercial operations date the date that the construction is completed and we are putting energy on the grid at earliest by the end of 2028 and you know the one thing to mention throughout all of this and this is going to be a theme um in the presentation but in how I answer questions or comments is that you know we are looking to engage to hear comments from to to uh make connections with any stakeholder agencies uh even you know local community members that are involved impacted by this project so that has already started and it will continue all the way through and past our commercial operations St so this is a facility an overview of the facility I won't spend too much time here we actually have a map printed out over there if you didn't get a chance to see it feel free to go check it out after the presentation contact um so again U I would be the main point of contact I have my business card over there uh by where Sarah is sitting so feel free to take one uh shoot me a message give me a call whenever you'd like um anuka soulsby is our permitting connect is our our the permitting uh person on this um and then you know also this will be circulated so should you need to talk to Mitch or Gary who is head of engineering proc and construction they contact there well reach that question and answer and comment period of our meeting I just wanted to go over really quickly if you are on the web act um this slide shows you how to participate or raise your hand to make a comment or ask a question um there is also a number on the notice if you're on the phone there's instructions on how to participate via phone we're going to leave this slide up during the Q&amp;A in the com perod but we're going to start as I had noted before people people in the room people on the WebEx and then people on the phone and we will work on that one of the things that I fail to mention at the beginning is that if you do want to comment um it's really important to us that we get your name accurately there are comment cards on the back table if you want to make a public comment tonight we ask that you fill one out so that we have your information um if if you are wanting to make an oral comment tonight um I think we're just going to open it up and see if there's anybody who wants to make a comment and we do ask that you come up and sit at the table and speak into the microphone so we can get it recorded the meeting is recorded and so we're going to start with the um people in the room you don't have to speak if you don't want to you can also just write a comment on the comment card and hand it to Sarah to Nancy or to me or to chase before you leave tonight and um like I said there's multiple ways to comment after this meeting as well and you can also ask questions you don't have to just count comment just ask clarifying questions what we just went over so I'm going to stop and see if there's anybody in the room that would like to comment we wait a couple minutes people prid you had a question question name the record that my name is Ken Clark um with the recent uh federal emergency Regulatory Commission order 2023 and the bpaq reform as a generator uh when do you expect to be able to receive an inter connection agreement and a commercial I think you said but a commercial operation date yeah um that is a great question one that we are you know very closely monitoring and very have been very much involved in the bpaq process um you know I'll be honest there is a bit of uncertainty as to how these reforms in the bpaq reform will play out um we are targeting like we said end of 2028 for commercial operations date I will say that is aggressive um you know I I would I would probably say that it's anywhere from 2028 to 2030 based on how we're seeing those um reforms play out um so in terms of when we expect interconnection I mean just kind of working backwards I think that that we would be looking at then in the 2026 range and again all this is um so those are General dates that we're we're looking at now but again are closely monitoring this process and how that affects the timelines on our project have you entered the bpaq yeah so we we do have two positions for these projects um without going too deep into the the mechanics of the bpaq um we we are in the um the transitionary cluster um basically to not make that deadline there would be significant impacts for the timeline but we filed Q uh we have four Q positions of which were filed either early this year or late last year yeah as best as I was able to ascertain the best estimate I could come up with is that uh the BPA will not start uh reviewing transmission clusters until 2025 that sound um you know I'll kind of you've been most involved with the epaq reform would you say that's accurate for those in the least so that's that's a moving Target I think unfortunately a lot of things in the BPA process are moving targets right now but you're you're generally generally correct and and what they might be getting to issuing additional one question so you said on Buckley 2 you've secure it all in title notes or necessary use notes no no no so with Buckley we have not we are still exploring that possibility for the line tap we have um you know the Land There we have everything we need to to interconnect on site with Buckley there is still easements um and other agreements or or parties to to work with to actually secure that so something we're still working on at this time great thank questions there anyone else in the room that like comment question you put the math up while people are do you want me to spell it if it's complicated yes d uls k i that's the bullus I'm Joe de buus I'm the Sherman County judge and so my question pertains to your second option going to buckle is that a choice you guys make to go over there or is that would be a choice for for the from BPA for an interconnect and why would you choose to go there over um right I'm good question so I mean it's a choice that we make contingent upon working with various parties needed to secure easements to get there uh and gain access to the station so if we're able to secure that um then it is our choice the reason why we would go there as opposed to interconnecting on SES is it is significantly more exp expensive to build a new sub station which we would be required to do if we connected on site now we are willing to do that we don't think that that will um you know overly negatively affect the economics of the project that being said um if we can go to an ex existing substation that allows us to have lower costs therefore sell energy at lower prices so this may be a question you can or cannot answer I may not know when is Buckley cons going to be upgraded oh uh um I'm just curious if your information same as my information yeah I'm not entirely sure do you have like an estimate from BPA as to when it might be upgraded no it's going to start so um within next couple years it's going to start is what I'm told but that's in in a meeting like this so it's not that's something handed to me so we're g to start yeah generally in line with what we've heard but um I think that that would be something we would get more information on as we keep getting more studies back from DPA which have been somewhat delayed due to the Q process the reform um so unfortunately my information now is probably better than thanks is there anyone else who wants to comment tonight or ask a question okay and like I said if you just want to write a comment",

        "text": " the mayor mentioned counselor Barney is going to be released it sounds like different points and conditions are beginning with no haven't heard so I heard that she was appointed for me so I thought oh that's interesting and then I stopped for like yeah I'm not sure I have not heard anyone um it might be a little different use cases you know counselors could be at home watching this right now to do and that would be okay part of the record um but I'm not I'm not sure I do know that the mayor is interested in boards and commissions generally looking at what their roles are we have the right working commissions we have too many maybe I know we have some that I feel like they don't really know like the purpose that they were created for um could different roles it seems that the council are going to be given towards and commissions the goal of these to start this year so there may be because I think because your goal has never been done did you want to say anything about the two deputies um sure there's so many changes that start to you know I don't think um yeah so the so we've been sitting last fall um so he's made some organizational and he's decided that based on the size of our city that he really needs two Deputy city managers HR department head um this is Deputy city manager and she's in charge of all the internal and City operations facilities all those people um and then he's recruiting for another deputy singing Center as part of that creating this thing in the Department of Community Deputy manager would run for I call them fun things but I call them like community services at like a community or do things the library center 50 plus products rank that kind fun things happy things which actually used to be an apartment before the recession of the entire department there's your problems yeah so um that recruitment is underway so to fund that position Norman Wright who was our director of Community Development left and set up on that position they took they took his position and turned it into that new um and so they can find Community Development with Urban Development Urban Development as a director of Christian Rockefeller so she's now thank you thank you what administrative staff so there's and then there's just kind of the where people sit is also very jumbled right now because the building they're almost done Urban Development is downtown but obviously no invest somewhere up here she's also in terms of the Housing Authority um this building's going to be remodeled right with the so there's just a lot of change other questions for Lisa and we'll move on to comments for the good of the articles thank you in the state of the city speech which is calling in at the beginning uh I guess on Wednesday March 22nd um from 11AM lunch at 11 30. presentation begins it's at the center Convention Center uh site foreign or something but you don't have to be you don't have to buy one should be um but if you don't very much you sit in the bathroom the event is co-sponsored by Rotary Club the Salem City Club and the Chamber of Commerce this year the Chamber of Commerce has the lead but thank you so in December I had opportunity to participate in a workshop that was sponsored by the department of U.S energy and the landscape program at the University of Oregon and the issue there was the realization that as we moved from apartment-based fuels to removal Fields the actual physical footsteps that is going to be required in order to meet our energy needs this might be significantly significantly larger uh than what it currently is and so the US Department of energy is really working Partners to try and expand the placement of renewable energy infrastructure improving areas it's the project that I participated in was bringing designers planners together to think about you know in these four kind of urban type schools et cetera how can we integrate renewable energy into those so it's kind of a brainstorming Workshop what I left with was the recognition that in order to meet my removal energy levels we're going to have to really maximize sides the use of land efficiency here in our Urban environment so that in Salem and as we look about it and see these huge asphalt parking lots as we look at roofs and warehouses and all these other structures we really need to be looking at those as potential renewable energy opportunities and to think more about that so that that's an issue I hope to bring back here soon because I think that it fits well within the purview of the landing Department Planning Commission and look at advisability Council on how we manage growth so I just wanted to find that for people thanks for sharing that article yeah Michael in this discussion was there anything about designer planning requirements related to solar energy relationship developments or or buildings actually of any implementation of some requirements that there be a certain orientation or does it mean that there be some sort of accommodation for the ability to install so yeah you know I'm looking into this and personally so I'm sure has some answers as well I've been involved in a couple smaller projects going in my own house which is installed solar we were able to install it at an east facing Direction which was surprising to me um and actually because of our sunny days we've actually produced more power than we used in my house on an east-based Direction which is kind of exciting at least fewer because we get a lot for it the the one issue that came up that I learned and I think this is one of the reasons I like to explore more is that we had to have about maybe two thousand dollars worth of structural work done in order to manage the wind loads of those on the roof and stuff that we use that they're the only company they know of that will take a client that needs to have structural work done on their roof because there's such demand that they can just go to the easier houses uh my house is in 1955 in a ranch and there's a lot of housing stock but that's a that is that age and older and so if that's the criteria what's happening in the marketplace we're gonna have a real tough time meeting some of our you know the solar demands and requirements so that was just one thing that I experienced um I know and maybe Lisa wants it correctly but I don't think the city has done any sort of comprehensive review of its own policies in terms of what is it could facilitate or was inhibiting solar uh the company that installed by said oh you know it's really too bad we have these requirements we never had went to vets it's probably worth looking into it I think that's one of the things that we as a commission can do I understand that I support that I thought early on one of the things that we might look at whether or not there are should be any requirements or any provisions in our in our codes in buildings both residential commercial would facility or help facility it used to be that I would see as a huge developments which if you looked at me wrong already reached it was but for a position of our son it wasn't very good for solar there is new technology where your solar panels can move Etc but um I would I'd support kind of going in that direction is something to at some point consider seeing what the impact whether we are facilitating there's a way to facilitate it when there's something that's inhibiting new construction the opportunities a requirement anyway I kind of could support it with Michael's yeah good comments good discussion any other kind of attention to the good of water it's not we're adjourned",

        "text": " just for clarification yes we are in rule making related to contested cases it is limited to new applications however that will also feed into the subsequent rule making on amendments where that will be one of the things we look at and you know what our information comes out of the contest in case rulemaking certainly can be applied there are obviously some nuances that have been discussed today regarding the availability and thresholds for contested cases and amendments but those will also be evaluated in that Amendment thank you okay is there anyone else present that's interested in making public comment I don't see anyone and then um also is there anyone on the webinar or on the phone um at this time I do not see anyone with their hand raised but let me just remind anyone on the web how they can participate so if you're on the webpage the webinar you're gonna at the bottom of the right main window is a set of icons click on the participants window the bottom right hand of the participant window is a hand icon just click on that hand and that will raise your hand and when you're finished speaking go ahead and click it again and that will lower your hand if you are participating by the phone press star 3 on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and again when you're done speaking press star 3 again to lower your hand and at this time I do not see any hands raised Vice chair house let's give another 30 seconds or so and see if anybody is scrambling trying to get it to work okay it looks like no more additional public comments so we'll move on to the next item which is the obsidian solar center Amendment one this is an information item we've got Kathleen Sloan senior siting analyst to present an overview of the approved 400 megawatt alternating current solar will take energy facilities and the changes proposed in the request for Amendment mislona jury thank you Vice chair Howe for the record my name is Kathleen Sloan as stated earlier I am a senior citing analyst for the Department of energy I'm going to try to share my screen all that techie all right so for this agenda item this is an information item for Council it is to cover the council review of the draft proposed order and the public comments received on the record for the obsidian solar center request for Amendment one so just as an overview for the agenda I will give you a basic overview of the facility the components and the memory requests I'll also go into a summary of the draft proposed order with the focus on the condition language that actually changed from the original site certificate as far as recommendations um we'll also do an overview of the public comments received both during the public hearing which was held in Christmas Valley on August 24th and also in through the comment border or email written comments received on the record during that public comment period and then it will go to council for discussion and deliberation there's no decision or action required at this time but Council may have the opportunity to ask questions make recommendations for changes to be incorporated into a proposed order or you can just advise us to prepare the proposed order but we will prepare a proposed order and issue that proposed order based upon council's review today so just really quickly overview of the approved facility Council approved the site certificate on February 25th at 2022 the certificate holders obsidian solar Center LLC which is a wholly owned subsidiary of obsidian Renewables LLC the approved facility is for 400 megawatts of solar 50 megawatts of battery storage related and supporting facilities and the approved site boundaries 3921 Acres it's located in Lake County about eight miles Northwest of Christmas so that map there is the approved the solar center request for Amendment the purpose of the the amendment request is to add this 169 Acres additional acres to the site boundary so that the certificate holder has the ability to construct and inner tie to either the BPA line which is on the side of the proposed amended area versus what has already been approved which was to allow for an inner tie to the PGE they want to construct one GSU substation within that area they will also be increasing the voltage of the transmission line from 115 kilovolts to 138 similarly the collection system from 34.5 to 138 and some modifications in the uh length of the transmission line and the collector lines particularly how much was above ground versus below so this map shows you the requested amended site boundary on the left hand side of the map you're going to see the orange cross-hatched area which is I think I could use my low pointer right in here that's the amended 169 Acre Site boundary within that is this 84 Acres which is in pink that is the proposed microciting area but the certificate holder did want some flexibility on where to cite those components within that pink area so just a refresher scope of council review for amendments this is adding a new area to the site boundary so it is a requirement that approved that all the applicable laws and standards for the original site certificate um can that the amendment can comply with all of those conditions and then also and meet those standards and then also that the bond or letter of credit is adequate for the changes proposed in the Amendments um of course all of the draft proposed order is open for comment by Council um we can talk about any of these standards but I am going to try to focus this presentation on the standards where we actually recommended a change in condition language or an additional or new condition So based upon our review of the request for Amendment we prepared the draft proposed order and in that draft proposed order we did not make any recommendations for substantive changes or condition language changes for any of these standards that are listed on this slide again we can talk about any of these if you want but I'm not going to cover them in my presentation because we're not recommending any substantive change or new language for conditions so the standards that we are going to focus on today are the ones that we actually did either make a change in recommended condition language or a new condition recommendation and so these are the standards listed here and my next few slides are going to focus specifically on the proposed change or new recommended language and Council will also be able to take a look at the red line that we have prepared in the draft site certificate for each of these so the first one is the general standards of review basically because the uh RFA a request for amendment is asking to change the transmission line Corridor it's actually requires a change in general standard condition nine to allow for that change from 115 KV to that 138 and so in our recommended amended condition 9 under General standards of review we have provided a red line that basically reflects that change that upgrade from 115 KV the change in the extent of the corridor and also that additional point of inner tie with the addition of area e so just just Council have any comments or questions at this time okay we got to move on so the next standard where we proposed either new or revised condition language is organizational expertise um one was to reflect that the change in the just the structure of the facility as far as the increase in the kilovolts of The Collector lines and the inner tie we ensure that the certificate holder has retained qualified Personnel to do that work and again it's reflected in the the new recommended conditions which is six seven and eight which also speak to that issue of qualifications and making sure that the staff professionals contractors construction managers meet those qualifications for this upgraded so the first is a recommended amended condition because there is an existing condition too that does speak to this uh additional requirements for both the qualifications and the information provided prior to construction for the construction manager and the on-site manager a little more specificity particularly requiring that 72-hour notification if there is a change so this is our recommended amended language for that condition oh go ahead Council Condon Vice chair um thank you a question related to the statement or that assurance that the construction manager has experience in managing permit and Regulatory Compliance requirements and is qualified to manage a utility scale solar facility what is it that we're looking for I think that it's really about looking to see that it is that again it's it's to make sure that the certificate holder has the professional capacity to manage such a robust project like I think it's looking at what we asked what it said for before was that the construction contractors be able to to be qualified to manage a project but what we've learned is that there are the certificate holder does retain these on-site project managers construction managers and that these people really need those similar qualifications because they have to oversee the work of the contractors and I think that was something that we've just learned along the way I mean thank you I'll just add kind of related to my my comment and then the secretary gave the report with respect to the organizational expertise is that it's that this digging down that I I'd like to know more about is what's expected from what if an applicant provides information how are we assessing it so thank you okay thank you chair how councilor Beyer and as you're getting to the next conditions just thank you for adding additional conditions regarding project management throughout the life of the project I think we focus so much on construction but knowing that there is someone on site who's responsible for ensuring compliance with um the order and the conditions of approval is really important and I'd like that specificity so carrying it forward to other proposed projects I think is a good idea and and tightening up the conditions as counselor Condon mentioned as we get more experience so I think this is a step in the right direction so thanks thank you so we do have three new recommended conditions in that regard and really they are tied to the phase of the facility as council member fire mentioned one of the things I've learned is that oftentimes the the certificate holders team shifts from construction to operation so having those two broken out I think is helpful again reinforcing that they have demonstrated qualifications and expertise to do the work that needs to be done and having someone on site that really is uh or on on board that is really responsible for for tracking and managing those site certificate conditions whether it be in construction or during the operations of the facility in the long term so the next standard is the land use I think Council will remember that the question that came up over the addition of the 169 Acres",

        "text": " to the department and council member for corrections of certain scrivener's and then we have fire protection issue left to resolve um the draft final order to review um um our next slide up is jesse sorry good also oh thank you yes um and so related to the um the draft final order review will be the opportunity for the parties to comment on to the department's order proposed order that are occurring as a result of the hearing officer's proposed contested case order so basically i've just walked you through the proposed contested case order you've had a chance to ask questions um you know state objections if you have any and so we're going to provide that opportunity to the parties as well before the council takes a final vote on um on the site so um up to the council members whether or not they want me to proceed with scrivener's errors at this point or if you'd like to dive back into the fire protection issue um it doesn't really matter to me we have the scrivener's error slide up if you prefer to prioritize the fire protection that's fine council anybody have a preference harry none jesse do it the way you like okay well we've got the slide up so i'll keep going thank you uh okay so um i guess uh um we have a very small number of scrivener's errors from both the applicant and the department and uh sarah if you wouldn't mind putting the let's go with the departments first because if i'm remembering correctly the applicants are mostly a subset of the departments um so let's let's start with them give me just uh 90 seconds so jesse this is hanley are you going to progress through this as we progress through the document or just go through the list that's in the february 10 uh memorandum i guess yeah um councilmember jenkins i guess my thought was that the number of um corrections were small enough um on the departments and applicants side that we could just kind of take a look at their charts here um if there's anything that's not self-evident from the chart we can we can go to the page in the proposed order and so if that's uh uh fine with you that that was the way i thought of proceeding whatever works i mean i minor minor strictly scribners i think and and um you know i just i haven't paper clipped on my hard copy here so okay well i will i'll go ahead then and walk through um the departments and the um applicants and then we can go through yours and on that on yours then we'll go through the the part of the proposed order put that up on the screen so that we can all see okay just okay so uh with the departments um on this page one of three here that's been pulled up on the screen um we have uh first just a misspelling of ms estherson's name the next one is um an acronym issue um so uh we have the lake county planning commission um and then we have the lake county board of commissioners um and uh the um distributors error is intended to properly identify who determined uh that the applicant properly inventoried accepted farming practices etc that was the board of commissioners not the planning council similarly the board of commissioners not the planning council determined that the site certificate application is conditioned to adequately address its potential impacts through proposed minimization and mitigation techniques another acronym issue um so according to the directory uh director of the it should be the lake county planning department not the planning commission next change is page 89 second full paragraph here it looks like there is a mistake using the word with instead of without as corrected it should read nonetheless the applicant does not request and the department does not propose the council grant site certificate for unmanaged construction activities without sufficient mitigation that's clear enough from from the context based on the hearing ruling on that issue moving to uh the next one here page 89 second full paragraph last sentence um i i think we just simply have a um an autocorrect issue um where the uh um hearing officer had described the um the applicant as a contentious community partner when it appears that he meant conscientious uh from from context um and uh um uh that the um appropriate phrasing at the end of that sentence instead of the applicable site certificates um we're talking about a single certificate um that really what the hearing officer was referring to was more generically the approvals so our next change again um this is to clarify um that uh um while the the applicant has other jurisdictional projects in the area um this is the first f sector's digital project request um and so um we're not referring to site certificates here um we're referring more generically to the other approvals that the applicant has uh so that's the list of um scrivener's errors from the department again we'll just do a quick straw poll here to see if there are any objections to any of those okay hearing none we will go to the actually jesse i have a quick question um with respect to the smaller um that the applicant has done and so what approvals were required of them so the primary approval in non-fsec jurisdictional processes is going to be local land use approval whether it's a conditional use permit typically would be what the approval is there depending on the project there may be other state permits that are required for example if there were removable hill impacts there would need to be a removal fill permit from the department of state lands um and there can also be um additional deq uh permits that might be required for a variety of things for storm water discharges um uh you know um really kind of any number of things uh there's a lot of potential permits there but again from the county's perspective from the or from the local jurisdictions perspective the the primary approval there is the conditional use permit and my concern there is that in our site application criteria may be much much broader and specific and that the um the meeting of those approvals not defined uh may may not be relevant necessarily to ours and so i was wondering if they just should be uh indicate what approvals those are you know it's a question more than anything else councilmember condon i um that is something of course that the uh department staff could take a look at the the the approvals that are mentioned will presumably have been described at some point in the record um you know the applicant was attempting to demonstrate that it has proven itself a conscientious community partner has been able to meet its obligations under those those local land use approvals or or perhaps other statewide permits um they would have submitted evidence to back that up i don't personally not aware of what that evidence is um but um i'm concluding from the ale the from the hearing officer's reasoning here that he reviewed um the applicant's evidence um and and found that it demonstrates the claim that they've made about their status as a community partner for example or their ability to operate within the parameters of their i should say at this point that it's a um it's a requirement of the site certificate applications as part of the organizational expertise standard that applicants come forth with any permit violations um that resulted on their other projects right i just knew that the the um the applicable site certificate was not wasn't certain that the that those approvals was specific enough so that that's fine okay so uh then we'll move to the applicants scrivener's errors were good okay so the first couple changes here are misspellings of witness names pretty straightforward the third was having a cross-examination witness missed in in the list there and so another person who did appear and was cross-examined and then the final one again is the same change that the department requested concerning the autocorrect error here contentious versus constant inches so does any council member have any objection to any of those scrivener's error changes all right thank you um so then councilmember jenkins let's move to you and uh sarah if you could just go ahead and pull up the proposed order i uh our proposed contested case order sorry i and then we can go through and take a look at those page 30 and ask that kellen and sarah kind of help me with these to make sure i'm alterations to this can you advance to page 30. okay so in 112 there it is yeah so the second sentence mr n i kind of thought that that was supposed to be uh nicholas johnson instead of n walls nicholas johnson is resident of lake and the current executive director of mr n walls i don't know who he is also has prior experience with applicants through the development of others solar projects was that supposed to be nicholas johnson in that second sentence i can double check i mean it seems like it makes sense but i can double check this exhibit reference if you'd like yeah i think we ought to be accurate there then advance to page 62. some jet gym walls jim or james walls testified at the cross-examination provided the declaration as an applicant declaration of jim walls founding director of lake county resources initiative lrci okay that probably should have been a separate finding then because the third sentence then says mr johnson's experience so i don't know you know there there's not a linkage there between the three sentences sorry wally can you hear me i just want to be able to mark your edits as we're going through them and not sure if i know how to do that easily let me just work it there i'm making note of them as well okay all age 62. under uh opinion yeah so um the first word there i think is and then i don't think you need the last word in the sentence generally it's a repeat page 84 be the bottom of the second full yeah so the the oregon administrative rule reference there um 345-002 i think that's supposed to be dash 022 because that's the section we're talking about all the way through this part of the discussion so you might check that and this is real picky bottom of towards the bottom of the page where it says related to economic development comma i suppose supposed to be states s t a i think that's it all right thank you councilmember jenkins and i'm um assuming that there are no concerns with those modifications from any other council member we have now reached the part where i i think it is um appropriate to revisit the um fire protection issue and language because the next step beyond this would",

        "text": " your pitch for rack members to just say help us um make this still meeting our legal requirements but clarifying our intent and and hopefully members of the public can help us with that thank you it's a good question though uh it is something we think about and is one of the biggest challenges so for sure uh go ahead and go to the next SL so uh sort of have decided that around this this rack size is typically worked for us in the past uh I know some and I have since learned uh and working with other uh rle making coordinators that there are some racks that are enormous but uh we typically don't get much more than this even if I ask more you know let's say I ask 30 people I might get an eight you know so but we do try to kind of get a representative rack uh and uh it would look something like this but you know if we could if we could fill it it would be as around well so anybody have any thoughts about the rock makeup the visual making chair how yeah can't I'm just curious about like you said the public is one of your more challenging positions to fill how has that been in the past with BR making have you been able to get volunteers yeah we've actually had uh members who represent public interest for each the rle making however uh the pool of people who represent the public who who would then also be interested in being on a rule making like this uh is you know you know I can count them on my hands so we typically like the rest you know like the investor owned utilities we're not constantly seeing a change on that front I mean it's been the same for years uh our public bucket is kind of similar to that so we have people who have expressed interest in a lot of aspects of our role making and deciding projects and they typically are the people who will say who will answer the call and say yes I'll I'll be involved in this rule making but we're always trying to think of ways to rot our reach Beyond sort of the usual uh suspects which is why we we did do the re effort for our last most recent rle making uh to actually just directly reach out to sort of folks that have never expressed an interest who didn't even know what we you know that this exists had never been on Iraq before so we're we're always trying to think of new new approaches yeah I think maybe one concern I might have is that you end up having the same people on these racks reoccurring and that would be something that I think that the council should work on um a broader scope there if we can I know it's challenging though to to the roles but if we have the same people constantly serving then we might get the same answers every time absolutely councelor G when we reach out to the counties um I was thinking about like the port commissions and things do we approach them like hey would you like to do this versus can you you know put it in your own minutes and advertise it through your own your own communication I I don't know but my thought is if we reach out to the port it' be like okay well there's what three Commissioners in Moro County they're like I I don't have time for that but are we asking them to communicate it to their constituency the forward so and I typically don't I mean I might you know send a notice to you know all the counties in hear back from three of them who say no the rest I don't even get responses and typically uh the only County involvement we get is from AOC the association of you know Oregon County so um uh they depending on the rle making they they'll they're the the only County involvement we get and likewise with the tribes I I've never heard back from the tribes on any rle making so but we we still reach out to them chair how yeah c um just a thought here um I know most boards and commissions and whatnot have a consent calendar and maybe um a letter that's sent to and put on their consent calendar that way they have to acknowledge it in somewhere you know an email is easy to bypass you know it's just easy to be like H I don't have time for that but if we put it in the public record maybe that would be some kind of you know better outcome as far as interests just a okay any other for huh yeah does she look familiar yes we want you to see uh yeah go ahead okay any further discussion from council do we have a this is an action item do we have a motion councelor gra Mr chair I move that the council initiate the application process phase we'll make turn on the right one we'll making with the scope and objectives presented recommended by staff staff and approve the creation of a rul making advisory committee I further move that the council delegate the authority to appoint specific members to the ruem advisory committee to the park Department do you have a second councelor Byer okay we've got the motion in a second uh secretary esterson could you read the role yes sir Katie IMS yes Kent how yes Cindy Condon yes Anne berer yes Perry choc toot yes and Marcy Grail yes motion carries Mr chair okay thank you so yeah thanks Mr Jackman that was well done um it's a break time do people want 10 15 what do you want to do 10 good okay well it's 933 so we'll take a 10minute break come back at 943 okay uh it's now 9:44 and I'd like to call the meeting back from recess and continue with the next agenda item which is public comment so um this time is reserved for the public to address the council regarding any item within Council jurisdiction that's not otherwise closed for comment and Nancy I'm going to need to ask you if we've got I I see you gave me uh one person here um that's in the room that'd like to provide public comment so we'll do that one and then we'll check the webinar and the phone uh after that so um Mr Jones we're ready to hear your comments welcome thank you chair how is this on no I push that button there you go you're on now thank you chair how and fellow council members uh I want to first thank you all again uh don't think for a minute I don't see this as a this opportunity to address this Council as a privilege and I always want to make sure that we do so in a respectful way myself and and my fellow community members have spoken and uh I just want to ensure that that all of our concerns are are communicated clearly and concisely with uh with all respect so I've attended a number of the last I'm sorry oh I'm sorry my name is Troy Jones thank you my name is Troy Jones um my address is 223 335 Gap Road in Oregon I've attended uh a number of meetings in the past and I've spoken about my concerns specifically to the inequities and some of the Oregon State statutes related to land use um I don't want to continue that same that same conversation today I think I've made myself clear on that matter uh a couple of my neighbors and my myself uh came to the meeting I believe it was in February and we spoke to the to the concern of uh water contamination and uh also the lack of an end of life policy for solar panels in the State uh that concern is still a legitimate uh the reason we're here is because there's a a proposal for a large solar facility near near our community uh it's nearly 1,600 the the notice of intent indicates it's nearly 1,600 acres and it's on uh zoned efu or exclusive Farm use properties that's high value exclusive uh uh use Farmland use and while this hasn't been formally applied the application hasn't been formally applied for yet uh we're trying to stay ahead of the pitch count we're trying to be proactive in our approach and our communication so the council is well aware of the concerns that that exist within the community a main and primary concern is the potential loss of that efu property I've spoken before in regard to the the amount of properties efu prop properties have been lost over the last number of years uh there's records that show as of 2022 up to 660,000 acres of Farmland has been lost to Urban growth boundaries and uh industrial sightings there's a multitude of other concerns that we have uh specifically to Wildfire concern uh Wildlife uh impacts and the loss of wetland well most of this property is considered farmed Wetlands which is also a huge concern to us we what we hope is our hope is is that our presence and our continued communication with fsac will uh have a positive impact on the council and the council will take these considerations into uh into their process as as it evolves and again all we're trying to do is stay ahead of this I I I I personally believe that if nothing was spoken of and it just comes about it'll be too late in the process and that's why we're that's why we're here that's why we're present um a lot of my neighbors and the community that I live in they're not able and capable of coming to the these meetings I know that uh WebEx is available to them but they're not always very good on the zoom in the WebEx type uh format so I come and I speak on behalf of the group and I appreciate that that you're your uh your patience and your thoughtfulness uh in regard to this perspect this particular project um I hope that you strongly will consider our concerns as this goes along as the process evolves we understand the entire uh flow process uh very clearly we understand how it evolves the public comment periods and that type of thing so it's uh again we just want to make sure that we're doing a good job of communicating our concerns before we get to those processes so with that I really appreciate your time thank you for your comment can I just ask a quick question um for you as you know um you know we get both side the the developer and certainly the people they're working with that want the project and others might not so um is the efu issue overriding if we had condition if there were condition suitable conditions to speak to the land use land use water not so much land use I guess uh but the water contamination the end of life of the solar panels those issues conditions were applied that recognize that and possible possible solutions",

        "text": " agencies but this uh rule making is is has been driven uh is on this list here because of a request by uh Kim Peacher who is interest who represents um DOD and then they are very very interested in being making sure that they are kept aware of projects and and sort of uh kept in the loop so to speak uh with respect to potential energy projects and and the possibility might have to impact you know dod you know defense space or what have you uh they just want to make sure that that they they're kept in the loop and uh so that that role making is on the schedule for that reason any questions about that one no um all right let's move to the next slide so here we have the projects for 2026 and Beyond so uh there certainly could be some I'm sorry I'd like having a delayed reaction to that when I'm I'm processing uh this for the record this is chair Grail are we has this been a problem is it just something that they have a need of yes sir please yeah thank you for the record to fet um this is a request made by um you know came on behalf of the dod in the in the Clearing House um because as Tom said they're very interested particularly with renewable energy projects and the potential impacts of those projects to either physical military assets or training kind of grounds either early on the ground or or in the air so renewable energy facilities you know can and do uh impact you know their ability to you know conduct military Readiness exercises and and so it's a very real thing um this issue came about several years ago with the um saddle but case um I think that predated most of council members it was a wind turbin proposed in military training routes around the bourman bombing range and there had been a lot of issues some County projects had been approved and had created incursions in those military training routes maybe some FC projects and I think when at that point the dod got involved was a little bit sort of late in the process you know and and had some pretty significant impacts to to that particular project since then we have been very um proactive in communicating with you know her Kim's predecessor Kim the dod it works fine right now there is good there is good communication and information um and I'm not aware of any circumstances where they haven't been made aware early of projects however that's not a requirement it's not in rule it's basically we recognize we staff recognize the purpose and value of that and and take it upon ourselves to make sure that that happens I think the issue and concern is what if we change our mind or or people in the future don't have that same sensibility so the idea is to put it in rule to ensure essentially what we're already doing um and so we're you know we don't have any we staff don't have any concerns about doing that um but like I said for for now with our current staff it's already being done um just not on a from a regulatory standpoint on a this is good um public business standpoint thank you for the clarification I just I think all of us in our work lives have had to um try to quote correct something for you know one situation that did not require a big thing to correct and I basically wanted to make sure we were not taking on an Endeavor to over correct thank you so I I don't have an issue with it I just wanted to understand and I do I mean since I just switch jobs I do understand what happens when a person who has been doing something is no longer there so you and your staff are there I can understand their concern so thank you for that clarification so uh yeah yeah I think any other questions on that particular one okay so for it's difficult to forecast Beyond I think at this point considering how ambitious our schedule is how whether we'll be you know what 2026 will look like um I imagine at least some of this schedule will see some slippage and and it'll and so there'll be some of these projects will slip into 2026 at this point the only thing that we know for sure is that there are a whole bunch of standards that we're going to look at as part of phase three and so as we kind of move forward and get through the 2024 2025 lists we're going to start seeing more more and more uh rule making projects that are specifically directed at various standards as part of our kind of phase three rule making effort so uh that's yeah that's where this slide looks the way it does any any other questions about and and obviously as we get closer we'll you know start evaluating which standards should we look at first should we group them should we do so we look at them by themselves uh you know what makes the most sense um yeah we're we're we're that's an eternity way but it is on the it is on the forecast that is where we're headed okay uh next slide so that's rule making projects this slide uh is just an informative slide about pending five-year reviews um you can see uh every time we have a a adopt new rules so it's literally it's just a sort of black and white if we even if we significantly amend a rule there is no statutory requirement that we look look at that if we create a new rule no matter how small if the new number is generated by the Secretary of State we are statutorily obligated to review that rule within uh five years to evaluate whether the rule had its intended effect whether the anticipated fiscal impact was you know underestimated overestimated uh whether we should repeal it or amend it uh whether we need it at all the impacts on small business so there's a there's a list of things we have to analyze as part of that but the next one just coincidentally or not is the uh review of the amendment rule making which is which is due on January 28th of next year so that is the next pending fiveyear review so we'll essentially be doing that as part of our Amendment rule making just you know as a matter of course uh and then any of the the rules that we generated this last year will be due in 2028 so uh which there were more than a few um but any questions about the fiveyear view or what's coming up okay well that brings us to public comments on the role making schedule so I will turn it over to Nancy to run that but if there are uh any any comments about what we've discussed so far with respect to the RO making schedule now's Now's the Time all right for the public comments period if you're on the line or online I should say um you're going to go ahead and click on the participants and you're going to see a little hand icon and you can click on that to raise your hand if you'd like to comment if you're on the phone you're going to press star three to um on your keypad to raise your hand and star three again to lower your hand at this point we do have a gentleman here in the room that is going to make some public comments if you'd like to go ahead and come up you can do good morning my name is uh Randy B I work for Oregon Military Department as the master planner for installations and I am here to uh make some comments for the record on the ru making schedule um I'm here early in the process because we're looking at essentially rule 241 the one that was discussed for the Federal agency coordination and and that's we know that that's probably not going to come up for discussion until next year uh but we wanted to put our marker down early and I typically speak extemporaneously but I've been asked to read some comments in other records so uh the Department of Defense through the Oregon Military Department and the department of the Navy has had a long and effective working relationship with Oregon Department of energy we have worked together and have consulted several times on proposed energy projects and that have potential impacts on military training and operations uh the Navy's Northwest training range complex out of Woodby Island and the Oregon Military Department's ground and air assets are critical to national uh are or a critical National Asset that enables War fighters to prepare for real world operations the NW TRC includes training and testing ranges and training routes throughout the Oregon in Washington which are connected to the restricted areas over Naval Weapon systems training facility in Borman within Oregon there are approximately 13,000 military personnel presently in this state including the Army and Air National Guard uh the Oregon Military Department manages and trains Oregon and Army Air National Guard uh and provides uh facilities and institutional support for them and responds to the governor's orders during peace time and during Naturals that natural disasters to sustain the military Mission and Associated required training the military is dependent on the support and cooperation of land use authorities and that includes Odo we have worked with the Oregon State and County stakeholders for years in support of compatible land air and sea uses utilizing DOD funding we recently completed a $1 million initiative to create an interactive mapping tool to facilitate notification and coordination with renewable energy and transmission stakeholders and Associated qualitative assessments this is known as the Oregon Renewable Energy site assessment also by its acronym oresa and another initiative looking at potential location for transmission infrastructure in support of offshore wind in southern Oregon and Northern California in 2019 House Bill 2329 included notification to the dod for energy projects permitted at the county level this is good it is necessary but it isn't in of itself insufficient We Believe notification by itself will not ensure early collaboration in favor of a win-win nor are there any assurances of addressing any potential adverse impacts to National Security uh currently we don't have a rule a rule or a viable process with odoe to ensure early notification of the dod for projects that are located in and around our critical training testing and operational areas the lack of notification has in the past resulted in additional time contested cases and outright removal of a project during construction is as Todd mentioned earlier with the vast majority of projects the implementation of a viable early notification policies in coordination with the military ensures that future land uses are compatible with military operations while fostering renewable energy and supporting of state regulations and policies the processes in place are ad hoc and create challenges with normal staff turnover and they don't provide a clear and transparent coordination process DOD is engaging early in this Ru making because proper development of these processes is critical for ensuring the",

        "text": " that was the best way to do it uh but we're certainly open to uh to ideas or people have feedback or or seen a better way to do it please let us know yeah the reason i bring that up is because we run into that with refunding permits when a general contractor applies for the permits pays for them requests a refund and then the question is is how does that money ultimately get back to the property owner that paid for that so it's just kind of the same thing on a lending agency side i'd imagine they'd they'd want their money back if they're lending money to a property owner we're paying or there's money going back to the property but not getting back to the agency it's just a thought maybe there's no grounds or even a worry about it just it's just kind of no i think that's an important thing to flag and that uh one i mean just you're talking about kind of the general contractor aspect of of them paying permits if we had a general contract or submitting permits and filling out an which we'd love for them to do you know are they putting up front some of the costs and expecting that incentive uh that's something to consider and we'll take a look at that great thank you so much chris um i don't see any other questions in the q a and i don't see any of their hands raised at this point so if anyone has any questions they can answer here or any questions they have about kind of what we're thinking with the program please let us know now and otherwise michael maybe you might want to doing the next couple slides and if we have some questions at the end we can oh we have one now kevin dial 802 perfect okay great so kevin adiana for a second it went right down but helen laura still has a hand up with some um then she's now unmuted and and helen you should be able to talk down thank you hi we can hear you helen oh okay i'm sorry um what are you doing right joined a little bit late and i was wondering if you could just briefly uh talk a little bit about 40 the 41 does that is that of qualification thing or um we had uh chris on the line i believe works for marion county in the building department and he mentioned that so far 41 percent of the homes that were lost have already been rebuilt and so that's what we're referring to at the 41 um there was a couple of questions about retroactivity of our program so if someone already felt can they take part and so we were just saying we're for some folks that'll be possible and um and that's what we're talking about the and if you're in the middle of rebuilding right now um is there something a person should do right away michael you can go ahead on that yeah hell that's a great question so uh we are kind of in the stage of right now designing a program and our goal would be to be able to offer something uh in in maybe around february or march of next year and so uh what we're designing is a program focused on energy efficiency uh and within that energy efficiency program there's a lot of efficiency gains in just getting people to build our current code so my first question would be helen how do you when you pulled permits was it to our current code and i guess i work on the assumption it was and so there there should be an incentive available to you if you built our current code and then there's also a certain opportunity to build above code so there's utility incentives and a variety of different programs to take advantage of of utility incentives and then we would also like to incentivize encourage people to build more energy efficiently and so taking a look at those different options and take a look at existing utility programs based on who your electric utility or gas utility may and then andy do you want to talk about with dcps fire hardening come the fire hardening options that are going to be sure uh like uh similar to department of energy we're still sort of developing the program but if you are in the process of rebuilding and you can talk to your contractor about uh things that's going to make the the building more resistant to fire damage things like ignition resistant siding and ignition resistant roofing things like that um those are going to be the types of things that our program is going to be incentivizing when it gets started up early next year ignition resistance is that the same as class a rated or yes classic rated roofing uh would be ignition resistant okay great yeah and all these programs so we've got program websites through the state agencies and we'll certainly share those links but there's also a feature where you can you can sign up to get email updates and so as we're starting to roll these programs up you can get those those email updates and and uh we'll start defining what kind of those menu of options and what those incentives are going to be and we'd love for you to to get those updates you kind of know how things are going how do you sign up for if you join our if you go to our website there's a a link that you you can click on and you can select what kind of information other updates you would like to receive on the program okay are you thank you yeah thank you alex um michael we do have a quick question in the q a and then we can go to kevin who has his hand raised so if someone wants to unmute kevin um i'll kevin i'll let you know when we're we're ready for you um but someone asked what about the gates area in linn county and just the flag that we have marion county here and and participating which is great um lynn county folks were also um but um but just know that the program will work in both places it just so happens that the marion county person is here and giving us a lot of information so it we um well it doesn't matter what you're in the program will be available and then um we can go ahead if that's that okay michael oh i just want a flag so it's available for uh any any uh survivors of the 2020 wildfires uh since there's been talk of of maybe including 2021 or or other other wildfires but at this point we're just focused on on damage from from those right and gates was heavily affected in the 2020 wildfire just happened to be on the other side of the rotor river over there um so uh kevin go ahead thanks for your patience so the two things the most of the energy efficiency will it also be linked with solar systems and solar power and then you talked about natural gas the second part of that is we have more restrictions on natural gas builds is that going to affect that as well michael yeah so kevin great question so these incentives aren't tied to solar i mean we would love for people to to engage and add solar to their property and we do have a separate program that's a solar and storage program that offers incentives for people and when they building a house or existing home or a business adding solar we certainly want you to take advantage of that and so i point you to our website to take a look at the solar and storage program and see if it's something you might be interested in and we certainly know a lot of utility programs offer incentives for solar and uh certainly take a look at all those different options but you don't you don't necessarily have to do uh uh solar or wind or any kind of renewable to participate in this program we're focused on energy efficiency and so that means just building your rebuilding that existing structure as energy efficiently as you can and so excuse me um and i guess your second question i guess about natural gas regulations so uh you know rebuilding with with natural gas certainly we're not going to impede that in any way and certainly we welcome whether a home is all electric or electric and gas or any kind of fuels we're kind of agnostic to do that we certainly just want people to still do our current code or build to above code an above code program and so you can certainly do that through electric utility or natural gas utility and um and there's for above code there's a reach code that you can certainly model after if you want to build above code and certainly if you have questions about that or that process feel free to send us questions uh in a next slide i will show you um actually here i'll just click it right now it's perfect it's 9 30 so thanks thank you christy and so uh you know we've got an intensive program page about this wildfire recovery incentive we've got kind of a process page of administrative rules you want to track how how the process is going and our additional meetings we've got a direct way to email us wildfire recovery at and we've got dcbs program here but ultimately what we want to focus on is kind of the program timeline that right now we're engaging all these community meetings uh we're going to start our rulemaking process there's a public comment period and we've got some draft rules to make sure uh we're doing what we can to help as many people as we and then at the end we're going to try to implement this program and be able to start cutting checks and helping people ideally in february of next year but in the end if you didn't have a chance today i know we're at time and we can certainly stay a little bit longer if people have additional questions but there is other there are other opportunities there's going to be future meetings and there also is a public comment portal that people can join and there's questions within that or there's a space where people can upload documents or or just write their thoughts and and their experiences and we we we're here to listen and we really do appreciate people taking the time to do that and it does inform our decisions in what we do do we have any other last questions that i need to hit on before uh before we go i believe you're on mute there's no other hands up and there's no one in the q a so i think we're good and then we plan on following up with people you have to give your email address to get in so we have your email address and we're planning to follow up with people with some of the links we talked about so that it's easier to access them so stay tuned for that okay thank you everybody for coming we appreciate it have",

        "text": " make sure that we can help youall with this planning so awesome um John you have your hand up and then we have a question in the chat as well you want to come unmute yeah thanks um I figured it be easier to unmute and ask this one I I think I understand the the the um requirements from the hb3 3630 there's there's a couple I don't uh entirely understand and um back on I think it's slide eight it says um the requirement is identify critical Public Services facilities where development of alternate energy generation and storage resources will meet local energy needs what does what does that mean is that is that are we talking micro grids or can you can you maybe paraphrase that for me uh sure I don't quite quite understand um yeah that is a great question so I mean the idea behind it is when the energy grid goes down making sure that your critical Public Service facilities have an energy resource a available to provide them with power and that is I think the simplest way to phrase that it could look like micro grids those are excellent it could look like backup generators it could look like thinking about additional fuel storage for those backup generators um thinking about your fuel points of distribution so that you can receive emergency fuel supplies it's pretty comprehensive and I think there's a lot of different ways that it can look based on what's available to your county what your county wants to go forward so in type um you know that's it's there's not a lot of specificity in what you have to do the idea is just to be making a plan for how you're going to support your critical Public Service facilities should they not already have those resources in place and and maybe if I might just add one more thing Hanna um I might look at a critical Public Service facility like a water treatment facility or a Wastewater Management Facility uh as an example I mean it could be a fire station it could be you know a hospital or or a health clinic but think often times I think of water and waste water facilities and if they don't have grid power how much energy do they need how much electricity do they need to continually to operate to provide water Wastewater facilities and services uh and then I think the phrasing simply this is a quote out of the statute by the way so Alternative Energy generation and storage resources you can take that for what it means I think it's exactly what Hannah talked about maybe there's a backup generator that uses diesel um then you have to think about fuel supply chains and fuel storage maybe there's an alternative that would have um some solar and a battery facility Al though that might not be sufficient for all of your needs for a major facility but major some type of facilities so I think it's really getting to the point where if you can look at identify First those critical Public Service facilities and then understand their energy needs and then sort of working what options might there be available um to meet that needs if grid power was down I would also just add as like a a plug for one of our other programs the community renewable energy program um or project uh grant program CP um again one of those things that this plan can identify is those places like your um you know your police station or your sheriff's office or whatever that probably that might not have that backup or needs additional backup we have a program uh CP which is up to $100,000 for planning processes and up to a million dollars for construction of um renewable energy on um for public entities so again um this flow this plan would flow perfectly into a next step and a next phase of another program that we have access for so don't feel um overwhelmed if you know you have all these buildings that don't have backup power and you know they need them we also have um programs for that um the next question in the um in the chat is from Taylor R Bowski um when does this g g Grant gain approvals are they approved as they are submitted or are they all reviewed after February of 2025 ah Taylor that's an excellent question and um yeah I feel a little bit uh silly for not clarifying that up front um so we'll be reviewing applications as they come in so not waiting till February 2025 um it should be a pretty quick turnaround to look over that application make sure that's all filled out that we don't have any questions and then from there we'll move into the performance agreement process provided that it's all good to go so yeah perfect and then the next question in the chat is from Scott your discussion of plan requirement suggested that a plan must address a whole lot of things power ouges energy infrastructure resilience hubs energy consumption Etc must all those things be addressed or are those options per plan contents yeah Scott I I don't know if you're comfortable coming on to clarify because I think I'm a little bit unsure because I'm sure in going over the plan requirements I also mentioned a lot of examples of what that could like look like but I guess I'll just say all those bullet points on these slides like the one that's still up are the plan content requirements and we do have the statute linked with that it is laid out in the applications but if you do want to hop off mute and clarify to make sure I'm answering your question that'd be great yeah my my understanding can you hear me okay yep yeah my understanding from looking at your resource page page um was that a plan could address a whole bunch of different things doesn't have to address all of those things that you talked about it it could go down one you know about fuel it could go down a power thing it could go down a critical facility thing but the way uh you were presenting the plan requirements it sounded like all of those different components needed to be included in your plan so yeah yeah so all of these you know I don't really want to make you look through that and get SI going through all those bullets but all those plan requirements that we went over those do all need to be addressed to some extent within your plan however the exact specifics of what that looks like in terms of which alternate energy generation or storage resources um that's where it can be County driven um in terms of thinking about how you are going to put that on the ground or you know this one opportunities to coordinate and locate energy infrastructure development to align with and support critical public services facility what that energy infrastructure is and those opportunities are again County driven but um your plan does need to be uh meeting those mapping requirements looking at the energy inventory needs of your critical Public Service facilities if you're getting what I'm trying to say um So within that you know we understand there's $50,000 there's capacity constraints um for some of our counties that you know there might be a lot of critical Public Service facilities in that definition and I think we get that you do need to meet all those requirements to some extent if that means you're going to dive into further depth on your top priority critical Public Service facilities and you can um acknowledge your prioritization and why I think that is fine um but you should be meeting all those requirements to some extent if that is clear yeah they yeah I guess it's clear but it it still for me it compounds the the um the planning process in terms of all the things you have to address let me give you a couple examples we did a we created a fuel emergency fuel plan several years ago it needs to be further developed and it needs particularly to focus on fuel planning points of distribution and what that looks like but that wouldn't talk anything about power outages it wouldn't talk about resilience hubs necessarily it wouldn't address other things that it sounds like have to be in the plan another example doe many years ago 2010 I I think was the last time asked us to to create a list of all the uh backup generators at critical facilities uh in our in our counties and that list hasn't been updated really since 2010 2014 I think somewhere in that time frame uh and this grant could be an opportunity for us to go back and connect update that and connect it perhaps to some elements of what you just described but again it may not talk about uh resilience hubs or power outages or mapping the inter uh electrical infrastructure so that's where I'm confused about you know how would we do some of those other projects updating things and still address all this other stuff so yeah um so I think that I guess in terms of the confusion your your inclination to think that you do need to address those other components is true so you know if you decided that you were going to look at all your critical Public Service facilities and you wanted to support them all with back up energy generation and really think through getting fuel storage and fuel distribution as your approach that would be great but you would still need to think about Community resilience centers and mapping your energy infrastructure to meet the requirements of this plan um so yeah so I think that is the answer okay thank you you're um uh just as a note Tamara yes we are putting this slides on the um on the project page which is put in in the chat a couple of times um and the slides from the last um webinar are up and they have not changed that often so if you want to pull those up right now um it's a good option um there's a hand raised from Holly Holly if you want to unmute yourself hi good afternoon um I guess my biggest concern on this is the requirements and the money allocation um $50,000 in my experience is not would not even come close to covering the requirements for this so I'm just really curious how um others or brainstorm on leveraging you know does the technical assistance does that count against the $50,000 is it included in it like what's the Matrix to actually make this work I would imagine the majority of counties don't have a person who does energy resiliency so there's not there's not an entity within my County that's like oh yeah this makes sense I would have no idea how to write scope of work or even um you know start this project and then $50,000 to bring on a consultant to run it for me completely is not even close to that so how do we leverage the funding um Andor all of the things that have to get done when um this is kind of outside of normal scope of work currently yeah that's a that's a great question um",

controlled directly by an electric utility when they might need to reduce demand and then renewable hydrogen can also be a resource for meeting electric load either through combustion in a turbine or via fuel cells and so that's what we'll be looking at as that study requirement and then the study report must also provide a discussion of the forecasted costs of renewable hydrogen and how these costs might affect adoption in the state now we're not going to be doing um any forecasting ourself uh the build does ask us to rely on existing data but we will certainly take that data and then look at it through the context of and finally the study must identify the many barriers to adoption of renewable hydrogen in so that's what's required for the study um because there are a lot of technical aspects to consideration of renewable we have decided to put together a technical advisory committee or tac and the goal of this tack is to have a group of technical experts from the public and non-profit sectors who can provide unbiased feedback on data sources to the extent possible study assumptions and other aspects of the study in putting together the tac we very much sought out those who could serve as experts without necessarily serving as advocates of a specific point of view as i said as much as possible so thus the attack is comprised of academic a national lab the power council our sister agency odot who is working on a study related to hydrogen in the transportation sector and then we also have uh nia the northwest energy efficiency alliance we also have some other folks that we've invited to the tech that we're still working with um that includes stanford university another national lab and and then you'll see here we have a couple of folks listed as experts on and those were some folks that were unable to participate in the tap due to time constraints but have offered to serve as experts on call and so this includes the national renewable energy lab and jc dream which is a washington organization focused on reducing the use of rare earth metal metals pardon me in energy applications including hydrogen so the timeline for this study is that it's due to the legislature in september on september 15 2022. so we have started work on the study this fall but the timeline shows the time remaining between now and september so the research and analysis portion of the study is going to be completed between now and hopefully mid quarter one of next year um january or february though that depends on how busy the legislative session keeps us and then after that we're going to begin drafting the study report in terms of communicating with you about the study we have envisioned three stakeholder workshops so today is the first one and then we expect to have one in the first quarter of 2022 that details the initial findings of the study and gives us an up gives you an opportunity to provide us some feedback and then another one in q2 that details those final findings and so the goal is to keep you informed um on the results of the study and then as i said to to provide you an opportunity to give feedback on those results for example did we miss an important piece of data or forget to include a relevant sector are the assumptions that we made in our analyses reasonable we will certainly also be asking these questions of our technical experts on the tag once the study is complete and report and the report is submitted to legislature we'll certainly follow up presentations on our findings as well so that's the study in a nutshell and i know you have questions or at least i hope you have questions and comments um but first as i said we're gonna go right into the hydrogen 101 and so that may answer some of the questions that you have about hydrogen and renewable hydrogen in general and perhaps about the study but also hopefully gives us a little bit of common ground so on to the 101 let's go over a few things about hydrogen what is it i'm so glad you asked no really um so hydrogen is easily the most abundant element in the universe it's in the sun it's in stars jupiter is mostly hydrogen here on earth most of our hydrogen is found in water there is a tiny little bit in our atmosphere um but it usually just escapes the atmosphere hydrogen is also the lightest element and it has the lowest density of all and compared to conventional fuels hydrogen has a low volumetric energy density in both gas and liquid form now you may have heard people refer to hydrogen as an energy carrier as opposed to an energy source and it's true energy sources are the original source of energy so think solar radiation in the form of sunlight or wind or hydrocarbons and some energy sources are also the energy carriers like fossil fuels in that they don't really need to be you know they their energy can be transported and used by energy consumers in the same or almost same form in which it was found but many energy sources have to first be converted to what we call an energy carrier um before we can actually use them so for example solar radiation has to hit pv panel so hydrogen thus is a carrier of the energy found in another energy resource so for example if you do steam reformation of natural gas or if you use a resource to generate electricity which is also an energy carrier and then use that to produce hydrogen as an energy fyi i use this information at cocktail parties all the time that gets us to those pathways for converting energy sources to hydrogen this chart is meant to confuse you i'm actually not um it's actually really um in that it shows some of the pathways production of hydrogen um but not all of them and so we have pathways here for computing converting fossil fuels to hydrogen and then um you know we have in red uh conversion pathways for nuclear energy and then what we're really interested in are those pathways that are green and so these are some of the pathways for producing hydrogen and so here are some diagrams that are hopefully easier to follow and so these show some of the main pathways for producing hydrogen from renewable sources of energy now down here we have renewable energy which is going to include renewable electricity from wind and solar and one way that we use that produce hydrogen is electrolysis and that may be the pathway that most of you are familiar with and that's where you run electricity through water to crack it into its components of hydrogen and oxygen but it is by no means the only pathway so for example we have a few different pathways for biomass and this can include um uh dry feedstocks like agricultural residues i could also include wet feedstocks um like things from um and biofuels like um things from anaerobic digestion um at dairies or from wastewater treatment plants um we also i mentioned earlier steam reformation of uh like for example natural gas which is how most of the hydrogen produced used today is produced we can also do that reformation process on biomass and biofuels so these are some of the you know so these are some of the main renewable pathways for renewable hydrogen production that we're going to look at in the study one of the things that we should mention is how we define renewable energy or green i'm sorry renewable hydrogen or green hydrogen so we very helpfully have that definition for the study given to us in the bill but we haven't had any you know federal definitions or other definitions in in state law um until recently and so the uh the federal infrastructure bill that passed in august finally gave us a definition for renewable hydrogen in u.s law and actually it's more definition for clean hydrogen and it defines clean hydrogen as that produced with two kilograms or less of carbon dioxide equivalent produced at the site of production for each kilogram of hydrogen produced and so this is a carbon intensity approach to defining hydrogen as clean or renewable so you know you may have heard of gray or blue or green hydrogen the industry is really moving away from spectrum of colors which doesn't necessarily tell us a lot about the environmental impact of renewable hydrogen or of hydrogen from other non-renewable sources and instead is moving towards a carbon intensity which is actually how for example oregon's clean fuels program and california's low carbon fuel standard address clean fuels okay sorry and so hydrogen storage um hydrogen can be a little bit tricky to store uh it's usually so um there's two main ways that it's stored we've got physical storage here on the left and then we've got chemical storage on the right so physical storage uh it's going to be stored either as a gas or a liquid um as a gas it typically requires high pressure tanks where storage of hydrogen as a liquid requires cryogenic which is because of the boiling point of hydrogen um on the chemical side hydrogen can be stored on the surfaces of solids or even within solids um there's been a lot of work going on at national labs and academic regarding chemical storage of hydrogen and how to make it more efficient um and then we have down here at the bottom right um there's a mention of um ammonia and you may have heard of ammonia being used as a promising hydrogen carrier um and that's due to its high hydrogen content and there's already an established distribution network um ammonia is you know easier to move around and the hydrogen can then later be released on demand from ammonia so that's also considered a storage medium for hydrogen there's also geologic storage um such as feet in geological features such as salt caverns so this is a graphic some folks promoting a an energy storage project in utah called aces or advanced clean energy storage and their goal for this project is to produce renewable hydrogen and then compress it and store it in existing salt caverns and it is being billed as largest um energy storage project in the world the only problem with this is that salt caverns aren't distributed everywhere they are just in kind of narrow areas within the world and within the us with respect to moving around hydrogen um there are kind of three main ways that it's currently distributed so the first is within pipelines and there are some pipelines in the u.s that are dedicated to",

        "text": "sorry guys a lot of talking on mute always exciting i'm just saying we're getting ready to get started um we're just going to give people a few minutes because we just opened the webinar and so some people might have been getting like uh not open yet message and for those of you who called in if you want to get on the webinar um not on your phones because they see a couple of you on the phone it might have been that you were getting that message so go ahead and you can try now and the webinar is open now and thanks everyone for joining us we'll get started in just a minute or so okay hopefully by now everyone's had a chance to to get on um again if you had a if you had trouble getting on you can try again we just didn't have the webinar fully open and so some people were seeing an error um we're really excited to have such great turnout so thank you so much for joining us by way of introductions my name is christy split and i'm the oregon department of energy's government relations coordinator and i'll facilitate our conversation today i'd really like to thank the special districts association of oregon and the oregon association of clean water agencies for bringing us all together for what i think is an exciting opportunity for oregon's communities an energy resilience and renewable energy grant program that can support both planning and projects so as we get started i hope everyone can just take a minute and introduce yourselves in the chat be great to get your name um what sort of district you're representing where you're located that would all be really great information for us and to kind of help us all get to know who's in the crowd a little bit better so please take a minute to do that and hopefully my department of energy colleagues can do the same um so let's see so just a quick note on agenda today we're gonna go over the program itself talk a little bit about a project example just to kind of get those creative juices flowing and give you an idea of the type of project we could imagine being funded for for this program and then we'll also you'll also be the first people to kind of get a tour through our application process we want to save plenty of time for q a so you can expect that our kind of program here at the beginning will run about 15 to 20 minutes and the bulk of our time together will be for you to ask questions of myself and our program staff so um we will ask that folks raise their hands and then we can unmute you to have you ask questions and then you can also raise questions in the ch ask questions in the chat and i'll keep an eye on those and i might wait to ask and um ask the questions in the chat during the qa and in a part or i might interrupt along the way so um so that's that's sort of our basic we are in webex which for those of you who saw the corrected link is just always sort of an interesting beast and a lot of us are more used to other webinar formats like zoom so i just wanted to quickly share just a little guides of what your screen should look like for some people it's black mine's black not white i don't know but other people see why i don't understand how how it's different for different people but whatever you're seeing you should see something like the screen here and then you should see information on the panel list and a place where the chat's located mainly i just want to make sure everyone sees that they how to raise your hand you can raise your hand at the very bottom where little smiley face is if you click on that raising your hand is the top option there there's also an option to raise your hand next to your name on in the margin so um feel free to take a look make sure that you know how to raise your hand and we'll give people a second to mess around with that if you have it i see a lot of people using the chat so you figured that out but if you have any questions feel free to raise your hand and i can call on you if you have any specific questions about the agenda you can put that in the chat let's give a awkward moment of silence for that to happen and then we do have a couple of people on the phone a good reminder from a colleague just now um i believe you just i i it's one stars three and one star six and i always get worried but um i believe you click star three to raise your hand and then star six to unmute so um i'll confirm that and say it again in a minute um the next time i have an opportunity to talk because oh i did it right so star three to raise your hand star six to unmute so um that's how you'll participate so i don't see any questions in the chat although i do see lots of great introductions from around the state and we'll just move on to the program and like i said we'll get have plenty of time for q a after we kind of run through run through our pro prepared piece here so um for now i'm going to hand things over to rob delmar and to james cogle who are certified smart people when it comes to this new program so rob i'll go to the next slide and let you go thank you christy and i'm rob delmar i'm a senior policy analyst with oregon department of energy and i helped to put this program together over the last six months or so um house bill 2021 also known as the 100 clean energy for all bill established the new community renewable energy grant program and the purpose of the program as stated in the bill is to offset costs of planning and developing community renewable energy support projects in traditionally underserved communities promote small-scale community renewable energy projects and finally provide direct benefits to communities by improving energy resilience creating local jobs promoting economic development and offsetting local energy costs next slide please so one of the features that distinguishes this program from previous programs in oregon is that it's only open to public bodies applicants include tribes cities counties and other public bodies including these special districts and there is an exclusion in the bill for cities over 500 000 which in oregon of course includes only the program is also open to consumer-owned utilities the portland exclusion was done in recognition of the portland clean energy which can provide funding for similar types of projects within portland and so next slide please focus of the program another feature of the program is its focus on community energy resilience the bill establishes carve-outs where 50 or more of the funding must go to community energy resilience projects and 50 or more of the funding must be for projects that serve qualifying and we'll look at what that means in a next slide please so qualifying communities include communities of color low-income communities tribal rural and coastal communities and other traditionally underrepresented communities in oregon the definition of the bill is is fairly we're hoping to see projects kind of in every corner of the state according to these um you know the carve out to get 50 of the funds to these communities next slide please the bill also called for an advisory to work with the department of energy on program design and now program you'll see that clean water agencies had allen johnson from city aggression gresham representing clean water agencies we also have les perkins of the farmer's irrigation district on our committee and so we had a really good group of folks help us put this together and they're going to continue to help us implement the program next slide please since the passage of house bill 2021 we've been very busy standing up the new in the summer of 2021 photo staff were assigned to the project and developed an implementation plan including operational staffing and i.t changes within the agency in september we recruited the stakeholder advisory committee to help guide the program design develop the program rules and that effort resulted in draft rules being posted with the secretary of state's office on january 1st and those rules are now final our opportunity announcements for the program came out on march 7th next slide so we before we move on to the specific grant opportunities i'd like to walk a project that the eugene water and electric board completed a few years ago and the city of eugene like much of western oregon could be subject to significant damage from a cascadia earthquake and as a utility that manages both electricity and water services e-web recognized the importance of energy and water delivery and was well positioned to support a resilience and disaster recovery within eugene that could address both the energy and water issues next slide please um so eweb considered community energy resilience based on the rule of threes and that is in the first three days provide access to drinking water in the first three weeks repower critical facilities and in the first three months complete system repairs and restore restore service next slide please so as a result of their planning efforts eweb developed the grid edge demonstration project and pictured over on the right hand side of the screen some of the elements the project utilized an existing 50 kilowatt pv system on the roof of the howard elementary school and added a battery storage system and a new potable water well next slide please and the result is a facility that can serve as a potable water fill station for the community in the event of a power outage the school building is also provided with backup power and serves as an emergency shelter the system provides value to the in addition to the value of the water and energy resilience features for example the school benefits from energy bill savings and e-web is able to use the batteries on this site to provide grid services during their day-to-day operations next slide this is a schematic diagram of the microgrid system showing electric loads that can be served by the system during a power so the battery storage units and they are shown as bess they're the black ones on the bottom battery energy storage systems those are able to provide power to the water well and the backup loads within the school and you can see that there's a switch shown at the main breaker and that's to ensure that this micro grid is isolated from the rest of eweb's power grid in the event of a power outage and that's to provide safety to their line workers and so now that the program is essentially up and running we've we've got staff to implement the",

        "text": " and uh since covid I you know kind of brought it back to life and our committee our three priorities is Outreach education both internal and outside and as well as recommendations and research about various um ways we can improve as an agency and then also um the sustainability Committee just initiated a greenhouse gas emissions inventory over calendar year 2022 we just got the results about a month or so ago and they were presented to our board at the August work session and then from the Baseline information it's going to feed into our climate action plan so we're going through writing of the scope right now and the procurement process in order to bring uh consultant on to help us develop the kind of action plan that isn't complementary to our local Regional Partners including City of Salem and then also the county and the state level organ ODOT and then um so the climate action plan is a huge Initiative for the district it's one of our 13 activities for two fiscal year 24 which we're currently in right now and uh to kind of get started we're also Marion County Earthwise certified since 2013. uh and then we're signatory for after sustainability commitment after is the American public transportation Association we committed to aligning our initiatives with um with APTA through a commitment program and then finally uh just a highlight that you know in everything we do in regards to development of Transit centers both ktc and future projects uh we're always keeping sustainability at the Forefront of our mind really and almost you know every decision we're making as a district and um so it's it's something I would I would like to point out as well and that concludes my portion of the presentation but I'd love to answer any questions if I if I can so I could help but notice the picture of the where all the buses are yes do you have any plans eventually putting sort of like solar canopy or anything over the parking area no explicit plans of course with um charging infrastructure everything's kind of been brought up I don't know if that's an immediate future but I yeah I do know there would be some regulations coming online about um Sheltering uh parking lots over a half acre just going from the state oh okay so I don't find out a mandate to go and do what it's already built something to be aware of thank you thank you so what's going on ridership he has a perfect person in here and that's the same goal is really cool but if nobody's getting on the bus ridership on the increase uh month over month ever since 2020 we've been seeing double-digit increases which is exciting uh a lot of that has to do with our youth ridership program that we're partners with City on we're really excited about our electronic Fair program and how that's going to be creating more opportunities for for folks uh it's it's more Equitable program with the fair capping system where you basically earn a month pass as you pay as you go and it takes about 28-29 Brides so about 14 or 15 days to earn that month pass but uh for those consistent writers a lot of them were it would be hard to pay out the 45 dollars in one payment but a dollar sixty or three three dollars 20 cents for a day pass each day is a lot easier for folks especially families um so um yeah I we've just been tracking up and up uh so that things are looking good I have a question about the electronic uh bear system so I I downloaded the app and loaded some money onto it and I'm just curious so I I haven't used it yet but I did download the app and have money for someone I did I'm ready to go okay do you have that money or is that like sitting with this app company like if I haven't actually used further I was just curious yeah yeah so I believe it's in a chariot's account okay you wouldn't be able to go to Eugene and no no no no no no I just meant like some app company had do they have it or does chariots actually get the money once I love it uh Chris do you know the answer to that I don't know the technicalities I was gonna we'll have to check into um I am not a hundred percent sure on we can get back to you good question I was just curious I'm just wondering also how is it impacted ridership have you noticed and people have you received many complaints from people not being able to access the platform or how's that going it's really going well uh Chris do you have any information on that I think yeah so I know in the first month we had over a thousand uh people sign up for the program um and that's between the card and um and the new and the app um we haven't abandoned any of our previous methods so uh so all of the previous uh Fair media that was um is still in place uh it takes time to to to move that stuff out and so and getting the adoption so you can't we don't we didn't want to just change day one and force everybody so all of the previous options are still there and slowly over time we'll uh move those out uh for as we get more adoption to the e-pair program so you can you can still play cash is that what you're saying you will always be able to pay cash there's uh we there's uh Equity issues with removing cash as an option there will always be a or as far as I see into the future a cash option thanks I wanted to ask a little bit more about the um the business I don't know what your program's name is but where businesses can purchase I know that that's been a challenge um I think personally my I think because of the requirement that had been in place or if you want to do it you have to you have to purchase one for every employee so for instance the City of Salem has 1350 employees but not all of them would be riding the bus wouldn't be practical but there could be a nice core number of people where it would be and I'm wondering have you thought about it or have you implemented anything to relax those requirements so we maybe we could purchase a smaller number than that that's a great Point um our chief Planning and Development officer Sophie Zoom is on and he may be able to answer that we just had a discussion last week about this very yep good morning I'm not sure if you can see me it's really weird um all right can you hear me though I mean yeah yeah all right sorry about that I've been a little late um yes I can expand on that so and this is my second month so I started on July 31st and uh since then we have started expanding and exploring different Mobility options including the group Pass Program so uh Kiki has been working on this and she kind of like informed me that there has been some additional demand for flexibility in the program and we are as we speak working on those criteria how we can reach out to more people and to fit their needs and especially the employers need and to answer your question yes we are working on it and then we will be in touch with you if that's the case and then see how we can better serve the need of the community and the employer as well um yeah so two short answer is we'll get back to you and see how thank you I really this one's really important I mean of all the questions I've asked that you might get back to me on this is the only one that really matters so again this is the only one that really could impact climate in our you know climate action initiatives in our city and how and actually have a meaningful impact on greenhouse gas reduction so and not just with the City of Salem I've heard it from others I know uh there are other large employers who might be interested as well or even maybe even not so large employers so I think that as much flexibility as you can build into that I think it will increase your ridership and I think um you know that's good when your ridership goes up that's you know we all benefit yep right on I have a few different questions I've tried to group them in topics for you um so I want to start out first with an easy question and that is how are you educating the public on the youth uh free ridership program that you're offering there's been a lot of communication with the school district uh there's a video that has been developed that will be released to all students and through I think the app that Salem Kaiser School District uses here in the next couple um I have not been on that initiative I don't know if anybody else has more to yes I can chime in sorry um yes so that video is going to be it's going through final review right now as we speak sometime mid-september if that I can say that sometime this week or next week we would be able to go live and then that we're working with the Salem uh School District as well and uh working on a roll-up plan so how we can better Outreach to those communities and working with other stakeholders so yeah that work is in progress and sometime this week or by next week hopefully we'll be go live great thank you aggregation system Plan update happening soon I would love to hear more about your rapid transit goals for the future um any kind of ideas on how we can work with uh bus lane or bus lanes and bike lanes and how those two things should function really well together um in the space that we have um we're a pretty well built out so we need to use the curb to curve that we have so how do we use that and benefit both of those types modes of transportation and I'd also love an update on any kind of South Salem Transit Center all right I'll take a stab at those questions first and then maybe Chris and trophy can chime in uh yeah I guess I'll start with the South Salem Transit Center we're working with the consultant pivot architecture as we speak and the board is going to be I believe looking at the the conceptual drawings that have been developed at their work session on the 14th of this week um so we're really in motion to get to a point where we can get the point where we're choosing the the actual plot there's two choices right now one on the north east corner of Wilton commercial and one on the Southeast so they need to make a decision of so same intersection just",

upon the ru making you know they may or may not be interested typically like a a public utility district or a consumer owned utility wouldn't really be part of our process you know and UMO electric is kind of a weird one because it's sort of in between um it's certainly gotten a lot bigger you know and it's not a Pacific core it's not a Portland General Electric but it's also not a consumer own utility and I don't know exactly what category it's in it's kind of in that sort of um in between category between those but but it's a good reminder that I think they're a valid um uh one and and while that may not be a perfect categorization we would I would see that they would fall within that thank you for that I just I want people to recognize that the emphasis on guidance like we have the ability to make change and I don't want somebody to see that list and automatically think they're they're out because they didn't fit in our box somewhere so uh to be just as a reminder what we proposed at the last council meeting and I'm just going to begin with this but essentially I'm going to distribute a a sort of 2024 outlook for all of our potential rule makings it will include this one and we are going to cast a very wide net in terms of seeking interest so whereas previously we were sort of like doing targeted you know let's Okay we want two investor own utilities let's contact investor on utilities and grab two of them you know sort of an approach uh I think this time around we're going to we are going to cast a very wide net uh for all the rulemakings and so you know if the um matilla Co-op you know follows our process and it and expresses interest in joining like we would certainly you know if it made sense given the other interest we would we wouldn't say you don't perfectly fit one of these you're not going to be not going to be and this is just sort of a a general guideline we're trying to sort of balance you know essentially applicants and non-applicants and with sort of kind of reviewing agency kind of straddling the middle there um but you know representing the public as well uh so yeah it's sort of remain we sort of this is kind of a hope but we kind of have to go off of what you know actual this is a volunteer process so we kind of have to base the rack based on who actually calls us you know responds to our our um requests for interest but we are going to be attempting to really spread the net widely and um hopefully that allows us to make the best racks that we can for each of these R makings thank you for that and I just will add that that's one of the reasons why I think everyone on this Council now no pressure Katie uh but we've been very committed about making sure that we go to the areas where the projects are because we want to get that involvement and I think this is just another way that aligns with that objective that we share okay um that brings us straight Council deliberation decisionmaking thank you Tom so um Tom has concluded his presentation on uh the 2024 site certificate Amendment Ru making and at this time I would um ask that if we have a motion on this action council member oh I'll go for it okay um Madam chair I move this is Kent and I move that the council authorize informal initiation of the 2024 site certificate Amendment Ru making as presented and recommended by staff thank you Vice chair how do we have a second council member Condon um thank you I'll second that motion thank you are there any additional comments council member delin council member chak we don't hear any comments we're going to call the role Mr secretary please call the role yes Richard yes thank you council member develin Kent how yes Cindy Condon yes Ann berer yes Perry choc toot yes thank you coun M CH toot Marcy Grail yes motion carries Madam chair thank you Mr secretary Tom thank you apparently we'll be seeing you a lot this year so I will be out next uh next uh month so I I believe Chris or someone else will be handling the public hearing for the contested case r making but yes uh for the rest of the year you'll be seeing a whole lot of me right on well thank you we appreciate your efforts we will look forward to hearing about it all right well that concludes agenda item C and we have already taken a break so I think we're going to motor pass that for now and that gets us to agenda item D which is the public comment period this is an information item where this time is reserved for the public to address the council regarding any item within Council jurisdiction that is not otherwise closed for comment um at this time we have we you have uh a member of the public here in the room three four oh I just saw the stack sorry we have uh members of the public who do wish to address us so um I think we will be going through them yeah start with the green ones in the I'm sorry start with the green forms okay okay um we're we're juggling here Nancy usually it's got me lined out here all right so we have our first um person on our list is Terry Hamilton and if you would like to please come address Council just speak right into yes ma'am you hi thank you all for having us today and and giving us an opportunity my name is Terry Hamilton I'm a resident of the ly County Harrisburg area and with all this new renewable energy stuff coming up there's a lot of uh unanswered questions or unknown questions or and answers to uh my biggest one is with these uh not my biggest but one of the main concerns is with these renewable energies and storage and and uh uh possible contaminants from all these things is there a a way to monitor contamin an in groundwater I live in the wamit valley groundwater moves a lot we get a lot of contaminants from a lot of nitrogens that we've taken as uh a family when our kids were young to mitigate any possible contaminant for them because The Young and the old are the most susceptible so we brought in bottled water so our kids never had to drink our well water even though we had it tested many times it's below uh contaminant levels that were that was still acceptable for for consumption sometimes it would be higher and so our groundwater moves a lot so if there's any contaminants that go into the into the water that water is going to travel to many many Wells um the other thing would be food source so with these new solar and and I'm assuming uh uh wind also so sheep are going to be used a lot at least that's the proposed so what's the contaminant intake to these sheep so when the the Lambs are born are these contaminants passed from the mothers to the babies and then the babies go into food source now some of the adults will also go into food source how do we Rectify or or quantify all of those contaminants that could be possibly passed into the food chain not just the water chain do is is there any studies that anybody knows that any of this taken place I have no idea so I'm going to tell you thank you for your comments so the way public comments work is we get to listen to you but we don't respond uh and address your concerns as we move throughout the process there will be opportunities for you to share those as you heard earlier today okay um and my belief is that the developers and other stakeholders listen and pay attention to that and that's something that I would expect a developer pay attention developers to uh hear and and respond to but I'm going to look at uh Todd our um Council secretary to correct anything I may have said yeah no no Corrections Madam chair um just clarification that you know um we do have standards related to um the the issues that you have have brought up and what I would say is you know please you know connect with myself or other members of the sighting division team and we can walk you through um how that process works how those issues can and are evaluated in an application um that way you know if you're interested in participating um and reviewing an application we can help kind of get you prepared to do that um in terms of what to look for and how to look for it um and then when to comment and you know everything you brought up yes can and should be evaluated in an application um and we want to hear that kind of information okay thank you very much for the clarification that's all I have for now thank you very much just a second um um council member Condon has a question and we're going to see if it's a question we're supposed to ask and if we can't then Todd's going to tell us yes thank you one thank you for being here today um a question for you with the concern about grandwater which I think is huge issue across across the state but um certainly is we've got a project in the wamit valley a large project um understand the concern but is is your concern um the a property that is currently used for agriculture a crop of some some sort um converted to solar all right Council remember con just as a reminder and and not just you but I keep seeing people do this when they're speaking and they're blocking the microphone when they're speaking I know it's not purposeful but I'm just worried that people will have a hard time hearing Us online okay hold my hands um are are you concerned about an increase in contamination to groundwater you know it's relative increase from the current use I I'm not I I don't know much about groundwater but I'm interested in what your concern is is uh the the current use is is pretty much all Agland around um I've lived directly on the valley floor now I'm on the Foothills so the wall consump the water usage from the down is a lot sorry didn't mean to block that it it's much different now from where I was to where I'm currently at but I'm only three miles away from where I used to be but the the water table and the water saturation is much higher now where I'm at compared to just a m three miles away so the water flow is different the the",

        "text": " a lot of site work Associated adjacent to the the Fred Meyer in Cornelius and is scheduled again for late summer yeah it's it's much more developed than that I just drove by it about two days ago and it's it's coming out of the ground fast and it's remember it's right alongside Council Creek Trail that was also the hottest day ever that groundbreaking day homie was here I was Tigard Senior Housing will complete the summer of Celebration um also a late August schedule completion date 58 units in Tigard this will be for senior housing for folks 62 years of age or and older uh 58 units on donated Land showing really the city of tigard's leadership and supporting housing and will be adjacent to the the Tigard Senior Center so lots of lots of Partnerships planned between the two entities to be able to to take advantage of the amenities in Tigard what is that other little building because nothing looks like that that one that cream-colored one to the left to the right of the flag or the flag I think it might be the senior center with a new paint job because it doesn't look like the senior center no yeah I think this is an artist's rendering yeah okay I just thought they'd make it look realistic as to what it looks like Pam just barely qualifies for men let's not go there and then scheduled for a little bit later completion and and fall is um Saltzman Road 54 units in Cedar Mill um this project recently the the project team is has worked on a new name opal Apartments I'm still being an interesting component to celebrate um and it's also in partnership with First United Methodist Church Great partnership with the faith-based community in the area couple components first today through your board's action is to congratulate Community Partners for affordable housing cepa on successfully receiving recommend recommended concept endorsement to Metro for the Woodland Hearth project that will expend all but 3.45 million dollars in in funding the Washington County team will work on alignment and supporting the other applicants they're really all great projects over 50 million dollars in in funding requests in metro housing bond funds that work will begin with working with the second place applicant reach CDC on Dartmouth Crossing phase two on opportunities for alignment with available metro housing on funds there is an open Lyft application through the state that can be a great opportunity to pair metro housing bond funds with those funding opportunities so we look forward to working with with that applicant as well as the other applicants on great projects to creatively structure upcoming funding opportunities and potential support as needed to to be able to move really all the projects forward that have submitted because they're they all serve a need and have a great partnership team and sponsorship and that really belies the third point which is the project quality demonstrates a future funding need and an opportunity in in Washington County to be able to advance these and other projects forward the the demand is there the capability is there with these teams it's just really a measure of being creative and finding opportunities to leverage future funding sources so this this chart will take um we'll show we'll show with with today's board action the chart on the the item on the right column column is the projected unit count um the goals and in total of 814 units 112 have been met and then with today's action 875 units of of new homes in Washington County you can see going down some of the priorities that have been set through the County's local local implementation strategy over 440 family size units 344 deeply affordable units um 531 that are still within the target range of 30 to 60. and over 185 permanent Supportive Housing units so that really shows where we are today in in the projection with 11 funded projects in in Washington that's a good question because I I'm confused on that last line I thought all of these would be affordable housing they are awesome permanent Supportive Housing that's the one that provides the okay thank you psh oh okay yes yeah I have a couple questions but go ahead I'm fine okay uh feel free to change to the next slide I'm so excited about the colors so I haven't been by in a few weeks now but I started them or I I saw them starting the painting and I was just so um I have a couple of questions I believe but this is old knowledge that the property at Baseline and 170th in Washington County near the almonica transit center was acquired Metro in cooperation with Beaverton for affordable housing and the property's been cleared but it's still just sitting there could you inquire for us about the status of that and um I know I don't know if there are any other projects outstanding in Washington County I know the Hillsboro one's under construction that's very exciting uh the Marianne was done and the two projects one of ours one of theirs up at South Cooper Mountain but I think that's the whole of affordable housing Bond projects in Washington County if I'm right um but feel free to come at me with that's absolutely correct what one component this would be good to schedule a future update is there is a site acquisition fund um that Metro Staff are are leading but coordinating with Washington County staff it's 12.9 million dollars for acquisition of available sites that team has been working hard on on opportunities and um do have some potential opportunities to to move forward that would be timely to schedule a future board update but the the intent with that fund is to acquire one or two additional sites in Washington County to support affordable terrific but only for the site acquisition not for the that that that's correct okay okay which leads to my second question you did such a good job and we're hearing that there's still need so I'm left wanting what direction might you need to come back to us with just some sketch of what the remaining need is I'm not ready to start an engagement program to explore having a Washington County only affordable housing Bond but I do want to better understand the need because as you say the demand is there the need is there the capability is there but I can't quite get my head around that yet so I would like to go from Total fog to just a big foggy blob could I could I ask another question that's right in there is when does the affordable housing Bond expire the the program was estimated to be completed within five to seven year years the bond funding I can't remember if it was a 15 or a 20-year Bond it was a 20-year Bond five to seven years from 2018. it was approved so we're right we're approaching that that zone here that's I just wanted to yeah put that in my brain too yep thank you so I think what I would appreciate from the board is just for direction for staff to work on kind of what that high high level first step high level option yep would be yep yep yep am I seeing nods from the board yes I'm nervous about any income tax problem high level this is not this is was Cedar Grove part of doing affordable housing property no that was before okay I I have two questions for you um and and one of them is very very wonky and technically the first one was easy one um this is my observation I'm probably wrong but uh down in Tigard we've got four or five projects different really close to my office and I see District 2 not having a lot and I think the district one which has a great need based upon the demographics of the area not having a lot is are we looking in those areas for additional opportunities we have the one that's being built on saltsman that's it though yeah five within my heart again in just a short range I think I think wow I'm sorry this is a little out of my Lane but at one point of context is um in the case of the affordable housing Bond the funds were distributed to three jurisdictions in Washington County uh the City of Beaverton the city of Hillsborough and unincorporated Washington County for the share so there are several projects that are being led by each City of Beaverton and city of Hillsborough yeah I just know that everybody needs opportunity my really wonky one and this is because you know you're really smart I'm saying you know the tax credits that really make these projects run it and we're what a 99 owner partially and then one percent all of us tax credits go to that if we could capture those and sell those on the market it didn't have to give them up it would provide a lot of funding for future projects I mean that's huge huge tax credit the low-income housing tax credit is that yeah you know that's a federal program that was delegated to the states so we go to the state for our location but do we have to give them up to the developer or could we keep some of those well if you don't have taxable income is of no use to you you sell them yeah that's what we do with our affordable housing projects the state Awards it then we sell it to the highest bidder when I first started working how we were given to the developer we're not oh no they they sell them for equity but they sell them we don't tax exempt organization that's the only way that they work yeah yeah I knew that they were but somehow I thought they were ending up with them and they were taking that to help Finance the project we weren't yeah two three decades ago yeah you could but nowadays the market is very matured so you sell them to insurance you have to figure out how it gets more money yeah if we could use it we could do a couple more projects all right thank you could you remind us again uh that with the bond I have this very vague recollection of the numbers four percent and nine percent where those different levels of income tax right so so the nine percent tax credit is competitive it has a plan and you comply with that and they they are paid to the state the federal Treasury 70 present value so that's what they call nine percent is very competitive yeah and then there's a four percent cash credit which is you get that uh if 50 or more of your development costs is financed by Banks got it so that's that's the four percent a lot all the deals we are doing use the four percent which is a bit unusual generally it's been at that nine percent correct right right okay that's the power of nine percent nine percent is competitive and yeah the county may get one",

        "text": " even since then I think uh well you would talked to to Doug and I to make sure that was okay and I thought that was a fine idea um um uh I think the other thing that's come up is I think we probably are going to look for a more General recommendation to city council so maybe the next meeting we might revisit that letter and uh and say suggest that hey as we're looking at the meeten hunt Runway 1634 memo we actually look at more than just the estimated cost but there may be other things that come into that related to commercial a service and things like that so it might be a slightly different letter that we come back and and resend it but I just wanted to follow up that there was a reason why it hasn't gone to the city council and that we still want to recommend that same goal go ahead I think Mark has oh just some breaking news uh in one of our meetings today uh the Public Works director gave me the go-ahead to schedule a work session with the city council uh this fall on primarily the future of the secondary Runway I get the numbers mixed up excuse me um I do too I didn't know there was four I knew that I knew that but I didn't I I keep because of there four numbers I get them all mixed up um the future of the secondary Runway uh and the master plan like a Master Plan update in general but uh Council work sessions get skitted out way in advance and if you don't jump on it now you don't get one so so we will be working to schedule a work session in the fall uh so you might as you think about that think about the timing of your letter okay would it be better to have that yes in your hands when you go to that work session I would have it submitted before the work session okay then then we can just tell the council we've scheduled a work session to address this yeah I think by then my hope is that by the July AAC meeting we'll have some direction from off on whether we need to continue to pause because part of it is they're collecting commercial a service data as well to support what we're showing as uh Aviation forecasting into the future it doesn't match up with the past of course because there was not commercial so really want to see some reality before they they send it off to headquarters so that's part of the pause the growth potential growth of the terminal campus is if it pushes East and it gets up against taxway Alpha and safety areas and things out there that impacts the other Runway so there's there's more than just the cost of maintaining the runway long term uh so we really want what we take to Council on a work session U and how we sort of direct the remaining portions of the master plan we want it to be sort of to to to be encompassing that makes sense so I think in the July meeting we'll have a little bit more direction from FAA by then and what their comfort level is with restarting the master plan and we can revisit that letter that we're going to submit to council and then at that point you know coun Council Moka is is is wonderfully engaged here so so she won't be confused as to why there's a letter coming before a decision was made but my my my worry was that if we sent this letter out and then there was nothing to tie it to it was just confused councel as to why we're ask being asked to review something they haven't seen yet you said Brad in the scope scope get more yeah my recommendation would be that we we ask a an independent firm to to look at the entire the entirety of the impacts of the second Runway and see if they concur or not with the with the findings from our consultant and and John you know that I was trying to be encouraging in the sense of getting things to us so that we could push forward in the legisl committee and you are you know you're there and so you know that there's you know there's opportunities and so that's what I was working towards is I want to see if we can get federal and state support and so having all of the in a row the timing work for that if it was in the fall then um I think so because they're not going to come back but uh you know they won't start till January okay and so I think then and if we have that information and it sounds like if people are already thinking ahead if September would be able to lead us into you know how we want to present something with our lobbyists okay okay and and it may be it could be as early as late September or as late as sometime in November before the council work session it just depends on how yeah still before January and in Courtney would be able to start working up what is needed with John's support so a lot of competing priorities with the council but now we're past budget season budget season we're not past Revenue task force right actually it's it's now completely in the council's lap the budget the budget committee is so great than uh any other I discussion on that point any other things that we need to discuss before we adjourn I feel like we've come to the end one Qui question I know can't ask this outside of the me so long ago I heard um Talk of a project for electrification so electric vehicle and electric airplane just wondering is that is that kind of Gone by the wayside is that company still around they still around that company is still around uh more and they they paused a lot of their growth because they were way out in front of themselves but charging stations that airports up and down on the west coast before they had certified by the FAA so I don't know what the status is of their certification of their aircraft but electric aircraft growth is still a thing uh but more broadly we're actually at the the final stages of a solar feasibility study at the airport as part of the master plan the Salem climate action committee uh gave us $50,000 to do a solar feasibility study so to look at what potential property would be good for solar Farms that wouldn't impact either pilot or air traffic control operations uh is there enough power to make the airport you know carbon neutral IE power you know via solar uh is there enough power to be gained to have a micro git so that a power loss we could could take care of ourselves for a period of time and then possibly even to sell some of the power back to PGE they have a mandate to have 20% of their power be renewable resources and so so all that study is almost complete now it's very highly technical you might be interested in it my high glaz over when all that stuff kilowatts and bolts different things but um should be coming back here I would say by the end of this month or sometime in June um and then at that point we'll look at you know again highest and best use of properties is do does the city want to take a portion of its available property uh and turn that into a solar farm is there enough benefit there as the payback period you know makes sense and all of that um and then um on the airport itself you you see this at Medford and some other airports where they have they take their parking lots and turn into covered parking and the covers are actually solar panels and so there's potential there for for some some of that as well as we continue to grow here at the terminal obviously if we build a new terminal we want to build some solar and some you know some renewable energy um in in an upgraded terminal it would be required it would be required yeah so so it hasn't died uh it's actually kind of taken a different course it'll probably it'll probably look different than what we anticipated because I think the aircraft certification side of it is much much slower with you know the FAA processes to certify aircraft and and and figuring out how to fight battery fires and things that fire departments really aren't used to having yet having so how about electric vehicle charging I heard was that would be that would be part of that yeah so we would but the flight deck our plan was to do aircraft on one side of the fence and then vehicle on the other side of the fence but we also want to look at it the vehicle charging probably would move ahead a lot sooner than the air right I mean that actually can be Revenue um if you have the cap you have the capital installed you can charge much higher than what you're paying for the power in fact we probably need to think about getting some electric vehicle charging spaces identified in the current Lots yes so I'm happy to chat on that if you want I I consulted with some folks on resorts on on the coast actually the former the former Herz Bild this afternoon for all the reason and I looked at that back roof that slopes towards the east and it's the Beautiful Blue Roof that slopes towards the east and I thought it would just be a perfect spot for solar panels to power that part of the airport and so I think there's a lot of potential there for for solar and and then electrical charging capacity here and over the other site as we just grow that out comparison I have airport wise is p is PX and they do have charging um and it's at a a fairly low rate so in other words the vehicle might take a few days uh if you were really low and really large capacity but it is free so doesn't have to be though you can charge I mean you can even have it open for anybody as long as they willing to pay the parking fee to stand for $10 a day yes well I know there are some facilities where you know they have different rate structures so if you want a supercharge you're going to pay more but you vehicle charge in an hour or less and I don't do super charge I mean right now since you can't since you can't return the same day or even the next day currently yeah um you could go with a level one or level two charger absolutely you don't need a level three charger yeah I can't use the level twos in Portland because I would be full LEL right before return if they had level ones I'd be all over that i' pay for it and we did talk about that as we were doing the ternal improvements things there was so much we had to get done in advance of just get",

know it's not purposeful but I'm just worried that people will have a hard time hearing Us online okay hold my hands um are are you concerned about an increase in contamination to groundwater you know it's relative increase from the current use I I'm not I I don't know much about groundwater but I'm interested in what your concern is is uh the the current use is is pretty much all Agland around um I've lived directly on the valley floor now I'm on the Foothills so the wall consump the water usage from the down is a lot sorry didn't mean to block that it it's much different now from where I was to where I'm currently at but I'm only three miles away from where I used to be but the the water table and the water saturation is much higher now where I'm at compared to just a m three miles away so the water flow is different the the current current use is is a and so they use a lot of nitrogen to get their uh their grass seed was the majority of the the process there um that is pretty much been the way it's been for years the new stuff coming in is uh solar has a lot of um if you read some of the studies that's been done has a very high contaminant rate compared to some of the other other processes out there like uh wind farming is is different it it doesn't have the contaminants of the solar panels have so that's going to be a new concern is how do we measure those new contaminants uh the batteries that they're now going to they're proposing to put in place and they have in other climates they drier climates I don't think they've worry about the groundwater as much as what we will because they don't have that much water like if you go AC across the the mountain to the east side it's a much drier climate they're not going to be really that much concerned I don't believe um unless they're in a high irrigation area uh but we we get irrigated on a regular basis so those new contaminants are going to be what's going to get into our groundwater and our food supply now if it's just grass seed I don't know what it's going to do to grass seed but the water and the food suppli is what my main concern is for what is a daily uh consumption value for a lot of residents and because of the one proposed uh just knowing the difference in in nitrogen levels in our groundwater that varies from year to year on how that water table moves what direction does it move I don't know those answers so that water can can e and Flow I would assume just like any other water source if if you ever have a house that has a water uh a water leak you may not find that leak where it's dropping from it's completely at a different location you didn't suspect so that's kind of the where we're sitting at now is where are those water sources going to come from we know where the food source is going to be because everything's on top and it's not just sheep Wildlife is going to get into that also and so it's going to contaminate a a quite a range of animals versus just the water table thank you thank you for your question thank you for that that's a great analogy I actually appreciate that for myself because I did have a leak and I did have to bring somebody and spend a fortune to find out where it was so thank you for joining us and and being willing to make comments thank you so much thank you uh our next um our next speaker would be um Shannon good morning thank you for joining us hello let me know if I'm speaking loud enough I've been told I have one of those voices you can't hear so um so um I'm Shannon Hamilton um in reading the department of Energy's mission statement pertaining to protecting the environment public health and impacts for current and future Generations my question's a little bit along the line of of my husband's Terry Hamilton but um are there any studies or data that you can site that are related to environmental impacts with um solar projects that also ensure protection of the efu lands as well as any end of life policy of the decommissioning of the Hazardous Materials related with that thank you for your question the comment and I'll reiterate a little bit what we said we that's not we do at this time but as Todd said we do have standards there are numerous things that developers have to provide data for to show that and that those we end up getting them back and we evaluate based on those standards um and in terms of you know involvement you obviously have expert knowledge that we don't have and we would strongly encourage you to continue participating in terms of odo's mission it all gets wrapped in there and sometimes it may feel more inclusive than others but we are very strict in what we as Council are evaluating to and I'm gonna look across the table all right well he says okay so yes okay um and this is a new process so I'm apologize I'm trying to learn all of the ins and out of this but I appreciate your time and all of your service to this please do not apologize because we are all in the same boat we are all trying to learn and that's why I keep looking across the table at Tod and Patrick so okay all right thank you next we have Troy Jones good morning good morning we are still on morning I keep looking at my watch we are we are we're getting close though so thank you uh Madame chair and council members appreciate this opportunity it's a privilege to be able to speak to you and I'm one of those those folks that uh Mr cornette referred to earlier I'm being educated as as goes along so full disclosure live in the Harrisburg Area ly County as well uh of course the Muddy Creek energy Park is one of those large solar projects that's coming before us all and uh so there's some concerns that we have as a group uh I'm a neighbor I live right there uh you know it's all efu all efu Farmland it's uh considered farmed Wetlands as well as Mr Hamilton referred to earlier um it's uh extremely wet and we've we've provided a lot of documentation in that in that regard two different departments within the state one of the things and the the main purpose that I'm here for today is I wanted and I want to make sure that I do a good job of communicating this so if if if I need to I may have to slow down but I don't want to get too far into the weeds also so one of the things that uh is concerning to me is as I became educated in this process I started doing more research obviously and the thing that struck me is odd in especially in this time of equity within departments and our state organizations is the efsc is not required to follow the same requirements as the lcdc in regard to um whether or not there is a alternate site that can be considered um I got the specific uh statutes if you want to if you want me to bore you with those but uh it seems odd that that emission uh to look at alternative sites doesn't exist for the EFC uh it is required for the land conserv conservation development commission for their statutes so that that that's one that I'm looking into legislatively if there's some need to make a make some sort of of a change there one thing that's refreshing as I watched this process is this is a living breathing animal so to speak and it and it was refreshing to see that these rules can be modified or adapted as required as we go along so it gives me hope that this can be considered as well because you know there was a recent uh Oregon public broadcasting article put out about a week and a half ago um it referred to 660,000 Acres as of 2022 660,000 Acres of efu Farmland has gone away to for what an asundry of reasons and that's concerning to me uh there's not a lot of a few properties left and Oregon took a lot of pride in establishing in the 197s and 1973 to be more exact of developing and protecting our farmlands and so I see that as a very important aspect of this and I hope that the council will take that into consideration as they move forward thank you very much for your comments we certainly look forward to learning from you and and hearing more throughout the process and we are fortunate to have folks on Council who have a strong land use backgrounds and continue to educate those of us who do not so thank you for joining us okay thank you there's a great movie out there a documentary uh Mr Jim Gilbert produced it it's called an Oregon story I would uh I would suggest everybody take a look at that if they have an opportunity thank you and thank you again it was a privilege to be able to address you all thank you our next member uh our next person here in the room to speak would be Miss Gilbert Miss good morning good morning Irene Gilbert 2310 Adams Avenue thanks for allowing me to comment um first I wanted to say that I did appreciate the time that was spent with Jim krider and myself uh discussing our concerns with the changes to the uh contested case rules and um I did did appreciate the fact that he made some changes or some changes were made as a result of that um I gave you an outline of the issues that I was going to discuss before I knew what changes had been made but um there still are some just comments that I wanted to make to the council regarding this whole process the first one being um I'm questioning whether or not uh fsac and Odo really want to make very many changes to the uh Oregon administrative procedures rules the main reason being that those rules have been um evaluated there has been Court uh decisions regarding what the interpretation is of the terms and when you start creating changes in rules that have been vetted um what ends up is if you're not paying really careful attention to what the statutes say but also what the Court decisions say there are many pitfalls you can fall into uh that would end up creating um future litigation regarding the changes so um one another concern just in terms of making changes is when you base your your basic rules on the Oregon administrative procedures but then",

        "text": " research subcommittees uh what your kind of specific scope and charges are and what it is that we are hoping for um to have for deliverables on that um uh were you going to bring that you planning to do that yeah so um I hope that uh it wasn't um that my memo uh you weren't overwhelmed by it and I hope what it does is it provides some uh Clarity and sense of direction to you and so during this particular uh uh discussion time um we're here to help provide even further Clarity so in kind of your review of that memo what questions did you have about your committee's charge or the particular deliverables or the scope um that that you have uh going forward here um I know it sounds like a lot if you think you know I think the first presentations we looked at are coming out later this year in October right so my hope is that maybe each committee uh will kind of give their recommendation at a meeting and we'll do that over the course course of three different meetings one for each committee and so the first one of those in October so that's a little over seven month or about seven months away um and so uh hopefully that's enough time for you to uh spend an hour or two a week here and there uh in kind of this work um but uh and coming to a conclusion where we can provide a good robust and well supported recommendations right I in that memo we've outlined a number of uh questions and and data points I recognize not all those data points will necessarily apply to your specific scope or that we will be able to find out that information but I hope what it does is is it kind of send you down some Pathways of seeking that data uh get you to dive a little bit deeper um than we might otherwise and and regardless of kind of what data you can you can find and locate um that you'll be able to produce some uh some well supported recommendations that we can then consider taking to City counil uh and helping them achieve helping the city achieve the greenhouse gas redu mission reduction efforts um so with that any questions any issues you're foreseeing any further guidance you'd like to have Debbie I would like to know where the city is because um reading reading some of the stuff that was handed out in the last packet it sounds like they've been transitioning to Electric uh equipment for a while here and there I just want to know like what's the status on that now um what's is it 25% now that we've transitioned or 5% sure and yes good question and Dylan's going to piggyback because I had a similar question is I guess to that point because I think it applies to all of them I wonder if there's any way that Juliana could kind of like give each group a memo so to speak of like kind of just compiling what exists already because I imagine she has done a lot of that work and I know that when I was on the climate action plan there was a lot of things that were given in terms of some of the reports and like with some of the strategies listed of and I think some of this is in the final version of you know a likely amount of greenhouse gas reductions this is high low Etc similar to what the revenue task force came so it seems like there might be some starting information that already exists that I wonder if it could be sent out I don't know what truly on this capacity is like but given this is hopefully mutually beneficial if she could send some of that out that might have what you're saying you know here's like the here's where we are and then here's what the goal says could give each group a little bit something to work so I don't know staff if that's feasible but just wanted to I had a similar question on some of my uh on some of the charges in my section of you know trying to get a better sense of status quo we can certainly think about that and I had similar questions GW and reading through packets um I also saw where Portland I think just just just said we're doing this so yeah so you got a lot of data for you and Joan to kind of dig into on that perhaps but Joan you had a question as well um well I would um I'm wondering if um you did any research about what can be done with the batteries once they're expired I'm I haven't you know looked at it yet to see what what happens to them yeah I I think that's probably a good area of question right that's kind of the the externalities approach of like all right we make this decision how what's the cascading effects of that decision right and certainly the battery disposal and concerns there are uh are part of electric equipment that's a big concern with like electric vehicles and like what do we do with all of these things so um I the city might have some information on that but I think regardless kind of delving into that of how other cities are grapping that a good kind of point of inquiry for your for your um any did we want in terms of your and Juliana's ability to provide some of that data did you have thoughts on that yeah I just gonna C the the memo there's the comment that we we'd be happy to connect you with staff and and I mean I if if I don't know if Julian has capacity to write memos but we certainly could uh have interviews so can sit down with staff that knows the most you could you could you know ask questions of them and yeah yeah and I think what might be helpful for you in that endeavor if I can speak for you is is having from each of the Committees kind of a list of initial questions um that gets at that Baseline data so they know kind of what staff to bring into that interview so if you can sit down as your group and say okay what is it that we need to know just to get that kind of initial start in there and then and then they can kind of know what where they can say yes and here's some of the data around there or no we haven't looked into that to your point about batteries right like what's the what's the starting point so I think I think getting your group together and and kind of going over those initial points of inquiry will be helpful in in guiding staff's ability to support us so then should we connect with you rob or I I hate to put more on your plate or should we connect she'll make sure I yeah she'll make sure I don't miss the yeah yeah the inbox can be pretty over sometimes but she'll she'll make sure go for now all right I do want to underscore though I think that's helpful but I do think there should be things that Rana likely has that she could send out so I I would I would at least like to put in the request to her to see if there's things that like active transportation for example I know there's conversations on their way with chariots about U bike share and things like that so just any tidbits that she thinks are helpful even if I used memo very formally but I mean it very informally of like even if there's here's some links that you all should think about or here's this page from the climate action plan that you might want to know about and I imagine that a lot of that is living in a Google drive or Microsoft whatever folder that you all have that she might be able to farm out fairly easily so that's kind of where that request was coming from um and then process-wise two thoughts one is we have this three Monon um set of October to December I think it said for presentations uh yeah I'm wondering if we want to schedule those outs there's three groups we don't we can maybe check in in the summer and see where we're at but if we kind of have that Target of you know okay this is October we're doing this one November December and kind December yeah we can just give you December now the third committee so go I was expecting December my plan was to yeah do a touch point in kind of Midsummer in a few months see where groups are and and and work to schedule that out but um but to Rick's point we could go default I think some great but I I think at some point that'll help for all of us kind of know when when you really when you got I I will work to schedule that out before we get to October yeah that sounds great or at least before before we get before September I guess before September yes no I think that's a good um I had a different question I forgot it um well I had made the note too that I think us all leing with Juliana would be smart and so I think that's a reinforcing that that it would be a good goal kind of on this process we should all try and schedule meeting yes and I think with that uh with that idea um because I could see value there again kind of let's if you all can outline kind of what your questions might be um send those to me do that send those to me um and and and my thinking here is not wanting us to have three different me meetings with Juliana and asking 60% of the same questions right so can we maybe all try to get together or have her come for another board presentation that she can answer meetings or answer questions during our meeting that kind of uh consolidation of effort there rather than um loading down her time with with separate individual meetings and if I may a reminder the a Corum on sprp is five and just for I a little bit of buffer room I just it groups of three or or less communicated by email that would be my my preference but certainly never have more than five members on an email together that that's very important you're making the city lawyers proud you be hear it to three and have them forward it we also have to avoid that which is why you sent it to me and I will be the one that uh relases such foring of information um on myself I I just wanted to say that in terms of the electric uh uh chariots I mean I was on a committee there uh until recently um is transitioning to electric buses uh only a few at a time because uh they're very expensive and they're charging platforms and everything and so with the money being scarce that could be an issue for absolutely right so part",

the august 29th and 30th and 31st 2022 meeting of the energy facility citing council to order i want to thank all of you for your attendance tonight we appreciate you taking the time and we're interested in your comments mr secretary are there any agenda modifications uh mr chair i'm this mike test test can anybody hear me yep okay maybe maybe it's the mask okay um so roll call ken howe hanley jenkins jordan truett here cindy condon perry choctoot uh mr chair uh mr vice chair you have a okay thank you and i jumped the gun there and so are there agenda modifications mr chair i did hear from council members earlier before the meeting um that you would like to defer voting on the draft meeting minutes uh until tomorrow or wednesday depending upon so i guess we will defer that okay thank you i have the following announcements please silence your cell phones those participating via phone or webinar please mute your phone and if you receive a phone call please hang up from

meeting are not acceptable pursuant to oregon administrative rule three four five zero one one zero zero eight zero any person who engages in unacceptable conduct which disrupts the meeting may be expelled so we're going to move discussion over the meeting minutes to tomorrow or wednesday and we're ready for the council secretary report thank you mr vice chair uh first i have a staffing update uh the last council meeting i had let council members know that we had somebody who had accepted the rulemaking coordinator position the operations of poly policy analyst 3 position who was intending to start on august 22nd so unfortunately that person has elected not to accept the position and has chosen to pursue something else and therefore we have reinitiated the recruitment process for that position in the meantime christopher clark will continue to serve as the rulemaking coordinator as he has in the last several months so he'll pull double duty being a sighting analyst as well as rulemaking coordinator so he'll continue to move forward on the rule making projects as well as the assigned projects that he's working on so and we thank chris for his efforts on next on my list are project updates so on august 7th the notice of intent for the bonanza energy facility expired so once a notice of intent is filed by an applicant they have two years within which to submit a preliminary application prior to the conclusion of that two year time frame they can also submit a request for an extension for one year to extend the notice of intent by one year which means extending the ability to submit the preliminary application for site certificate for one year uh bonanza facility uh failed to either submit a preliminary application or a request for an extension so that facility has expired or at least that notice of intent has expired and the facility was proposed at 150 to 300 megawatts it's was a solar energy project with up to 1100 megawatts of battery storage related relating and supporting facilities the project was proposed to be on 2700 acres so 4.2 square miles it was to be located in klamath county near the town of bonanza and the applicant was hecate energy bonanza llc which is a wholly owned subsidiary of hecate energy naf llc they have indicated their intention to resubmit a notice of intent in 2023 so we'll wait to see if they do second on my list is the oregon trail on august 19 2022 we received a request for amendment number one for that amendment request includes two individual requests the first is to expand extend the beginning construction date from august 30th 2022 to august 30th 2025. so to they did not construct the facility within the time frames originally approved and they're requesting a time frame extension for that and the second request is to revise condition 50 sub b to eliminate the requirement of a cultural resources monitor being present when ground disturbance occurs at depths of 12 inches or greater to requiring cultural resource monitor being present when there is the initial open ground disturbance below 12 inches associated with collection line trenching in the solar array so that's a little bit nuanced and so i just wanted to throw that out there so you're kind of aware of it but really it's about sort of the presence of on-site cultural resource monitors during construction they're requesting a change to that they've also requested a type b review the facility is approved to include any combination of wind and solar components not to exceed 41 megawatts including up to 14 excuse me 16 wind turbines or up to 1 228 acres of solar pv generation and the entire site boundary is approved at 13 800 acres the facility was originally part of the montag wind power facility but was split off from that facility through amendment number five in september of 2020 that's why it when i described it it's a rather small facility it's because originally it was part of a a much bigger facility and then they split the site certificate into three the applicant excuse me the certificate is oregon trail solar llc which is a wholly owned subsidiary of oven grid renewables llc which is the us division of the parent company ibradrola and i have one enlisted council has any questions on either of my project updates i have one more update there is a group uh called verde which is currently working with renewable northwest and thousand friends of oregon and they just begin pulling together a comprehensive stakeholder uh they've called it a table but essentially you know a a group of diverse uh individuals and and representatives from different areas to discuss the sighting process in oregon and and i'm quoting from their information how to address some of the frictions that are coming up between communities and developers and whether there are any changes that may need be needed in the system to help new policy goals such as those established in house bill 2021 but also to protect community so it's a pretty diverse group the public interest groups state agencies other natural resource groups so it's a fairly large group so just so i you have some understanding verde the entity uh their website states that its purpose is is to serve communities by building environmental wealth through social enterprise outreach and advocacy so that's the really the head of this the group met on august 19th it will again meet on september 2nd with additional meetings planned through the fall the idea of the work group as we understand it is to seek input from a broad group of stakeholders in order to identify potential legislation for the 2023 session the near-term goal is to have a placeholder holder study lc legislative concept submitted on september 23rd and spend time throughout the fall working to identify uh what should be included there are legislators who are part of who have been engaged including mayfield representative marsh representative brock smith representative owens representative helm representative pham representative levy senator lieber senator findley and senator dembro if any council members would like to be um included invited it's not our group we're not the lead but if anybody's interested in tracking or being invited to that we can reach out to the group leaders and see if we can get an invitation extended to any council members who are interested todd just a question about verde or do they have experience uh pulling diverse groups together do you know i mean is this a common practice for them i i think so um i don't i don't personally have much experience for them but that's my understanding is that's kind of their what they do um they're kind of more of a grassroots organization seeking kind of broad you know broad input um so that's my understanding okay i may um is there anybody from the department yes involved the department has been participating so far thank you okay mr vice chair with that i will conclude my secretary report thank you secretary cornett um the next is the boardman to hemingway transmission line at the last meeting in july the council reviewed the standards from the proposed order that did not result in any contested case issues this august meeting the council reviewed the standards from the proposed order that did result in contested case issues we have kellen tardy weather oregon department of energy senior siting analyst and jesse ratcliffe senior assistant attorney general natural resources section of the oregon department of justice presenting and walking us through those standards this evening so with that i'll turn it over to mrs tardy thank you vice chair hal for the record my name is party weather oregon department of energy i am trying to share my screen so um and normally through all of those introductions we would have had um a a powerpoint and a screen corresponding with all of those but i'm having issues sharing my screen right now one minute if we may while i would just try to troubleshoot this and i may have somebody else just share until i can figure this out um to cover so i just announcements i have the i have the powerpoint on my screen and we're going to work on getting it up on the screen here so thank you for being this is the introduction and here um we are so i'm going to do and i know it's easier to have the visual representation but i'll just do it orally just to kind of get us get us going here um i",

        "text": " the event of a power outage the school building is also provided with backup power and serves as an emergency shelter the system provides value to the in addition to the value of the water and energy resilience features for example the school benefits from energy bill savings and e-web is able to use the batteries on this site to provide grid services during their day-to-day operations next slide this is a schematic diagram of the microgrid system showing electric loads that can be served by the system during a power so the battery storage units and they are shown as bess they're the black ones on the bottom battery energy storage systems those are able to provide power to the water well and the backup loads within the school and you can see that there's a switch shown at the main breaker and that's to ensure that this micro grid is isolated from the rest of eweb's power grid in the event of a power outage and that's to provide safety to their line workers and so now that the program is essentially up and running we've we've got staff to implement the program um pandy pandyan krishnaswami is on the line today he's our energy services manager and james kogel has been leading the work on the program nuts and bolts and we'll take things from here james james kogel and policy analyst uh urban department of energy um the program will provide grants for planning and constructing renewable energy and energy resilience projects opportunity announcements were posted on march 7th and there are four of them one for each of the project categories there's 12 million dollars available between the four opportunity with more opportunity announcements we'll announce later after this round closes with additional funds online applications will open shortly and we'll only be accepting applications through the online next slide please opportunity you know announcements outline the minimum required information for a complete application as well as detailing how applications will be scored during the review process this includes required information about the project the applicant and partners and consultation with different stakeholders and six different stakeholders and following a review of applications to make sure they contain all the required information and are elig eligible for the program the applications will undergo a competitive review process assessing the strength of the project and its feasibility as well as how the project meets the program's priorities and targeted benefits the scoring criteria includes topics such as the project leadership and involvement of environmental justice jobs and economic development direct energy cost savings for families and small businesses inclusion of inclusive hiring promotion policies procurement of services from disadvantaged businesses assisting with natural hazard mitigation plans and geographic and project diversity the grants will be awarded on a competitive basis at this point we don't know how many grants will be awarded and how the funding will be distributed across the four categories how the funding will be distributed will be kind of depend on the number of and strength of applications in the different buckets along with the required funding allocations stated in the legislation next slide please just kind of i'm going to take you through uh kind of a quick uh introduction to how what the application portal will look like um so you'll be able to once it's live it's not yet um access it through the department of energy community renewable energy grant program web page um we're expecting the application to be finalized and available in april so you can see the red arrow uh points to where it will be available soon um so next slide please um you'll also if you are familiar with uh odo's customer service portal be able to access it from there i just click on the financial and incentive uh tab at the top and it'll be available in a drop-down menu um from there so next slide please once you access the application uh you'll be able to apply for a planning or construction grant you'll be able to change information you've submitted or withdraw an application using the drop down menu on the the front page next slide please if you haven't already signed in to the customer service portal you'll be asked to sign in um this is your first time accessing the customer portal uh you'll be able to um providing a create a username and password um for your account next slide please ah so once you start an application you'll be given information about the eligibility requirements for the program and asked to confirm whether or not you in the project meet them these are outlined in the opportunity as well expert please you'll then be asked for details about the applicant organization general form to fill in next slide please also be an opportunity to provide contact details for an application contacts and this will be the person oda will contact with communications about the applications any questions that we may have uh you'll also be asked if you are partnering with any other next slide please you'll be able to input information about the project partners and add any required documents relating to the project partners in the application portal and similarly if you are working with the contractor you'll be able to put their information in on a subsequent next question please as you go through the application portal you will then be prompted to provide information about the project itself details of what information will be asked can be found in the opportunity announcements um before you submit you'll be able to review the documents that you submitted um because there'll be an option to upload documents to the bottom of the page and if you want to kind of review the information you submit you can kind of click back and forwards through the to make sure you've got all information filled in next slide please so this flowchart shows our process with applicants um if you have questions about opportunity announcements please submit them by may 20th 2022 uh this will allow staff time to respond and post answers online before we close applications on june following the close of the application they will applications will be reviewed after which the successful projects will be offered a performance agreement while unsuccessful projects will be able to reapply in future opportunity applicants will be able to request up to 30 of the grant funding upon signing performance agreement for the construction grants the application applicant must have taken meaningful steps to seek site control file the request for interconnection with a host utility or appropriate transmission provider and many other requirements provided by odo in the performance agreement to be eligible for that thirty percent uh following the signing performance next slide please and we'd like to we'd be happy to hear any questions you have regarding the program uh if there's any specific information you'd like more detail on please let us know um but yeah thank you very much while people are thinking of questions they might have i see wade has a hand up i'll get to in one second one thing i just wanted to be really clear about is resilience can mean a lot of things to a lot of different people the bill itself has a definition for resilience um for this particular program and it's that type of resilience that's like community benefits and also this program has renewable in the title and just to be clear when we're talking about energy resilience projects under this program umbrella they need to be paired with a renewables element so i just wanted to like immediately kind of put a pin on that because it's something that's come up in other places and i just wanted to make sure that we kind of level set that from the start but the bill tells us what resilience is and it doesn't necessarily mean the same thing as it might be more broadly outside of the parameters of the program so i'll start with that and then wade um we'll get you off mute and and you sh i'll tell you there there you go you can go ahead and ask your questions now wait so i have a question uh first off uh thanks for putting the picture of our new operations center there on that slide it's kind of nice to and it's a rare sunny day here at the coast in that picture so that's equally my question is surrounding the timeline for the project i noticed that it said that we had to start construction within 12 months and it had to be completed within 36 months you know that does make me a little bit anxious given the current supply chain around the the country and the world of what we're facing getting some materials and some certain items so i i'm just wondering if if there's going to be any flexibility around that once we start to go out for procurement and we find that we're having issues that's a really great question wade it's something that is some of these timelines are set in the statute itself and when the bill was passed in 2021 we didn't have the same situation as we do now so we've certainly heard a lot about that rob can you go ahead and um dig in a little bit more on what we heard about that and what what maybe we can do um in addition to what the statute might limit us how the statute might limit us yeah so that's a good close read of the rules in the statute wade and it does have a one year to start and three years to complete requirement the bill also allows us to grant an so we'll be able to grant extensions for these issues associated with um you know the supply chain i'll have james correct me if i'm wrong but i believe we can extend a project an additional year for the construction projects and so if if we find that there's a lot of um beyond those time frames we'll have to address those as they come because we are kind of limited to the statutory language but we are going to be very accommodating up to the limits of the bill itself okay thank you great thanks rob and wade we'll be keeping tabs on this this year too and um you know it could be something that the legislature might hear from people and want to take up um making some changes there just because of the supply chain or something so um just know that there's that legislative session coming and we don't necessarily have any plans to do that i'm not suggesting that but it might be just given how this year goes that it does come up there too all right thank great um so um alex um from corvallis had a question that i always like to try to answer and then like let rob and james correct me if i'm wrong so this is one where they can do that um the question was can a project be just for renewable generation without being paired with the resilience aspect and that's absolutely that's absolutely possible we have sort of four categories of projects and so one of them is what we sort of called pure renewables as like shorthand and then there's the renewables plus resilience the issue is that um the the bill is set up and our program is set up",

        "text": " for energy projects permitted at the county level this is good it is necessary but it isn't in of itself insufficient We Believe notification by itself will not ensure early collaboration in favor of a win-win nor are there any assurances of addressing any potential adverse impacts to National Security uh currently we don't have a rule a rule or a viable process with odoe to ensure early notification of the dod for projects that are located in and around our critical training testing and operational areas the lack of notification has in the past resulted in additional time contested cases and outright removal of a project during construction is as Todd mentioned earlier with the vast majority of projects the implementation of a viable early notification policies in coordination with the military ensures that future land uses are compatible with military operations while fostering renewable energy and supporting of state regulations and policies the processes in place are ad hoc and create challenges with normal staff turnover and they don't provide a clear and transparent coordination process DOD is engaging early in this Ru making because proper development of these processes is critical for ensuring the optimal balance between commercial development and Military Readiness compatible renewable energy development is critical to preserve military operational capabilities Safeguard our military missions and protect the overhall the overall health safety and Welfare of the public living near military installations or training in operational areas and we do look forward to continue coordination with the Oregon Department of energy and to include the federal agency's rulemaking that is currently docket docketed for 2025 so I thank you for your time and I'll take any questions if you have some thank you council member Condon thank you chair gril um thank you for being here um today and I'm I'm not really familiar with how the counties and state work together so in your statement I think you said in 2019 uh statute was passed requiring notification from counties that we received notific yes notify I believe I'm not sure how the chain works I'll pass that one over to excuse me for the record Todd coret the um house B 2329 created sort of a car bout so there were previously FC jurisdictional projects that changed the threshold that then became County projects so there were then really three versions of jurisdiction County projects that were smaller than the house bill 2329 projects those do not require notice to the dod then there are the house bill 2329 projects built into statute that requires those projects that fit within that um subset do require in addition to the dod other uh early notifications including the department of energy um so so that subset of bigger projects at the county level currently do obligate um counties to provide that notification okay so my um follow up um my my question is really so where where certainly reviewing our rules and doing Ru Ru making on this I think you said that the the requirement in 2329 was insufficient for the county so how our rules don't impact the county so how does the dod um work with the counties versus the state for that sufficiency I guess currently uh we work with counties on a case-by Case basis as we learn of projects we will go and talk with the County Commission and and uh attend their commission meetings um either in support or with concerns and to date it hasn't been a tremendously um it has we haven't had a lot of business in that regard but we have been dealing with um both Morrow County and Wheeler County and it's largely about air air rotes and windmill projects that might in in infringe on an air route a training route council member thank you thank you sorry council member con council member buer Cher gra thank you um just to acknowledge that DOD has been very supportive of those mapping efforts both Statewide and I understand that there are some new grants to local governments to help better understand where those military assets are without divulging National security issues and that's that's a big tension but just know that DOD is supporting efforts I think both at the state and local level to map those resources so decision makers can be better informed about the potential issues so thank you for that and thank you for joining us today thank you and yes and that is actually true Wheeler County I believe right now is uh looking through some grants for that purpose this is chair gril I think it's uh I would hope that developers hear this conversation and something that they think about beyond what staff does they have the ability to reach out and and be mindful as well so I think the burden is not just for us as well secretary cornette thank you CH gril for the record Todd cornette um you know as was pointed out the aresta tool you know was designed I mean you know it has a lot of other values but the primary purpose you know and the reason why the Department of Defense funded that was it did map those resources it did provide information about those or rather those assets um on the Tool uh and there's the ability to do you know sort of view them and identify them but you can also do kind of an analysis of I want to put a project here what's in the vicinity of it you know and if there is a military asset you know either air or or ground that will pop up provide you know who's the contact for that military asset so you know that and of itself and it doesn't do everything certainly but it was a lot to try to identify those and provide that um early you know communication so hopefully you know developers are using that identifying that having that early communication with the Department the Department of Defense as I said we've taken that on our own sort of responsibility to make that you know connect ction with the Department of the defense um we've done that we will continue to do that as I said we have no concern about this Ru making uh we we we staff are supportive of it U whenever it comes on to essentially reflect what we already do from a non-regulatory standpoint but make it make it a regulatory standpoint whatever ultimately that ends up being thank you I just also this chair girl would like to say that um you know sometimes uh the department um I've set gets criticized for not being good communicators and listening and the fact that you've led the staff to direct this type of communication on your own without being required um I think it's just a testament to our our commitment to to working with uh the party so thank you again for showing up and and helping us and I'm sure Tom is taking diligent note of what youve said okay well thank you very much and I appreciate the time just as a reminder to those of you that are on the webinar if you're interested in making a comment at this time you're going to go ahead and go to the bottom main window there's a set of icons click on the participant that will raise your hand if you'd like to make a comment you can click it again to lower your hand if you're on the phone you're going to press star three to raise your hand and Then star three again to lower your hand at this time I do not see anyone with their hand raise let's give them another minute or so to see what happens oh now I have a hand raised I have a a phone call I'm going to go ahead and un mute your phone you are unmuted do you hear me hello can hear you okay um this is Irene Gilbert uh 23 can Adams Avenue L Grand Oregon and um listening to the rule changes and and updates that are going to occur I think it's is important to look at rules uh fairly frequently and um one thing I'd like to comment on just in terms of rules in general and that is um fsac does have according to the statute their role is to protect the citizens and the natural resources of the state and I think that rul making should reflect that and um part of that should be considering the cost to the citizens um if you when you're looking at rules require rules that are clear provide the same treatment for all developers it will go a long ways in helping to meet that um the goal of fat I have found that when rules um rules are Flex ible and a and developers are giving a what I would call a deal on mitigation or um any kind of requirements what it amounts to is someone pays and if developers are not paying their fair share it's going to fall on electric users citizens and the agencies in the state um what is a given is that mitigation is never going to leave citizens or resources whole and I can give you an example um for of well for Idaho Power there were arguments made about how they should not have to pay the same U bond amount as other groups because it would affect the rates to their customers and and they were never going to default um now since that decision Idaho Po's uh credit rate has fallen to just above junk bonds and uh part of the thing that really is somewhat irritating to me is Idaho Power has gone now to the Pu and when I looked at I calculated the um the cost currently for Idaho Powers customers in Idaho and those in Oregon for well 1,250 kilowatt of hours of power per month and the cost for an Idaho Power customer in Idaho for a year was um was $1,320 the cost for an Oregon customer $1,390 now the uh Idaho pu just considered a request for rate increase and the request was for 88.6% increase for their Idaho customers um idah hope power was granted 4.25% increase but then they have also in December requested a rate increase for the Oregon customers which represents um roughly um 100,000 people in Mal here and Baker County and the request for increase is for 19.28% for their Oregon customers um the request for instance just to give you an idea of what that looks like for irrigators in Idaho the request reflected an 11.7% increase which they didn't get that much but that's what they asked for for Oregon they're requesting over a 35% increase in the cost for Oregon's irrigation customers so I really think that when you hear arguments that oh gosh it's going to affect our customers um I think a better approach is just to say we treat our energy developers the same in Oregon and it's not reflected in there you know there's no guarantee when they when a developers able to avoid mitigation or avoid you know any kind of rule or sort of sidestep the the full",

out if people online can hear okay or council member Hall this is Patrick Roe we can hear you thank you councilor Roe uh so tonight we have the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line public hearing on draft order draft proposed order on request for a site certificate Amendment Kellen tardy weather will provide a senior signing analyst will provide a facility overview I will act as the presiding officer over the public hearing and then the public hearing we will following this brief introduction of the agenda item this is the public hearing on the draft proposed order on the request for Amendment one for the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line site certificate I can't Howe energy facility citing Council Vice chair and serving as the presiding for this hearing hold on just a second uh restart now Pickett um today is July 17 2023 the time is now 5 35 this public hearing is being held at an energy facility citing council meeting in person at the Best Western Sunridge hotel conference room in Baker City Oregon this hearing is also being held via a WebEx webinar with a call-in option for those who cannot participate in person or via webinar weather senior citing Analyst at the Oregon Department of energy will provide an overview of the amendment process and changes proposed in the amendment request missed harder weather you have the floor thank you Vice chair how oh my gosh my voice is so loud there we go um for the record Kell and tardy weather senior citing analyst Oregon Department of energy I am I have Nancy in the back of the room for those of you who are online and calling in thank you for attending um she's going to be running my presentation so if there's a little bit of pauses or if we go back and forth with the slides just bear with us I may or may not have forgotten my computer back at the office everything's fine several as a vice chair introduced I'm going to be um leading off um the information item with a project overview and then we're going to transition into the uh first of two hearings on the request for Amendment one and the draft proposed order on request for Amendment one for the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line um next slide Nancy so this is an overview of uh what this evening is going to look like um and for those of you online we have we have we have some folks here in the room we have some members of the public and the agency but um people may be filtering in here um and then when we get to the hearing portion we'll kind of see um who's interested in commenting and then a lot time from that portion um but really this part of my presentation should be should be pretty quick I'm going to do a facility overview which includes just a summary of the approved facility and then a summary of what request for Amendment one is um I'm going to provide an overview or the vice chair how is going to provide an overview of the hearing um Vice chair how and I are going to say a lot of similar things um and and for those of you who participate in the process there'll be familiar words but they are very important that's why we go over them a couple times um then we'll get to the hearing um where the certificate whole older Idaho Power will be provided an opportunity to comment on the draft proposed order members of the public will be provided an opportunity to provide oral comments and Council will be provided an opportunity to ask any clarifying questions of the certificate holder and then lastly the certificate holder will have an opportunity to respond to anything raised this evening um the written comment period also is still open which I'll um next slide please Nancy which I'll I will comment on those options that exist for people to comment so just real quick for those who may be new to the citing process Nancy can you click one more time the energy facility signing Council fsec or the council provides is provides a Consolidated review and oversight for large scale or utility scale energy facilities across Oregon um the council is made up of a seven person Governor appointed and Senate regulatory body who's the decision maker on these large energy projects in Oregon the council members come from all over Oregon and come from a wide array of backgrounds and serve terms so for folks who track with Council processes uh projects they see the council members change over time myself and other other my colleagues in the citing division at the Oregon Department of energy serve as staff to the council so we do like technical legal review project management and do things like we're doing here tonight next slide please and then one more click so this is our and uh in the room this is a little bit hard to uh hard to read the screen's a little bit small but but folks are kind of used to seeing our process Chevron this very much mirrors the same processes for an application for site certificate all applications and amendments originally are submitted in a preliminary State and they go through a completeness review where there's information requests sent to a certificate holder they provide responses this back and forth goes on until the department determined determines that the information in the amendment is sufficient for the Department to draft findings and conditions of compliance in a draft proposed order um and then when we deem the amendment complete um we then use that information um to draft findings and recommendations in the draft proposed order we issue um stems a comment period and then there's in-person hearings which leads us here and then the next steps after our we would issue and I will go over um more in my presentation of the next steps but folks for folks who are new to the process one of the things we really like to highlight is this is obviously where the red Chevron we're in the middle so we're not towards the end there's still more steps to go next slide please okay so the Boardman to Hemingway transmission line is an approved um Council uh approved uh the final order and issued the site certificate last September so we're just under a year here um from that Blast from a past um and um so the facility again the map is kind of small it includes approximately 273 miles of mostly 550 kilovolt transmission line through five counties in Oregon there are several alternative routes that are also approved and then there are rebuilds of some segments of the line that are included in the approval as related or supporting facilities that are approved and include multi-use areas which are like temporary construction um 299 polling and tensioning sites 10 communication stations and then two communication stations associated with the Morgan Lake alternative um and then another important related or supporting facility you know particularly as it applies to Amendment one are our roads so access roads which can be temporary access roads or permanent access roads um but roads are related approved related or supporting facility to the transmission line next slide please so what are we looking at in requests for Amendment one so similar to how Idaho Power originally proposed in the application and what council approved Idaho Power what council approved is was the approved route and then Alternatives which gave gives Idaho Power if they're approved the flexibility to choose one or the other ultimately when they build when in final facility design and build out the here as represented in request for Amendment one as Idaho Power works with landowners and gains access to do surveys and landowner negotiations a lot of that has necessitated moving some roads or routes around properties um which If It Moves outside of what was that previously approved site boundary that means they have to add that area and through an amendment process and so how Idaho Power has framed it in a request for Amendment one is just adding more options so these are functionally adding more areas and ultimately they will be able to pick from anything that is approved if these are approved so rfa1 includes uh",

        "text": "70 and so from a financial perspective it strikes me that we by conditioning this project as we have suggested here we are putting oregon taxpayers as the should something happen it might not be likely but it could happen and certainly given the changes in energy per generation um just everything that's going on in in energy and what i would like to see here right now the added language what in red in the document is the department shall review the five year idaho power would be obligated to do a five-year report and i would like the report to be annual or i'd like to see it as an annual report and in addition that um or at any time required by the council should something happen bankruptcy some event that would um cause us concern in terms of the the conditions we put on that thing they obligate taxpayers of the state to be that backstop i'm uncomfortable so i i would like us to retain the ability to always um come back and say we need a bond to speak to the wrist risk cindy i'm i'm not clear on what you're asking are you asking that the five year be changed to one year that's what i'd like to see an annual report i'm pretty sure that a public company has to do an annual financial report and i don't think that would be a burden to the organization but additionally that we would have the right at any time to require information and should that information suggest more risk than we had intention of here that we could additional security at any time a chair this is perry chocto and for the record um a one dollar bond it just doesn't seem practical to me something on this level of cost and this year level of of making profit uh a dollar is kind of strange i hope i'm able to talk about it sorry if i'm not any other council discussion where's the rest of the council on can can i ask a clarification this calendar whether can i ask a clarification question so making it annual and then or at any time counsel requests was that specific to the information that is specified in this report are you saying that you want a different information the examples you gave of fire or risk so that may increase the bond amount that those are kind of out of the scope of what was covered in this five-year report when council reviewed when we discussed this at the review of the dpo like you on your onset of your comments of just like well technology changes we want to know what's happening out like it with the grid and with technology and that's where this came from with the five years being a reasonable time that maybe something would change but i i just if with what you were asking with those examples that you gave to me those are not this is like technology and those are like risk things yeah those weren't examples for me of information it's financial information what what we're doing is saying you don't have to provide um security this is councilmember condon for the we're willing to take that risk ourselves and i'm uncomfortable with our doing that it's not us it's the taxpayers of the state of oregon and it's a financial report that would tell us i mean i quite frankly i'm not really sure what's intended here by a five-year report if financial like i thought that to be a financial report and maybe you were thinking just very differently i mean as i read it i was thinking financial report well it's like a i well this is the physical condition of the facility evolving transmission or electrical technologies the facility's performance in the context of the larger power grid certificate holders oh general financial condition including the certificate holders credit rating at that time it's the financial report i'm focused on right in the end it's their financial ability to do what we want them to do for retirement and giving us the financial assurance and i i don't see financial assurance here so other than that regulated utility and have been in business for 100 years there are risks that we may not have any idea what those will be so this is hanley and the burden really here is i mean the information is being provided by the idaho power but the burden is on the department to evaluate that five-year plan and include any other additional information as it's listed here in order to do that i'm not uncomfortable with the information that's being provided because i you know i think it does the certificate holders general financial condition and the department is evaluating that as a part of that report that they receive from idaho power i'm not sure that it's necessary every year that's i guess is my concern everyone's muted again so i can see this the edition thanks todd yeah there's just a little bit of a lag here so i'm just trying to pull it up do you mean this right here right there okay so i guess my my concern is we are talking about a transmission line we're not talking about the solar facility or we have no examples our testimony is there no transmission lines that have been taken down at least from what i'm seeing here i think what is being required in the report and by the department's evaluation every five years is going to is adequate the record todd cornette and the reason i want to scroll through so you can see the full condition on the screen is it does come to council so it's not just the count the staff's review it's the staff's review and then the council will consider whether the bond is required at that point in time so it's not just us it is council you know ultimately we're making our recommendation to you but you make the decision at that point in time whether it's every five years or if you want to change it to some other frequency yeah right and just in response to that this is council member condon five years is a long time when things go wrong and so i five years if we want to keep the five years that's fine as long as i would like to see something that says we have the opportunity at any time to ask for financial for for this information and make decisions accordingly not really asking for anything up front for a pretty large project and i would like to see us as having to analyze the situation as situation changes so it's proposed at five years now councilman condon's suggesting that stay the same i guess at five years or any time if the council were to deem necessary to other than at the five-year interval where's the council on that so you do it after that first underline the end or any time requested by the department i don't i don't have a problem with that that's this is handling i don't have a problem with that other counselors uh this is jordan cindy are you asking for the complete report at any time or just the financial report upon request financial condition well i would say the complete report because we're trying to make we'd be trying to make a decision based on a changing set of circumstances top foremost in my mind is the financial would there be an event that would trigger that or just at random upon request which i were smart enough to project what all of the instances are but there certainly are instances we've seen in the last five years that have transmission lines power generators other council members wanna let us know your support or not of this proposal sure how this is anne byer for the record um i'm torn on this because i i think it's reasonable to have the big bond during and then to have a lesser bond uh during initial operation i like that there's the kick in at 50 years it is a changing world and having the ability to adjust the bonding and i i understand um idaho power's position and they need some certainty because they have to go in and ask for raids making sure that they maintain their financial health and and it doesn't strike me that this council is going to ask for information just for the sake of having another report to review it would be some changing circumstance that would would trigger that request so i'm supportive of that additional that the department or the council can request that the specific information as necessary or when needed counselor truett i'm i'm torn as well i i'm i'm comfortable with five years i i don't want to necessarily counselor mcconnell and i understand completely where you're coming from but i also don't want to arbitrarily maybe it's not arbitrary but on unforeseen events open the door to what could turn into annual reports upon request it's a burden on both sides of the i think there should be some sort of qualifier potentially in there but again i'm pouring on counselor top tech i'm also torn on it too but um we have we have no way of knowing what the future brings it might be enough just to put in the wording that uh upon request we get the report upon request vice chair how if i yeah i don't want to overstep here but i may have a suggestion that uh from contract language that because i think i've heard the concern expressed that we don't want a future council to act arbitrarily um now ordinarily you know um there are protections against doing that in you know your kind of administrative this is the way that the statutes that govern citing work there's this concept that the site certificate is a contract and so it binds the council just as much as it binds the you know if there is a concern about a future uh council acting arbitrarily well you know because you've put in kind of carte blanche to rest request report wherever uh whenever um you know a typical thing that you'll see in contract language is just as you know the council may reasonably require you know that there's some kind of concept that you you can't just ask for this just because um you need to you need to have a stated basis for it and that would you know put things more in line with the notion of how the council has to conduct itself in you know its regular decision making that she even when you have discretion you don't have discretion to be arbitrary you you have to provide reasons for what you're doing so i you know because you're right you predict all potential future circumstances in which um you with hindsight you might want to see a piece of information and so that's a tool that we'll sometimes use to try to hedge against that as is you know provide some comfort to the other party that we're not just going to ask for it for fun which i can't imagine imagine anyone doing anyway but you know but that you still have the ability to get the information if you thank you um with that i think i'm on board too so i think there's a consensus there",

        "text": " process is taking hydrogen and splitting it with electricity is that the Crux of the comparison of whether this is a synthetic synthetic kind of process going on like or am I off base there well I think so um that's what we're trying to get to is compare the two of them to see if one equates to the other or not yeah um and you know and again the well maybe I'll get into the kind of the the context before I sort of um start responding so I think maybe the um my evaluation here might help answer that question okay or or at least provide you the information to help you answer the question okay good um I do have sure um thank you Cindy Condon um can you put so two billion bqs of heat a day is stated how does that relate to hydrog to what we just heard about hydrogen what is the two billion what's produced what's the amount of energy that's produced yeah that would be the equivalent so we would basically say if you take all the hydrogen that was produced at the facility on a daily basis and if you utilized it would it be equal to or greater than two billion BTUs and so if if you know the determination that an electrolyzer a hydrogen electrolyzer is a synthetic fuel plant okay then and then somebody came in and said we're only going to produce 1 billion BTUs equivalent you know a day it still would not be your jurisdiction it would have to be you know you would have to make this determination today that you believe a hydrogen electrolyzer is a synthetic fuel plant and then and somebody came in and said okay we want to create this industrial facility you know our answer would be well the Council made the determination that it is a synthetic fuel plant however you have to show us that you're producing you know equal to or greater than two billion you know BTUs per day equivalent and the use of the hydrogen would have to exclusively be for um fuel not for say um fertilizer or some other use okay I don't think and I'm I'm waiting deep into things I don't know but um you had mention that so there's one gallon of gas you made that comparison one gallon of gas and hydrogen um so is two billion BTUs a day of hydrogen like a really large PL I just don't don't know um relatively what we're talking about is it a really large plant that is or is it a small one as you a small relatively small electrolyzer that is putting out two billion BTUs or that could uh I just don't know anything about electrolyzers um well there's there be there's quite a wide variety of electri alzers used today industrial processes so I'm envisioning that this would be a facility that would that would produce significantly more uh for it to justify uh like a creating a hydrogen facility that's dedicated to creating hydrogen for storage or for use as a fuel it would it would probably far exceed that um and as far as like how much it's hard for me to say um how much it would be con I think I'm getting trapped in my facility my idea of what a facility is and so would a hydrogen facility with using an electrolysis process or electrolyzer be as big as a coal plant producing electricity it it could be okay okay more to be revealed I guess all right thank you Mr chairman oh uh councelor delin Mr chairman being a little bit familiar with this technology but by no means any more than a little bit familiar most of the environmental Advocates that are pushing hydrogen talking about this process which has uh literally no um no no green gas no emissions uh that are going to be problematic in the future I mean it's not only advocated for like smaller vehicles but it's perhaps advocated by some perhaps the only way that you could have larger vehicles uh transporting on things other than fossil fuels oddly enough what they do is they convert hydrogen back into electricity to run you know Electric Motors in the vehicle but it's far more practical than using electricity directly the amount of battery storage you would need in larger vehicles but I think it has a really broad potential use uh there are a lot of questions about it I think the staff analysis is On Target I mean it's think clearly outside of our purview I did have a question though although it does not exist at the time if there was a hydrogen pipeline in the future and one of the difficulties in transporting hydrogen is it has to be kept very cold um would that be under our purview so that's not a question that we're evaluating right now um so the answer to that is um I don't know because we have not um taken a look at that so that would have to be a separate um you know so this is really just looking at the sort of the plant that converts you know water and electricity to hydrogen and whether that's a synthetic fuel plant so we've not evaluated the pipeline question okay but I think clearly your presentation it doesn't follow under our definition of a of a facility under our jurisdiction um NOP okay you're back on all right so um getting back so again we wanted to kind of provide you know what the what the threshold is what we can answer what we can't answer you got the technology and I'm kind of looping back now to that sort of question you know which then puts us into the context so we looked at the text that didn't give us the answer um now we're looking at the context so um again does a hydrogen elect electrolyzer constitute a synthetic fuel plant so it helps to go back to when that was just put into the statute and what what were the thoughts at that time what was the legislature thinking what was the understanding of these you know respective um Technologies at that time um and so one of the ways to look at that is just definitions so it would be nice that if you know the legislature every time they put some word in the statute they would include a definition that clearly doesn't happen and it didn't happen here so we don't have any definition in statute to provide that value for us so it is worthwhile and the courts look at this all the time um you can go back to what the this the plain sort of more standard dictionary definitions were at the time so looking at the 1984 Webster's 2 new Riverside University dictionary definition of sin fuel um and so this was relative to the time that this was put in um it says a liquid gaseous or solid hydrocarbon fuel derived from naturally occurring fossil fuels as coal shell or tar sand um and then similarly the Oxford English Dictionary U which is now online the the word sin fuel first appeared in there in 1976 and and when this was put in statute it is it was the exactly the same it said any fuel made from coal oil share or uh Shale excuse me or the like as a substitute for a petroleum product so looking you know at these the the definition is really both related to fossil fuels so that was the sort of the context of those standard definitions you know at the time um next slide please so then going to the legislative record and there's a pretty significant legislative record so it was House Bill 2260 in 1981 that added the synthetic fuel plant to the definition of an energy facility and um included on that house bill record um were the Oregon Department of energy director at the time there was a representative from the Oregon environmental Council um as well as the House Legislative staff and and that information is more detailed in the staff report but all of the language that was provided on the record again was related to the possible environmental impacts and harmful byproducts of a synthetic fuel plant to determine why it needed to be added to FX jurisdiction so looking at air quality looking at effluent looking at you know greenhouse gases those were the reasons why they wanted to put it into FX jurisdiction was those environmental issues um and you know so again we believe that the focus and concern at the time was really related to fossil fuel feed stocks next slide please so this really just kind of goes back and summarizes what Michael um provided and comparing the two of them so looking at the Technologies the relative Technologies so for synthetic fuel plant feed stocks are typically coal gas biomass hydrogen electrolyzer water and electricity um what's the how does the technology work well for synthetic fuel plants you mix hydrogen carbon monoxide to to produce synthetic fuel plant which then can be processed into a hydrocarbon fuel um for hydrogen electrolyzer just use the electrolysis process to split the water into hydrogen and oxygen for synthetic fuel plant byproducts can include um greenhouse gases and other pollutant that need to be evaluated and limited and then for electrolyzers um you know no no harmful gases or by products from that process itself just oxygen and then the hydrogen quick question if I might um water consumption which was raised early on is Is water considered to be consumed as part of this process and who would monitor the water use do I need a water resources permit do I buy City water well I'll answer part of that and then I'll turn to Michael to answer the other one I mean like anything you have to have you know access to what you know whatever the size of the facility is they have to have legal access to that water so whether it's a water right or whether they have you know they're using industrial so this is not sort of granting any I mean if you determine that a hydrogen electrolyzer is not a synthetic fuel plant you're not giving anything to anybody they still have to go get a local land use approval they still have to site that facility according to local land use requirements they would still have to have legal access to the volume of water that they need to produce the amount of um hydrogen that they're intending to produce so um and you know as as Michael indicated you know some areas of the state you know we have you know groundwater limited areas and and critical groundwater areas and you know water is becoming more and more scarce so this again that's something that a developer of a hydrogen electrolyzer would have to figure out as part of their process and then I don't remember the first part of the question but see more oriented towards you yes so I I was just going to address so the water that is that does go through the process and and does get converted to hydrogen and oxygen that the water would go away yes yes so you would lose water in that process uh a fair amount of that water",

        "text": " much work went into refinishing the flooring it's back breaking work I don't know how they did it but that was before and that's after what building is this this is the Pavilion building yes and so will it stay like that or are you going to have to pick up that floor and put it back down every time yeah so this is a portable floor and it's almost like a huge puzzle so when they will it will be stored excuse me stacked in pieces okay all numbered and then when they're ready for an event they will lay it out and we're trying to get the the process of install and removal sort of timed because it does take a little bit of time and their staff is getting used to that but I think we've got it down to about a day and a half at this point so for sure so is the floor owned by the Expo Center or by travel Salem I travel Salem yes do you just like continue to store it there and do they charge you for that they don't they don't charge us for that um and we're getting a credit for them so when we bring in events to use their space we'll get a credit towards refurbishing the floor so it's a wonderful partnership they've been really great like we do with our fair and our training okay yeah okay great so I'll keep you posted as we continue to hopefully bring in some really great events because of this flooring the last couple of things so we work a lot in the social media space we work a lot in the public relations space telling our story trying to bring real life characters and experiences to our consumers so we featured the Silverton Christmas Market in the Oregon garden we did places to capture stunning fall photos and that got a ton of traction as well there and then we did 16 dreamy Hot Springs you might visit and that was featured on MSN lifestyle a couple more just samples of what we did shampoo State Heritage area the beer here celebrate Oregon craft beer month and then Smith Creek Village offers cozy Forest lodging and that was featured in The Oregonian so I think that's all I got for you today and I'd be happy to answer any additional questions you might have great any any uh questions for Angie I don't think so so Angie did you share the pickleball tournament with us uh last time you were here did we hear about that and all all the stuff that happened with that yeah no we haven't reported out on that yet that will come in my last quarter report for you oh okay but I can just give you a quick blush um this was our third year doing it um the first year we had a little over 100 participants second year we had over 300 and this time we had 461 participants so we had to actually kind of Midstream adjust to two separate venues but our primary venue was illahee they have a premier pickleball court yeah it's beautiful and uh so we're trying to build the West Coast's largest pickleball tournament currently we are the largest indoor tournament in Oregon and so we're continuing to try to build that and bring Economic Development to the communities so thank you for asking so I know the uh sorry Mr chair please yeah keep going I know the um uh Detroit Lake Community Center is now restored and they haven't they haven't really got the I don't think we've got the agreement between the foundation and the city totally we don't have any hotels up there but our our staff is working really hard on getting septic systems in to get some hotel we have four hotel rooms I guess County staff yeah yeah yeah County staff is Public Works is working really hard to get sewer system or septic systems installed for uh the commercial uh down there it would be really interesting to keep that on the radar for um smaller like basketball or volleyball tournaments for the high schools and I know there's not a lot of places for them to stay but even if it was a regional like between Bend Bend in Salem and there was something that could be done there where they travel and even if it's for the day so in your Sports Marketing uh in the high school interaction there think about that because it's really beautiful now that it's been restored and could be used and helped them with some income as well as bring some attention to what's happening in the canyon with the rebuild going on it's wonderful yeah have you toured it have you seen it I haven't and actually I I'm going to need to get my staff out there to go take a look at it we should have that on the radar we should be able um you know pitch it yeah and you and on that trip we can help you with that on that trip when you do it you might want to stop in Mill City and see the new gym that that prayers yeah first put a lot of their products into there's a gym there as well so there could be yeah kind of a regional tournament in the canyon for for uh you know probably high school that'd be wonderful there's a gentleman in our community called Chris roach I don't know if you know who he is his dad's an old basketball guy coach and and Chris follows suit but he puts on the capital city classic um every December but he's somebody that I would try to bring into the loop on this because he's very well connected and he might know of some he might want to do something himself out there so let me investigate that but that's a great lead I appreciate it sure yeah thank you thank you thank you Mr chairman thank you for your time thank you Kelly and Angie we're going to move on to our consent agenda yep Mr chair I moved to approve the consent agenda under Board of Commissioners board committee appointment Solid Waste Management advisory Council approve orders appointing Keith bondog Nguyen as chair and Bonnie Sullivan is vice chair to the Marion County Solid Waste Management advisory Council the terms ending April 30th 2024 and Scott Gagner as a citizen at large the term ending December 31st 2026. under Human Resources except the 2023 Marion County Compensation Board recommendation for elected officials and forward the recommendation to the budget under Information Technology approve amendment number four to the contract for services with executive Information Services Incorporated to add 34 880 for a new contract total of 1 million 484 319 for the Marion County Sheriff's Office records and jail management system through June excuse me September 30th 2026 and under Public Works schedule final consideration to adopted administrative ordinance for May 24 2023 for zone change comprehensive plan case 22-004 Rafael Hernandez Mercado and under Treasurer's Office a proven order increasing the change fund at Marion County's Brown Browns Island demolition landfill from 350 to 500 to meet the needs of customers paying with I'll second the motion the motion a second is there any further discussion seeing none of those in favor signify by saying aye aye aye aye commotion passes okay we have one item one item on under action today we're going to receive an appeal of the hearings officer's decision the nine conditional use permit case number 22-041 Silver Creek solar LLC and consider whether to schedule a public hearing for May 31st 2023. good morning good morning commissioners So today we're here to discuss accepting an appeal of the hearings officer decision denying conditional use permit cu-22-041 Silver Creek solar um so this was for the establishment of a photovatolic solar power generation facility on a 10 acre portion of a 30 acre parcel and a farm Timber Zone located at 3840 Silver Falls Drive Northeast just outside of Silverton on December 8th 2022 planning staff issued a recommendation of denial to the hearings officer on December 22nd 2002 a public hearing was held the record was left open until January 12 2013 and additional submissions were permitted through January 26 2023. on April 14 2023 the hearings officer issued a decision of denial the hearings officer determined that the proposal did not meet Marion County code as the Board of Commissioners repealed code sections regarding photovitalic solar on March in March of 2018 ordinance 1387. on April 28 2023 the applicant submitted an appeal to the board of county commissioner's office with a statement and appropriate filing fee the options uh for consideration for the appeal are to accept the appeal and remand the matter back to the hearings officer accept the appeal and schedule a public hearing the suggested date is May 31st 2023 to meet the state mandated decision or deny the appeal and uphold the hearings officer decision denying the request and staff recommends the Board of Commissioners deny the appeal and uphold the hearings officer's decision denying the request as there are no Provisions in the zoning code that will permit this sort of solar facility and I'll stand for any questions you guys may have any questions my only question is for the board because I was not here in 2018 and I've not decision but if you could provide context that'd be helpful sure Mr chair from me please uh so this goes back to the legislature in two thousand fifteen Maybe passed a bill that allowed solar farms in efu we didn't even know we didn't even know and all of a sudden our uh we had these solar Farms popping up in efu areas and they are uh put where uh PGE or whoever has uh infrastructure so and uh we we had a big hearing about it we had farmers in here and and um you know it's obviously a situation where some Farmers wanted them because they could make you know money on uh issuing their land the challenge was uh really high uh value Farmland was being taken up with these and I think and I'm going to speak for myself I I was the legislature won't let you build a house on 80 acres or less unless you can or whatever the number is unless you can produce so much income but yet we're going to start taking away farmland for renewable energy that um uh you know could be could be a problem so you weren't here yet were you okay so it was Janet and Sam uh yeah commissioner Carlson and and it was unanimous we had a big hearing about it uh and uh we we voted to because the the legislature allowed us to opt out of this okay so we said go put it in efu land on the east side where your trucks or whatever so basically we we stopped it from um back",

uh stored in this uh door or there's a there's coil super gutting conducting and then when you need the power you just tap it and then yeah you can put through a inverter to convert it to ac i'll just say maybe uh the other way is large storage batteries of lithium batteries i'm just suggesting maybe you ought to do a study on that see what the benefits there's also hydrogen uh converting the electricity to hydrogen then converting back to electricity through a fuel cell i'm suggesting maybe you ought to do a study on maybe on storage methods for electricity and see what is most uh economical or what uh you know they've got to look at maintenance uh a reliability and they look at the technologies that i think the technology recipient of magnetic storage is much more improved now than back in the 80s and it might be more uh feasible it might you know or you might want to develop a test bed to see if how this these different technologies work and let's just compare them see how they work get some uh research money or something to see if that would work that's great thank you so much for those comments harvey um i'm not as familiar with the coiled approach but that is something that we've noted down and the um we actually do have an ongoing study a different staff is working on it related to renewable hydrogen and we'll put a link to that study in the chat in case you're interested in it um thank you for that comment jason is there anything that um you wanted to um add around power quality i'm recalling there might have been something from a pnl study and while you're thinking about that there's a comment related to from shannon um power quality on the coast many of our solar installations are regularly faulting out not due to the solar generation but due to the quality of the utility power with which they must synchronize this limits our capacity for accessing rooftop and community solar thanks um shannon for that comment if anybody was looking for more on power quality um there was some references to that in the literature review and the references we cited um i don't know um the details of you know the quality currently and i'm sure it differs by location and differs based on the day you know or the season um so there's probably a lot of different ways to look at that but it was just generally flagged you know and we're just highlighting it at a high level so i'm just checking to see if there's any more hands raised or comments or questions in the chat related to local reliability and not seeing any hands raised yet just pause i think um mike just um raised his hand so we'll um go ahead and call on mike and unmute him for his commenter question thank you um i'm just wondering if a distribution plan for the power and i imagine some of it's going to be utilized for replacement of fossil fuel plants being shut down i'm just wondering what comes after that or if if there is a plan um thanks thanks mike for that question um i know jason has done a good job of covering this in some other forms jason do you want to provide a little bit of information on that question uh yeah i think the question is just i mean i mentioned it before and there's different facets to it but i think it's kind of on the on the buyer in the market who buys it um and then you know if there's a buyer then the project would get built and interconnected to the grid where that would happen is a little uncertain but once the electricity hits the grid um you know it kind of it goes where it needs to and then there's like paper trails of the contracts that are signed um for those for those buyers and and sellers the developer and the buyers at the power and so that kind of covers to some extent where it goes um but it would get distributed you know up and down the coastal grid and if there's more than then the grid can accommodate them that's where the storage topic kind of comes in or the transmission upgrades um so i don't know if that's helpful or maybe there's a different way to interpret your question or a different way you would phrase it but great thanks jason i'll just add that um there's a number of utilities that um do integrated resource planning which is a required process at least at the public utility commission for the three investor-owned utilities pacific corps portland general electric and idaho um and they do um every two years update to that integrated resource plan it's basically an analysis and about resource planning in other words how do you ensure that the customers of those utilities continue to get power uh while the resource makes like coal going offline as you mentioned um as happens and so that that is a sort of ongoing process that would be um used to analyze a big part of your question and then the other thing i'll mention is the northwest power council does a regional study for oregon washington idaho and part of montana that also looks at sort of the regional look on power related to a number of factors um but but what your your question goes to is is also included in that um but but i agree with uh jason that it it sort of depends on who the purchaser of the output of the power from the project is but the reality of sort of the physics of the grid is that it would be used wherever the power is needed at that let's see here there's um a couple more comments and questions in the chat that i'll speak to mark is asking can you give a link to the power quality reports you're referencing i work for utility on the coast and we really have customer complaints about power quality thanks um thanks mark for that and also thanks for being on the line we have a really um soft spot for utilities are a big part of the work we do so thanks for being on the line here sean from pge talks about has a comment oftentimes people think of power quality related to reliability but depending on the perspective they can mean different and then jason shared the pacific northwest national lab link for a technical report okay we're going back to the raised um i see that harvey has his hand raised and then shawn um after that so go ahead harvey well meet you thank you very much uh another uh another comment uh thinking about the reliability of these wind generator you're out in the middle of the ocean uh it's not very often but you have storms like the columbus day storm the and the uh storm of uh december 12 1898 uh have hurricane force winds i think that creep blanco wind speeds were up to and oklahoma state storm was 100 i think a coast guy told me best about 150 miles an hour and you've got this hurricane-force winds bearing down on this wind you have provisions of uh is there gonna be the the connections being there be such that uh they're strong enough to withstand not only the high wind but also the large waves you could get 30 40 maybe 50 foot high waves and what happens if they snap the anchor uh cables and then you got this wind generator floating around in the ocean it's now becoming a uh a uh hazard to marine traffic uh you are you're gonna have a like a uh a radio transmitter on it or something that's able to be able to track this thing if it breaks loose uh what do you what what are the provisions you have for that type of scenario that's great um great comments it's actually um kind of prescient because our april 7th public meeting is going to cover in more specificity some of the energy-related topics and turbine and platform technology that you might be raising so it's actually a great segue um also noting that we only have about five minutes left in the in the meeting today um but i think we've had a really great discussion on local reliability and resilience i think we're going to need to skip our last topic and just move that to our next meeting on april 7th in the interest of time but also wanted to encourage any additional written feedback on local reliability and resilience by march 25th thank you so much for your comments and questions on this topic there's just a few slides on next steps but i did see um rep rocksmith come on video to see if you wanted to okay um so i think we'll skip the draft literature review and move this to the next meeting and then we'll spend a few minutes with jason talking about next steps by jason right yeah and the literature review topic is all i was gonna do was flag a few things that were raised um within the confines of these topics and it was very minimal um and it was kind of like the miscellaneous questions so we're not missing much and and the feedback's all visible online um and more opportunities for commenting which is what i'm talking about here which is the same link we use the first time so you know easy as easy as it can be for remembering or just coming to the powerpoint here and clicking or going to the floating offshore wind website we have up all the links are there too and as you'll see i don't know how visible is but just the topics we covered today are kind of bolded and bulleted here and we have um different different boxes in the online comment portal for these topics generally for anybody to add any more things i thought about after hearing everybody's discussion today just a reminder of the you know that we have some required fields and then you just hit next and that saves save saves what you've submitted but it won't fully submit until you click through all the topics and then hit submit and so if you could do that for those of you who are interested um you know over the next couple weeks by march 25th that would be great nothing really to add i think i could mention again you know the idea for another meeting after april 7th we did a great job today i felt like we kind of hit the you know area of feedback not too much not too little to overwhelm the agenda it's kind of hard to build these",

        "text": " which is in the application is further they want that substation to be north of the umatilla river for access reasons and so if that project sorry if that substation does not get built the alternative connection is either a smaller project to the existing bpa line a mile to the north or the uec transmission option which is the long 25 mile line that goes off the page so to answer questions about phases that is going to be somewhat dependent upon the commercial solution to this project which is not yet uh finalized and so ultimately we want to provide a product to a customer um who's willing to pay a certain amount resiliency and reliable power and so as of today and the reason we added solar in batteries that you need those all three components to get to that close to around the clock solution and that's not just the utilities in oregon but cni customers are also looking for that uh more reliable product and so ultimately we're going to build what we can sell and so if we cannot sell 600 megawatts at once we will build in phases but but that's to be determined i think your other question was will you build wind solar and storage together right and i think i i you know i can't guarantee that i will say that all of the products that off takers are requesting these days they those products take priority and so when you bid into an rfp it will look be looked upon more favorably it will be more expensive to build and the power will be more expensive but ultimately in terms of shifting away and creating a a you know 100 renewable grid that's going to be a requirement and so our expectation is to build it but i i can't guarantee that will it will all be built together so a quick follow-up on that so is there a chance that a commercially viable solution is just is solar only on this on the the ground that's being the goaltree exception is requested potentially i think it will be difficult to build a long transmission line economically without a bigger project and if we do do solar it will most likely have batteries battery component as well okay so it likely will not be solar only it would be solar and storage but we started this project as a wind farm for a reason it's a windy site it's got its winds blow at a unique time of the year and a unique time of the day it's evolved over time to become what it is today great thank you anyone else on council have questions or okay i'm not hearing any does the applicant have anything else that they would like to provide at this time or present uh tim mcmahon here again for the record uh mr corey is in the room he does not intend to add additional testimony to a sworn declaration but he is available again for questions should you wish to ask any such questions so you won't be hearing from him again today unless you ask questions and in terms of the purpose of today's meeting which was to respond to comments so we we talked about the goal three exceptions we talked about the the the only other one that i had in my notes was about um capital power standing behind nolan hills and and making sure that the council is satisfied or that we provided an adequate response to that and i just wanted to kind of reengage on that and make sure that you have everything you need um thank you for remembering remembering that comment and it was not the material that you provided and um i am prepared to make a comment after because you asked the question i don't believe there's been sufficient evidence on the organizational expertise for the applicant capital power comes through loud and it's my understanding um nolan hills is not capital power um i i do have concerns about that and i think there probably there's probably evidence that can be given but i i certainly don't see it in the materials okay um that were offered in the application so uh and the reason i brought this up is is this was not prepared by the june 15th submittal and and we wanted to make sure we had the materials in your hand with adequate time to review but we did have our general counsel write a letter you know from cap on behalf of capital acknowledging that capital power will stand behind the nolan hills facility within exhibit a and exhibit d and exhibit m in terms of that expertise and and how capital power will bring that to the table and stand behind this project and so to the extent we can submit that on the record i wanted to do that here okay um do you have copies of that that you can provide to counsel i have two copies so there's a letter and then the the letter references exhibit a exhibit d and exhibit k which are append to the to the back end of it so your honor for the record todd cornett um we are making copies to hand out to council members and so this will just be more of a question once this agenda item concludes if you want to take a break in order to take a few minutes to review that or if you just want to go directly into the next agenda item so you don't have to answer that now but just be thinking about that all right is there anyone on council that wants to review that before they ask any questions of the applicant about it or are we ready to move on grail we can move on please is there anything else that the applicant wanted to present today i don't know okay and i realize i've checked him with council several times but i just want to make sure uh that there's nothing else the council wants to ask of applicant or any other comments they want to put on before i close the record for the public hearing so anything else from council on okay sarah grail no thank you all right well i'm not hearing anyone speaking up um the time then is 1 32 p.m on june 24th 2022 uh the public hearing on the draft proposed order for the nolan hills wind power project is now closed i want to thank everyone for their time on this i think that's the end of my my duties here thank you everyone your honor thank you honor thank you thank you so just from a time check sarah is going to make copies we could take a five minute break we could take a 10 minute break whatever your choice is to get the copies made hand them out it's about a page and a half so probably just take you a few minutes to uh to review that so but however long you want to take a break obviously it's fine let's take a 10 minute break please thank you please return it 142. you say that all again so uh patrick kellen can you verify that you can hear us okay thank you uh yes kate please okay start again i will start again so thank you chair grail thank you council members for the record my name is kathleen sloan i'm a senior signing analyst with the oregon department of energy i'm here to lead the presentation for the information item on agenda l for the nolan hills wind power project and this is the council review of the draft proposed order on the application for site certificate we're going to present this in somewhat of a team approach i'm going to start off the presentation sarah esterson our senior policy advisor will interject um on specific standards where we received public comments or comment from the applicant or comment from council helen tarte weather is on the phone she will be presenting on part of the dpo from public services on i will advance my slide i got two clickers here so just for uh organization of the the presentation i'm going to start with just a really brief overview of the applicant the proposed facility and its location a summary of the procedural history and then we're going to launch into a review of the council standards the issues raised and comments received and just as a note we had a total of 19 commenters that submitted public comments either oral or written oral testimony at the public hearing written comments received submitted in by letter or email and also comments from council and the so the nolan hills wind power project a pro an application that has been submitted by nolan hills wind llc a subsidiary of capital power proposed facility is a 600 megawatt wind and solar energy facility with supporting and related facilities and components that includes two proposed transmission lines a battery energy storage system or a bus and a occupies a micro sighting quarter of about fifteen thousand acres within a forty eight 000 acre plus site boundary located in northwestern umatilla county so this slide here i'm going to see if my clicker works okay this slide here depicts the micro signing corridor the proposed site boundaries so the is the site boundary what is depicted in purple is the microsighting corridor and i think what is important to point out here are a couple of features this purple polygon that i'm circling with my arrow up here in the upper right corner is the proposed solar facility that's the 1896 for which a goal exception is being requested under goal three and there are two proposed transmission line routes leaving the the site boundary the first one is the one that's going to sorry my mouse is getting away from me going to the proposed bpa substation this is the line that goes north crosses the umatilla river the other transmission line option is the uec the umatilla electrical co-op follows the existing uec line and would go up to another substation or existing substation so um it also depicts the turbine strings and access roads which are the longer linear purple lines throughout the site it's a little bit on the procedural um the notice of intent was filed in september of 2017. the draft proposed order was issued by the department in april of 2022 in between there was a series of revised preliminary applications changes in site design um but the dpo was issued in april it opened a 37-day public comment period we had a public hearing pendleton in person on may 26th the hearing was held open at the applicant's request to respond to comments received at that hearing that hearing just closed in the previous agenda item so the public hearing has been closed and where we're at today is council's of the dpo um after today the next steps would be to issue the proposed order which the department will work on so today is the opportunity for council to",

it is it is difficult but it also is um if you can get one it's incredibly helpful for those these individuals and it's helpful for the criminal justice system too because we want to hold these people accountable and so it's just another burial that we can knock down for these victims um that's a great Point Elana and and for the record feel free to participate as much as you'd like the only thing you really can't do is vote um since you're not a sitting member but questions talk comments whatever I encourage you to do all of the above so did anyone else have any any questions or comments with that uh I'll have a comment and then and then first of maybe multiple questions um just as a reminder slash information for our guest um this conversation is the first in a series of several that uh respond to we do an annual community belonging survey uh in partnership with the city and students at Western Oregon and um one of the things of kind of concern that we heard from the community was uh a distrust a lack of fluency uh um uh govern government law enforcement Etc among our indigenous Latino Community our indigenous migrant which is often doubly legible as undocumented or unsanctioned migrants and uh our our knee-jerk reaction our Instinct was that a lot of this interpetation come stems from that from that legal status and so we've kind of embarked on this little journey of soliciting information and understanding the scope of the kind of where we are the landscape of policies and laws as they stand today and areas of growth and so Lieutenant's presentation Alana was the first in that conversation we were reaching out to um folks from the HRC from the City of Eugene who did work on this several years ago and then also working Community Partners uh in the new year so I thank you first lieutenant for that presentation um Outreach does SPD do uh Visa informing community members maybe much of the fashion that you've done for us tonight so that they know their rights and are uh have this information accessible to them that's my question yeah it's a great question so um here obviously is um one of those outreaches um so for the two two years so this isn't maybe necessarily specific to to um Sanctuary promise but for the past two years since Salem has become a um resettlement site for refugees I do provide a um an hour and a half class to newly arrive refu refugees on their right as well as just to acquaint them with law enforcement and and our laws uh in Oregon in the US but I also talk about their rights we talk about some of their constitutional rights um so that I don't know if that specifically answers your question if you're asking do we go Outreach um for specifically for Sanctuary promise we have done um informational sessions especially when we're asked to we'll come and talk to any group who wants to know what our policies are or what the Oregon what Oregon law is um I have done um a town I did a town hall at Shad Community College not it's probably a couple years ago um when there was a lot of questions about Sanctuary laws so we do we do some um but we're always I am always happy to to go do more especially if there are groups that want us to come and talk with them about it and I I know the the Oregon Law Center has a a migr farmer group program where they try to help do some of the Outreach I just alluded to and there are several entities I remember when I worked as a community organizer with gausa a couple years ago who did who did similar work does does SPD or the city have uh information about regarding these these laws and policies and and the city's practices in indigenous languages uh which are the languages of many of our migrant Farm Workers who are undocumented are you talking in Spanish or in different other other than Spanish like M or sapot or Ricki yeah so that would be a great so not to throw Gretchen on the hot seat but um I know I know that we do have access to different interpretive services so we don't have it on our website because those are fairly specific so it would be hard to have those very specific ones but um I mean obviously if somebody had the request we we would accommodate it as well as we could those are pretty very specific uh ones so we would have to work with an interpreter I I ask only because there are about 60,000 indigenous migrants in the wam Valley and many of them are very are don't speak any English or Spanish language limited sure and a lot of the the DV comments actually made me think of this is a lot of the uh undocumented or unsanctioned migrants are women and children um in in the in the kka era in the mid 80s a lot of the men gained citizenship and brought their wives to the United States who who are in turn undocumented and remain so and so uh and many of them just for cultural reasons don't speak any Spanish and so a lot of men do a lot of the speaking in Spanish or English if they can and so in terms of empowering people who really wouldn't have access to it maybe even wouldn't know to make the request in the first place having those indigen languages available literature rather in those languages for the this thing of the women yeah yeah that's that's where where we would really need the community's support on that to identify where we would locate those individuals ual to to maybe help identify interpretive services to help you know create that connection so I could I could hear you maybe volunteering yourself for it well our my indous language is not what I unfortunately don't speak M but um I uh I'm asking in part because I mean part of the point of this conversation other than just to know which I think we everyone ought to on on the commission is to think about how do we respond how do we you know kind of expand this this Manel of of belonging to as many folks as we can and I think it is an outstanding question whether that involves as it was with housing you know policy changes law legal changes as we saw in chapter 97 which originated with this entity of this body or if it is uh an educational thing whether it's a translation thing whether it's you know doing all these are these are the kind of questions that we will be grappling with and so I mean I guess this is maybe an unfair question maybe one you can't or won't answer and that's fine but from From spd's perspective what are some legal or policy I have to ask because you're here de you know what what are what are some areas where you think well you know that we could I don't know maybe has unfair question because she's representing the the police department but well it's never an unfair question because I am here representing the police department um now whether I have an answer for you or not because that's it's a that's a very that's a deep um specifically um policy changes related to uh belonging or specifically around specifically around Sanctuary I guess I'll qualify my question with you know Thea uh Alonso Leon who's the the congresswoman she's now no longer in the Congress but she's a former State Rep who sponsored the the house bill in 21 you know prior to that I mean you mentioned you know the 80s or organ was actually the first Sanctuary state in the country and uh a lot of the community Advocates regarded is rather important and material but somewhat toothless prior to 21 uh when when uh State Rep alono introduced her her her um her bill so I guess my question is you know as we're wrestling with these questions from your perspective as someone who's been a law enforcement for you know quar of a century now what what what are what are how can we make it toothy or can we or is it really just an education question on on our end boy that's that is a great question um I don't know if I have a great answer for you um I might have to think about it I will tell you that one of my frustrations with the law enforcement or with the criminal justice system is the ability to protect victim information um that that maybe has something to do with your question maybe not but I'll I'll get on my Soap Box a little bit so you know you have and it does really relate to the HRC because uh police reports largely are public records and so if you have someone who reports a crime especially if it's a sensitive topic like maybe it's a a biased crime and they're lgbtqi plus but they haven't disclosed that to their family and the case goes through the system and then somebody ends up having access to the police report and they're able to access that information that's and cret it makes somebody feel incredibly vulnerable so having some more support some Protections in place for victims um and understand there's a right for the maybe for the public to have some of this information but at the same time I just feel for these victims that feel like they want to report this but then they also don't want everything that happened to them potentially out in the public purview so I know it doesn't NE that doesn't necessarily answer your question but I I I am advocate for how do we protect the victim's information uh when they're going through the criminal justice system and then after the case is concluded and the the information could potentially be public information um I know it doesn't specifically answer your question but that's that is a a pet peeve of mine um but let me I might have something better for you Wen later so let me think about it yeah I mean I think you know this this is first of many as I said conversation so there's no pressure to have all the answers or any right now I I will preliminar say I mean I don't think the government should be in the business of adding uh our neighbors uh and um so maybe this this becomes a larger conversation around this what I would imagine is a very tender and specific legal dance right to embark on around how do we negotiate apprciate these questions and uh whatever recommendations or actions this commission makes might be more in that in that Arena but thank you for your yeah all right thank you",

it need to be bigger there something we're not seeing here and it's just at the noi comment phase this is one of the things that we're really trying to uh dial in because in the app in the project order that I prepare I'm going to identify the required analysis areas for the application and they may be the same slightly mod different so if you have thoughts or concerns about potential impacts of a project to these resources then please be sure to put those in their comments and what you think those analysis areas be and then just land use is a complicated topic but just so you know the state sighting process is what we call a Consolidated review and it pulls in all most of the permits and requirements from local governments and state agencies that would other that would otherwise apply through those different it's it's to simplify the permitting process so the requirements are still there but it runs through one process of review and that's why we call it Consolidated review for land use the applicant has an option to have the land use review being conducted by the local government or to have it in the Consolidated State review um I believe in the notice of applicate has indicated that the local land use requirements for Wasco and Sherman counties they're going to opt in to utilizing the Consolidated State review process the can choose to do the local review but at the time they submit their application they have to lock it in they can't change their mind later if they say they wanted to do local review or state Consolidated in the application right now you know they they're not locked in but once they put in the application they can't change it so just a really quick next slide I'm trying sorry the proposed facility location is that black outline um and just to give you an idea of where it is what's in proximity and like I said it's approximately 12 6 square miles of private land and from what I understand the only portion of the facility that would actually extend into Sherman County is that transmission line should it move in there because it's right up against the that's correct where the site facility is not is is purely within Wasco one of the proposed interconnection points um is that line you see extending North that doeser count and that's an option they have it one of two options yes so just next slide very simply and this is just a really Brie overview of what's in the notice of in P so what is this facility it's a proposed 800 megawatt solar photo voltaic energy generation facility with related or supporting facilities that include up to 800 megawatts of battery storage um a 34.5 collection system a collector substation an onm building and overhead 500 KV gen thain fencing Access Road staging areas and as Jeff had noted they're looking at two options for what we call a point of interconnection or a POI one would be directly adjacent to the facility the other option is if they had to go north about 4.5 miles to connect with a different uh BPA subject next slide so I just wanted this is not the public comment period of this meeting but I wanted to talk a little bit about the public comment period on this notice of the H as I had mentioned the public comment period opened the day we issued the notice on October 10th and it will be open until December 1st there are multiple ways to provide comment you we have a comment portal you can email me it's all in the public notice there's a copy of the table back there if you haven't received one um and it's really like I said opportunity you can email me you can Su them snail mail we take comments tonight these will all become part of of the comments that we include in the project order that I'm going to preparing um as I noted before it's not a public hearing the public hearing comes after we issue a draft proposed order and it's not required to comment if you wish to participate in a contested case at a later stage um and we'll open it up for Q&amp;A in public comment after Jeff has an opportunity to provide his uh his presentation next slide this is also information that's on the public notice that this is my contact information my email my phone number please feel free to com contact me if you have any questions or any comments that you want to provide to the Department of energy as we move through process um and then the next slide we have an amazing web resource web based resource great web page um this slide is really just to show you that there are several um places in the Oregon Department of energy energy facility sighting Council website where you can get all sorts of information we have a project web page set up for this facility we will update that project page as things move along um there are ways to submit comments through the internet and our comment portal any comments that we receive get uploaded to what we call our site docket so people can review and see what's been provided we have a very public process we have a public guide on how to participate in our process we have hand notes on that back table that also you can take with you that outline our process and how it works and what our standards are and where we're at in our process and there's some good links down there at the bottom of that page and so like I said I just really wanted to thank everybody here in the room in particular and anybody that's participating on online for participating in our meeting and at this point I am going to turn it over to Jeff who will talk about the facilities you're you're you're okay okay um thank you anyone for anyone who just walked in or just joined online again my name is Jeff Watson uh development manager Sav On energy and lead developer on this project uh going to keep things brief want to give everyone some time to make sure their questions and comments are heard and answered um so just gonna quickly give an overview of Savon as a company and then the pro so Savon uh is we are a us-based developer for renewable whether that be solar PB uh storage or wind based out of Kansas City Missouri um operating in 33 Excuse Me 3 three states across the US um Savon is a portfolio company of and wholly owned by shell energy um Savon effectively functions as shells um Renewables are in the United States so while we are owned by shell we do operate as our our own entity um and the benefit there is that we get to utilize any sort of connections or existing um shell may have in Renewables energy Etc uh while still you know pursuing our own um development efforts on their behalf uh and next slide please so just to give an overview of our um you know sort of experience in the in the industry I know that's a lot of numbers up there uh but over on the left we have you know about 2.5 to upwards of three U gws of projects that are contracted so you know have a contract to sell energy uh under construction or in operation um we are also develop have a significant solar and energy development portfolios um again across 27 States so one thing I will mention is that um you know Savon is a new er entry to the Pacific Northwest um that being said uh I feel like at this point we have a very good fo hold in um you know Oregon Washington even Idaho and shell as a company has a significant investment in Washington so we at Savon we have a local team here um across the the Western Seaboard and shell has a pretty significant presence in Washington with a trading desk um and other other teams based out of Spokane uh and because of that investment in the Pacific Northwest particularly within BPA which this project is interconnecting into um there's been a lot of ways that you know I guess all that is to say is that you know we have a bested interest in in succeeding in this part of the country and and are very much here to here to stay and next slide please so that's a bit about Savon um and so I just wanted to give you an overview of the project and I know that Kate already went through this so I'll just try to you know walk through this quickly so we are 800 megaw of solar PB uh that is going to be developed and constructed in phases so divided into half so two think of it as two 400 megawatt projects divided up into phases um this may include up to 800 megawatts of battery energy storage uh that number is yet to be fully determined as BPA does provide us some flexibility there um but at most it would be a one: one ratio of solar panels to battery storage uh as I mentioned that it's on the BP uh excuse me the BPA uh system our Pro so BPA allows us to choose two pois or point of interconnections our first is along the bucket of grizzly 500 KB line number two which is directly adjacent to the project uh we would effectively be what's called tapping the line or constructing a new substation on site uh and having our point of interconnection be on site with the project the other option we are exploring is running about a 4 and a half mile Genai North into Buckley substation in Sherman County um this is something that is not yet it is something we're looking at it's something that we're doing our diligence on uh it's not something we fully yet secured um so we'll continue to look at this as an option uh but for now we do have an initial uh point of interconnection secured at uh the and then quickly just on permitting",

        "text": " feedback we get from the committee uh if staff gives us that and then once we issue the notice there'd be a public comment period for 20 days so I did send you a comment we received uh last night um about our proposal and specifically there was a concern that using the commenter group would not create a representative in particular they are concerned about including just public commenters that didn't necessarily have specialized um about uh fiscal impacts if the council wanted to have a more targeted group we could exclude some of the commenters the council could of course add other people I do want to note that in that comment the the the person who's new sun energy they said you know we need to have uh small businesses local governments uh energy developers environmental and maybe other groups included those groups and interests are pretty well represented by the commenters that we got and these are people that have already expressed interest in participating the one group that maybe were missing is local governments but um I don't think local one local governments just haven't been participating in this will making haven't raised any concerns about physical impacts to them um and don't we don't think they would really be affected by this Rule and a meaning meaningful or in a direct way at um we could invite Association of Oregon counties or someone else along if the council wanted us to uh and then if the council did want to limit the public participants we could we could extend this invitation to everybody except for the people that commented through that that online platform but I personally think that that those people were interested they represent local communities they have local knowledge and you know we have trouble getting members of the public to come to these kind of meetings so sending an invitation out to 70 people probably isn't going to result in 70 people coming to this meeting um and if they did the smartson good for them yeah I do not in favor of um because I'm almost like hey I let them played but now you can come play so yeah I think that's a terrible yeah um I would say that in it magically you'd end up a level you want to participate and then you know have some kind of discussion on what he could do or you could team things up but I am not in favor of now drawing yeah this is how I don't see the um well so Nissan industry is a a solar developer the organ solar and storage Industries Association is the industries Association representing the interest most likely to be affected by these rules to the solar is what we're seeing the most of renewable Northwest is a renewable advocacy group but their interests are often represent the renewable energy industry as well there are no Public Utilities yeah um public utilities will not have much to say about the small business impact statement but they could provide an impact on the fiscal impact statement more generally so we could include Idaho Power oh well there's an error on this side because Idaho powered by comments and this is just Larson my opinion when you start getting into the utilities this is their world and I would expect them to have they know the process they know how to be engaged I don't feel like we have to do extra work to engage them so I'm not concerned about that what I would say is maybe they're part of it it's like in my mind lives with Chambers of Commerce sight of people like those are that's a a kid they wouldn't follow on a rule but um that's where I'm going to go see on some of this places should be you're going to say small businesses then go to small businesses otherwise I think you're just so I'm more concerned about balance you know business these most of these folks are going to advocate for small business and yet our definition of small business doesn't really include science certificate applicants and so you know these aren't a certificate outputs generally that is for us and and we could invite if you if you would like us to invite applicants like the big ones like up in Greater nextera um there's a couple of others that I'm not thinking of right now um we could send this out to that pool as well um uh obsidian was specifically referenced as uh you know a small business that could potentially be affected although we don't agreement uh obsidian did not comment on this woman so yeah this is again this is Marcy for me this is their their wheelhouse this is what they do they did not participate and that's just strange to me that developers who we've obviously been engaged with them sitting in over the last several years that they would not have participated I don't I don't have a lot of I'm concerned about this because that's what they do for a living it's the the average the ranchers and the farmers and the people who don't sit down on a computer all day and track who's been put outside their job because developers that is their job and they know the definition of small business that's probably why they didn't participate yeah go ahead I guess that's my I'm a little bit confused by the conversation with respect to applicants being the parent company which is clearly not a small business commenting on the applicant who is in LLC that at least in some there aren't any even any employment employees that's what I'm a little bit confused what they would with the parent would add you know for an invitation you know if they were invited so the physical impact statement does have two components I mean one is just a general statement which we provided and we did estimate how we think these rules would affect certificate holders in that um the second part is like specific to small businesses and as you'll see in the amended notice we basically say if there was a small business a heavy there plus medical assistant setup by the impact would be the same small business and to me the Oregon solar and storage Industries in renewable Northwest I don't know who all the members are but they're enlightening to be those small business actions I would think this is Mercy I would say as individuals and the people who are affected to do the work they probably would mean yeah yeah and we can you know we invite OCS to participate um it has been you know their executive director of the staff that have been the most active but we could you know ask them to everyone kind of their members if they can yeah that I was going to say that it you know not necessarily that the invitation go out for the Oregon solar Association renewable Northwest for instance but they them and their members you know so for an individual if they want to participate in an individual companies but not sorry this is Marcy and I think we ought to not move sight of what the rulemaking is is a start that's where I think it goes off the grants you know we're talking about senior resources and Recreation standards rule making not because if I sit there and go otherwise then I say well I should be getting every left contractor and we're going to say because they are small businesses you know we could go we could make some big mess as we're trying to do the right things so I don't want to do that and if if I made one additional consideration is that this is who we're proposing to send the invites out to we'd also have to do public notice because it's a public meeting whether or not we wish to allow other people who show up at the meeting to participate is kind of that's more of a discretionary Choice I personally I mean I kind of feel like depends on on what what the the audience looks like being if there's you know if all 77 comments are going to show up you would likely knocking a lot of other people to participate but if we have a people five and two people who two two members of industry or other people show up that that were not on our specific invite list like there's nothing set up table and participating by um the important thing is that there's the committee and we ask them the question about this one box uh and consider their advice and this is Marcy and by the public notice being there that doesn't because it is it's just the meeting or they can still submit cops um on the fiscal impact statement that's included in the amended notice it would be more limited um often we do have a like public comment period at these kind of advisory committee meetings or people that a designated member of the committee can kind of say well this is my recommendation I guess that's what I'm asking is if there's still okay we want to not have every person from every enactment people could still comment on the specifics of what we're discussing Yeah by having the mirror back there's a public thanks that's awesome and I just want to be clear that there's an opportunity it may not be the desired opportunity because you're not sitting at the table or on Zoom but there's still looking for people to fun specific issue with you thank you chair yeah I think that's accurate and then I will just add that also if we once we issue the amended notice that is a full public comment period and there's no limitation on the comments that people expect during that yes and the quick question City condom um for the advisory committee do we do you set the size you know like work send out this invitation but it gets unwieldy after you know with more than seven people are right if you've set the signs typically yes um and what we would normally do for like a regular rules advisory committee yeah oh well I think what like a practice is anyways and this is what we're recommending for the amended enrollment amendment rulemaking that we're talking about later is that we would solicit interest have people give us you know tell us whether they want to participate uh and we'll you know give us some basic information about what interest they they why they're interested or what their qualifications are uh and then we would come back to you and say Here's the pool of people who express interest you know we want you to pick a representative group out of this pool um here's our recommendation you know do you have any changes in this case since we're on a I mean it's kind of a tight time frame um we don't really have I mean we could send out conceivably a request for interest today uh say you have to let us know by next Wednesday so we have enough time to get the notice out for the actual meeting uh and then you would have to authorize staff to make the decision on who gets included or not I must be uh you want us to come back at the November meeting and you know we obviously we can spread this out as long as you want if you want to be more involved and all",

        "text": " Corridor to really facilitate negotiations with land owners this change will allow IPC to work with landowners and accommodate change during the construction process as you know Wardman hemway is a 300 mile long transmission line and things will come up during construction and it's it's a key uh Energy Corridor uh energy pipeline for um to bring renewable energy from the north from the Northwest to Idaho and from Idaho to the northwest so to clarify the original site boundary really is a micro siding Corridor so we can move project features anywhere inside that um based on engineering as we develop final engineering work with land owners and that sort of thing what we're proposing is to have an expanded site boundary and changing the original site boundary to become the microid and Corridor so that doesn't change when we have this expanded site boundary which is that quarter mile from the center line of the transmission on on either side it allows Idaho Power uh to move a project feature with landowner support only we're not we're not going to move that without agreement from the landowner uh but we also have to do all the required studies ahead of time which include biological and cultural studies from there once we have a proposed move into that microid sorry expanded site boundary we would then develop the the amendment determinate determination request with um and send that into uh staff at um at the organ Department of energy from there it'll be it uh if that change is substantive enough an amendment is required we'll evaluate where we are the goal here is to be able to accommodate landowner changes and evaluate if they're minor enough and change if we're moving you know a common scenario we're working with a land they ask us to move an access road because it's better for their Farm it minimizes their impact if we would have to go through an entire amendment process that's as you can see from our previous timeline that's a lengthy lengthy time timeline and there'll be multiple many of those that might come up so what we're trying to do is if it's minor in nature we've done the studies we get uh we prove that it's similar impact same habitat um we've proven there's no resources that are impacted then it just sense for the project and for the landowner so that's what we're trying to do we're trying to accommodate landowner requests and if something happens during construction where um we have to make a minor change onto a road if we would move for example 10 feet outside the site boundary because which is and you can look at it you can say this is similar impact because we're moving that that area 10 just 10 feet outside the site boundary an amendment would be required with this new process we would be able to approach uh do an amendment determination request show that it's minimal impact and we could move ahead with construction and keep our construction timeline so I I really just want to clarify what this does and what it doesn't do so right it allows us to continue to work with land owners on a and and work to negotiations to to gain easements it doesn't grant us any sort of condemnation rights out we're not going to condemn in this expanded site boundary it'll allow us to keep construction on schedule this is a vital PR to the Northwest as I stated earlier and um it'll it'll really allow us to to minimize our impacts and and minimize the burden on doing multiple multiple amendments for minor changes what it doesn't allow us to do is we can't just build wherever we want in the site boundary without approval we we can't avoid studies we can't avoid def determining exactly what the impacts are we still have to go through that process it doesn't allow Idaho Power to force changes on land owners right now as the where the line is shown is where we're going we intend to build it we're not going to be really this expanded site boundary is going to be I I see it mostly for Access roads right we that is that is probably the the most common use of this unless we can reach an agreement with a landowner um for to change change drout really I think the goal of this is for remote flexibility during construction on a very complex project and I do want to comment a little bit you know right now um on blasting I believe you know we do not intend to do any sort of foundation blasting based on our current construction plans but we are trying to leave that open and we would have to gain approval with the Department on a blasting plan if we decide we need to do blasting based on the soils that we encounter during construction um comments on you know individual negotiations with owners those those we don't really discuss publicly because those are between us and that party and they are complex and really outside the jurisdiction of odoe and FC um yeah that's all I have to say Thank you Mr Sipple okay it is 7:38 on Monday on uh May May 30th 2024 in the public hearing on the draft proposed order for the Boardman to him andway request for amendment to is not closed the the hearing's closed but the records left open until 5 o'clock tomorrow so it's we're behind schedule significantly um what do people want to do a 10minute break okay 10-minute break we'll come back at okay it is now uh 750 the next agenda is for the wagon trail solar project draft proposed order public hearing and will include an information portion provided by senior sighting analyst Chase McBay Walker who will provide a brief overview of the agenda item and the request and a public Hearing in which I will serve as a presiding officer officer uh Mr McVey walker uh please proceed with the information portion of the agenda item thank thank you very much chair how and good evening to you and the members of the council um for the record my name is Chase McBay Walker I'm a senior sighting analyst with the Oregon Department of energy Nancy can you go next slide please as chair how mentioned for tonight's agenda Item B I will be providing you with an overview of the proposed Wagon Trail solar project as well as a summary of the energy facility sighting process for an application for a site certificate and then we'll hand off the presentation to chair how who will serve as the presiding office officer for the DPO public hearing portion of this agenda item uh council's review of the DPO including comments on the DPO is anticipated to occur at the June council meeting so that's the next step we're bifurcating the review of the DPO and the and the in the public hearing the applicant tonight will have an opportunity to provide and or present their comments on the DPO and we'll also have an opportunity to respond to any comments received at the hearing tonight uh in addition because the comment period deadline is next Friday June the 7th the department requests that Council hold the record open for the applicant to respond to comments received by the deadline until uh 5 o'clock Pacific time on Monday the 10th uh to allow for them to have an opportunity to respond to any comments received by the deadline and lastly Council also has the opportunity tonight to provide comments on the DPO and on the ASC an overview of the energy facility sighting Council I'll keep it brief as Kellen has already gone over this but the energy facility sting Council um is a seven member uh volunteer uh Governor appointed Oregon Senate approved uh group Council um and the Oregon Department of energy sighting division serves as staff to council while Odo staff makes recommendations to the facility sighting Council or FC it's FC themselves yourselves um that is the final decisionmaking Authority for energy facilities under FC jurisdiction including uh the proposed Wagon Trail solar project next slide please which brings me to an a brief overview of the proposed project The Wagon Trail solar project is a a proposed up to 500 solar solar photov voltaic energy generation facility uh proposed by Wagon Trail Energy Center LLC which is a wholly owned subsidiary of nexera energy LLC the facility is proposed to be to be cited within a site boundary of 7,450 Acres all of which would would be in Morrow County and within exclusive Farm use zoned area private privately owned exclusive Farm use zone of that 7450 Acres within the site boundary uh the proposed facility would permanently occupy 3,641 Acres so less than the proposed boundary and related or supporting facility components include up to 500 megaw uh lithium ion energy storage and that would be uh cited in two different locations a Northern Battery uh storage component and then a southern one as well as two collector substations a northern and a southern uh 34 A5 kilovolt collection system6 miles of 230 KV transmission line and also up to 47 miles of access roads next slide please now I'm getting into the process steps there's uh seven major steps in the review of applications for site certificates I'd like to emphasize that we're currently at the draft proposed order step which is the fourth step of the seven the first is the applicant's uh notice of intent which is their conceptual plan if you will the notice of intent is reviewed by the department and the Department issues a project order which is the blueprint for the application it dictates what the applicable requirements are and would be following the project order uh the department receives preliminary application for site certificate from the applicant and through reviewing agency and coordination with the public via a public information meeting the uh reviews the preliminary application for completeness and ultimately once completeness is reached a complete application is provided to the department which is where the the recommended findings in the draft prop proposed order are based off of is the application following the draft proposed order the department uh and following following the public hearing and fex review of the draft proposed order the next step in the process is the proposed order and that's uh staff's revised Rec recommendations based on comments received if there's a contested case that's a a step following the propos the proposed order and only those persons who have raised a relevant issue in person at the public hearing tonight or in writing by the comment deadline which is next Friday June the 7th May participate in the contested case and the contested case process step is run by an independent hearing officer following contested case process should there be one is uh fex review of a contested case order if there is one or Andor review of the proposed order and the issuance of a final order which approves or denies the application for site certificate this slide",

leasing or that's it this is whitney howard with boom again that's a good that's a good question and i don't i don't know the full answer i think historically um some leases have been issued on the east coast that um do not include these labor requirements and i think i don't know what that means for future leases being issued i think the um you know the the labor aspect is is an important one and one that there are discussions um with boehm currently and you know i think there's um you know in in working with developing the least terms and and uh in its review there there could be a potential for it but i i don't know a lot about that and know that it's a topic that's under discussion currently i'll also mention that in a in a little bit in the slide there is a topic on economic development where this might come up again i also see kathy has her hand up so we'll go ahead and unmute kathy for me is that a yes yes we can hear you thanks okay i had a follow-up to my question about uh allowing fishing um since we have some offshore with offshore wind not necessarily floating but offshore turbines on the east coast um what's the experience with whether or not fishing has been allowed to continue in those operating areas so there um you know there is the the construction and within state water there are five wind turbines in in operation and then there's also been the constructions of two two turbines um that was the block island wind wind project and then two in federal waters um with a as a research project off of virginia and so we're starting to see um what that looked like but there is still fishing that occurs outdoor these these turbines um so there was whether or not um for the construction of um the turbine there could be a buffer area to exclude any type of activity while while these these devices are are being installed and and even to that extent i'm i'm not sure if there was a buffer um implemented i know there has been examples of that in the world around the world um but we uh we are still seeing as proposed in in the construction operations plan of activities and its environmental review there is fishing within the projects area and also do we have any experience from uh europe as to whether they keep their fishing going they've had the offshore wind a lot longer than we have so that's a that's a good question i think they're um i don't know the answer i think where where this becomes a really interesting question for the west coast specifically is the floating offshore wind energy technology with the floating platform and the associated cabling mooring and and a dynamic c cable that that's suspended in the water column um and there are a few examples of floating offshore wind that are that are worldwide and i don't know the answer for that for you know how fishing is in within that okay could you make make sure that that's listed on the inclusion of questions that need to be answered um i wanted to go to a question in the given the speed with which the technology is advancing and the implications of impacts and so many things fishing industry recreation and commercial exclusion or preclusion of use habitat changes species impacts ocean impacts impacts to shipping ocean conditions uh marine mammals and birds what is the rationale for not keeping the lease areas as small as in order to learn as much as possible and then find answers to those potential impacts before going larger and then lori commented that that's a good before we go to the answer there i did want to note that we have a break scheduled um after this topic and then we need to move on to the ports topic but we have time at the end if we want to revisit citing and permitting as well as continuing to welcome feedback in written form through march 25th to flaxsen's question i think um i remember whitney talking about the sort of winnowing down and getting more data as we know more but i'll turn it over to whitney to expand on that yeah i think it's a a good a good question i mean vome is under um you know we have our regulations that that dictates our our process and i think we work with our with our partner then you know as a part of our um sort of data gathering and outreach effort for the years leading up to this you know the discussion of the approach in oregon to to define these large areas for further consideration um with was the approach that's that's being taken and in the um by doing that you know we're making this the the call becomes public and area identification we you know we receive public comment it's a transparent process and and um continue to work with our partners to to narrow in these areas if if we were to take an approach of looking at a very small area um you know we're we're predetermining where that sighting should occur without all of that input as a part of both process without that full public comment period you know and and i think that having a small area um it's determined that that area is not suitable you sort of start its uh square one again in bomb's process and that you would put out a new call um so you know i think there there are pros and cons to different approaches and and by start starting large and continue to work with the with the state and the task force and um you know tribal members and then our public comment period and all of our other um outreach and engagement efforts we're able to do this this winnowing yeah thanks whitney um yeah there's kind of a tension too with um economies of scale and trying to figure out you know the commercial viability of these so i know you noted that bums noted that in kind of their background information on the call area sizes so i don't know if that that needs more elaboration but hopefully that helps not only the size for economic developer economic viability i guess but um 100 clean targets you know affecting kind of the scale of resources needed not only in the ocean but on land too so large amounts of solar could be built and kind of the same challenges with sighting and permitting are happening on land is is what is kind of the beginnings of what what's starting to come out into the ocean space thanks for that addition jason and for those of you who didn't get a chance to tune in to our kickoff meeting jason provided a great summary of the sort of renewable energy um and climate change targets that have been established in and across the west that has sort of been driving a lot of this interest um i wanted to go to a hand raised from karen go ahead karen yeah can you hear me great so um i wanted to go back to the question about fisheries being excluded and just wanted to add to whitney's description which you know which i understand and thank you for that information but i wanted to add that some fisheries will be excluded by practice regardless of whether there is a regulatory prohibition and some of our west coast fisheries uh that might be might fall into that category would be things like ground fish trawl midwater trawl where you have large nets that are the tool the fishery uses to the catch those types of fisheries gear do not interact well with large structures in the water and would lead to significant loss of fishing gear which then could potentially cause secondary entanglement with protected species like whales and birds and so that essentially could be a group of fisheries that even if it's not prohibited from interacting you know from fishing and around the structures by practice would not be logistically feasible or smart for an individual to use that kind of so i think that's important to keep in i think that until we have um ideas about the types of fisheries that might successfully interact within the turbine areas i think from from my perspective as a fisheries manager i'm i'm anticipating that fisheries would largely be excluded writ large from these areas so that's that's just kind of how i'm approaching thinking about potential impacts and and interactions even though that may not be 100 percent and then i also wanted to to just add that i think that the large to small process the winnowing process is really important and the call areas that are out right now need a lot of work in order to narrow in on the right areas within them that would be minimizing impacts and would be good for the energy industry and so on and there's an additional concept that i heard that i think should be part of oregon's consideration in this study which is phasing in projects not just the winnowing down good areas but then once you start starting with a project that's that's at the appropriate economy of scale as jason but perhaps even the entire three gigawatts all at the same time um and allow a stepwise phased-in process so i really appreciate that that question and i i think that should be a consideration in the study thanks thanks karen um another question from laurie and then i think we're going to need to uh break for uh 10 minutes before moving on to the next topics but just a reminder that we have hopefully time at the end if you want to revisit any topics and we're welcoming written feedback um on this discussion today by march 25th so lori's question is will the state apply the same standards for esa impacts to offshore wind development as it does for terrestrial industries several esa species have significantly restricted industries like forestry and oregon can we expect to see the same approach used by the state to ensure esa impacts from offshore wind are minimized not sure if um andy or or karen from the state want to weigh in on that um yeah i'll go ahead and take a crack at that one um we will carefully consider any of the consultative advice and review that happens in association with the production of a of an eis from boem when they are looking at project elements and their interactions with natural resources specifically whitney mentioned consultations with noaa or consultations with the u.s fish and wildlife service and when the state is conducting its federal consistency review we will look carefully at those documents those would be part of the necessary data and information which should be required for the state to make a review decision whitney do you have anything",

        "text": " of the the idea that we put for forward to the governor's office and one thing I want to be really clear about is that's where we are in the phase on our legislative Concepts right now right now we've shared our ideas for legislative concepts with the governor's office and we don't yet have a red light a green light a yellow light on any of those we're just waiting to hear back um so it could be that they decide we're not going to move forward with this concept but for now since we are we did put it forward we wanted to be really transparent with you and really take a minute to get feedback from you all about the idea um right now every project under C must have a renewable energy component and at least 50% must have a resilience component and the possible legislative concept we put forward is that up to 20% of funds could support resilience only projects and this also dovetails with our um our recent County um energy resilience planning grants that we have and it also dovetails with Federal funding and I'll tell you a little bit more about each of those so right now just opened up a program where every county in the state can do a energy resilience plan and we'll provide a grant to help support crafting that plan this passed in legislation in 2023 and I believe it was House Bill 3630 and then when those plans are done they in some they in many cases will include ideas for projects to increase resilience and there's not a pot of money that's available for such work that's out there now um at the state level at least there are some related programs there's a resilience hubs program at at um uh at the uh Department of Human Services but it it does it's the amount of money is like not that great it'll probably be expended pretty quickly things like that so the idea that we had was to oh and then the other piece of it has to do with Federal funding and consumer own utilities there's a grid resilience program from the federal um federal government that actually has a a match of 33% for resilience projects for the utilities to meet so they can get access to a lot of federal funds that could help them complete projects to help with safety in their communities to help keep the lights on um in the first place but they can't access those funds without a 30% match and we have a lot of consumer and utilities where like raising that 30% match is a real barrier so it means they won't be able to take advantage of the federal program and so we thought we could potentially take a look at this idea of um offering up to 20% % of the funds to support those resilience only projects to serve both the needs of counties and communities served by those counties um for ideas for resilience projects after planning grants and to help with that match issue that some of our smaller cus are experiencing with the grid resilience Federal funding program so that's the basic pitch here why we were thinking about doing this um really um hopefully we've gone through that in enough detail that it makes sense but I really want to hear your questions and comments so that time is now I actually don't have to go anywhere I'm planning to be on the call so I'll be here for the public comment later but I just think while it's fresh before we dive into the rules and like let the two things get confused I thought it might be helpful to just talk about any questions or concerns and I know we've got I think four members of our advisory committee on the line Shannon's got her hand up and we just love to hear from you um so with that I'm happy to hear from Shannon and then open the door to anyone else thanks chrisy am I coming across okay perfectly it's nice to hear your voice okay cool um yeah thanks I'm I'm glad we popped in I guess my my my knee-jerk reaction is just thinking back to the Inception of this program which was as a very very very modest um cutout that was negotiated through HB 2021 so that we had some certainty about funding directed specifically to renewable energy projects within our boundaries um and that was coming out of a a long um an arduous and sometimes negotiation um just about uh how how any certainty would be brought to HB 2021 for projects to be built in state so given the that it you know BR broader framework and history and also so the knowledge that there are it is a very aggressive and competitive active grant program um I'm I'm feeling some concerns um about redirection any of redirecting any of those critical funds away from Renewables specific yep good to hear that Shannon I think that's in part why we're looking at taking a chunk of the money money and not having it compete alongside or you know make sure that we still protect the vast majority of the funding for those purposes of course but um we'd be open to hearing if there's like ideas about lowering maybe it's 10% or something like that um I me we're open to any ideas but um definitely hear that point I want to maintain that it's a renewable energy program and um and resilience and not move it or shift it from that but I I totally hear you and competition for the funds is a real thanks yeah thanks anyone else have any questions or concerns well I'm happy to move things forward but my door is open um to ideas for I guess I I maybe should have said this part out loud too kind of two things on this um that I didn't say all loud that were considerations for us bringing this idea forward in add to just sort of the um like the oh the ones that are like closest to the actual like here's issues we have with the program how up um one thing is we were planning we were thinking about bringing this as a new program and it seemed to us to be a lot more efficient to like nested into an existing program that's successful and has infrastructure and serves many of the same pop same groups already so I think that we'd be interested in like you know potentially more funding for the program to help with this or something like that to to kind of make it pencil um so that it doesn't feel like a loss to the Renewables Community but um we're just trying to think about like a separate program it's just I think a lot of us now in recent years have been through the process of setting up um new programs and it is just so so much work and sometimes it feels like almost inefficient like why don't we just have like one heat pump program why do we have two for example um so I think that's another reason we were thinking like this serves the same audience we are have things up and running could we fold this in so um so just know that that's on our radar too so like if they're um I think we don't there's like no way to say like let's not move the LC unless we know what the budget is because that doesn't really like work with the legislative timeline but that if we could that's how we would do it you know what I mean if that makes sense like if there's more money then we could put it here and only 20% of it you know so um anyway yeah oh Jenna is saying we have three heat pump programs that the department of energy um I think we have two but we'll have three soon um oh in Oregon we have way more than three in Oregon I'm eligible for eight in my house in southwest Portland so yeah it's like kind of wild it's it's frustrating really frankly all right um but with that I'm happy oh Audrey's got her hand up now hey Audrey how's it going hi I had a suggestion of um something else that I wanted to bring up but I don't know if this it's not related to this specifically but I didn't know um I didn't see on the agenda when the best time for me to go ahead and do that would be I'm fine with you doing it now does it relate to like something that would legislative I'm not sure okay let's hear it so I'm with PGE and the grant requires um letters from the utility to be submitted with the applications and we got kind of a avalanche very last minute letter requests that was very um administratively challenging and onerous and I was wondering if there was any way that we could put language suggestions I don't know if it has to be a requirement but just some advanced notice on the information people can give have to give utilities and how much advanced notice they need to provide to get that because we have to do um interconnection reviews which can require like desk engineering reviews and we just don't do that at the snap of a finger yeah Audrey the um within within our rules we ask the applicants that they can show consultation uh with the utilities about the project it doesn't uh necessarily have to be in this letter format we can even we're even accepting emails Communications that this is going on kind of pre kind of precursory communications uh I think a lot of applicants uh a lot of applicants have almost assumed as if they were supposed to get an official letter from uh from their utility which is where we wind up with that Avalanche that's come in because it is required to show that consultation uh I'm glad that you brought it up there's some other pieces about this that the program team we're going to be addressing uh once we get through this sort of crazy period before we move into subsequent rounds we're actually going to move into trying to look into that providing some clar ification uh on some of the items based on what was required in Statue because this was actually a statutory requirement this consultation that made it into the rules but there was never any specified guidance of how that had to come in and we've done a lot to go to go deeper into our other required items to create that guidance and based on this round and and subsequent rounds we definitely see the need to go and try to re uh try to respell this out a little bit better for applicants on what we're looking for vers what the utilities can even provide at this point in time in a project cycle as when it comes to the feas yeah and we're happy to do it and it's actually pretty useful on our side to receive information ahead of time but maybe um like a a form or something like that to just kind of guide what is me what information is wanted from you guys because um they're not doing",

        "text": " an uh even a compactor there so all the garbage that they collect from the parks can be compacted right there and then so it reduces the amount that gets sent to the landfill too so there are some always Partnerships that city is always looking at so even though it's called Public Works waste processing facility I said right in the beginning it's a city waste waste processing facility so U there are some old panels from our old YMCA sitting over there that's the MOs right they were there supposed to be there for a year or so there five years and counting they're still there but we don't care we we taking good care of it lots of abandoned cars cards that's become a problem unfortunately we're dealing with that where do they come from um from the grocery parking lot they end up in streams right off ways uh you know homeless camps uh everywhere you can think about we find them everywhere and then staff has routinely been pulling them out of streams picking them from the right right of ways or homeless camps and bringing them for they're dirty they're horrible they are they have to then be kept in a way where basically you have to segregate them by different types you have to put them assign them by months so that when they were picked because you have to maintain them for a per period of time under our ordinance and then we have we have with the Grocers uh company which comes and then selectively pick fix what they like and then we left with what we are left and that goes into the recycle metal recycling so there's a big long huge process uh that we are involved in right now so anyway there's we also uh from all the road work and all the other things that we do we end up getting concrete broken up concrete asphal dirt it has to go somewhere used to go in the uh shops complex over year we didn't want to make the shops complex any more more Messy as we started doing the new shop complex so we wanted to make sure that we had a proper designated areas and that's what we build the bins for now as you can see we still uh need to do even better job of managing even the bins it's it's an working site is always M so U native plant nursery as you can imagine we do a lots of Rian planting and any kind of strong water um you know along the banks or any kind of uh areas that we are trying to fix up and we quickly realized that we pay a lot to the nursery folks so why not make our own you know something which lasts we know where the those trees came those plants came from and if you can propagate and use those then we are saving the city money we have a land we we have people knowledgeable who who can do this so we started doing our own Nursery so we have our own plant nursery for all the St wateran planed do you have space to do maybe some trees too uh well Parks does bring a lot of things but I think that sight of that you know you would need a lot bigger sight than that I to to yeah if you had to go get trees started because I know we've had some challenges with getting more climate adapted trees in this area yeah no I think okay you'll see Park lots of things probably two or three or four dozen trees waiting to be planted so it's kind of a staging area for them okay okay since I have you as captive audience I mention so shopping carts abandon most of those shopping carts are identified as to who they originally belonged to right so do we go back to any of those retail retailers to we trying different process at the time yeah the the challenge is it might say Safeway but it doesn't say which Safeway and so you can call up all six Safeways and they'll say well not my part um and so there aren't those corporate stores but their managers buy their own their own cards so we TR yeah I mean so we have two entities who collect carts that are in the best condition and take them back to the stores but that's only taking care of maybe half the load and uh so the other half of the carts stay around for about 30 days that's all to keep them and then we take them to Cherry City medals and we get Pennies on the dollar for what the stores paid for them 500 bucks the average card is about $300 to $400 and we I think we're averaging I think we're destroying about $30,000 wor the carts every couple months it's wasteful it's stupid um but that's the challenge we have so stores if you call them if let's say you identify a cart and you call the store that's closest by they said oh that's okay we don't need it they don't want to come and get it the amount of Labor it takes to clean a cart to sanitize it after we've been storing it for 30 days depending on where we pulled it out of um it's just not worth their money they can buy a brand new one for $300 and to pay a clerk to sanitize it and clean it and repair it and all that so it some of it's economics and some of it's just you know the challenge that we face with a lot of it is driven by homelessness and that's part of the problem so but we are using valuable real estate and we are using our public funds to go and pick them up and then again worry about disposing and keeping and tracking so something is coming to you shortly we're trying to work on something different so can't wait all right so let's go you know so all this time I was telling you we were losing money you know all this time the side that we were talking about we were picking stuff for the public and then we were sending it to the landfill and paying the landfill now it's our turn to make money so here's the side of the of the operation which basically brings in Revenue so now we are looking at the other side of the facility which is where accessible only by permit so we are going to talk about this as you can see it's a single Loop one way in one way out facility uh the whole facility is uh storm water Net Zero so that's what you're seeing in between there rain Gardens Planters there are bioses everywhere around the facility there is no stor water that leaves this this site everything is uh you know uh treated and then infiltrated into the ground from the side so it's a very well designed from that point of view to make sure that nothing goes out is that Airport Way or is that another yes dri and that's not one that people have to have a key to get in the gate or is that an entry that they don't require it's not they they punch in a okay so that's now we're going to talk about the ones uh you know basically who comes in the side uh of the facility you need need to have a perit you need to be able to uh be pre-authorized uh they are all registered with us they're tankers are registered with the EQ everything is checked so when they're bringing waste they're bringing with their manifest where they picked up the waste from you know everything they can come in both the sides of the building they can go in either of the side of the building and then they can uh start disposing of their waste they start by punching in their number they have a card they have an actual individual ID they can enter that into a system uh it's called pic by and they basically put all the information in City provides the horses different horses because of the style or the size depending on each one of them we didn't want have have them worry about oh we I didn't have the right coupling or oh it was broken and so there was a big splash out there so we provide the hoses they connect the host as you can see in the second photo over uh once the host is connected and it's powered up and it's pressurized now they are asked to keep it within certain pressure and they can push their waist uh into the system It Is by pressure that they are required to push it's not a gravity system and then if there is any reason that we want to collect a sample we can collect a sample uh which is right there uh the box that you see next to the tube it collects a sample uh of the waste that's going through now what's going on the other side of the wall basically let's look under the hood we are we have uh a big machine on the other side it's called Uh Huber Ras it's a German made trumel system it's got a big drum inside kind of like your dryer drum and basically all it does is as the water comes through it allows the solids to uh go through uh to the point where basically they start getting uh you know compacted and they come out through that funnel that you see at the left barott and it's like a piece of logs coming out uh into that uh into the Container while the liquid goes through uh but we don't allow anything unless it's checked so that's what uh is on your right photo the pH uh is checked right away so that to make sure uh by the way Ryan I'm running over time you're good okay yeah yeah you're good all right because I think very interesting the reason for checking the pH is that's a very easy measure to make sure that now if there's anything that is going to impact our system that's the first thing and if there is anything wrong with the pH the city Only accepts between 6 and a half to 10 as a pH the purpose is so that it does not impact any of our infrastructure or create any noxious gases any kind of issues pH is a perfect classic Bally of first knowing if there's a problem so if the pH is off what happens is the system shuts down and the system shuts down and you have a pressurized hose which is stuck to our system you cannot leave you cannot do anything you cannot walk away you only can basically call for help that's available right there in the earlier picture there's a remote button that you can basically press you can call um uh right over over here is an intercom you get to call dispatch public dispatch would call environmental services and someone will show up and you are now got given the fact that you just were trying to offload a Hot Load so so what would be in that hot load that would trigger that",

the general standard overview the department recommends a condition there that is very typical for other energy facilities allotting three years for the applicant to begin construction and then three years after construction begins to finish construction however this is the assumption that's applied to the public services standard uh the facility may be built out in phases so maybe by facility component or by area or a section um and then under public services like in a lot of i think public services more so than well same as other standards as we look at some at the maximum in impacts what are the maximum amount of people that are going to be on site working and the applicant represents that the maximum amount of people could be 500 people on site at one time um or in one one period usually during peak construction which is during the summer um they also estimate that about 30 percent of those uh of the workers would be hired locally and so then with that maximum number that would be approximately 150 workers would be uh hired locally and then during operation they estimate about 10 to 15 operational personnel would be working on the site so this is a list of the uh public and private service providers that is are evaluated underneath the standard this is a list of ones that i'm not going to talk about today the ones i'm focusing on the presentation is i'm going to talk public and private providers of traffic which includes automobiles and air traffic and i'm going to talk about fire service providers which are like fire districts so i'm not gonna talk about these but if you have any questions we can talk about them there is overlap in between i'm gonna go over water rights section and there's overlap with the water service providers same thing with the waste minimization section that i'll do um there's overlap with the solid waste management so um not totally skipping everything so the applicant estimates estimates that of those maximum workers um that there uh could be um well that of with the workers and delivery trucks and other equipment that would be uh that would visit the site that approximately just over 2 000 one-way trips would occur during this peak construction um part of the evaluation of traffic safety uh the applicant and the department evaluated the umatilla county transportation system plan or tsp um and then we also worked with the county and we did verify that it was last updated it updated in 2002 so it's it's a little out of date but what the tsp does provide is it talks about road designations of like bigger highways going down into arterial highways county roads um and it provides it talks about the conditions of those roads anticipated construction projects for those roads and also it gives you estimates of like the traffic counts on those roads um and so that was uh part of that and i'll touch later because we're you know that information is useful and it's from the county however the applicant and the department also referenced used and updated the data and the evaluation for traffic uh predominantly based on oregon department of transportation or odot um so it was kind of uh the traffic analysis is kind of a combination of this figure here um i think most of us are familiar with this area the applicant you know predominantly for the major highways is going to use i-84 um but and so those are those are larger roads generally in good repairable condition um managed by odot receives federal funding etc um a lot of the evaluation in the draft proposed order focuses on these it says cr and it has a number that's a county road and so these are the county roads and this is from the application that the applicant is representing that these are going to be the prelim are the primary hall routes um used inside you know for delivery to the facility particularly this 1350. so this route going from uh 395 over here to the site boundary um is going to be one of the primary hall so in the application the applicant talks about um makes representations of measures that it will do to you know avoid reduce um or mitigate potential impacts to public and private providers of traffic services which we look at which is like the county's road use department um we could also look at like odot people that manage roads um there's a little bit of overlap with some you know police police services um and the potential for police vehicles to need help navigating certain traffic but the department compiled um all of these the discussions um into a traffic management plan that's attached to the track proposed order so it's a department compiled document of applicant representations um and those an aspect of the traffic management plan is the applicant's representation that it will execute a road use agreement with the county um and road use agreements are very typical for fsa projects um and really the road use agreement mechanism is functionally what kind of reconciles the outdated transportation system plan because part of the rhodius agreement is that the applicant in the county are going to do a pre-construction inventory where the roads the primary hall routes they're going to be used are identified the condition is identified if any of the roads need to be improved to facilitate the construction of the with the construction vehicles they would need to be improved prior to construction and then the roads are monitored during construction and then after it's done there's a reconciliation and the roads would be any damage would be um repaired to the existing or better condition and those are just some of the components of the road use agreement which is a component of the traffic management plan um i'm going to move on to air traffic um all sorts of public services we look at air traffic service providers um who is that predominantly we look at airports and people that use navigable airspace so when we're talking about air traffic um this is a wind facility and so a lot of what we're looking at are the tall things so um the wind turbines are at 496 feet we have some met towers at 266 feet and there's also various proposed transmission lines and alternative routes um that vary from about 100 to 140 feet this is a table from the draft proposed order um that identifies the airports in the analysis area and the distance um from the proposed facility as we all kind of have been visualizing this facility all day it is you know has an odd shape and it's very big and the airports are kind of peppered around so actually chris clark um helped generate this table and just as a note if we were looking at a map the uh the direction provided is the direction from the site boundary uh to the airport location so of note here this west butter creek is obviously the closest airport it is a private airport it's like a um like a runway runway strip but it is not a public uh part of the application review and one of our reviewing agencies is the oregon department of aviation who we also call oda um which the oregon department of agriculture is also oda but oh in this context oda is aviation um and uh and there's also um a an aspect that an applicant when we have these tall facility components is required to engage with the faa the federal aviation but uh council's reviewing agency is oda um but we did a pretty significant preliminary review of giving um and again chris clark helped help with that review as well but engaging with oda to do a preliminary assessment of potential impacts to navigable airspace um so that you know preliminary assessment um was done um so i have a couple conditions here but the interesting thing is really kind of the faa guidelines are what dominates here and they have two criteria of when this uh this form the 7461 the notice of proposed construction or alteration this evaluation of when that's triggered and it's either triggered by the proximity of a facility or facility component to a military or public airport um and that in this context for this facility is 3.8 miles so that's one one trigger of this review the other one is if you have any facility components that are taller than 200 feet so as we saw in this slide there is an airport at 3.4 miles but it's a private airport it's not a public or a military so the first the first criteria is not triggered this 7460 review is is triggered um because we have tall facility components so um the conditions in the dpo are that um essentially the applicant is going to um resubmit and submit this form to the faa oda and the results of it which would likely be a no hazard determination because also the tallest facility component is still lower than 500 feet um and yeah those results would be submitted to to the department um under public services we look at fire protection service providers which predominantly we look at fire departments so there are several fire departments within the bigger analysis area but the two fire departments that would actually serve the facility site boundary is the echo rural fire protection district and the umatilla county fire district number one um the applicant provided correspondence from both of those fire districts in its um and and the fire districts do indicate that this facility is located in a high risk zone for wildland fires similar to the traffic management plan the applicant provided and represented a breadth of measures of best management practice practices um to uh to implement during construction to avoid or minimize risk of fires associated with construction activities um and then so the department took those representations and compiled it into what we call a fire prevention suppression and emergency management plan which is attached to the dpo so part of that plan has a construction component and then there's uh also the operational component because as we are aware this is a big complex facility there are facility components generally that have an electrical component so we have transformers transmission lines um the battery storage components um the the wind turbines all of these have some electrical component and there are fire risks associated with them so in this plan we basically break out and talk about the potential fire risk from certain facility components and then measures the applicant would do to reduce those risks um the applicant also uh provides um oh it's like a table of contents from an fire management plan uh and that includes those and so that basically a finalization of this final plan would include all of the details from the application and then a more a bigger build out of that table of contents that they provided which has a hazard",

        "text": " generating the electricity there would this would initiate a study and this study process would determine all of the different parameters or costs that would go into an interconnection agreement or their transmission rates here is a flow chart and i will mention that this is for large generating facilities partly the the facilities that you'll be seeing in the fsec process are these large generating facilities that will be connecting to the transmission uh versus smaller ones that could connect directly into the distribution system which doesn't necessarily fall under for jurisdiction and the point in showing this flowchart is more about there are a couple different places where projects can kind of fall off of of this interconnection process first it um these are all sorry let me just go back to my notes here for a second so interconnection requests are governed by what work we call oats or open access transmission tariffs which in this case doesn't mean but it means in how a utility interacts with and charges its rates to the customers so it's determining the relationship that it will have here between the utility the or the provider of the transmission and the customer in this case the generating facility so traditionally these transmission this process has been what they call a serial queue process which means first come first serve which has meant that there's been a backlog the queue just gets um it gets backed up and what we're seeing right now is is very true to that and that is partly because they will study each request on an individual basis to figure out what is needed to accommodate that particular facility to on the grid so this is a very time consuming process and as you move through this flowchart there are different levels of studies that are happening and at each step or stage there's the potential for these for everything to fall off as i said so if you see uh this right i'm not sure if you can see my mouse but the withdraw interconnection request that is like the first chance for a project to be removed from the queue but as it moves through these different study processes and reviews there are other opportunities for it to not progress in the queue and as it gets further in the queue the thing to note is that there are for withdrawing from the queue because they've had all these different studies they've put time into it and for the and so it could be excuse me that these projects decide at some point there's just too much uncertainty to continue in the interconnection queue meaning that their cost of remaining in as they go forward so there's actually a move right now to do what they're calling a cluster analysis so instead of reviewing uh projects on a case-by-case basis they're taking them in from geographical areas and studying them all at once to see what can be accommodated so we're hoping that this will alleviate some of the congestion in the queue right now we've heard that this process can take anywhere from one to three to complete to end up at a at a connection interconnection agreement it's slightly complicated but hopefully i captured some of the elements that can make it uh impact the timing of a project then can ask a question so where would this happen uh in the context of an application for site certificate would would this be initiated before during or only after because of the uncertainty aspect of it and that it has cost implications this would most likely happen after thank you but i don't want to say that absolute because there can be nuances are there any other questions or i will hand it over to max to start talking about um the off-take piece which is very much interconnected with this interconnection process all right thanks max i'll hand it to you yeah and that's um just what i was going to say and they can sometimes depending on a an applicant's risk tolerance um they can run in parallel and we're going to see a little bit about kind of how that might work and how the interconnection process can have interplay also with this next step of securing off take um this is a topic that's also i would say changed some um in recent years it used to be that there were relatively um you know limited paths for off-take uh of renewable projects but as renewables have become least cost least risk resources um we're seeing most procurement happen via competitive formal competitive bidding processes or rfps um the the council has seen some projects go through that um you know ended up having ppas um essentially with specific off-takers as part of a voluntary renewable program like green tariff um diane mentioned earlier but there's a move now in the most recent utility rfps to identify even those those green terra for voluntary resources via this formal rfp process so that's really what we're going to focus on here today so this formal rfp process is governed by oregon public utility commission or in the case of other states the utc has its own set of competitive procurement rules up in washington and the idaho public utility commission requires idaho power to conform to the oregon rules that's potentially in flux there's an ongoing docket at the idaho commission don't need to get into that but in any event um we do have this this pretty uh regimented approach to to competitive procurement the process can be lengthy estimate normal launch of a proposed rfp to actually accepting bids it can often be about a year and then there's additional analysis to determine um you know which bids utility selects and then after that we get into contracting which i think diane's going to talk about a little bit later also so it can be quite a lengthy process and i think what we really want to highlight and what i'm going to talk about in a couple of examples is that often just to to participate in these rfps to have a chance of being selected you have to have not just site control but also a permit so a site certificate or you know it's the equivalent at the county as well as achieving certain transmission and interconnection so in particular on that interconnection point you often need to have proceeded through that flow chart enough not necessarily to have a fully executed interconnection agreement at the time you're selected but at least have a study that says this project can interconnect and come online in time to meet the timeline of our rfp so if we have identified a need in say there needs to be a study coming out of the interconnection process that says yes this project can be online by 2024. um so that's kind of how some of these things can end up running in parallel and then there's there's even kind of a further risk for projects participating in these rfps in that you know you can have a project that's on it on its face it's just sitting by itself you know looks like the cheapest project round on on a pure like dollars per megawatt hour basis um but utilities make their selections based on portfolio modeling where they look at how all of the different resources that they have on their systems and all of the different resources that have been in will interact with one another and they choose the cheapest portfolio not the cheapest resource so it's really challenging you know when a project bids into an rfp it can look great on paper it just might not end up being the thing that fits best with uh with what the utility determines it um it you know will meet its needs best on a portfolio and really what all of this is designed to do why there is this competitive and lengthy process and why the utilities go through you know create these um sort of restrictions on uh what bids need to meet and then go through this portfolio level modeling process it's all about minimizing costs and risks to their that's another thing that is essentially outside of the control of project developers but that is kind of a central consideration in everything that happens in the regulatory process and and these formal rfps so on the next slide we'll start talking about a couple of examples um let's start with pacific corps 2021 all source rfp um which saw it was a huge rfp it sought a total of about 1800 megawatts of solar co-located with battery resources and 1900 megawatts of wind that's based on their preferred portfolio that came out of their integrated resource plan process and the preferred portfolio included uh 500 megawatts of solar co-located with battery resources in oregon so and they did this kind of abstract modeling exercise using proxy resources so not actual definitive projects and they said you know it looks like on a portfolio-wide basis across our six state territory our customers would be best served by going out and trying to get 500 megawatts of oregon solar in order to participate in the rfp there was not a firm requirement that bids already have a site certificate in place but the way they structured the rfp there was a strong incentive to have to be far along in the permit process and ideally to have permits complete including potentially a site certificate so those percentage figures that you see there on the right are the percent of the total bid score so you know you get six percent of your total bid score is having your permits in place um it would be potentially challenging then you know you would be disadvantaging your project to not have a site certificate already in place by the time you're bidding into an rfp so we kind of laid out that that there are risks you can have a project that looks you know cheap on its own but it's going to be measured on a portfolio basis and it has to already have that site certificate in place even to play and compete meaningfully in the rfp next slide in the end in this particular rfp the company received approximately 98 oregon bids that doesn't necessarily mean 98 completely separate oregon you know different bids can look like different configurations of essentially the same project and even that 98 number is sort of extrapolated from a report that was produced by what's called an independent evaluator in the regulatory process so it is fairly approximate but it gives a good idea of how many played and many were forced out even just by the interconnection process and this is also a conclusion of the independent evaluators report so the reason for that is diane referenced a move to cluster studies you know the company's irp had sent this strong signal that they wanted a bunch of oregon solar so a bunch of oregon solar projects all put in interconnection requests to be studied together in the cluster study that was ongoing in summer 202",

i believe uh that the other site boundaries are clipped so they don't appear in the middle but there may be some there is some overlap any other questions about this map and i will point out the um we did we received this notice of intent on may 10th it is available from our website if the in if the council member does have questions on it um i think there will be further opportunities to review this um and certainly it's out for public comment now oh and we do have a public information meeting scheduled on this for uh later in july in boardman um i can get that exact date well i will continue with my presentation i believe it's july 27 but i don't want him to speak for the record todd cornett and and you know if any council member would like to attend that either in person or virtually uh please let us know um we'll get you all the information um as well so and obviously you are not required but would be welcome if you wanted to attend but are those also recorded so that we could thank you yes uh council member buyer um yes so uh we they didn't used to be but now they are um and so um what we will do is whether it's all virtual or if it's a those will be webinars that for all future public information meetings we will record those and post them on the project site so that will be our practice moving forward has been for the last couple but definitely will be moving forward in case somebody's interested but doesn't have the opportunity to attend they can go back and watch those recordings so christopher i assume boardman is due north you see the interstate 84 i see the proposed b2h line assume or go straight north of the dash the purple dash blue purple and white line is that the city city of boardman i believe it's a little bit north and to the east it comes with yes this this other map may provide a little bit better view but yeah it's just a little to the west with um lexington and hebner to the south okay for um this particular step uh rs 469 480 subsection one requires the council to designate the governing body of any local government whose jurisdiction the facility is proposed to be located as a special advisory group the proposed facility is located entirely or is supposed to be located entirely within morrow county the morrow county board of commissioners is the governing body of morrow county um and as such we recommend that the council appoint the morrow county board of commissioners as a special advisory group for proceedings related to the echosolar project and with that i will leave it to your madam chair i move that the council appoint the morrow county board of commissioners as a special advisory group for council proceedings related to the proposed eco-solar project thank you kent septon cindy condon thank you cindy any further questions comments we have a motion in a second hearing then mr secretary please call the roll hanley jenkins yes barry choctoot ken howe yes and buyer marcy grail yes jordan truitt cindy condon yes motion carries madam thank you very much thank you chris it's my bruce time is now 10 56 so little assistance please so madam chair the next agenda item which is we have time certain on the agenda as well as um clarified no availability for uh hearing officer so we will need to go into recess until 12 30. as you just heard we will now be recessing until 12 30. and i would like to call the meeting back from recess and continue on with the next agenda item okay thank you um the next agenda item is the nolan hills wind power project this is a continuation of public hearing on draft proposed order on application for site this hearing will be presided over by kate triana senior administrative law judge at the oregon office of administrative hearings she will facilitate the continuation of the draft proposed order public hearing for the applicant to respond to issues raised on the record of the dpo from april 19th through may 26 2022 lj triana if you may please take over okay great great thank you hi i'm alj katriana and as mentioned this is the continuation of the nolan hills wind power project public hearing on the draft proposed order or dpo on the application for site certificate uh this hearing was continued uh from the prior hearing may 26 2022 through today june 24 2022 specifically to allow the applicant an opportunity to review and respond to issues raised in comments received at that prior hearing this hearing at this point is limited for the applicant responses information specifically related to issues raised on the record of that hearing i have received uh two requests to submit additional i'm going to address that a little bit but i do have that on the agenda as well so as mentioned i'm an administrative law judge for the oregon office of administrative hearings i've been appointed as the efsc appointed hearing in this matter as well and i'm serving as the presiding officer for the hearing today is friday june 24th 2022 it's about 12 32 p.m uh pacific time the hearing today is being held at the energy facility citing council or efsc being held in person at the oregon department of energy offices in salem the hearing is also being held via a webex webinar with a call-in option for those who cannot participate in person or via webinar so we have some people present in person at the department of energy offices we have several people participating by webex including myself and then we also have some call-in uh and this is being recorded so let's see kathleen sloan senior sighting analyst at the oregon department of energy and lead on the application for site certificate for the nolan hills wind power project is going to provide a very brief project and procedural overview um and then i'll take back over and we'll we'll get so ms sloane if you'd like to get started okay thank you alj triana and for the record my name is kathleen sloan i'm a senior sighting analyst for the oregon department of energy and we are opening agenda item k which is the continuation of the public hearing on the nolan hills wind power project and the draft proposed so just very briefly i'm going to give you a overview of the agenda item so a brief facility overview a brief procedural overview and then i will turn it back over to the alj to continue the hearing so the nolan hills wind power project is located in northwestern umatilla county nolan hills wind llc is a subsidiary of capital power corporation the proposed facility is a combined wind and solar energy facility with a maximum generating capacity of 600 megawatts and approximately a 48 000 acre site the project also includes related and supporting facilities including a dispersed or centralized battery storage system or a bus and two proposed options for a 230 kv gentile line transmission line the procedural history the notice of intent was filed in september of 2017 a draft proposed order was issued by the department on april 19 2022 the public hearing was opened in on may 26 2022 and as the alj noted at the request of the applicant the record was held open for the applicant to respond to comments that hearing was held open until today june 24 2022 and that is what we are doing in this agenda item so in the continuation of the hearing council rules require that the council department and applicant have an adequate opportunity to respond to issues that are raised and comments that are received on the record of the draft proposed order during the public hearing the scheduled hearing on may 26 was extended at the request of the applicant to respond to the issues and comments that were at the hearing so the hearing again was extended until um 30 days to give the applicant time to and at this point i'm going to turn it over to the alj who will provide the applicant the opportunity to speak or provide more so amj triana i am turning it back over to you thank you okay great um all right so uh this is alj triana as uh ms sloane noted the hearing record was held open for the specific purpose of allowing the applicant to respond to some of the comments raised at the public hearing from both council and members of the public between the time of that may sorry what's the date on that the prior hearing in may may 26th and today the department of energy received two emails requesting these people be allowed to provide public comment or written comments and that those be made part of the record as well and so i want to address those on the record now and make a ruling on that so the department when they received the emails forwarded them to me and has requested that i make a decision so i'll be doing that it appears that uh the two emails i received um the department received and forwarded to me were sent on uh june 22nd and june 23rd but both for uh blue mountain alliance so i'm gonna kind of address them together um is there anyone with blue mountain specifically daniel kearns with us today if so speak up or raise a hand please okay i'm not noting anyone um ms sloane there in salem do you have anyone present yes we do sorry so i'm gonna i'm gonna let him introduce he has his mic on richard jolly with blue mountain okay great and mr jolly um what is your affiliation with blue mountain alliance and daniel kearns can you explain that just a little bit to me yes i'm a member of the board and the board selected daniel kearns as our uh to contact um you in your office and i hadn't heard back from him and so i uh contacted the office also okay and are you expecting that mr kearns is going to appear at all today at this public no i don't believe so but i believe he responded and has sent in our statement okay and so i did receive this email from him um that included an attached letter and mr jolly have you had an",

people want to speak uh yeah there's no particular uh requirements as far as time um go and so yeah it's probably just dependent on the number of speakers we have okay thank you all right so the time is now 2 15 p.m and we would like to offer an opportunity for a limited party those with limited party status and the applicants to respond to the material that we've made so we're going to open up a hearing at this time i'm going to defer to nancy and wally or whomever is running things to see if there are any participants willing to take advantage of this time right now hello chair grill um this is wally adams hey wally hi we've tried to make all of the parties analysts have control over their video and button i think there might be one left and then back in i ours know if we won't i'm not catching all everything you're saying and so probably a little far from the mic i was suggesting maybe we just um go through them one by one to see if they comments that they would like to make so in alphabetical order i think the first one is derek green okay so i'm just going to sit back and ask you to control that part of this competition so can i jump in i think you know uh mr green represents the applicant i think it's probably more appropriate to let the applicant go last in case there are other comments that other limited parties make and and they have an opportunity to respond to those as well so um i think you know if there's anybody who um the either attorney's representing the limited parties or the limited parties themselves um please identify yourself either if you're in a attendee um by unmuting yourself and and showing your screen or if you are simply on the attendees raise your hand or some other way identify that you would like to provide a comment good call thanks for the help todd keeping an eye on the attendee list i'm not seeing any hands not seeing anything among the panelists jesse i'll defer to you in terms of when you feel it's appropriate to move on to the department but i'm not seeing from the limited parties the only attorney for uh that i'm seeing on the list that was julian mars he is from the uh office of the attorneys that represented the limited parties so you may want to specifically ask if julian mars has any thanks patrick wally adams again mr mars um you should have control over your mic if you would like to make a comment you should be able to unmute yourself jesse looks like you're talking but you're on mute got to happen yeah so since it looks like we don't have any uh comments from the limited parties i don't know if the department would like to comment at this time or the department doesn't have any comments all the material changes that have been discussed the department uh is on board with him thank you patrick and moving on to the applicant hi good afternoon my name is elaine albridge i'm permitting council for obsidian renewables and obsidian solar with me today is derek green my co-counsel along with representatives from the applicant michelle slater and lori hutchinson on the line we'll keep this brief thank you very much for your time today and your diligence in reviewing this project we are very excited to be before you today it's been a long a long haul um through covet and all um so today is a really um we're very happy to be here um we are satisfied with the final order as proposed before you um we do not have concerns about the proposed revisions to the fire management plan or that language we think that actually helps clarify for the record um how we're going to navigate those conversations through pre-construction compliance so so thank you for that and with that unless there's any questions we'll just go ahead and close the day and say thank you very much for your consideration and approval of this thank you for your comments and it's good to see you as well does anyone from council have any comments questions well hearing none then jesse i'm kicking back to you for where we are next okay thank you chair grail and i believe where we are next is um coming to emotion um so um we there's motion language uh i think that um it should be before you um that is drafted as a sample we um have a couple loose ends to tie up here there is the draft final order that's been presented to you but we'll also need to incorporate the scrivener's error corrections and the new language concerning the fire districts i think the motion in general should be um uh you know if based on what i've heard and the lack of objection to um uh proposed contested case order dispositions of the issues um and uh acceptance of uh kalantardi weather's presentation on the proposed order if there is a motion to approve the site certificate i would recommend that it goes beyond that to then adopt the draft final order scrivener's error corrections um that were discussed today and with the changes to the fire district language and i'm sorry i don't i can't remember exactly where that would go in the draft final order um so there may be a more precise way of saying that but that's what i would suggest for motion all right thank you did anyone catch all i made some notes but i can't make the emotions so i made some notes and i'll make a stab at it all right ready to go vice chair i'll be welcome to uh receive anyone's amendments that if i miss something are needed so madam chair i move that the council approved the proposed order and the proposed contested case with the scrivener's error corrections and the new language concerning fire protection as the final order as recommended and issue a site certificate approving the obsidian solar center request and adopt the final order with the scrivener error changes and the language concerning the fire protection do we need this is handling do we need the language for the fire district and where it goes jesse patrick um sarah if you pull up the version of the language that we have i'll agree don here um so um kent how about us about um amending your motion to include as on the screen and i'll second that okay yeah i can amend that let me ask this would it be uh in order to also specify the page number and the line number that the change starts at or any getting that specific or is it as shown on the page adequate i think as shown on the page is adequate in part because as we start to clear let red line et cetera the uh um the page number and line numbers will change yeah yeah okay good so i'll am in my motion to the language concerning the fire protection district is um as shown on the page that we're looking at on screen now i'll second that we have a motion we have a second uh unless jesse or todd have anything to say about that then i'll ask are there any additional comments or questions on the motion i would just say that i i captured the thank you other questions comments hearing none mr secretary sorry sorry uh this is cindy i'm wondering if since we're not mentioning the page number if we should mention the section that it this is included in because the page that we're looking at isn't going to be familiar to trackable to anyone its section ibm public services the evaluation of fire protection service so can you say that again sarah section public services under the evaluation of fire service protectors fire service providers just preceding the public services condition number four so i included the location parenthetically in the motion if that thank you thank you okay so we have a motion we have a we know where it is any additional comments questions well i guess this is hanley my only comment is i hope the applicants hear us when we say that we think the exceptions process needs more work on these applications i understand this application was before we've kind of encouraged applicants to do that i think it's important that they understand that we believe that if you're going to take an exception to goal 3 it needs needs to be information provided for reasons why thank you for that reminder yeah and this is kent uh i agree they need exceptions to the goals need to be robust in their preparation that to establish the findings that we need in order to give approval so my presumption is that staff when they are working with the applicants will help relay that message uh very clearly as this happens in the so we have a motion we have a second any additional questions or comments on the for the question i'm sorry call for the question okay just checking mr secretary please call the roll ken howe hanley jenkins yes jordan truitt yes cindy condon marcy grill yes motion carries madam chair thank you i would just like to say thank you to everyone that was involved that was a lot of dialogue and i hope that that developers and the public hear the work that not only staff puts into these issues but counsel and to making sure we're upholding our obligations so thank you to everyone next on the agenda as public comment this time is reserved for the public to address the council regarding any item within council jurisdiction that is not otherwise closed for comment which includes the boardman the hemingway transmission line proposed order and the obsidian solar center proposed order i'm going to look to nancy and wally to uh work through and see if anyone in the public wishes to make any comments at this time uh madam chair if i may yes sir there was uh in the either the chat or the q a early on the meeting a kind of a question that was raised that i thought might be helpful to answer um as well um so the question was",

        "text": " infrastructure so we don't do that many uh you know maybe in the future as we look down the road and start planning some of these other things but that's how I would categorize it so we will get some of that with the new uh with the new Chief but um but I think there will always be a need to have a partnership uh with uh with at least Mount McDonnell for the next seven years should this be approved and but uh vendors uh of the like great thank you very much other questions okay see no questions who would like to make a motion director Duncan I move the board authorized the general manager to execute a contract with Mott McDonald LLC for project management services for a four-year base term and three one-year contract extensions for an amount not to exceed one million six hundred and eighty seven thousand second we have a motion in a second any seeing no discussion all those in favor please say aye aye aye any opposed I no opposition motion passage unanimously thank you very much next we'll uh hear about the battery electric buses sure and I'll ask our maintenance manager Greg Thompson to please come in an attempt to save paper I'm going to try to marry some technology in my high good luck thank you see how it goes uh good evening president Davidson members of the board tonight I'm asking that the board approves the general manager general manager to execute a contract Amendment with Gilly for the purchase of five 40-foot electric battery electric buses to replace five 35 foot diesel buses for an amount not to exceed 5 million 386 750 dollars at the so the reason why some of these look familiar is because they are we this is so this approval tonight is kind of a consolidation of some past approvals and some new approvals which is going to be one overarching contract with gillig for the the first five buses so there so as we go through this it'll we have things itemized on the bus costs we're coming with those buses and we'll also show kind of where some of the teachers are so at the April 21st 2021 board meeting approval was awarded awarded for the general manager to enter into a contract with gillig for the purchase of the five buses for amount not to exceed three million 597 775 dollars at the November 18 2021 board meeting approval was given for the purchase of the onboard charging equipment that we added after the fact of the the board approving the bus purchase for an amount not to exceed 395 750 dollars at the time when we were going through those bus purchases our intent was and in our Grant application we were going to lease the batteries that was an option that was available to us and we were going to use the battery cost as the match in the overall Grant since that time there's been some some changes in from the governmental Accounting Standards the Accounting Standards Board a gasb number 87 and it made this leasing batteries less attractive as opposed to purchasing them outright and also since that time the district has received local state Source funds that can be used to purchase the battery so we can offset some of those with the outright purchase essentially we're not going to be carrying that that least debt for a period of 12 Years so that was the the last remaining approval was the the battery issue we were tending to come to the board for the lease now we're including that in the purchase of the buses because I don't even remember the first one we said we kind of joke because we said oh the batteries aren't included on the first five I don't know if you remember that now they're included so the so in table one in your packet we've kind of broken out with the the cost of the bus itself is each bus is one million seventy seven thousand three hundred and fifty dollars five buses brings that bus total to 5 million included in that is the bus itself the onboard Chargers that was earlier approved and that's the inductive pickup charging equipment is on the bus we've added uh is in manager kids presentation he saw an image of the electric bus with the graphics and the wrap so that was an additional additional cost for fourteen thousand six hundred and eighty two dollars a bus the batteries themselves are a hundred and ninety four thousand dollars per bus we've added a battery warranty that will warranty those batteries for a period of six years so that kind of helps mitigate any risk if there's a battery issue or cell issue that we work with Cummins for for that warranty and then we've added two thousand dollars per bus for a total of ten thousand dollars for maintenance training they will purchase some blocks of training from gillig to go over some OEM specific electric bus training that brings the the grand total for that bus for all five at five million three hundred and eighty six thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars now of that money is broken out there we're using several different Grant funds in table three kind of starts breaking out in that overall purchase how we're funding that so we're using 53 39c with it has a 75 25 match the ground amount is 2 million seven hundred and twenty seven thousand the or the the grant amount the grant amount is that much the match is nine hundred and nine thousand dollars for a total of three 636 thousand dollars for the the batteries we're using the Oregon D Dash Das for the batteries and the extended warranty that's uh 100 Grant funded for the the total amount of one million three hundred and forty five thousand dollars for that onboard charging equipment we are using 5307 a charging for the charging equipment that's that total for 395 000 750 and then we're using general fund to cover the training costs for ten thousand dollars bringing that total again so you can kind of see it summarized together at five million three eighty six thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars and again the approval tonight is just to wrap up one entire gillig contract price if all the expenditures we're going to be spending with Gilly I'm trying to think if I missed anything uh staff recommends that the board authorized the general manager to execute a contract Amendment with gillig for the purchase of five 40-foot battery electric buses to replace five 35 foot diesel buses for an amount not to exceed 5 million 750 and I am ready for any questions you may have okay any questions any questions for manager Thompson yes thank you um so my understanding is that there's 10 buses total that are supposed to come on the property is that correct great question yes there are there are two orders of five and this is considering the first five the other the other five are they will be entering production the first week of June and will will those batteries be purchased instead of least as well is that the idea correct the the lease program is only available for a very short window and we took it we tried to take advantage of it uh and is only available essentially for that first low no Grant and then come and decided not to do that program any longer so it wasn't even available on our second Grant so those those buses came with thank you and I have one other pet peeve of my my own personal pet peeve though I'll just air for everybody um so what part of this is about graphics and uh is that private vinyl wrap or something like that it is it's a it's a vinyl wrap that we wanted to set apart the the look of the electric buses while still maintaining the the colors of Chariots and have some familiarity we also wanted to set those Vehicles apart Great yeah I think that's fine I I just don't like it when I think disrespectful to our passengers when we have wraps that go over the windows over substantial part of the windows and you've got those little holes to look through I don't I don't personally like that I don't think I don't think it's people want to be able to look out the window or see in the window so you know I that's just one Pepe whoever's designing that I'm sure it's probably you're not the graphic designer so but just to keep as much of those windows as free as possible that's right so Chief Feeney do you know offhand does the proposed graphic cover the windows full wrap might cover the windows but the otherwise we were doing partial reps which would not so we were gonna have a full-size bus year round that was going to have the full size wrap and then the other buses would be partial that was just one bus just the one bus I share a similar yeah pet peeves other questions the Oregon dasque fun source is that the end of the Betsy tack credit stuff the very end we never have to wow congratulations so let's verify does that exhaust all the the no we have more there's still more okay still it's a good thing okay I mean that is wonderful it's just real money now real money it is wonderful to see it being invested in things that actually mean something to our community I'm so happy other questions I will entertain a motion I move the board authorize the general manager to execute a contract Amendment with gillig for the purchase of five 40-foot battery electric buses to replace five 35 foot diesel buses for an amount not to exceed five million three hundred and eighty six thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars a second second we have a motion and a second any discussion director Duncan I know that part of the reason we do this is because there are Grant funds but also I am always impressed by how you are able to find so much grant funding and how we take advantage of it in such a fantastic way I know how hard it is to get and maintain grants and I just want to say once more how much I appreciate the work that you guys do to maintain our budget to the best of our ability and to do the most with what we have so thank you thank you we have a outstanding finance department that they work magic for me other discussion I'll just I I feel compelled to say that I'm unsurprisingly very excited about this I'm excited for the battery electric buses that's not what I'm actually saying but I I wanted to say that I'm very excited for this pilot I have every expectation and hope that this succeeds that this is a wonderful success but I also want to State publicly that this could fail and it's okay Pilots fail and that I want to State here on the record that if it does fail or if there are more challenges than we",

want to jump to a particular issue or um expand this or the conditions the conclusions of law but i just wanted to go over this because this is just a when navigating these documents okay so now are we back to uh everybody can see my screen this is uh this is cindy yes carolyn thank you very much for that little tutorial okay good thank you yeah and if uh if we get to it and you know if you have your documents open and you want a reminder about how to access or find those we can totally go back and do that but this is you know it's also something that for the members of the public um you know who track our projects we really want um we really want the information to be navigable we know there's a lot of it and we just want to help people be able to find what they're looking for okay so we are reviewing the proposed for uh the obsidian solar center the applicant is obsidian solar llc uh the proposed facility is a 400 megawatt solar pv photovoltaic energy facility that's located in north lake um lake county is quite long and large which is approximately eight miles from christmas valley within a 3 900 approximately 6.1 square mile site um the site boundary includes five underlying property owners and then within uh within one mile of the site boundary there's 17 residential so the description of the facility as i noted it's a solar pv the energy generating facility includes modules posts inverters and transfer number units and the electro collect electrical collection system as council is aware an energy facility in your statutes is the energy facility and it's related or supporting facilities so related or supporting facilities include four um up to four one acre collected collect collector substations a three acre 115 to 500 kilovolt step-up substation which means it's stepping up the power from 115 kv to 500 up to two operation operation and maintenance buildings access and service roads fencing around the entire and two miles of 115 uh gentile transmission line which would connect the generating equipment to an existing and the energy generated to an existing 500 kv pge uh transmission line um the relator supporting facilities also include 550 megawatts of dispersed or centralized flow battery technology technology storage systems so in this figure here and i know you read all of these little call outs but i selected this figure because it's basically a layout what the generating equipment would be and where the substations would be this here and there's other figures too this is the transmission line and then this is the existing pg e transmission line you'll notice that there's these little blocks where there's no yellow solar those blocks as we'll address later underneath primarily the council's fish and wildlife habitat standard and council's uh cultural historic and archaeological resources standard these are avoidance areas where the applicant is um going to avoid sensitive resources this is uh the procedural history slide as council can see back in 2018 the applicant submitted its notice of intent uh i'm going to remind council here that back in the notice of intent phase the applicant was proposing about a 6 000 acre solar generating facility but due to comments and review um from the applicant's coordination with tribal governments and other reviewing including the department of state lands for wetlands uh the applicant actually removed 2 000 acres of uh their proposal to what uh council is reviewing today and that was to avoid impacts to sensitive resources so uh back in let's see 2019 we deemed the application complete and then in uh the department issued the draft proposed order um which the draft proposed order typical of all dpos that the department issues is really staff's first cut at making recommendations to council findings of facts and conclusions of law with the inclusion of site certificates to meet particular standards now there is a gap in between the ep or sorry dpo issuance and when we actually had the public hearing on the dpo and as everybody's aware this was just the onset of the coronavirus pandemic so we really um we made several attempts to have a public hearing on the dpo um and just were really mindful of keeping the safety of staff and the public in consideration but also making sure that we met all of the requirements um for the hearing under council's rules and statutes so in july of 2020 we had a in-person and remote public hearing on the dpo uh council reviewed the dpo in august of and then let's see in october we issued the proposed order and notice of the contested case um there was a full contested case proceeding on the applicator on the proposed order which was um uh led by uh joe allen who's a administrative law judge at the office of administrative hearings uh this concluded with his issuance of the hearing officer's proposed contested case order um in january of 2022 and which leads us to today where we're reviewing the proposed order and um council's uh possible final decision of the site certificate so i'm going to go over and this kind of correlates with uh the staff report so the scope of re review so i'm going to go through the proposed order and i've certain items uh i'm certainly not going to walk through all of the conditions because that would just it would be a long time to do all of that so i've just selected some items that i think council would be interested in and that i think are so if as we're going through there's something that you want to talk about or for me to expand on just let me know and i can do it so as we went over uh council reviewed the dpo in august of 2020 and provided input and comments uh on the issues that were raised on the record of the dpo many of the many of those issues were carried forward into the contested case which jesse is going to go over later after my presentation um and i'm sorry just as jesse radcliffe as council's aware but for the record is uh is um council's council uh their doj attorney from the department of justice so i want to make sure that council understands the scope of review so following or during my presentation you will have an opportunity to take an informal vote on whether to adopt modify or reject the proposed order if council determines that modification or rejection rejection of findings and conclusions of law are appropriate it must be based or are maybe inappropriate if basically if council would like to modify the proposed order it must be based on a determination that the applicant has failed to demonstrate a preponderance of evidence to satisfy an applicable standard under review which i'll talk about for ponderance of um within my next slide so um i'm going to continue so the council's general standard of review requires the council to find that a preponderance of evidence on the record supports the conclusion that the proposed facility will comply with essex statutes the citing standards adopted by council and that the facility complies with all other statutes and administ administrative rules applicable to the issuance of the site certificate what does preponderance of evidence mean it essentially it's more likely than not that the evidence proves that the standard is met and um jesse will likely expand on this um in his presentation so under the general standard of review the department recommends uh and also imposes uh conditions one through ten um these include mandatory and site specific conditions that are required in all site certificates so uh so for the mandatory insights there may not be the recommend in front of them because they're required to be in there um and as uh what you'll find in this proposed order and i think uh in other orders is that there are mandatory that relate to the structural standard and there's mandatory conditions that also you know directly relate to the retirement and financial assurance standard the department recommends or imposes those conditions underneath those standards so they don't necessarily appear here however there's several other um conditions uh under general standard of review um where the mandatory or specific conditions are imposed uh the mandatory condition imposed under recommended general standard of review condition one requires that the specific certificate holder to begin construction on the facility no later than the date no later than the construction beginning date specified by council on the site in this condition the department recommends a timeline that's consistent with previously approved facilities noting that the applicant may begin after the issuance of the site certificate but of course pending compliance with all pre-construction conditions um let's see uh general standard recommended general standard of condition three um i think that this this is an important condition um uh and this kind of ties to the site certificate but underneath this condition the certificate holders required to design construct operate and retire and retire the facility substantially as described in the site in general in generating the site certificate the department basically the facility description from the introductory part of the proposed order or final order and um and puts that into the site certificate and this is so when dwayne and the compliance program um is out on site during construction or operation they have an idea of what what is what is constructed and what operation activities are and also what retirement active activities would be um the recommended general standard of review condition six is also a mandatory condition i just plucked this one out to focus that um council is aware that re-vegetation is uh commonly and in this case is addressed under the fish and wildlife habitat standard but there's also a you know as a backstop or additionally supplementing to a mandatory condition that requires re-vegetation on the site um the council also has um well under oar 345 2500 6 sub 10 is a a requirement that the council includes as conditions in the site all representations and and supporting all representations in the application and supporting record the council deems to be binding commitments made by the as necessary to avoid or minimize a potential impact so this is interesting because in the presentation there are conditions that appear that don't necessarily weren't necessary to meet the standard but were an applicant's representation to minimize or avoid an impact uh does council want me to us like just want me to like continue or do you want me to pause at the end of like does council have any questions about the general standard of review helen this is marcy and i'd advise you to pause and",

Senate and ultimately had a work session so kind of got through the final committee requirements at the legislature and really was just awaiting to go to the full senate floor there may have been some resolution needed on the house side but that one essentially is waiting for a floor vote at the Senate for House Bill 3181 this includes numerous elements um the first is it would require the department of energy and the department of land conservation development to convene stakeholders to identify lower conflict areas for renewable energy and transmission citing and ways to streamline and expedite the sighting process and provide and then that would require a report to the legislature next it would require Odo to periodically update the erosa mapping tool we've provided updates to you on that before with new layers or updated data layers next counties would be able to go through their own mapping process related to renewable energy sighting and there would be grant funding provided by dlcd for that purpose and then finally Odo would be given funds that fsec could provide to public bodies tribal governments and Community organizations to participate in the upside process so something like an intervener funding much of that would be the details of that would be established in a follow-up rulemaking that fsec would have to do the the language in the bill was pretty thin about how that would actually apply so a lot of that would have to be established through rulemaking and that bill is currently at Ways and Means so again the the big takeaway there is like everybody else we're waiting to see what happens with the session and uh if if anything moves forward from here on out Todd this is Marcy can you repeat what you said about um I think it was the second thing you said about the counties or actually the third thing about the counties updating I think I missed something yeah so the the basic idea of the bill is that you know we would we would convenience stakehold a bunch of stakeholders and go through and sort of identify uh areas of lower Conflict for renewable energy and transmission citing and then also look at sort of streamlining opportunities um both at the kind of fsec level and at the lcdc level that would apply to um that would sort of be the you know broader approach but then the idea was to give counties the ability to do goal five inventory mapping or kind of go through their own process at the local level and provide funding to them so if they did that then um they could have you know a little more local sort of evaluation about how that would apply you know within their jurisdiction so someone you know pretty much the same as the first bullet that I talked about but really it would be more of a low local evaluation okay thank you chair Grail yes Cindy Conan I just have a question um with respect to 3179 and I probably should have um done some work on this but given the increases in acreage and um metrics for the facilities of the existing site applications we have or projects that are being developed now um do you have a a number or a sense of how many of those would not have been under f-sec jurisdiction if those limits change yeah doing a it was a pretty high level look but I did look at all of our current uh applications and determined that really only one would have met the uh sort of change threshold um but then there was a question of whether that actually had more high value Farm ground than was submitted in the application so so one possibly you know really I think the bigger question is would any of those have altered their acreages to not be within f-sec um so so that's where moving forward you know you know you're looking at the numbers and would that influence anybody to make changes you know going back to you know the wind boom um you know in the you know early mid 2000s the threshold for fsec was 105 megawatts there are many many 104 megawatt uh County jurisdictional projects out there um and just to follow up on that so are the counties uh supportive of this change uh I mean I think there was only a couple counties that really sort of participated so whether they're universally supportive of this or not I don't know um but I know there was a couple counties who Who provided comment and were supportive of it thank you thank you for your comment and I'd just like to remind or I guess not remind I'd like to tell everyone I because I'm having issues with my phone I can't see folks so please just speak up um and if there's anything I'm missing I'd ask a vice chair how or Todd to flag a person I apologize this was not the best device to call in on okay well definitely keep an eye out thank you sure uh this is Kim yes follow-up question uh for secretary Cornett on that um are there any data yet has this been you know where the counties are doing more applications um for citing energy facilities is there a track record yet on the appeals process they're going through uh I mean I did a little bit of research on that so they're you know in 2019 House Bill 2329 increased the thresholds to what they are now and I kind of describe what those are um there are reporting requirements associated with those projects and we've received um notification of eight projects that went through that kind of house bill 2329 process and to my knowledge two of those uh were appealed uh one went all the way up to court of appeals and then kind of backed down to the county so you know it kind of did the many of what you see at the land use who went to the land use board of appeals and then you know sort of um you know some up and down remanding balance back down at the county that was related to implementation of the natural resource protection requirements and so that one is still unresolved and then there was a second one same owner uh project owner and I think that one has been challenged and I think that one's sort of on hold as well so to my knowledge I think just two of them have been chat two of the eight have been challenged okay thanks great questions thank you okay last on my list are future meetings so uh you please saw the emails yesterday so we've been trying to get the draft proposed order hearings figured out for the Boardman Hemingway Amendment one so those got rescheduled um so we were thinking those would be at the June the later June meeting of this um that's not going to happen so we've changed the June meeting um to just June 23rd or the second June meeting to June 23rd and that will be a morning meeting virtually only just like this so that should only be a couple of hours and then July we sent out the email seeking uh whether you were all available or not for the 17th 18th and 19th so the idea there would be that the July 17th we would be in Baker City for an evening public hearing July 18th we would be in Pendleton for a evening public hearing and then July 19th we would also be in Pendleton for the regular council meeting several of you have responded with your availability for those who haven't please uh send an update to Nancy as soon as you can so we can determine whether or not we will have enough for a quorum for that meeting and with that that concludes my Council secretary report thank you very much secretary Barnett any further questions all right well hearing none we'll move on to the next agenda item which is the presentation of the Department of land conservation and developments farm and Forest land use report this is an information item we have Hillary foot from Department of land conservation and development farm and Forest Specialists to present welcome Hillary hi welcome um thank you very much for having me here today and good morning um so I am Hilary foot I'm the farm and Forest land use specialist for the Department of land conservation and and I have to thank Todd for having me here today to review um certain sections of the 2020 2021 biennial farm and Forest land use Report with you um and should I just ask to have those slides advanced yes Hillary I got it okay so next slide all right and they'll win after that one um so today I'm going to be talking about a report that the land conservation and development commission has been providing to the legislature for over 38 years it's a statutory obligation that we have and it's intended to provide some insight into how well our zoning-based working lands conservation program has been performing and achieving the objectives that have been set out for it for Statewide planning goals three and four so bringing to mind that old adage that you can't manage that you can't measure that's really what this report attempts to do um so today I'm going to be giving an abbreviated version of this presentation I'm only going to talk about farmlands we're going to put forest lands aside um I'm going to start with a little bit of the historical context for the goal 3 Program the Farmland conservation and I'm going to touch on Farmland conversions some different ways that we look at it in this particular Port there's a lot of different types of ways to look at it and that it has been looked at by a number of academics and research papers but I'm going to talk about the farm and Forest and lastly we're going to focus on data that was included in the last farm and reforest report on solar sighting and that was included there's about six page section included in the last Prime and Forest report that was a response to a from the board of Agriculture to look at how well our rules have been functioning on encouraging solar sighting on more appropriate locations so next slide uh just getting right into one of the really important things to understand about exclusive Farm use zoning is that it is and always has been associated with attacks program and it predates the land use planning program by over a decade exclusive Pharmacy zoning was originally standardized Statewide in 1963 as part of an incentive tax program that kind of went like this if you were a farmer you could volunteer to have your property enrolled in the program the county would apply a restrictive exclusive",

        "text": " through graduate school as well we gradu school as well we can get it from undergrad to PhD at this point so we've been pretty successful in ensuring that our students go those routes if they don't go thatout we' also develop a technician training track importance of the technician training was that uh we recognized that some folks didn't need to be um have a PhD or a master's or a bachelor's in science to be effective lab technicians and and so we've also beg that development and have several technicians right now hired that CTI Trav numbers that are working through their uh their trp uh in 201 22 we sampled the Columbia River at Hampford reach to develop a Columbia River Matrix for laboratory ion exchange test what that is it's a a simulant of the Columbia river that we can utilize to test our ion exchange materials to ensure that the artificial muscles are able to detect the contaminants in that particular area in the hamper breach because um the laboratory tests work well but unfortunately the laboratory tests are very specific to a neutral pH water that does not have any of the co- competing ions that we see at the hand reach and then in 2023 we developed and implemented our first sampling and Analysis plants for the first foods we did this at the W site we went off of the hord site and you saw that I mentioned we developed those sampling protocols for the hord site we utilize those in the develop of this s sampling analysis plan the big reason why we didn't do this originally at H at the hord site is because one we didn't want them uh we didn't want to concern them too much with fact that this is the first time we're doing this and so we wanted a test site the l site is a CTI own site just down river from the hord site and so it has a very similar set of soils and plant communities and then this year we proposed a Hanford solar and storage proposal on the Hanford industrial lands and the c2r seated LS consistent with the carbon fre energy leasing effort and the department of Energy's clean the clean energy Mantra so this is currently where we're at and we are we are looking forward to seeing how that shapes up so I want to talk a little bit about our travel member scientists and technician training beyond what we've already discussed here are a number of our interms of various levels of technicians um our scientist training track is really the profession for the professional development of our travel members son to become scientists we have have opportunities for high school students for undergraduate students for graduate students and finally we've got this PhD track that has just opened up for Lauren on the right in the middle there and we also have our technician training track it's a non-degree pathway to develop the techn technical competence and environmental sciences and the young lady on the right uh Des sha dick she is um one of those techn and has done an exceptional job and I anticipate that she will continue to grow in this field we've also done some Botanical restoration and some research here's the Pacific northwest side side office prison protected designation area um this is just Northeast of the p&amp; campus it's right along the river there um there's a little uranium Plum not too not too far from there underneath um hopefully we'll Capt some of that in the sa R just kidding we'll see it I don't think we're looking at that um so we did a number of things we developed the soil and moisture sensors to automate our Greenhouse irrigation we produced roughly 40,000 plant in fiscal year 17 replanted approximately 12 acres of this land uh produced a number of seedlings have have continued to our ongoing cheat grass trial we all recognize the the negative impacts of Che grass on the site and and on the ecosystem in general and the need to improve that so we consider that one of the environmental cont threats that we think we need to address and deal with uh we did some seaing trials at our Field Station to understand first Bo and um some of those seing Trails were to understand how sandberg's POA could help control CH grass we are prop we are planning to propose and some changes to the restoration manual to ensure that we increase the number UE sandur Blue Grass uh seating to ensure that uh we reduce fire risk from the that sheet graphs some Cactus tests were completed in fiscal year 21 at this site that you see here and also under our solar panels and in our at our Field Station to understand the impacts of U the solar panels and the cheat GS and then we have been working towards uh some research to understand how to improve overall restoration of the shrub step species that support first so we're no longer laboratory accredited in 2019 much of our staff members that we had at the time many were non- tribal members and moved on to work at the hord site uh and some of them moved on to work in the energy field so um from 2019 on we began restaffing but at the time this demonstrated that we had the ability with this Quality Systems and um the processes that we had developed those standard operating procedures to to obtain and retain accreditation through that period time here's one of our interns assisting toil we talked about the tribal risk calculator and the importance of that to do that we developed a GIS display that took the concentrations of various samples that had been collected at the handford site and reported to the handford site and we assigned some risk to those based on the trip of subsistence scenario and had put together an ability to display that risk for the 100 B um so through the natural resource damage assessment we're obviously involved to look at a number of Assessments here some work that we are we'll be starting here very shortly is a hyperic study of the hampon reach at the Columbia River um we're hoping to demonstrate potential River impacts to upwelling and organisms which ultimately two of at least two of those benic organisms two two families of those B benic organisms are first foods and many of the other first food depend upon those organisms no this just for the reach the r reach so some access and sampling protocols we develop these protocols to access the hord site uh we' also developed some sampling documents that were that were prepared to comply with those neac Institute standards and then as I mentioned we performed last year our first sampling and Analysis plan for the first foods in at that test site wanit and we did so to ensure that the protocols were effective we did that again this year and uh are currently working with Pacific Northwest National Laboratories to build internal capacity on some of the methods that we hope to utilize in the long term and uh we are also working to as an organization acquire the former chemical depot lands at least a portion of those lands and there are several Circle remedies intact on those lands and those Circle remedies will give us an opportunity to demonstrate our ability to do long-term stewardship and to grow that capacity around first foods access sampling and long long-term management of the Circ remedies next slide so that was a look at the past here's a look at the future so ctr's vision for future management of the Hampford lands includes our definition of long-term stewardship we also have a vision for that long-term stewardship ultimately we'd like to return to our former role of the stewards of those land and resources and our commitment to doe for those long-term stewardship is will continue to work to become long-term partners and managers of all the lands and resources at Hanford and we will work ly and respectfully with all those parties involved and prudently use that funding provided by the US Department of energy to meet both those goals and our own policy goals so we have an endstate vision for the handford site that is that is clean restored protected enhanced and accessible um clean being below our own health standards consistent with that tribal subsistance scenario restored ensuring that the uh ecosystem services and the equivalency of those services are restored protected ensuring that it's permanently protecting the quality and quantity of both cultural and natural resources that it's enhanced for the continual Improvement in the quality and quantity of accessible natural resources at the site and it is safe and open access by CTR members U for the use of those traditional lands and resources throughout the UN also we we defined the hamper should not be further developed unless explicitly done through government to consultation that we should get the first R of refusal should land become available within that seated territory and that we'll continue to work towards becoming long-term partners of the site we continue to be proactively engaged in managing the national cultural resources at or affected by uh our Nate vision for management of the handford lands is consistent with the closure of the Seventh Generation report this is the 2017 Edition that was presented to the state traffic government working group we would like to be the long-term partners and managers of all the lands and resources to Hite to ensure that the federal government upholds its Trust responsibility participate in the in this longterm multigenerational Mission and that and that uh we try to get most of the long-term stewardship Concepts consistent between the department of Energy's handford long-term stewardship program plan which has some differences between uh that plan and the closure for the seventh generation and it's important it's important to have those similar in the model to and for do to utilize those travel view points Andi access and use just somebody's question earlier us Mak a question before you move on the first um C we'll have to probably negotiate that has territories as well to the West C to the east uh and some of those likely overlap as the treaty WR or the writers of the treaty U were less uh precise I think than they could have been and I think there was also benefit to the US government to ensure that there is potentially in I mean just what we know from uh so when we look at the river vision and the Upland Vision the Upland Vision describes how the big game roots and berries are impacted and the touchstones to improve them here we're looking at the river vision and the and the uh water and fish as critical to the river Vision within that River Vision there are five T Stones that's hydrology geomorphology connectivity riparian vegetation and biota so i' I've changed these restoration actions to be largely based on ones that are at",

        "text": " local communities would like to implement with this you know we have some communities that just want to talk about um emissions period we have some that want to talk about you know developing um resources that provide significant local economic we are trying to do something that allows for both um this slide is really helpful because it shows that it's the general umbrella Provisions about um you know how customers get charged the program mechanics in terms of you know how decisions are made and then that last one risk allocation is really important I'll pause here to see if there are any questions with what I've got so far question so far I don't think we have any so far okay great so to talk briefly about risk allocation I want to just explain what how that works and why um one Bedrock concept of any voluntary utility program is that the customers that are choosing to take on additional costs bear the risk because it would be not not fair to let say um you know the M County County C IL make a decision that could increase costs for customers in Salem OR Hillsboro or anywhere else right um it's just it would be allowing one local government to make decisions on behalf of folks that are outside of its jurisdiction And to clarify in this context when you're saying customer you mean the city the county whatever the jurisdiction is you're not talking about individual households or business oh thank you for that clarification in this particular example we are saying um residential and small commercial customers in the City of Salem or anywhere else so if Salem moves forward with this we are talking about costs that will be paid by residential and small commercial customers in the City of Salem we have other options if it's the City of Salem for you know on on if if you if we're talking about just meeting the city of Salem's um owned man like at at city of own buildings but that's not what we're talking about here we're talking about a a tariff that would be broadly applicable to um all residential and small commercial customers in Salem unless they opt out so that's the part I was not clear on when you because you were talking about it being optional and I understand it's optional for jurisdictions I didn't really realized it would be optional for individual customers within that jurisdiction yes and yeah and that's required by the law what hp21 says is that for this this is an opt out program so you customers would get a letter in the mail and probably plenty of other Communications um that say Hey you know the Salem City Council voted to create this program you are automatically opted in you have some number of Bill Cycles to let PGE know that you don't want to be in um but that's how it works works thank you okay one followup question if I could I understand that counil have a choice between opt in or out opt out programs is that the case or is it mandatory opt in it's mandatory opt out and that's that's something that's in HP 2021 we have no flexibility there thank you okay that actually is a really helpful um intro to this risk allocation um which I've already started to touch fundamentally if any local jurisdiction in our service area says we want to do this it means that the costs of doing this of implementing a community green tariff are on that Community permanently there there is no offramp once the money is spent there is an off-ramp for money that has hasn't been spent yet but you know once we sign a long-term contract for a new resource to serve folks in the City of Salem um to help Salem meet its climate goals um there there's no way to sort of turn that off and let me just tell you why the answer is because there's only two places to put costs it's either on the people in the City of Salem after the City of Salem votes to um create this program or it's all of our other customers and you can see immediately how it's just really unfair to say to people in any other city that we serve you know Salem City Council voted to do this thing and now you have to pay there's just sort of like a representative democracy problem right there where you know people in um Sandy or Government Camp can't vote you all at office so that's not really an appr appropriate option for um yeah by money spent you mean the investment in the infrastructure to provide the the electricity is that correct correct yeah oh see see we're on a we're not on the oops we're seeing your you you'll see that my my one clarifying question was who is the mayor and I apologize for nothing that's all right our room isn't the best setup here yeah now I can actually see you this better so this is good um I'll keep going while Steve gets that slide back up um so the Terra filing like I was saying was very is very Universal it's like we can slide anything through it on behalf of the community as we discuss the community's there k out looks like steeve got knocked out um then the participation agreement which we'll get that slide back up in a minute um the participation agreement is where we hammer out the details to say you know um Salem would like a combination of utility scale solar and you know small Hydro and um I don't know some some batteries at City Hall or something like that just for example um that's where we negotiate those specific items um we're doing that very intentionally because we want to make sure that communities have the space to work with PGE on their local priorities that's also where we talk about price we are working to get some sort of very representative pricing for communities we're hoping that have that done in the next couple of weeks but that's going to extremely let's say directionally accurate um but it's really going to depend on choices that communities make what does directionally accurate mean um it means that the data that we have is more or less what large resources that are sized to help meet a utility's overall demand you know we 900,000 customers about um resources of that scale like you can think like large solar facilities or large wind facilities or large batteries um that is going to be helpful as you all make price make decisions to sort of know what that stuff would cost we are currently running an RFP for small resources for um cbes for um communitybased renewable energy that's going to give us more pricing data for smaller resources um but this is the first time that we're running a procurement specifically for smaller stuff we will have more information for you as we move forward in that process one thing that's a little bit confusing to me about this is as I have no idea whether we'll even entertain the the idea considering this you know we're just right now wanting to learn sure but if we were to that point where we wanted actually consider this how would we given that it's an opt out possibility how would we know how much money there would be to for investment in infrastructure when we when we don't know how many people would opt out that's an excellent question the answer is um by doing collectively our homework up front um you know we're never going to know exactly how many customers opt out um but you know we have data points we know how many folks in any particular City are enrolled in pge's existing voluntary green programs already um and then it would be absolutely worthwhile doing some very um careful polling um and having really honest conversations with your communities um about what this is going to cost and what it's going to deliver to the city um but um I mean this is this is a big decision um and there are ways to sort of mitigate that risk like I would not recommend that on day one you sign um or you have PGE sign on your behalf a 20-year contract for a large solar facility in eastern Oregon because you know you're right what happens if you get 50% of your um residents opting out well that's going to be a big problem so it would probably makes sense to sort of start slower and build smaller things um where you know the cost um is is you spread over 20 years or so is more manageable just to sort of test the waters and see you know okay if we have a $2 a month Bill impact we only have a 8% opt out rate or something like that that would be a good thing to know before you go out and do something that's going to have a 10 or 12 or $15 a month Bill impact and again these are just numbers I'm giving you for the sake of discussion they're not real numbers at all understood thank you I have a question yeah can you give us an idea of how many people are enrolled in the voluntary green program currently I can't but PGE certainly can we we I believe we have that data on um all cities in our jurisdiction I think that would be interesting context to have like what is Salem you know we at 50% 10% I mean I have no idea I wonder work in advance to try and increase that number right before we commit to anything else mayor mayor Hoy we can provide you that number in terms of the number of residents we can get that number pretty quickly to you it's not heavily advertised I I'm on it I had to find it yeah that would be great Wendy thank you yep yeah we have I can't tell you that pges is the highest um is as a percentage of customers is the largest in the country we we have um a lot of customers on it interesting good um Steve can you skip this Slide Five um I think I'm on Slide Five actually oh you customer pricing yeah you are great um like I said Steve just will intuitively know where where to go except when he get gets the wrong screen up yeah that was that was um it just showed some of my political ignorance um okay so you know this is showing you sort of with words what this is going to cost and I want to be really clear about what we're asking communities to pay for we are not asking communities to pay for every cent of what a new resource is going to cost we are just going to ask communities to pay for what percentage of that new resource is above what pge's cost would be otherwise so you can sort of think of us as having a baseline cost which um all customers are going to pay and then the increment above it is what residential and small commercial customers in the City of Salem or anywhere else would pay um so Steve let's go to uh slide seven I",

like or the unique ability of the site to provide both wind and solar at the site and as you've you've you've received the applicant requested a 30-day extension at that hearing to submit additional evidence and on the 15th they provided a supplemental packet that was provided in hard copy and electronically to counsel and i i think i don't want to repeat what you've heard or maybe what you've reviewed but in response to the specific recommendations that we heard out of the testimony from council we wanted to that in the supplemental response applicant explains that the wind energy site was selected based on favorable interpretation of wind the site allows for wind and solar which provides a balanced generation it has robust wind resources and that allows the site itself allows for shared infrastructure of the two technologies being wind and solar i think we are interested in whether council has any further concerns or comments that we should be in that goal exception chair this

protecting agricultural land for continued agricultural production required under lcdc statewide planning goal 3. oregon's land use program was developed and initially adopted back in the early 1970s i heard the late hector mcpherson say on several occasions that the primary motivation for oregon's land use program was protection of farm and forest lands or ever in from ever increasing development pressures in the 1960s and goal three states in part agricultural land shall be preserved and maintained for farm use consistent with existing and future needs for ag products forest and open space mine conservation and development commission solar rules which i helped initially develop when i was the co-chair of the lcdc solar rules advisory committee require an exception be taken when 12 acres of high value or 20 acres of arable land are taken out of agricultural production by a solar facility clearly these thresholds will be exceeded by this application and an exception to protecting farmlands is required whereas force 69.504 sub 2 sub c which is f sec statute sets out the requirements that must be met when taking an energy facility citing council reasons to statewide planning goals they include three parts a reasons justify why the state policy here goal three should not apply b significant we abbreviate it as easy consequences anticipate anticipated from the proposed solar facility have been identified and adverse impacts will be mitigated and c the proposed solar facility will be compatible with other adjacent uses or will be made compatible i agree these criteria do not require an alternatives analysis as the lcdc requirements do and i stated that clearly on may 26 in my comments the evidence presented identifies the majority of the subject 100 1896 acres is identified in nrcs soil class 3 and is designated as arable land with scattered inclusions of high value this acreage has been cropped in the past and is in the county's exclusive farm use zone as i stated may 26 i agree uh with and accept many of the reasons provided by the applicant justifying the removal of this acreage from statewide planning goal 3 farmland protections but i also believe many of these reasons could apply to any dry land wheat acreage in the region and there needs to be a demonstration why this specific site should no longer be protected for agricultural use and how the applicable criteria are met for help in understanding how to meet these criteria the oregon supreme court found in our rural oregon versus at a gas-powered electric generation facility was particularly suited to its site due to its proximity to an existing natural gas pipeline transmission line and substation so the question here is how is the solar site particularly suited for this project aside from the financial benefits to the farming operation lack of current farming practices and minimal impact to adjacent farming activities why is this site particularly for this solar facility i believe it's particularly suited because it's proposed to be developed in conjunction with the wind facility and all of its supporting facilities the applicant's new testimony emphasizes the benefits of being cited near the bpa transmission line and proposed bpa substation to be constructed with the wind facility new testimony also emphasizes that the solar facility will balance electric loads with the wind facility wind in the evening solar during the day and increased reliability to the grid in addition they state of all the acres under management of cunningham this parcel can best integrate wind and solar electric generation therefore i believe the site certificate should be conditioned to support the goal 3 exception as long as the solar facility site is developed in conjunction with the wind facility to take advantage of the shared supporting facilities transmission substation roads and battery storage i'm going to leave it to the staff to draft the exact language for such a however i believe the solar facility is particularly suited for the proposed site because it's associated with the wind its shared supporting facilities therefore must be developed in conjunction with the wind facility and you know one of the questions is you know is one turbine enough i think you know the wind facility has to be commercially viable so those are my comments it's my position go ahead i have a bit of a lengthy one not quite as long as hanley's the credentials and expertise of steve corey and bob levy and their written testimony in their june 13th declarations uh connects the dots for me solar pv site has been taken out of ag production because it was an uneconomical to farm a least productive area for farming with no water resource or irrigation and with the grazing limitations it's not economically feasible a farm trying to farm the property even with the recent up-to-date practices generally provides a negative financial return the low returns in soil erosion are the primary considerations and why it is some of the least viable property in their ownership and in the county in addition the site's within a mile of a bpa transmission line that runs through the site of a proposed bonneville substation providing an economical connection to reach the grid and provide integration of wind and solar generation 1896 acres or less than seven percent of the total dry land wheat producing land in the family ownership and less than 1.2 percent of the total agricultural acres owned and managed by the family the proposed solar pv facility location is flat with excellent aspects towards the sun as close to the transmission infrastructure requiring no separate inner tie line the location of the solar pv facility takes advantage of a relatively flat area the availability of wind facility infrastructure and will have a lack of impact on existing agricultural operations including ranching near the substation any other solar pv on their ownership would be remote from the substation and would not serve the project's purpose of a fully integrated round-the-clock hybrid renewable energy facility so i find that the gold three exceptions justified i find that the inclusion of solar at this particular location creates a more balanced generation profile increasing reliability of the grid and increases the project's viability the solar site is particularly suited because it is different from other cropland in umatilla county and the region because it will be located in close proximity to a proposed wind energy facility and provides interconnection opportunity for the solar facility without requiring additional transmission lines because the two facilities are so interconnected i feel it's appropriate to condition the goal 3 except to approve the goal 3 exception on a condition that the approval is on the basis of the solar facility being built in conjunction with the wind for this is anne byer and although i wasn't present at the two hearings that happened before this i did listen to the audio tape so i have some familiarity and i have reviewed the materials thank you to the applicant and the property owners for providing the background i agree with vice chair howe on how that really helped explain why this site was less suitable for i would like staff to ensure that there's a finding that reflects discussion of those locational dependent the transmission line the location near project substations and the in conjunction with wind i think that does distinguish this project and we want to make sure we're explicit about that i think that locational factor is is pretty critical to this particular application so thank you for the record todd cornett just uh two sort of follow-ups to this one so you both read you know moderately lengthy uh statements can we get those and either if you want them back we can make copies of them and return them to you or we can just take them if you're you don't want them back so i think that would be helpful for us um as councilmember buyer said i think using that kind of either language or paraphrasing that will help us supplement the findings so um and then just looking for again consensus on you know the that type of language that phrasing and the condition from all council members yes this is marcie uh cindy uh yes grill this is perry choctew yes thanks perry uh this is jordan for the record i i believe the proximity connectivity geographical conditions power generation goals and benefits to the state uh represent the highest and best use of this project and ground so yes thank you all good okay thank you very much hand it back to kate now okay so we're going to move on to the which is the protected area standard under this standard the council must prohibit the sighting of energy facilities in protected areas except for special cases primarily transmission lines or pipelines where there is no reasonable alternative protected areas include national and state parks national monuments and other areas identified in the council rules as having special scenic natural or environmental value for proposed facilities near protected areas the standard requires council to determine the facility would have no significant direct or indirect adverse impact on these protected areas so in the application evaluated the analysis area which is the pink dotted line around the proposed site boundary and in their analysis they identified 18 protected areas includes four state wildlife refuges five state fish hatcheries two state parks one state heritage area two agricultural experimental stations one blm bureau of land management area of critical environmental concern and three state wildlife areas so in their analysis basically we looked at the proximity of identified protected areas in relation to the components and that would be the wind turbines the solar facility and the transmission line and one of the key findings is that for the wind and solar",

        "text": " large it was it was near the the ac uh transmission lines and there was arcing due to the wildfire smoke so the the the intertie had to be de-energized uh to not to not further the wildfire and so what ended up happening was not only did california lose potentially so they were talking about major system impacts here so beyond oregon they lost you know three and a half gigawatts of potential import and then and then the dc entertain had to be also de-energized not because the wildfire smoke because now the system was out of balance so there's another couple gigawatts so you know all of a sudden california is in a huge you know pinch without without some of the imports they really rely on and there are other times of the year when we rely on imports across the intertie and that could be really important for oregonians as well all right let's go to the next slide okay so a couple key findings from the oregon study uh from our our 2020 um offshore wind study was this ability for you know uh interconnections of of maybe between two and three gigawatts of nameplate capacity offshore went but closer to you know two gigawatts of power flows um on the actual existing transmission that works as as gauged from a production cost model and then some of the um some of the complementary benefits i indicated before one thing i didn't mention was that there there is a you know a larger scale relief of historic transmission flows from east to west so not just across the coastal range but also from the farther east part of the region all the way to the coast and also to the i5 corridor so by serving some of that i5 load from the ocean you relieve you free up some coastal capacity some of that cascade transmission capacity which has some implications for future uh generation and transmission um the last thing i want to mention is we're really i would say we're just really starting on this work and fully the the reliability and resilience value of offshore wind in the northwest and on the west coast in general um so uh the next layer so there has been some production cost modeling done several studies this one and several others and now but what the next part is really to look closely at resource adequacy you know do some detailed power flow work including steady state short circuit and dynamic studies to understand the impacts the true impacts uh to the existing transmission grid and also you know how a purpose-built transmission infrastructure might benefit or how it would be affected um by offshore wind power flows and then and then of course if we're looking beyond the three gigawatts beyond the two gigawatts then there's there's a role for new production cost modeling and we're doing some of that in our study right now so next slide final this is the current study it's funded by the national offshore one research and development consortium and boem and we're looking at this this exact range we've got great wind speeds uh and strong capacity value as i indicated we have 18 months we started at the beginning of this year um and we're at the point we're optimizing generation footprints in the ocean for for electricity system values and the same values i've been indicating in these slides evaluating three conceptual transmission scenarios to move that power and seek it at load centers in uh in the i5 corridor as well as down in san francisco um and we're guided by poet and and as from as in an advisory capacity uh as as led by jason bush um and i'll take any questions about that as we go here but thank you very much for the time happy to talk more thanks travis that was great um jason just has a couple of additional slides and then there's been some really great questions for you in the chat if you want to take a look are you able to stay on for a little bit longer so we can do a discussion okay great jason i'll just um have you do your remaining two slides while travis takes a look at the chat and then we can kind of do it all at oh your slides disappeared there you go okay thanks travis um yeah i think that's a wise decision let's go through recap and the synthesis of the feedback we heard on these topics um you know 100 clean power grid that gets to the generation profile a little bit then the transmission power supply reliability travis touched on with enhancements and expansions to um maybe increase the transfer capacity on east west and north south pathways and power system resilience and here here we go was able to get a synthesis of the comments we we got on this topic down to one slide so maybe this can help us stay on track for our for our timeline for the meeting um we'll point out on the right that wildfire risk is kind of a big um maybe more frequent natural event extreme natural event that the pacific northwest encounters so planning for these is a little easier than planning for like the big earthquake scenario we talked about on the last topic so some of the themes where floating offshore wind generation profile is complementary to solar and provides resource diversity we've talked about diversity um in that aspect and then the locational diversity for balancing power flows on the transmission system is another um key feature of offshore wind that's relatively unique then floating offshoring compulsory reliability um explore these need to explore these benefits with in relation to kind of the transmission expansion necessary talked about that a bit and transmission solutions that reduce the east-west pathways the reduced congestion on those pathways and then also provide alternative north-south with stuff many folks highlighted in the comments as well so generally we heard a lot of feedback relating to these five or four four bullet points and then we'll open it up for uh additional feedback and questions for um so uh kathy i see your hand up i'm just gonna cover um a few in the chat and then i'll go to kathy and then sean um there was some really good discussion and questions in the chat about this topic and i'm trying to scroll through there was a question for travis about what studies were done uh whether there were economic dispatch studies or reliability studies contemplating the nerc and whack reliability obligations and cathy also had a question about the pnl 2021 study that was referenced and if the link could be put in the chat it looks like the oto literature review has a reference for the 2020 study um ashley also asked about whether you could share a little bit more on the locations chosen for offshore wind looks more centralized while the bomb call areas are more southern oregon um there's also a clarifying question from troy about on slide 53 saying the total load on the oregon coast is one gigawatt or is that just around the south coast area that um you could clarify and then maybe i'll pause there for those and then cover the rest okay thanks yeah a couple of those questions i think are related to the footprint we considered so we we ran in this first study it was you know we depict four locations that span the coast that was our ideas just to kind of you know inspect the the characteristics of offshore wind and how they might vary across the coastline um and then also looking that of course so spatially but also in time as you saw me uh walk through today um so so that was our focus so the in terms of you know the coastal low the coastal load was north to south the thought was it's roughly order of magnitude it's not really a precise number but on the order of one gigawatt of load on the coast that could be served by offshore one um if the transmission north of south was was suitable to do that um and then richie helped me with the second question that had to do with um had to do with the footprint yeah the it might have been oh go ahead oh go ahead no please um the i think there was a clarifying question about whether one gigawatt was total load on the oregon coast or just in the south coast area yeah that's the total coast um and then jess had a comment about how we can ensure communities where the most offshore wind development is happening actually benefit from and receive that energy generation to improve south coast energy resiliency rather than being entirely sold to the broader grid or and or california grid yeah um go ahead that's a really good question um it's an important one the way it works right i mean there's so when the electronics is generated and interconnected you know it's not you don't really there's no way to trace that electron right it goes into the grid and the grid then serves uh power flows for with uh you know what the uh infrastructure can what the capacity is of individual lengths of the infrastructure so the way to sink the load on the coast is to ensure that transmission up and down the is suitable so that when the grid hit when the power hits the grid i mean it's not like there's a separate i just want to be clear that there's not a separate intertie into portland a separate one into san francisco right it i mean you know outside of talk about you know some sort of backbone that might interconnect specifically in certain places as the major kind of thoroughfare for for moving power this study you know looked at existing 230 kv bpa substations so once the power hits those substations provided that there is um there aren't any constraints on on the trend or failures on the transmission system north to south along the coast that power should go to the coast um and the coast should see a direct benefit and that's kind of uh you know i think the system operators have to keep that in mind you know to make sure that you know the coast can be served reliably and and but the benefits are are system-wide i mean everyone benefits it's not like i know that's that's a common question it's not just the coastal folks get the benefit or just the i5 folks get the benefit i mean it's been it's a it's kind of a rising tide you know we we all benefit from it and um but there are some acute power quality benefits that would be experienced near where the interconnections happen so that is a bit different in terms of you know um some things i mentioned in power quality so the to the the the stability of frequency and voltage you know you know along the coast particularly in radial extensions on the coast

        "text": " peak transmission needs and so there's some other pretty major co-benefits that you know may have decade-long benefits and billion-dollar sort of avoided costs associated with them that i think would be you know worth considering incorporation and some of this modeling so anyways i'll pause there and happy to ask answer any questions or you know sync up with folks in the future but i think there's some some big pieces there that again just continually having become aware of this this group uh hopefully fit in somewhere in this yeah thank you jake uh glad you found us and uh we did uh have a focused conversation around transmission needs storage needs associated with one of our recommendations in our 2020 report to the legislature which was the 100 percent clean electric sector um recommendations so uh we did follow up with some deep dives certainly i think would be beneficial to um to circle back to that uh as we start to look at how we implement these these programs and and understand a little more about what the utilities are proposing so thank you linda i have lost my there we go maybe i've got it back okay so next up is catherine thompson catherine thompson excellent so we do have a few more people that have signed up looks like we have five or six so please keep your comments to three minutes or under catherine you're unmuted thank you can you hear me all right i'll speak up um my name is dr catherine thomason i'm speaking as the co-chair of the multnomah county democrats climate action team first i want to thank you for your outstanding efforts to explain the modeling and some of the caveats listed at the introduction of this presentation and thank you as well for moving this forward to guide the state i'm hopeful it will be heated we are thrilled that you are shooting to model for improved targeting by 2030. initial actions will tend to be the most and cost effective so targeting achievement of those early on is very both to reduce the threat of climate change and to reduce the high cost of impacts from extreme weather and health i would like to caution on two major issues the first is not to rely as much in the programs especially for the accelerated 2030 goal with emphasis on alternative liquid and gaseous fuels that have a wide variation in the literature in modeling their true greenhouse gas emissions for example we believe that corn ethanol is significantly worse than gasoline in greenhouse gas emissions along with other non-quantified societal problems of nitrogen pollution and food in the case of rng the true evaluation of methane leaks which occur whether the gas is bio or fossil is not adequately included in many analyses i'd urge you in these cases to ramp up as quickly as possible the electrification of transportation and buildings and to advocate for legislative actions that would achieve these rather than agency-only tools i think that's very very important because of the pushback that we're seeing from major industry and the fuels industries as well lastly bringing forth the concept that methane gas heat pumps are not readily available whereas electric heat pumps are and they're well studied especially assuming your high market penetration by 2030 it may also be useful to bring forth new frameworks for fossil fuel industries such as the encouraging methane gas industry to become a thermal industry that's being piloted in where they are building neighborhood ground sourced heat pumps owned and run by the thermal industry with connections to each home this type of thinking is important for industry success and jobs creation instead of advocating for hybrid sources which as you've shown have lower net cost benefits thank you so much for allowing public comment thank you catherine really appreciate your your ongoing uh interest in our work and comments welcome karen uh can you hear me we can welcome okay um i actually didn't raise my hand but since you called on me um i i am a member of climate reality portland and uh co-chair of the legislative committee and so we our focus is on oregon legislation that will really ramp up the speed and scale of oregon going all electric because that's how we feel like we're going to make our we're particularly interested at the moment on the infrastructure reduction act and um really encouraged by that act and that that will get our nation to 40 reduction in um emissions by 2030 um which i'm thrilled to see that this commission is also looking at 2030 and that you will match up with that group but i think to get us there we have to look at all electric and that the hybrid isn't isn't going to get us there and um that's how we um how we are looking at it and we hope you'll give that and um thanks for all of the work that you're doing and i think you're going to really help us get to that last 10 percent i think oregon will be a key a key player there excellent thank you karen tim miller welcome tim very good thank you chair mcdonald and members of the commission and uh big thanks to alan and odo and the analyst team for this really great information super helpful to be able to understand these investments and their yield and looking at those curves over time um i i want to just applaud uh what alan covered about really digging into the valuation of the i thought there was a strong list there of some of the economic considerations around co-benefits and i'm speaking sorry i should have introduced myself i'm the executive director of peci and we're a funder of climate policy uh work but i'm speaking also with the experience of having run and habit which was an organization that helped some 5000 organ families do deep energy retrofits on their homes so i just want to double down on the the comments about the importance of valuing health risks and other those kinds of considerations burning gas in a house you know the dramatically increased risk of uh kids getting asthma in addition to you know missing school days and parents missing work days and all the other cascading effects of the health impacts and i know it's going to be hard to value those but i really encourage attaching some pretty strong dollar figures to those effects and then there are also things like air sealing and other measures that would go along with doing these residential retrofits that have their own indoor air quality benefits and other benefits and as as angus mentioned the value of air conditioning let's figure out how to value that when you're at least if you're adding a heat pump to a house so i would go as far to say you know quantifying these various benefits um and reorganizing then the mac curve that alan was instructing us on is to me super important even so much as to say i i don't think it's fair to call the the straight up sort of myopic how much dollars do i put into this system and how many dollars do i save uh in my utility bills i don't think it's fair to call that an economic analysis i think we should change our and we have obviously in this state a history of i'd say misusing the term cost effective we should call it narrow cost effectiveness or narrow economic analysis or a narrow financial analysis it's not a full analysis if you're just looking at those things um and i can say that the of the 5 000 families that upgraded their homes years ago under under the program i mentioned um i think very few of them made those decisions based on just dollars and cents i make decisions on a whole lot of other factors and let's let's try to get all those economic considerations in there and then recognize that there are non-economic co-benefits like it's really hard to measure the value of a kid missing a school day or getting asthma or whatever those things those are those should be the icing on top but let's put dollars behind all those other trade-offs thanks thank you really appreciate your karen it looks like nick is next nick um nick did you want to say anything more it looks like we got your question answered i went ahead and unmuted you if you want get any thanks so much for the data okay i think that's it then catherine okay excellent thank you with that we can move on to our kind of additional discussion that we had and it might make sense for someone to pull up the slide deck maybe maybe alan and then we can revert to that as we need to but just interested in reactions to what you all heard today on any of the comments that we heard from the public suggestions about how we move forward any any of that would be very welcome uh this is tom i just had a quick uh comment on on some of the public comments uh especially the one that that two people i believe you know we should not look at hybrid type models that really concentrate just on electrification and i'd like to just in a sense respond to that a little bit in that you know looking at the hybrid alternative fuel forces i don't think that slows anything down or or changes the picture but i think it it's more robust that we look at these things as time goes on technology is going to change too uh and and so i i just think keeping those other options available to doesn't necessarily mean we will miss the 2030 possible target but it allows us to have that richness and then as we go down the road these things may become more viable more economically viable alternatives for us to use to reduce emissions so i i think we we're i think it's good we have a hybrid look and i think we shouldn't lose sight of that thank you thank you commissioner patowski other comments this is tom riekman and i had a comment or yeah based on uh like what tim miller was saying uh we need maybe we need to move retro fitting up i mean there's i guess i need some clarification i mean i i assume we're not going to put a heat pump in a home that doesn't have insulation because all we'll do is raise the cost utility cost which would be an equity issue it would affect low-income people to a higher degree so i guess yeah just some clarification on where we are on alan or chris do you want to oh you've gone on mute somehow you put yourself on mute commissioner raymond is the question would we put a heat pump in a in a house that wasn't uninsulated i think that he's hoping to understand how we're thinking about retrofitting i think it's based on the discussion that we had around the cost curve right",

University OSU also under other facilities is a 51.2 megawatt steam generator and that's in the middle of a um paper mill and it's in Springfield Utility so that's all we have is the just the steam generator also we have one uh ethanol plant that produces 44 million gallons of ethanol each year um and it's located in the Borman Industrial Park Port of Moral Moral County the department has one operating 500 KV transmission line that's the Eugene De Medford transmission line it's a it's it's operating it's a 46 mile 500 KV KV transmission line between uh Pacific core um meteran Pacific core um met metering sorry Pacific core uh substation near Medford and then Pacific core Spencer switching Station South of so it's that that's the two meet up in end points chair Grail yes counc quick question how do you track amendments many of the things that have been constructed especially wind you know they're putting in new um blades and things how do you track those they would have presumably new conditions and would would addtion workload even though they've already been approved so usually when we do our kind of a um our first assessment of going on site to do um inspections um we you know we find the major conditions that we want to review or any other materials we want to review and if there's anything new like they're building something new then that's when that's kind of how we go out and check on it and make sure that's everything's going fine from that stage thank you secretary cornette yeah um for the record Todd cornette um thank you council member by it's a good question and it kind of the you know the answer varies we will get an approved facility and then prior to construction they may change that yeah um and if that happens that's sort of a almost a reset because we haven't really done anything yet so that's much easier than a project that has been approved has constructed is in operation and then they add a different component now we're seeing wind adding solar or wind adding because then you get the complexity of adding new construction new Operation new pre-construction new retirement conditions not all the old conditions directly apply so it you know going to the point that Sarah was making the amount of conditions the FTE the complexity an amendment can add a significant amount of complexity to a project in terms of the conditions and then how do those get integrated and and you know we could be dealing with construction and operation conditions on a facility in the same year so it's a good question and the answer is kind of it depends and some of it's easier and some of it is quite complicated thank you and and Tom as you look at those Amendment rules this might be something to Circle back on because it just seems we'll see more Amendments of existing projects at least since I've been on we've seen quite a few and then just quite simply we track it in a sheet yeah and then also the department has two battery battery energy storage uh systems um with already within already site cited um facilities and that would be Port uh Port Westward generating project there's a 4 to six wat megawatt or 4 to 6 megawatt uh B storage facility there um and then also Wheat Ridge renewable energy facility uh three 50 megawatt battery storage battery energy storage system as the in there as well so secretary brette yeah sorry just to make it painfully clear because there's potential legislation related to battery storage FC does not have jurisdiction over Standalone battery storage so Dwayne said it kind of quickly but I wanted to make sure it was clear these battery storage components are associated with a facility that is within the jurisdiction of the council so I just want to make sure because he characterized those as as just the battery storage but early on he explained that they were part of another facility so again I just wanted to make sure that that was very clear to people thank you council member Condon quick question to that does anybody have jurisdiction that's a very good question coun um not not to get too far into the weeds on that I think that's part of what the legislation is about is um in the short answer is yes and no um we believe you know that you know clearly you know the council has jurisdiction if a battery storage um component is part of an fsec jurisdictional facility if a battery storage facility is by itself that's going to depend on the Zone whether it's an urban or a rural Zone the rural zones in particular the exclusive Farm use Zone I think everybody believes that it is a utility facil necessary for a public service but it's not explicitly articulated that way so I think that's part of the the idea of the legislation is to make sure that it is sort of reflected that it is a use that is allowed um so I think that's going to be a continuing theme um in the near future um in terms of legislative updates to make sure that gets very clearly articulated you know where it's allowed how it's allowed we're just sort of at the beginning stages of that because you know it's it's a relatively it's not a new thing there is a battery storage a standalone battery storage facility owned built owned and operated by Portland General Electric in Salem so it's certainly not a brand new thing but I think the potential volume that we're going to see in the near future um is going to be a very different thing so there'll be be a lot more conversations about that so sorry I didn't mean to Sidetrack that but I just wanted to make sure because there's there's a lot of play um related to that issue right now you next slide okay okay so I am going to go over um a little bit about the scope of the subprograms of preconstruction construction and operation and then we'll hand it back to Dwayne to talk about the fun stuff so the first um step after a site certificate is issued uh for a certificate holder is to satisfy all preconstruction requirements or all those that apply to a phase if a developer has decided to develop a project in phases um the preconstruction step is incredibly challenging for many reasons a few um just to give you a a sense are that conditions and mitigation plans are technical they're detailed they're complicated it often necessitates a familiarity with the council's final order and even the record and um that is like Odo fex speak that is not everyone's speak so it is difficult for new individuals that are stepping into the process once that site certificate is issued and that's exactly what happens it's the permitting team is not the construction team is not the operations team sometimes there is a bridge depending on how the developer entity is set up and there's a lot of movement going around so we're not you know people that have been players with certificate holders that we deal with all the time like ni SAR and Aven grid are seeing a lot of turnover so um we're having to you know kind of retrain all the time of what this really means uh so that piece of there's new different people involved is is a challenge um and even for us I mean we hand it over to people that weren't involved in permitting and it's not easy I for that translation um and then you know many site certificates have an allowance to do preconstruction in phases uh to align with how it's actually built especially as projects are getting bigger and bigger they're not and we don't want them to we don't want a solar project to go out and grade and develop 4,000 acres in 3 months we want that to be spread out spread out the impact in across the board um but that means that preconstruction compliance happens in waves um and each time it might be varying degrees of adequacy and accuracy given what we believe the conditions require um fun only fun um so our typical forecasted cost for preconstruction for any site certificate is about 400 hours which is like 4 to 6 months of full-time work um and if there's more than one project at a preconstruction phase uh that four to six months becomes like eight months because you just can't handle the volume um things are spread out and we lose efficiency uh so typically um once we're preconstruction how it starts is that a certificate holder uh cont conts the department and lets us know ideally 6 to 12 months in advance of when they think they're going to mobilize uh we assign a staff as the point of contact UM and we have been setting up um monthly phone call check-ins if not inperson meetings with them to go through conditions conditioning requirements where they're at there's a lot of work that has to be ironed out at that phase it is um and we've built into the conditions like that the department has to approve so and that's not a checkbox approval it's we're approving something substantive that wasn't figured out in the permitting process uh so it's it's quite detailed and requires a lot of coordination um typically uh We've interwoven other agencies to help in that review approval ODFW is the obvious a lot of times the local government the special Advisory Group entity um and dogami are are standard agencies that we build into that process takes time um so just a couple of examples I have more listed on the slide then I'll go into but of conditions that we're evaluating at pre-construction compliance one of our favorite and applies to every developer is the the decommissioning bond and that condition if you're familiar I mean is typically a half a long makes sense to everyone right but it doesn't uh and so we where we the council would approve um the methods for estimating that decommissioning estimate and the unit costs and so really all that is supposed to happen at preconstruction is you can adjust the number of",

        "text": " come off mute and ask a question we also looking in the chat for um any questions we have so far so far no hands open and no chats hey yeah that's what I'm seeing as Chris we sit here in awkward silence we'll get that here we got a question so um are projects that integrate existing renewable generation into a micro grid with battery storage eligible for the program yes is the short answer the devil's always in the detail um and so we'd have to take a look at that the um the it would also have to be uh micro grid design specifically to support the resilience and reduce the effects of grid disruption um so as long as that was built into the design and planning of it um what's not allowed is New Generation so um if it's a so a micro grid um where the resilience generation is from solar um the solar aspects of that are not eligible funding but aspects of the micro grid would be great the next question is could you please repeat what is not allowed that you mentioned previously so I don't know if it's easier to just go back to the slide thanks Joshua glad glad we yeah i' like to put up the um the eligible whoops there we are um and what's not allowed is cyber security measures and new generation of of electricity just those two things um can just maybe just leave this up for a sec the other thing that's discouraged but not specifically disallowed is are um maintenance um and that can be a little bit subjective so we'll sort of address that project by project detail by detail um and I want to point out that I got that information from the US Department Energy's um frequently asked questions website or document that's on the federal website link and Emily just included a link to the FAQ in the chat for those of you interested um next question Joshua and Lisa thank you for the question so far this is from Brenda if we have applied for grip in the past with different project Scopes is the letter still required um I believe they still want the letter so they can confirm that the that the Scopes don't apply and they have some background information so they can go look up your your grip application um our directions are anybody who has a grip uh project should give us the letter just so that the US Department of energy can be conflicted great thanks Clay and um if anybody um has joined the call and hasn't yet introduced themselves in the chat please do um I know we had some folks join a little bit late which is great we're so glad you're here and then um Tean has a question if our utility is a subrecipient other under another organization's grip Grant but not the direct applicant or recipient what are the grip letter requirements I would assume still have to put the letter yeah yeah and just making that distinction about what what parts of the project and scope fall under your entity under under your organization um and then again we'll be we'll have a period we'll be able to go back and forth with our project officer at the US Department of energy to get anything like that sorted out if it comes up great and then last for now is Janine uh what is the period of performance for this round of funding they have some concerns about supply chain delays for Su certain equipment right yeah I've heard some national other National chatter about the reclosers and and other equipment in the shortfalls but our period will be in like May April a April 2028 will be the end of the period in any performance agreements we signed to start but there are a few ways to extend projects um beyond that um but for now what we're um going to go with is April of 2028 for the the end of the period and of course the concerns or the things that come up with supply chain would would end up being in most cases a legitimate reason for a no cost extension to a performance agreement from what we're seeing so far great well we'll just sit here until you have more questions for us and if the silence gets to be more than a couple minutes I think we'll move on I suppose yeah and um I'll just say if if if you're thinking about question but don't want to do it now you know please I'll I'll put up my phone number and my email at the end um before we say goodbye um but please email or call anytime and I can set up other technical experts we can have one onone meeting or just answer uh questions by email um that's fine too however you guys want to get in touch just don't hesitate to do so don't wait till the deadline uh I'm available and and uh and ready to take your questions at any time that might have been the couple minutes we haven't had any oh uh let's see we have some more yay it always happens perfect thank you um Janine thank you can you speak to the public engagement expectations for projects okay sure um one of the documents Linked In the um opportunity announcement in the resources section are the um Department of energies and the um grid deployment offices metrics document specifically for this program and in there they have all of the metrics and the measurements that the department of energy is going to be used to assess the projects that get selected we're going to try and use some of that but not as strictly as the department of energy for looking at applications right and so it really is up to the entity but if you go and find that um grid metrics document guidance document it talks specifically about the community engagement and the type and degree of Engagement and so that's really the best guide instead of me talking about it is to go and get that guide and look at that Community engagement but again it's doing the Outreach to your customers and whatever level you're able to allow them to participate in the project um and then keep them informed of the project and then um you know a high degree of Engagement would be allowing your customers or your communities to participate in Project selection um you know so it runs that whole range um I'm going to jump right to Lisa's uh question about the question is um Can the application include equipment Andor off-road vehicles required to support getting the projects done yes I mean that would fall under um see I guess that would you know it would sort of fall under the hardening of facility substations and others um or um prevention systems monitoring control it or utility pole management it could fall under that it's a little bit subjective but our understanding is that type of equipment that allows you to get your grid back in service faster that's reduc reducing the duration of grid disruptions and so increased equipment increased Parts is also um an eligible cost from the the other things that we've read or heard from the Department of energy because anything that reduces your downtime is a grid resilience measure sorry I was talking on mute for a second I'm back off mute um I'm just gonna stay off mute hopefully no weird sounds will happen uh so um John Warner is wondering in PGE territory is PGE the only eligible applicant I think um I guess I mean I yeah I can't imagine the project that you're talking about John so um you know each you know the utility um you know if if they're the transmission utility it's PG territory and it's their distribution Network their customers I would expect a PGE project um I'm not sure if that's getting to your your question utilities are the eligible applicants so yeah I suppose there could be like a world in which like another utility decided to put a project like on the border into PGE territory or something that serves their need because if that's where the land is or something I don't know right yeah if you have a specific idea John you know go ahead and and Emil me email me and and we can research great yeah John will have Clay's um email address at the end and then go to thatan is pointing out the application portal is not open um and asking if there's anything we can expect to be in there that's not currently available and I think the answer to that is you have everything you need and when the portal is open you should be able to just cut and paste things in right is that the that the plan clay exactly it's basically a Dropbox where you'll upload all of the documents um and then there'll be a series of like attestations or certifications that um that you are the authoriz a person authorized to submit the application there'll be a place for an electronic signature it really is just a way for us to have a portal where we can have an auditable deadline and not have any conf conf usion about when the submissions came in or any submissions possibly coming in after the deadline um but it don't need any of the meat or heart of the application is all on those documents that are already posted and available hi so um I'm going to go to Lisa's question because it relates to the portal and then I'll go back to Joshua's question so Lisa is just asking when the portal will open I believe that's as soon as possible but don't have a don't have a set deadline I would like to see it open in May um just to give people time to to sort it out and and take a look um but uh but we don't have a set date yet and generally like our thinking on this we we've had this happen in the past where our portal hasn't been open and that's why we kind of put together everything that you need to complete the application so that because in our experience you need to sort of like draft everything in a separate document to like have everybody review it that needs to review it and all of those things before you just kind of put cut and paste it into the portal in the end so the portal it's there's nothing there that you don't already have and the idea is really just so that we don't have to delay getting the money out the door to you all to do the projects that we know you want to get going as soon as possible because our it folks are not able to get to opening the portal right away so hopefully that makes sense and you agree that it it seems like the right approach to here's everything you need and then in the end the thing you just need to cut and paste to will be open and hopefully that will all um open in time for you to do it but we didn't want to like slow everything down right that's exactly right CH see the only thing is we won't even have any cut and pasting it this",

        "text": " a obviously uh unquestionably beautiful gorgeous state and there's a lot to protect here um but we are engaged in a battle um you know we we are in the ecosystem collapse prevention business now and the renewable developers um those that are seeking to facilitate decarbonization are are in the effort and engaged in a pretty challenging incredibly challenging effort to facilitate the decarbonization to present prevent entire ecosystems from collapsing and it is a sad uh truth that in oregon um but due to you know other land use laws that fsec did not write um but that you know limit the agricultural development of land and other states you know reduction of water use and development of farmland is favored and supported but in the state of oregon there are habitat impacts that are undeniably and unavoidable in achieving these other objectives which pains us to no end but is an unavoidable truth of the bigger job at hand and and these you know has memorialized in the statute and it's complex the gentleman before you know described these these issues um no doubt accurately and simultaneously the power line corridors and crook county um where we're familiar with and perhaps some others are have become the primary corridors for uh the antelope herds that move through and so uh you know it's complex but ultimately i think oregon has a lot of well-developed standards um but they should be moving in the direction of how to facilitate success and put in the context and including the relative overall benefit and further to that we would also encourage you know odo's staff and other legislative proceedings and rule makings at the lcd and wherever else you know to help bring testimony and resources in odo and in support of facilitating the ability of counties and other jurisdictions and in its own proceedings the imperative to balance these considerations as we ensure that these projects do get permitted and unable to move forward and be successfully invested in which has its own challenges as well so thank you very much appreciate it stevens uh do any members of the council have questions scene out of the room okay with that i do not see any other hands raised in webex i'll just make one final call if you'd like to provide comment on the protected area scenic resources or recreation standards please go ahead and raise your hand now you can do that by clicking on the participants button at the bottom of your screen and then clicking on the little hand okay and if you're on the phone you can press start three i am seeing no hands and nancy are you seeing any excellent okay um see no further comments i'll go ahead and reassess the hearing on the protected areas scenic resources and recreation standards rulemaking and move to our final rulemaking hearing tonight which is on wildfire prevention and risk mitigation as before i will just provide a quick background in procedural history on this before opening the floor to comments in august of 2020 the oregon public utility commission open rule making related to risk mitigation and planning for wildfire and in august 2020 that was part of a response to the uh governor's uh earlier executive order actually that may have been executive order 2004 as to address the wildfire risks and risk mitigation plans for oregon's electric utilities during the 2021 legislative session the legislature passed senate bill 762 which established new standards for electric utility wildfire plans uh required statewide risk analyses and also pre um created several new programs for wildfire mitigation both in terms of risk and health impacts adopted permanent rules for wildfire protection plans investor-owned utilities in december of 2021 and it's continuing to do supplemental rulemaking um the three investor owned electric utilities in oregon submitted their plans earlier this year and those were all approved uh oh sorry in december of 2022 and those were all approved just a month or so ago council is also conducting kind of its own rulemaking to establish wildfire protection and risk mitigation standards for energy facilities um as we all know and have heard several times climate change is increasing in both frequency and severity in um climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of wildfires in oregon and across the western united states um and there have been several catastrophic throughout the west that have been found to have been caused by electric infrastructure and there's also been documented cases of wildfire adder caused by renewable energy facilities and associated transmission lines which have raised concerns about fire safety the council started this rule making to find rules that would minimize the risk of a facility subject to the council's causing wildfire to ensure that there's sufficient programs and procedures in place ensure the protection of public health and safety in the event that there's wildfire at an energy facility site regardless of whether that was caused by the facility or not and third to maintain consistency with the rules adopted by the public utility commission to the extent possible um the council adopted or initiated this rule making back in october of 2021 we sent out a comment letter requesting comments from oregon's tribes in january and then also conducted a rulemaking workshop with um interested members of the public including several representatives of electric utilities we developed our proposals for proposed rules and brought that to you in may and the council did approve proposed rules and authorized issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking we issued that notice on june 1st so today is obviously the public hearing for this rulemaking the last day for public comment is july 1st at uh for written comment is july 1st at 5 00 um to give a quick summary of what is in these proposed rules the council is proposing to adopt a new standard which would require the council to find that an applicant has one has adequately characterized wildfire risk associated with a proposed facility when it receives an application and um second that it will that the council must find that the facility will be operated in compliance with a council approved wildfire mitigation plan um the proposed rules include a provision that allows the council to approve a facility without making those findings if the facility is subject to a wildfire protection plan approved by the public utility commission or a plan approved by the governing body of a consumer-owned utility um and then the pros rules also specified that the new standard would apply to the review of any new application for site certificate or request for amendment that was filed on or after the effective date of the permanent rules and by file we do mean filed as a complete application so i will go ahead and open the hearing on the wildfire prevention and risk mitigation rulemaking uh at this time if there's anybody that would wish to provide comment please go ahead and raise your hand oh and i'm sorry there is an incorrect date in this um the uh the the slide for those of you who can't see the slide uh says that we're in comments must be received by february 10. um that is not correct these uh written comments on this rule making will be accepted until july 21st 2021 at 5 pm uh thank you council councilmember okay so uh mr stevens i see i i we may be having the same issues uh if you would like to provide comment go ahead if not that's okay too but yeah same issue i i didn't click anything but um i'll since i'm here and i'm often not uh thank you for your work on this effort jake stevens new sun energy uh ceo for the record which develops renewable energy facilities um i think we'll further review these but i think as as you're considering comments one comment i would have is um that particularly for solar facilities um the contribution to fire um uh reduction and wildfire risk from basically creating large fire breaks uh is something that should be considered sincerely credited um and included in sort of in context as as how these rules work and how applications are considered and i would also um recommend that that be considered in the context of wildlife mitigation you know under the direct have sec permit applications for those facilities as well as we've talked to the wildlife biologists in the districts that we're working in there's recognition that uh you know fire breaks uh have the ability to prevent the entire ecosystem from burning down um you know in these large large value valleys and i've actually literally driven home from a permit hearing in harding county as the world was on fire and watched that occur and those brush fires just go and go and go until they run out of fuel and so large fire breaks including the setbacks from in front of fences and other are actually potentially mitigation opportunities to protect the existing habitat and also contribute to the objectives uh i think this rule making is focused on so um i mean that may not be spot on in terms of what the the rules are that you're proposing um but happy to consider that further and just wanted to put that in context is something that's come up in our discussions with odfw and others that are thinking about ways to protect the landscape from the same issues as well as the wildlife habitat mr stevens any clarifying questions see none uh thank you so much uh i see jim kreider has his hand up mr kreider can you hear me sorry i don't know if you could hear me yes we can hear you please go out jim okay thanks i saw you unmuted me so i just wanted to make sure um i i have more or less of a general comment that is more or less a as i've been listening to this people have commented but we really haven't had a dialogue or an exchange of ideas with the council because they're not engaging in a dialogue or asking questions we don't understand what the council is thinking what their minds are how they're looking at this and i find it interesting and kind of impossible to do rule making because we don't have a dialogue we do not know what the council thinks we do not what they think uh is important when i've been to meetings usually the people on the panel ask questions of the people that are presenting i feel like why come to a rule hearing like this when there's no questions just submit a written comment it's it's extremely frustrating to go to decision makers on important issues like and there is not a dialogue with the public which makes me think sometimes maybe everybody's mind's made up before they come to the room because when i am on a council like this i read the material and i ask questions and i'm just not seeing that in this particular rule making today and i would like to express my frustration with the and i thank you very much and i'd love to take",

we get further data and information I will say one thing I'm surprised most time but I'll say one thing uh it's really a and it's for the public not for the sport it's really heartening to see that this board is taking that topic on this isn't a pleasant topic I mean nobody would like to have to deal with this big nut but we have to and I've not seen any wavering and any flinching at all like the full disclosure full valuation so I I think the public should understand that we're we're doing the job that needs to be done I mean this isn't we could do like everybody else and say well I thought it failed and we'll go off for a bond but we're trying to plan and it's a lot different so I don't know that's I'm sorry no no need to apologize we're all in this together and trying to sort our way through all righty well I may be going over five minutes we'll see first uh I want to mention in the constituent report the letter that we received from various community-based organizations on arpa um there will be I'm having a uh meeting with the parties of that letter along with Ms Angie uh hopefully Ms Tillman if and acas uh and we'll get back to you on um also in the constituent report is a really lovely email from the direct the new director of the Department of Environmental Quality introducing herself to us which is a really nice I meant to start my first item with clean water services made my morning uh as as you all had the opportunity to hear in our really great learning session last week uh we had the opportunity to tour the field Ops building and uh I am prone as I'm driving to work in the morning uh seeing the field Ops crews in their trucks and waving at them wildly uh and uh I had that very same experience today with one of the big water vehicles that we saw and I approached it from behind and saw the one water cycle and I thought oh I wonder if that's a clean water services track and of course lo and behold it was so I got to pass it rolled down my window and gave it the thumbs up and used my rear wiper you know yes I am silly but I'm very proud of the work they do so I thought I saw the sheriff depart deputies about natural the crazy yes I urge that didn't I very much this um on uh the AOC legislative committee and the board of directors so there were uh from each of the different steering committees we did I did ask to pull or others did a couple of bills for further discussion versus past uh as a slate and uh one of them was I can't remember the bill number now though the one with regard to uh requiring this is on the word requiring counties to provide a five-year property tax exemption for single-family homes that are redeveloped into uh duplex Triplex and quad plexus great idea I would have preferred that it be enabling versus requiring and uh it turned out to be a fun discussion because I I asked to pull it from the agenda made my case and then Douglas County Commissioner Tim Freeman spoke up and said that he couldn't believe it but for the first time perhaps ever he was agreeing with me so I guess having uh you know our two County descriptions are somewhat different so he surprised himself so there was much teasing there about who owes who oh who's a beer who owes who a beer for that one Catherine lost no I think I offered anyway uh you don't drink beer beer I know I offer I do for I think which leads to my second item oh uh I'll come back to one more but I want to make sure I get this in um and that is the legislative Retreat and the board of directors Retreats are happening in September um in the as usual the county of the AOC president so they'll be in Klamath uh and the ledge Retreat is Friday November 22nd and the board of directors Retreat is Saturday the 23rd that following weekend is our departure for weftec in Chicago so um it just amazes me how my calendar's filling up all the way to the end of the well what if you said November didn't she no no I was here in November I was thinking wow that's really late and then hey dates I could have said November instead of September but um yeah no worries I know I'm still adjusting to the fact that whoa It's so uh also with regard to all of that with the legislative committee uh is airing here yes uh if Aaron could come up to the table I received um uh communication from one of the AOC officers one of the bills that we pulled off of the Slate uh let me back up usually a steering committee uh makes a recommendation to the ledge committee and advances that first slate any commissioner who has a position at the ledge committee can ask to pull one of those off of the Slate one of those was Senate Bill 348 which is related to measure 114 and guns and there was much discussion the steering committee had recommended that we take no position on which was in line with the organization choosing to not take positions on bills that might that are divisive that could pull the organization membership apart so we had that discussion again at the ledge committee had a number of motions and the long and short of it is that we directed that that bill go back to that committee uh for further discussion so AOC has no position that I received a text from one of the AOC officers asking what we would be doing with regard to that bill and this is where for your discussion I wanted to make sure Aaron's up at the table we don't have a position on this as the board of directors which follows um our operating practice that if it's a bill that uh doesn't directly affect us and is you know we can choose to take no and that's where things stand and I would say let's continue with that on this bill other commissions who feel very strongly still have the right to advocate for what they want and even individual Commissioners here once they make it clear that our board position is no position you each have your right to articulate your individual position that's the role of an elected official so anyway getting too long-winded uh do any of you have any comments questions and that includes you Miss Doyle that's the house bill number uh it's a Senate bill 748. and this it makes changes to the the sorry good morning everyone Aaron told your senior government relations manager um the the bill itself changes what was um instituted under measure 114 of um by changing some specific things we I have not dug deep into the bill with the two things that I've paid attention to or any um ability to cover the cost of our Sheriff's Department um the bill has an increase in the permit fee um and then the potential for any liabilities for the actions that we might take and there is some concern about the number of appeals that are possible and the cost to our general our general counsel's office in that area so why are we not taking a position um I don't I think it's in our interest to stay focused on those bills that we really need to get past and uh this is an area where I know our legislators are some of them are quite immersed in gun legislation and I'm not sure that it's a good use of our limited time and energy to venture into this space so and Inter we can always speak to costs as part of our principles but not take a stance on the The Measure itself um and represent the county and the conversation in that manner I guess that's what I was focused on was the two items that you just touched on is the concerns that we absolutely have so can we stay focused on that and not get immersed in the the whole legislation thing that's based upon the discussion at both the steering committee and the ledge committee that's we can make that our staff can make that attempt but in the realm of the conversation those points really get at the AOC committee was a very challenging conversation with the principles around measure 114 I think that your gr staff has the ability to walk into a room and say regardless of what you're doing we need to make sure that the county is kept whole yeah absolutely yeah okay yeah so it's just a choice about it energy and so forth but yeah sharing facts not a problem yeah um thank you thank you Aaron um also related to legislators uh I had my somewhat occasional meeting with representative Susan McLean who uh gave me an update on the interstate Bridge today's Tuesday so she was expecting that a bill would be dropping today uh paralleling Washington State's work uh with regard to getting one billion dollars out of the session and uh having a bonding package that would keep the step the state step whole and untouched and as I understand it that will involve a bonding 250 million per bet by it biennium for each of the four upcoming bienniums so 2023 would be that one billion dollar uh in order to get in the federal funding queue so those bonding bills um follow uh by the end of the session um and there will be aware as statement with regard to the projects that are still to be completed from House Bill 2017 so there's no abandonment of um and then there will need to be follow-up with a package in 2025 as well as some work with 2020 interim and there's also going to be some uh coverage about heavy vehicles and light um and taking a look back at EVS as well as moving forward separately is conversations or work on bridge tolling I-5 and Abernathy so they're following through and completing these steps to get the interstate Bridge Project done is certainly in I think in Washington County's interest in the regional interest and so I asked her if it would be helpful for us to write a letter of support you know essentially just thanking them or doing the work to move forward with getting Federal funding for that important project not a letter that would go into design of this that and the other things but thank you for just moving it forward I chose though to not have something drafted up for consideration here because I thought it would be better to just take the",

        "text": " she cited and we think that this under the circumstances should motivate this council to send this issue back for further analysis by the administrative law just in a further hearing on these detailed scientific issues i'm happy to answer any questions if you have any thank you carl i didn't get your last name anuta anuta any questions of mr okay thank you uh thank you again this is jocelyn pease for idaho power for the record dr foudy raised many issues in her exceptions filing and idaho power fully addressed these issues in its responsive all this focus on several of the key arguments that dr faudi had made in her exceptions filing and attempt to address in in the short time the number a number of the issues that mr anuta had also first in her exceptions filing dr fowdy argues that idaho power should have addressed additional soil properties in its analysis regarding the soil protection standard in support of this argument dr fowdy emphasized language in the standard regarding impacts to soils including but not limited to erosion and chemical factors such as salt deposition from cooling towers land application of liquid effluent and chemical spills dr faudi urges that the council should the phrase including but not limited to expansively however idaho power explained in its briefing that when applying oregon principles of statutory interpretation to discern the intent behind the regulation it is clear that the scope of the standard is limited to the common characteristic between the specific examples in the standard consequently the general term impact to soils must be interpreted considering the commonality between the specific terms of the regulation and this was a point that mr ratcliff had also pointed out in his remarks on the other hand in her analysis dr faudi had provided no legal basis for her interpretation of the soil protection standard instead it is simply to satisfy her opinion that the soil properties listed in her issue statement are necessary to satisfy the standard furthermore dr faudi's request to evaluate additional soil properties is essentially an academic exercise idaho power's expert witness addressed this issue during cross-examination explaining at length that dr faudi's requests are not consistent with industry standards and that idaho power and others are not expected to perform the academic research project level of analysis that dr fowdy demands but rather the project evaluation must conform to industry standards which rely on agency issued guidance documents and best management practices or bmps second dr faudi claims that idaho power's analysis was not sufficiently granular however there is no evidence in the record that supports dr faudi's claim that compliance with the soil protection standard requires a more granular analysis or that a more granular analysis would would result in any new or different mitigation measures or bmps to achieve compliance with the standard and in fact the level of data that idaho power provided is consistent with the other applications that have come before the council contrary to dr faudi's assertions idaho power committed to performing mitigation in connection with potential impact to soils idaho power will conduct construction activities in accordance with oregon environmental laws and permits including the erosion and settlement control plan that accompanies the odeq issued 1200 c permit and the reclamation and revegetation plan which will be reviewed by the oregon department of agriculture and the oregon department of fish and wildlife idaho power will work closely with these agencies during the preparation and implementation of these plans now in response to mr anita's assertion that the analysis had failed to address dynamic soil properties like compaction in fact the issues around compaction are addressed through the reclamation plan the reclamation plan provides an explanation of how idaho power will treat the soils following construction which will include in some cases ripping the soil and working to re-vegetate the landscape and the best determination as to whether this mitigation will be successful will be the the revegetation efforts idaho power is bound to monitor the success of those revegetation efforts and if they aren't working to perform adaptive management and so those measures that are already in place will in fact ensure that that mitigation is accomplished for the regarding mr nude's assertion about documents that were excluded the way that worked was in the contested case there's a portion that's dedicated to developing an evidentiary record and then that record closes and there's briefing and after the close of the evidentiary record no one else is allowed to put more evidence into the record it's closed and then folks can argue the merits of the evidence on and so what mr anuta is referring to or documents that doctor foughty had attempted to put into the record late in the fight late in the proceeding after the close of the evidentiary record and those documents are properly excluded thank you msps are there any questions just a few comments on behalf of the department patrick crowe the department of justice uh the thrust of dr faudi's argument seems to be that idaho power's application is not complete she argues idaho power should have conducted you know several different types of analyses that it did not uh which mr anuta listed and ms ps also council has rigorous requirements for approval of a site certificate including with regard to compliance with its soil protection but in making her arguments dr faudi is setting a bar for approval that is even higher than what is required in law and in council's rules the rules in division 21 council's rules that govern what information must be included in an application the rules about soils don't require analysis of the items that dr faudi is suggesting as has been discussed the only specific items addressed in the rule are erosion and whether there are chemical factors related to operation of the facility that could adversely impact soils idaho power conducted those analyses second council can find as we've discussed throughout the evening can find compliance with one of its standards based not just on the information in an but also on conditions that council we have mr ratcliffe and ms p's referenced couple of those conditions i'll point them out uh and i think i'm probably going to overlap at least in one or two of these with what mr ratcliffe and ms p said but would point your attention to soil protection conditions one and two those would minimize erosion and soil impacts those are on pages 97 and 99 of the proposed order and actually i'm not going to give you the page references because there are two different ways to reference the pages which i won't bore you with but at any rate soil protection conditions one and two land use condition 14 in fish and wildlife habitat conditions 1 and three would also ensure that temporary soil impacts are restored post-construction that's one that i think mr ratcliff mentioned soil protection condition three that has the erosion best management practices under the 1200 c which mr anuta referenced fish and wildlife habitat conditions 1 and 3 include very detailed pre-construction assessments landowner consultation ongoing treatment and monitoring during the first five years and also assessment for long-term obligations so in short i think the two points that i'd like you to take away are one dr faudi's asking for analyses that go beyond what the council's rules require and there are conditions that the department has recommended that will address soil impacts council member continent i'm curious um about the five year the monitoring goes for five years and then what happened what what's the what's the timing after that does the let me kick this one over to kellen or reclamation and revegetation is viewed as short-term and so it's typical to set a five-year milestone where there is more aggressive monitoring and treatment and restoration in that first five years and but then for this plan under that condition at the five-year mark then based on evaluation of the first five years they'll develop a long-term monitoring plan and it might be different for certain areas it's everything is going to be quite specific for various segments but so it will be a large long-term plan with different levels of monitoring depending on the success of the first five years so just to follow up on that so because is or as i understand it it's going to constructed in phases so will each of those phases have a five a five year monitoring time frame i guess i guess i imagined it to be that the line would become operational at one point in time while it might be phased in operation i think there's going to be one point in time when the full line goes in operation that that starts to trigger the operational monitoring now many of these plans have construction requirements as well so there'll be a different set of actions that are happening during construction that are really like treatment avoidance monitoring control but then that's different than restoration and that's during construction right right as opposed to when construction is finished right so many of these plans have a multi-temporal component where they have to do pre-construction assessment construction activities and then short and long-term monitoring thank you thank you miss esterson okay so we're ready now to is the council have a different we've got the proposed order we've got the proposed um exception wait contested case order do we have differences on those two are we ready to have todd call the rule on that so so this is well go ahead cindy yeah so um i don't have any objections to the proposed contested case order because i believe that um what was being asked of idaho power was beyond the industrial standard the goal is to meet the soil protection standard and i think with the various plans that that are required under the conditions i that they adequately address that so i don't have any problems with the proposed contest case order or the proposed order where's the rest of the any difference of opinion on that council condon right councilmember condon um i have um some concern about the um most current science being used or not being used as someone might say um and i'm sorry i don't have it up in front of me but uh is there a requirement a condition that requires survey prior to construction it seems like there there was related to this soil protection and it wasn't clear to me if if that speaks to that most current information available or best available science i would hope we're using the best available science and most current and so i'm just curious if now we're you know the project is ready there is there a survey that's sure that the standard requires that cindy i'm not sure that the standard requires that i'm not either i i'm wondering if it does",

        "text": " utilities adopt one CBI for each of the following topic areas resiliency health and Community well-being environmental impacts energy Equity economic benefits so just alignment between these and then what the program priorities are for burgers Lane system there's been some conversation around that but yeah if anybody would like to come off from you um you're welcome to raise your hand and provide feedback virtually as well still Public Power or the investor and Utilities Fall um for large retailers we said it is the three items plus give it to one essay and Retail Academy West is that it depends still particularly something I think it's interesting something can you take Christina off mute for an opportunity to win it's beginning to wonder if it was functioning can you hear me clearly yes hi Christina hi this is Christina Medina calling in from Pacific Court thanks for the opportunity to kind of be in this space with you um we're very enthusiastic about any conversations around Community benefits particularly when we're talking about finding opportunities to calibrate and reach shared understanding um around them so you know I put in the chat some reference to some order numbers that really are a bit of our Guiding Light in the state of Oregon obviously they're they're born from HP 2021 and they're really elements that serve you know the clean energy plan and really making sure that once we adapt for the future that we are trying to mitigate any harmful impacts to the communities that we serve and so a good um amount of work for us here at the utility is really spent in creating those spaces for you know genuine and meaningful input from our customers and communities and through advisory groups and we've actually developed quite a few um and in those advisory groups we're able to kind of bring forward uh maybe some fundamental approaches in each one of these categories that we've listed here is cbis as a starting point by which we might build out um you know what might be a longer strategy to even more enhance and meaningful helpfulness what would be incredibly helpful is if there was a greater alignment from the the smaller facility groups that are not necessarily beholden to this legislation for them to actually kind of start to maybe see some of these cbis and see these areas because we are in in stakeholder groups where there's a significant Delta between you know what we're offering and delivering um so 50 cbis and what kinds of outcomes we're looking to deliver compared to basically what feels like no expectation or you know Municipal Utilities at this point and so we are having community members that are maybe receiving services from those municipals that are saying Hey I want to be a part of this system I want greater Equity I have some concerns I want to be a part of some of these things but they can be experience that type of equity so I think if we were to surface any opportunity I think that is one where we might have some level setting there and then two um with respect to the resilience topic which is obviously top of mind for many of us we clearly understand that there's a a real challenge with regard to you know communities living in The Last Mile climate impacts and other things air quality and whatnot but resilience hubs are obviously top of mind for a lot of communities we think there's some initiatives there in that space but um we start to have that conversation in the community we start off with the basics you know measuring outages the frequency and duration you start to build those into our maps and then we overlay census tract data and then also we start to include our own survey information so we're really starting to try to find ways to get enough enough of a lens to make a decision that's going to be more impactful and to Foster greater equity in their community so it's been it's been a great process for us it's challenged us to think outside of you know the norm collaborating or the past operating processes and systems and I think it's been really healthy it's challenged us to receive feedback from community members and try to understand whether or not it is something that can be used to be to force or drive an adaptation and the way we approach things and also it builds a I think a robust internal Community here at Pac where we have greater empathy and understanding for our customers for example we don't typically call them repairs anymore so we're very thoughtful about our approach with our communities and anyway it's part of a larger narrative so anything we can do to support the efforts here whether it be meeting separately to share some of our approaches we're happy to do it right about the ramble but it's an important topic for us I guess I might just give a Counterpoint on that you know we're not as cous we're not subject to the puc's oversight and um the community energy plan requirements of House Bill 2021 so you know our local governing boards work with our communities on these topics so um I guess I just offer that as a Counterpoint we're happy to look at you know some of the thinking that's going on over at the puc and we do on occasion um I would not want the department of energy to make um standards for this program comparable to what the ilus have to do because that that doesn't necessarily work for us so I just put that out there well I I would definitely I think the thing to keep in mind too is the scale um in comparing there's so much larger than they have the resources and they have capabilities and the staff to be able to do something which responsibility of wanting to do some of these programs for very small and we refer our numbers as members because they want us and we do calling rate wearers and also helps to remind us they're the ones with paying bills it's not meant to be negative it's easier when you're discovering good for a members customers to use it generalized from those terms but it's just it's just different it's you know Christina brings up a lot of great points and they're uh we probably do that so members that want to be involved and some of the things that may be like uh these very large believersion we just don't have a camera yeah it might be something we recognized and then we are working those reactions to to to to get better at that we don't fall we don't fall under the same guidelines either yeah I think I mean they go through a very rigorous process and in some cases the Ohio use Blazer Trail in California from you know it's important I mean as far as we in our local office Roseburg behalf of our one there worked here and vice versa and we're love working with regularly we've worked with your mom in San barter down in the rosary work with him for great folks I want to just we're just so I know that Gail Malcolm is with us and she had a really great project that I was hoping to hear from Gail and we'll move this along to get to the actual to other people okay so let's go over three more stories five minutes max and then we can move on this is Brooke can you hear me sounds good okay uh so I will drop into the chat um how PGE has taken a look at the cbis that Christina was talking about this is an iterative process so you know as we continue to engage with our community and the POC and other stakeholders this will continue to evolve but I think to the point that some of the cous we're talking about in terms of scale and scope and how do you operationalize that there are some good I think lessons in terms of you know some of the smaller things that may be able to be incorporated as smaller utilities are looking that aren't you know big large-scale Monumental things that take a lot of Staff time so I will drop that into the chat and just for kind of awareness purposes I wanted to briefly touch on the Workforce Development side of things and that's something that we've really taken as a priority for us and really looked at ways in which we can help build the workforce pipeline and really leverage you know the projects that we are doing so for projects obviously our own Workforce is doing some of the projects when we contract out we're looking at things like requiring prevailing wage and looking at Apprentice utilization thinking through ways in which we can partner with pre-apprenticeship programs we have our own pre-apprenticeship program for lineman and then looking at other Partnerships with other pre-apprenticeship programs so thinking a little bit broader Beyond just the actual project that you're working on but working in a more cohesive way for how we can build the workforce pipeline because that benefits community in a broader and a more long-term way so PGE also convened a Statewide Coalition last year around building the clean energy Workforce Coalition and I'm happy to follow up with anybody who would like more information on that we some of you uh on the call and in the room are participating in that but I'll put my information down as well so I just wanted to throw that little plug in about kind of thinking broader about Workforce broadly thank you bro yeah be right there can you guys hear us Stacy would it be possible to Pivot over to Gail and give her an opportunity to to speak to them on this hi I was hoping to be there in person but I ran into a car accident and I got turned around so I'm on the side of the road someplace safe so in terms of central Lincoln's um one of the projects we had thought about was something we call the cape perpetua project and it has it's a um a 14 Mile Stretch of distribution and fiber line that runs on the ridge above Highway 101 so it's it gets a lot of wind in the winter and um it's in the South National Forest and it's in the cape perpetua Scenic area and it's high up and to get to most of the sections of the line we have to helicopter in or get there by foot when we have an outage and we do have outages on that particular line because it's so so uh we're wanting to do a joint project with Pioneer who is also running um and uses our polls and and moving all that infrastructure down to Highway 101 um underground so it's an undergrounding project on its face but there's lots of community benefits and um first of all we'd be moving the distribution and fiber lines out of the national forest and the scenic area it returns where we do have roads it returns that habitat and public lands to its original use it eliminates the risk of wildfire and storm-related outages um it'll certainly enhance reliability of

or uh wrote that down wrong i think it's 300 feet maybe 340 megawatts of wind 260 megawatts of solar i may have flipped that and 120 megawatts of battery storage the facility is proposed in northwest umatilla county uh nolan hills wind llc is the site certificate or applicant they are a subsidiary of capital power so the draft proposed order public hearing will occur at the next council on thursday may 26th starting at 5 30 p.m and that will be at the red lion in pendleton and kate sloan is the project lead for that project so we sent that to council as well so all of the details associated with the dpo are available to you as well as the application materials are all on our website any questions before i move to the other next project next one is the statelined wind project we just received the request for amendment number seven so the project is an operational wind energy facility consisting of two geographic units state line one and two and van sickle two state line one and two is composed of a hundred and six 186 turbines with a peak generating capacity of 123 megawatts and then ben sickle two unit consists of 45 wind turbines with a peak generating capacity of 119 megawatts the project is located in north umatilla county the certificate holder is nextera energy resources llc so amendment number seven is specific to the van sickle two unit the 45 turbines uh if you recall council recently approved amendment number six to re-power that facility and battery since that approval the certificate holder has reevaluated some of the specifications associated with the repowering um and has determined that they need to make some changes related to the minimum above ground blade tip clearance and the hub height associated with those wind turbines that were approved for re-powering under amendment 6. so it's really if they had known that during amendment 6 they could have included that because but because there's some alteration um it is really just sort of a continuation of amendment 6 if you want to think about it that way and we just received well along with that amendment request they have requested type b review as well so we have uh the amendment determination request and we since we just received those we are just beginning to evaluate them sorry gotta move a little bit my lights are going off there we go sorry about that um okay uh there's a oregon public utility commission rulemaking that we wanted to make you aware of on march 31st the oregon puc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for changes to its rules regarding certificates of public convenience and necessity so these are typically referred to as cpcns and these are included in their rules at oregon administrative rule chapter 860 division zero two four so a cpcn is an additional approval needed for the construction of an overhead transmission line that condemnation of land so if all of the land owners where the transmission line are going to go are willing sellers of an easement then a cpcn would not be needed but if there landowners who are not willing to provide that easement to enter into an agreement with whatever the company is to provide that easement then the cpcn is what grants that sort of condemnation authority so well it doesn't grant condemnation authority but it serves as evidence in a condemnation proceeding that the transmission line is public use and necessary for public convenience so sort of a step to allow the utility go through that those condemnation so the proposed rule changes revise and expand requirements for filing a cpcn they clarify and distinguish the review criteria and clarify the process that the puc will use to ensure that the pros proposed transmission line will be in compliance with statewide planning goals and so specifically for the proposed rules provide that the puc will accept a cpcn petition while the council's review of an application is ongoing but will not take final action until a council has issued a site certificate so to kind of explain that a little bit um you know our process takes some time the cpcn process takes some time and and then ultimately if they want to go through those eminent domain proceedings those take some time so the proposal is prior to the conclusion of a site certificate by fsec that the utility could start the process with the puc because again it takes some so it gets them ahead of the process but the puc won't conclude because i think one of the issues there is there's no guarantee what the conclusion of the council will be and so they certainly issue a cpcn prior to fsec decision because they don't know what ultimately would be approved or denied uh based upon an fsec site certificate so this is these rules haven't been looked at for some time and that's why the public utility commission is looking at them now so next tuesday the 26th the poc will hold a special meeting to discuss the rules um and then later on i believe at 1 or 1 30 that day they will have a public hearing they will also have a second public hearing on may 24th and then the last day to provide comments will be june 7th so if council members are interested in learning more about this we'd be happy to put an agenda item on so we can walk through this in a little more detail that i'm providing today but if you are interested in that please let us know and like i said we can we can add that agenda item and walk through a little more detail as to what the proposals are anyone have any opinions on that at this time this is chair grill this is hanley i'd like to see it on our agenda for may yeah this uh this this is cindy sorry no um and i agreed like it on the agenda and i just want to make sure that i'm clear on it so the puc process really doesn't have any impact on our process that our process has impact on the on what the puc is doing is that um well i would say for the cpcn that is a correct uh evaluation but but i would make um alter a little bit the question uh because um so for a transmission line like boardman hemingway we have a need standard council has a need standard for transmission lines and pipelines so in order for there are two two standards that a transmission line could meet to meet the need standard is the lease cost plan rule and then the second is the system reliability rule the lease cost plan rule essentially the rules allow for council to rely upon determination by the public utility commission that the project is needed so that's paraphrasing a little bit and sort of minimizing it so so for mormon hemingway as an example one of i mean they've made arguments that they meet both of those rules but they're relying upon integrated resource plan that they have approved by the oregon public utility commission which says the boardman hemingway project is you know effectively probably not approved is not the right term but acknowledged for construction in the irp for the pc that allows us to use to rely upon that as uh justifying that that's that particular uh standard is met or at least that portion of the standard is met so there is some integration between us and the oregon puc where you know they go first we go second they go third and so these all kind of interrelate and maybe during our may presentation we can walk through that um part of it a little more clearly as well thank you hopefully that wasn't uh too confusing the way i described marcy this is halloween yes neily todd um i thought i think you mentioned that part of the rule changes proposed by the puc is compliance with the statewide planning goals are they going to depend on us to do that evaluation uh no um i don't know maybe chris if you want to chris has tracked this rule making a little more than i have i don't know if you have a response to that chris if i don't have a good response to that right now um council member james can you just maybe something be prepared to talk to that in more detail in may yeah council member jenkins i can say i believe that their rules already um require the puc to find compliance with the statewide planning goals before they issue a cpcn uh for an upset jurisdictional facility they would be relying on the site certificate to demonstrate that under i think both the existing and the current and the proposed rules for local jurisdictional they're they're they currently rely on land use approvals issued by the county and i think there are some changes to the proposals and how that works um in this rulemaking i think one of the can one of the issues that they're struggling with is some counties require all landowners to be signatories to the application in order for a project to move forward and so that puts the utility a little bit in a bind if not all the land owners have signed on to the application they're trying to resolve that catch 22 is can that project move forward you those signatures from a local uh you know on the local land use application and then are they going to be in a position to make a determination of compliance with lane use goals versus say a county or city who in their language decision effectively has you know made that determination of compliance because you know assuming that they approve a transmission line you know their lane use ordinances you know if not you know specifically then indirectly um are already in compliance with the goals so but we can address that a little more clearly and specifically when we come back in may and do that presentation all right and lastly is the may council meeting so i'd already brought this up a couple of times but the next council meeting is may 26th and this will be a hybrid meeting meeting it will be both in person and webex so as i mentioned that we'll be conducting the draft proposed order for",

        "text": " of the the reservation and we want to just kind of ensure that that isn't kind of a limiting factor for um low moderate income customers and low-income service providers accessing the program Thanks James hopefully that helps with the answer to that question um so we uh you're off mute I know you also went ahead in the chat but go ahead you're off me awesome thank you so much I think this is a really great program in terms of solar and storage and I was really excited about when it was first released a couple years ago um the unfortunate thing is you know I I took a deep dive into trainings I'm just a resident in southwest Portland I try to get solar and storage installed at my house in southwest Portland and um at that time Tesla had been a contractor in one of the approved contractors but since quit at the time that I was exploring solar in storage and what I found was that all the local Portland area contractors were anywhere from 25 to 30 percent higher than the most price competitive bid which was Tesla and when I looked at the numbers um difference was really uh still very even after accounting for the incentive and so um you know I I messaged uh James kogel this but I think that um many contractors at least when I was looking for solar and storage did not use the incentive to reduce the cost to the consumer when you look at it from the macro scale in terms of like what's the most price competitive and therefore did not pass on savings to customers what ended up happening was that the bids would go um the kind of much higher than uh kind of a price competitive bids of a non-participating contractor and that price was brought down to marginally competitive using the incentive and so I guess what I'm saying is that I'm not really surprised that this is happening because of just how involved industry Lobby is and and creating the um not only the the bill itself but involved in the rulemaking I think a more customer-centric way would be for the incentive to follow customers who can then use that incentive to shop around obviously that's not how the bill is written and that's not the under the purview of the rulemaking but I do think there's space in rule making to ensure to make sure that these funds are being used and passed on to improve access to solar and storage for customers but again I think right now if you were to do an audit of approved systems um and kind of what's available in terms of price competitive solar and Storage you'll see that um many contracts are um passing savings on to customers they're just basically padding the bottom line of these uh contracts which um as a end user I found disappointing and as a taxpayer I find um slightly unethical so I just wanted to provide that testimony because you know it got kind of this dismissive email from James Cole saying that um you know that it really wasn't under the preview of the rule making but um process to kind of uh but you know in terms of that comment but I think it is again because you know the legislative imperative is um this These funds should be to reduce the overall cost of solar and storage for the End customer and again my experience is that it has not been that well I really appreciate you coming and sharing that perspective today and I think we take it seriously that we want ensure that what you're talking about is not happening to the extent we can within the constraints of the existing which sounds a little like I don't love seeing that but I don't even I'd have to like look to see what what we can do I will say that there's new solar dollars coming from the federal government and there's new dollars for Energy Efficiency and those um grants applications so far have sort of included asking us like what our plans are to make sure that that's not what's happening because it is a major concern that um that folks could take advantage of the program to increase their bottom lines versus reducing reducing costs for customers so it's definitely something we have on our minds and I really appreciate you bringing it up today and all that if anyone else has anything they want to add go for it but I think that we're listening we hear you and um as we look at the rules we can see if there's anything there that we can change or tweak on that thank you so much I really appreciate that and just to hammer home the point had the incentive actually been effective at what it purported to do I would have solar and storage installed my house instead I don't um and so at least there's an N1 resident taxpayer potential customer who um uh you know I'm Savvy enough where I know where I'm not getting a good deal and when I got bids that span from you know forty thousand dollars up to a hundred thousand dollars for the same solar and storage system I know that there are some contractors who are taking advantage of the system and it was disappointing to see how just how prevalent that problem was so thank you um I will just say that Garrett there's somebody that Garrett who keeps chatting to like either privately or now he's to all panelists so let me he has a note for you I'm just gonna put it in and chat everyone he's saying he'd love to discuss with you offline I think he might be a contractor um okay Garrett also asked if there have been any discussions on removing the cap not to Pivot too much but going back to that question um there were discussions about removing the cap I think that uh lower volume contractors had concerns about that and that's my understanding that it remains sort of an area where there wasn't like um so by by moving the needle but still keeping the reservation cap might help preserve that balance that allows for the more mom-and-pop shops to continue to utilize the program and James feel free to weigh in if I'm misstating what we heard some of our smaller contractors that had a concern there Garrett no need to unmute and good luck with the kiddo you're doing great I'm using the chat um so I will just read aloud what's in the chat in case that's not accessible to everyone I know we've got a couple folks on the phone um from the industry perspective this is from Angela Crowley cook at osia solar contractors know that not everyone is participating in the rebate program and they need to be cost competitive and so it seems unlikely that they'd use the rebate to pad their bottom line in addition the Energy Trust keeps track of the cost to install solar and Oregon and they did not see an increase in cost when the rebate was introduced so perhaps that's helpful evidence I don't know much about the Tesla situation um so I can't maybe explain why they're more affordable than others but it could also be related to them just just being um but but I don't I don't know the answer but I just wanted to at least had to stay there and I'll show you saying the um solar Market is very opaque and even a cost-conscious engineer's last position had a hard time comparing Apples to Apples I hear that I work with Oregon Department of energy and spend a lot of time thinking about how to make everything easier on consumers and overall it's just an interesting and like with Energy Efficiency too it's just interesting and we passed we helped pass the Bill during session to create sort of a One-Stop shop on Energy Efficiency for now where a bunch of federal funding is coming into the state to help make it easier for folks and I'd love to see that expansea renewable energy too down the road to provide some sort of tips and there's a lot of really good information at the Energy Trust website too um I don't see any hands up and I don't see any more chats for now um there's an ETO report on the cost of solar Trends in Oregon that somebody put a link to in the chat if that's helpful for that conversation and then we'll just sort of sit in awkward silence so just in case we get any hands raised or any more um comments it looks like the link didn't work let me try something and see if I can open it by cutting out some of the extra pieces there Carolyn they're talking about the link a Energy Trust report on the cost of that sort of aimed to take a look at the impact of rebates yeah I was able to access it by cutting out that Chrome piece so I'll put a clean Link in here that worked for me all right so just checking in it's still not see any new hands up up so you want to get back on and please let me know if I'm oh yeah I'll show you I'm so sorry to belabor to this point but I think the information that in the industry and Energy Trust of Oregon uh has provided is interesting but again doesn't answer the doesn't even ask the um what is the outcome of uh these rebates and how they impact costs because you know you would expect costs to decrease with time and economies of um and just to show that there's no increase doesn't um show that the rebate has uh no like doesn't have the unintended consequence of uh not getting to the end consumer I think in order to answer the question which is you just need to have a lot straw buyers like me who are considering solar and then Tesla there are some other larger companies that may not participate in the odoe's improved solar contractor list and then just compare like what's price competitive and um my hope is that you know now two years you know after I had searched um contractors are more price competitive but I think what you'll find is that um you know Tesla and large companies that have economies of scale are much more price competitive than kind of smaller contractors not to say that's not wrong to support local contractors and local businesses that have higher operating costs and don't have the same economies of scale but again I think it's following point two costs haven't gone up therefore the program is not um padding contractor bottom lines I I think that that data does not support the conclusion that's implied um because I think I can even today if I were to look at solar and storage from Tesla I doubt there's single contract in the Portland metro area that can beat that cost even with these incentives thanks for continuing to advocate for this I don't want to be in the position of Defending it or not or whatever so um but I will just say thank you for continuing to share the thoughts and I think there's some more chats um that you seem to be reading just fine so um maybe just one on",

        "text": "good afternoon everyone just want to do a sound check jen or stacey can you hear i'm good great super well um good afternoon my name is janine benner i'm the director of the oregon department of energy and um i see we've still got some people joining the call so i'll give folks just a few more minutes to sign on and we will get started in just a moment thanks for being here all right well we're three minutes past the hour so i think we can probably go ahead and get started um welcome everyone to this oregon department of energy webinar where we'll be sharing information about the energy-related provisions of the infrastructure investment and jobs act and seeking information from you as to how we can best shape our efforts to direct those resources to benefit my name is janine benner i'm the director of the oregon department of energy and i really appreciate you for joining today very soon i will be turning this over to jen center who is our federal grants coordinator to lead the conversation and i'm also introduced excuse me i'm also joined by a few additional odo staff today and i will ask them to introduce themselves in the chat and actually i'd welcome all of the attendees in our meeting today to introduce yourselves in the chat as well with your name and if you're representing any particular organization we'd love to know who's with us on the call today so i want to start off by acknowledging that many of you likely have questions about the funding the timing and whether or not a specific project that you are thinking about might be eligible under the funding streams that we'll discuss today uh i'll just be upfront and say at this we also have many questions and as we through the presentation um we hope that you will use the chat feature to ask any questions you might have we may not have the answer to everything yet and we may not have time to answer every question live today but we are going to gather your questions and respond on our website in the weeks following this presentation because of the format of this webinar and the number of people in attendance which is um great we have everyone muted currently but as we go through the presentation we'll pause for questions and at that point we'll be able to unmute individuals to ask questions when they raise their as we go through the presentation we'll also be using some new polling features for real time and in addition to responding during this webinar you can also enter your thoughts and feedback through an online portal that we've set up if you'd like more time and more space to respond or if you want more time to consider your responses or if you want to share that with other people who you also think would be interested in providing feedback and i'm going to ask my colleague richie to put the link to that portal in the chat um jen can i have the next slide please oh there you go this is uh our agenda for today an overview of the presentation that we'll be sharing um starting with some information about our agency some background on the infrastructure investment and jobs act including highlights of the energy related we'll then cover the community engagement work we've done so far and what lies ahead in our planning process and towards the end we have some specific opportunities for you to provide input and feedback and we'll also cover how we intend to use the information that we gather today through this and through this process and the presentation materials are posted on our website now and we're also recording this webinar all right so before we dive in for those of you who are new to webex just a quick guide on how to use some of the features as i mentioned before your unmute button and video buttons won't work but our host will be able to unmute you if we call on you to ask a question you can see the option to raise your hand on both the right hand side of your screen and under the excuse me the right-hand side of your screen under the participants panel if you click near your name and there's also an option at the bottom of your screen where you can see a visual of a hand in the reactions bar and also feel free to use the chat function to ask questions or make as you're doing that go ahead and send if you have the option to all panelists or everyone so that the odo staff can see it and help respond and we will try to get to as many of those questions in the chat and through raised hands but again we may not have time for all of that today um you may notice that there's also a q a function or that that might be an option or you might see please don't use that we won't be monitoring that and one more thing to highlight that's not on the slide there on the right side of your screen where you see participants and chat every once in a while there will be a poll that pops up and it will have the title slido on it at that point we'll we'll let you know it's coming and we hope you will participate by checking a little circle and entering a response and then don't forget to press the green send button when you enter your response so it's actually submitted to us okay one more thing to mention um is that if you are calling in on the phone you can press once we unmute you you can press star six to unmute yourself and then i think you press star to raise your hand and please bear with us uh as we try to keep track of all the questions and comments coming in okay so one more thing before we jump in a quick introduction to the oregon department of energy or photo as you might hear is referred to on this slide you see our vision our mission and what we do and our mission is to help oregonians make informed decisions and maintain a resilient and affordable energy system we advance solutions to shape and equitable clean energy transition protect the environment and public health and responsibly balance energy needs and impacts for current and future under what we do on this slide you'll see the services we provide and how we achieve that mission and today we'll be discussing how federal funding opportunities can support our mission and our work for example we know that funding under the federal state energy program can support oregon updates to our energy security plan which will inform efforts to strengthen energy systems in our state and mitigate impacts from disasters next slide please all right our purpose today is twofold first we want to share what we know about federal funding opportunities under the infrastructure investment and jobs act and second we want to seek your input as to how odo should approach these funding based on the input we receive we'll be building statements of guiding priorities which will help us shape our use of formula grants and choose which competitive grants may be the most beneficial for odo to pursue so we are going to start by asking you a question this is going to be our first polling question so that we can gauge your level of awareness on these topics as well as your assessment of your current capacity as of today so we're going to start off with a poll to get a better sense of our audience it should be there on the right hand side of your screen right now the uh will give everyone 45 seconds or a minute to figure this out and and make your selection and don't forget after you've made your selection to press send so you may actually have to scroll down on your um and stacy i'm seeing that it says voting closed so i don't know if it's possible to reopen that there we go um for those of you on the phone i'm sorry we don't have an option to take the poll over the phone but these same questions are uh on the handout that we've provided um i guess we don't call them handouts anymore the email app that we've and in the portal on our website so this question says thinking about your organization or which of these phases or stages would you feel you identify with one haven't started and or new to this two assessing options and interests three prioritizing projects and funding four implementing projects or plans five evaluating or expanding current actually it looks like our polling is slightly different from what i just read but you can see there on your screen hopefully and it looks like we've got a good number number of respondents but let's keep it open for a little bit longer okay well it looks like responses oh no they're still coming in wait another few seconds to close it all right stacy i think the responding has slowed down so go ahead and close out that poll and i think that we will be able to see the responses okay great looks like there are a lot of people who are still assessing their options and interests which is great that's uh um good to know folks are approaching this work um and thinking about what makes sense for them and now i think i'm going to turn it over to jen to provide some background on the infrastructure investment and jobs act thank you everyone for joining us today so just to give us a little bit of a a larger context on the funding opportunities that we're talking about today the infrastructure investment and jobs act is what actually prompted this engagement here this federal law funds american infrastructure projects related roads bridges broadband internet and our energy and water systems throughout the country this was signed into law on november 15 of 2021 and the bipartisan legislation authorizes 1.2 trillion in infrastructure spending nationally and that includes 550 billion in new funding and as we go through this the biden administration is has been referring to this funding under the infrastructure law as a once in general once in a generation investment in our infrastructure systems and energy is certainly included as part of that overall investment the biden administration also has concerns about investing these federal dollars so that the benefits serve communities that have been historically disadvantaged while there's many details and definitions still to be set at the federal level it does look like the biden administration intends to direct 40 of the benefits of these funds that are energy related under the infrastructure investment and jobs act disadvantaged communities and so here at odo we'll be keeping this requirement in mind as we shape up all of our relevant proposals and program and you can see some of the federal executive orders that that touch on some of these issues related to disadvantaged communities and serving those that have been historically underserved and that aligns with some state priorities because here at oda we recognize that historically there have been certain groups that have been left out of the decision-making roles when it comes to energy",

meeting my supervisor and our policy analyst is Sarah esterson near to my left to the back of the room you might have met her as you came in as Erica Ewan she is our Comm specialist Communications and at the desk back there with her not only does she have the computer to sign up for notices she also has a paper comment form if you wish to speak tonight in public comment period we ask that you get one of those so that we can call you up by name and have the information of your name and address so we can follow up with you in the comments um you can also provide comments through our online comment portal the information is in the notice and we will have a microphone open for public comment after the presentations are are finished just some general housekeeping that I wanted to start with is we have restrooms across to the left outside the door and most importantly the emergency exits for this room are out the hallway to the rights there's an emergency exit door should we have to evacuate the building for any reason um so I just want to make sure everybody understands that we also have in the room the project proponents the Pacific Power team geninello is in the back he will also be speaking later tonight and he can introduce the rest of his team when that opportunity arises so I just wanted again to thank everybody and we have people online that are participating that this meeting is for the public it is to engage the public it is to provide you with an information on a notice of from Pacific Power to apply for a site certificate they have not submitted an application yet this is the initial stage and so in part of our process for this citing division is we hold a public informational meeting in the area affected by the proposed project and that's why we are here from the Department of energy and this is our meeting we're hosting it for our process specific power here is here as the applicant the project proponent as a part of the requirements of our noticeable Texas so when we get we get presentation part we will present Sarah and I on the energy facility citing process the citing process that a state certificate that falls in our jurisdiction goes through and then we'll hand it over to the applicant who will give you more information on the proposed project and then we'll have the Q a in comment so like I said national meeting it's to give you an opportunity to get information and give us feedback and also we're asking that you can hold your comments and your questions until that to the comment period it's important that everybody be respectful so we just ask that people speak with respect and behave accordingly and we have a lot of material to cover but uh process should be uh beneficial to you if you have participated and come in so just some background on the application that we have received on April 27th of this year we received the notice of intent submitted by Pacific Power and that is to um it's the very first step in our process like I said and that initiated our issuing the public notice issuing it in the paper mailing it to proper affected property owners and scheduling this fee it's like everyone so I want to give you a little video about the energy facility setting program and the energy facility citing the energy facility setting Council are the decision makers oversight certificates while under their they are a seven person body they are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state senate they represent a diverse array of areas and backgrounds we currently have seven members or all the positions are built and they are the on anything that falls in their jurisdiction that has to go through our we Sarah and I and Nancy hatch who's also here is our administrative assistant in Erica we work for the Department of energy and we work in the citing Division and we are the technical support staff to the energy facility citing Council so we're charged with doing environmental review for an evidentiary based process so applicants and components of projects that have to get a site certificate from the stadium have to feed the information to us that we have to analyze and review and we make recommendations to our Council based status There are 16 General standards of review that I'll get to in another slide and we're Consolidated process so it allows an applicant to kind of funnel all of their other requirements for permits and the idea is to reduce redundancies in the permitting process and a site certificate from the citing council is ultimately a formative to sight and energy facility based upon their next slide so what types of facilities fall under the upside exciting process it needs to be a state jurisdictional energy facility that meets the definition under our Oregon statutes 469 300 subpart 11. and these are a list of the types of facilities that fall under jurisdiction so we've highlighted that this is a high voltage transmission line and that is an energy facility that has fallen under console jurisdiction next one so a little bit more about the transmission line in order for it to to require a site certificate from our Council and has to check these three boxes needs to be greater than 10 miles in length it needs to be greater or equal to 230 kilovolt capacity and it needs to cross one more more than one jurisdiction and because this proposed transmission line checks all three boxes it requires that the applicant the proponent get a site certificate from the state through the energy facility citing next slide so as I mentioned earlier we have standards of review that we as deciding division have to evaluate every proposal that comes to us to make sure that the applicant or the proponent has the ability to meet the requirements of each of these standards so we have 16 standards there are some that are specific to transmission lines and we as the citing division staff this is a lot of what we do is we put these projects through this evidentiary review process to confirm whether or not these proposed projects can actually need these standards and then we make recommendations to council um the burden of proof to show whether or not your project meets in all of these 16 standards is the applicants so they need to submit to us adequate and sufficient information that would demonstrate that they have done their adequate environmental review and planning to design a project that can meet these and since we're in the notice of intent stage we're really seeking input that from the public on anything that you might want to provide based upon the information that we have right now but there's more to our process and it's really important to understand where it's step one we're at the notice of intent stage next slide so in this traffic I think is really helpful because it shows our process like in a in a schematic and as the red box will show you we're at the beginning we're at the notice of intent phase and one of the things that I really wanted to highlight is the boxes in green or every phase of our project a process that really provide for and encourage public participation and input so at the notice of intent stage you have an opportunity to provide input if the applicant decides or the proponent decides to submit a full application for a site certificate you will again have an opportunity to provide input and permit where we encourage our public participation in our process it's very important to our Council because that helps inform them and they are the ultimate deciders it helps them make a good decision so in this scheme We have basically seven steps and I'm going to go through them really quickly but after a notice of intent is issued we hold a public meeting we provide a comment period on that notice of intent with the information that was included in it and we have a comment period that comment period for this notice notice of intent is open until July 7th so you can comment anytime on the notice of intent up until that time and we take all the information that we get from input at the notice of intense phase from our reviewing agencies we have to coordinate with tribes and other state agencies who review The Proposal as well and give us comments back on what they think about it we can file all that information and we issue our project order and then that project order is basically a punch list of the requirements for the project proponent to that they have to include in their application should they choose to submit an application they will submit a preliminary application and in that you the department will go through and make sure that they're that it's complete and that it has sufficient information to determine whether or not each of these standards are met and there's a little back and forth that goes between us and the applicant to get it to what we call once we have a complete application we issue another notice we post it on the website and again there's a public comment period on the formal application we will then review all that information and prepare what is called a draft proposed order and that is a fairly technical document that summarizes each of those 16 standards I mentioned and our evaluation of that and we give recommendations to our Council of whether or not we think that there are either conditions that need to be prescriptive kind of conditions to meet the standard or if the standard has been done but there are recommendations and we take that to our Council the council reviews it we have a public hearing and when we have the public hearing we'll be back down here to have it and we take all of that comment from our Council from the public from the reviewing agencies and we have to basically issue a revised document which is a proposed order and then that proposed order",

        "text": " I talked about about the proposed facility about the notice of intent and all of that information will get summarized in what Odo prepares which is the next step which is the project order and the project order is something I will prepare as the signing analyst and gets reviewed and approved through our department and we prepared that project order for the purposes of giving it back to the applicant and that project order will contain really specific information about what needs to be included in their preliminary application so the applicant will be working on the materials for preliminary application and they will submit a preliminary application should they choose to um based upon what they're required to submit and it will be in the project order and that project order is underway and it will be issued in the middle of June is the deadline to to issue that to the applicant and then it come starts the application process so the first step is a preliminary application the applicant submits to the perment a preliminary application with all of the required exhibits that cover all of the 16 standards that we have and we as a department have to review that for completeness it has to have sufficient and adequate information for Council to really reach a conclusion on whether or not a standard is met um we also issue another public notice that says we've received a preliminary application it gets updated on the web page we will also an an informational meeting then and open it up for comment and then we go back to those reviewing agencies and coordinate pardon no com oh no comment okay I'm sorry public notice information meeting not on the preliminary okay and then the agency coordination is ongoing throughout so we're going to consult once we've deemed it complete that's what we call an ASC it's the full complete application and we can move forward with drafting the draft proposed order which is the next step so the department will prepare a draft proposed order once it's issued we issue notice we post it on the public website we have a public hearing the public hearing will be an opportunity for the public to participate and and make comments on the record for the application and that makes that's important to know because it ties to the contested case so in order order to participate in a contested case you need to make comments at the draft proposed order public hearing stage before that public comment period closes on the draft proposed order once we're done with that we take all of those comments and we incorporate that information we may make revisions and we issue what is called a proposed order both times Council will review we'll take the draft proposed order for Council review we'll make edits changes revisions as recommended by Council or in response to comments and we'll issue a proposed order that proposed order will be issued by the department along with another public notice it is not open for public comment at this time but that notice will also include the notice of contested case so it's your opportunity at that point to request a contested case once the proposed order is issued that notice goes out that notice on the contested case goes out you can ask as to participate in that contested case and then at the very end is the final Order final decision by the energy facility sighting Council so council is involved in all of these stages but the decision is ultimately theirs and they make that decision on whether to issue or you know I don't know what the other issue options would be amend amend okay a they'll approve a final order we will issue that final order the chair will then sign a site certificate and the site certificate will be granted I know you have a question we can go back to this later on we can come back to this slide when we open Q&amp;A okay so next slid so I did talk a little bit about reviewing agencies and special advisory groups and and their role I think that the important thing to realize is you know the the special Advisory Group for this facility is Wasco County because they are the local government um and they've been appointed as the special Advisory Group the other reviewing agencies also have the opportunity to make recommendations one of the key things that we look for is the description of the analysis area what areas need to be included in the application review and part of that is to identify the studies that may need to be conducted any local ordinances or or local government and other administrative rules that might need to be considered in the application and included and also identification of any required permits that might be required of the applicant in order to move forward with the so I mentioned that we are a standards based project process and this slide shows our 16 citing standards it is the burden of proof of the applicant applicant to demonstrate that on the record they can meet each standard it is the Department's role to evaluate that evidence because we're an evidentiary process and to consider are all the comments received and determine whether or not the applicant has demonstrated that they can meet that standard and then we make those recommendations to the FC the council who will evaluate all that making their decision because we are at the notice of intent phase we are seeking any type of comment that anyone wants to revise or provide but it's important if you do want to participate and comment in our that comments realize we are a standards based Pro process these standards apply to facilities we have um more literature on the table over there if you want to learn more about these but these are the things that Council has to consider with each of these standards when they consider whether or not to issue or deny or remand back an application for a site certificate okay and in the notice of intent we have mandatory study area distances that are that tie to these standards and one of the things that we're Consulting on is whether these need to be made bigger smaller um based upon potential resources or concerns that reviewing agencies or the public may have or our special Advisory Group so each stand has its own kind of extent of what that study area is this is for what had to be included in the notice of intent in the project order these may change they might get bigger they might get smaller based upon available information but it just gives you an overview of kind of like how we look at the site boundary the the resources and standards that we consider um around that site boundary as we ask the applicant to prepare information to submit in their preliminary application okay next slide so as I noted before the state sighting process is Consolidated review that pulls most permits standards and requirements from local governments and state agencies into one process and so for land use the applicant has the option to have the land use review either be conducted by the local government which would be Bosco County or to have Consolidated into our state review and the notice of intent the applicant has indicated they want to consolidate it within the state review at the time they submit their application they have to commit they can pick one or the other but they can't change it once they've picked it in the application and the land just as a consideration um for this one the land within the proposed site boundary is all zoned A1 efu land it's nonirrigated um and is currently used for growing winter wheat and and grazing just if people were interested okay next step next slide so really quickly and then I'm going to turn it over to the applicant team the notice of inted is applying for a new new site certificate a site certificate for a new proposed facility it is going to have a 2011 megawatt name plate capacity at the point of interconnection which is where it connects with the the transmission line um and it's going to be cited on 4,061 acres here in Wasco County it will have a wind generating component it will also have a solar generating component and the solar array will be approximately 274 Acres within a 474 acre fence solar area they're proposing approximately 32 wind turbines with a maximum blade tip height of 648 ft next slide there are also related or supporting facilities that are proposed in the notice of intent includes a battery storage what we call a best on would occupy up to 10 acres and it would store up to 201 megawatts of energy there are other facility components such as a switching station a collector substation I pointed at the point of interconnect is intended or proposed to be with the Bonville power uh void Ridge switchyard there will be above and below ground uh 34.5 kilovolt collection there will be a 10,000 ft\u00b2 o&amp;m building and 8 miles of approximately 8 miles of 230 KV overhead transmission line and some new access roads 10.2 some Road improvements of approximately 13 miles um another set of staging areas and temporary batch plant those staging areas are primarily for construction purposes and I believe that is my last slide and I am going to turn it over to the applicant team to present more on the actual proposed facility and then we will when they're done we'll go right into public comment do you have their slides okay it's all you okay just to be clear you're GNA double back to the public comment slide that preceded this okay thank you um so thanks again folks again samfield and I head up the development team at IPA power IPA power is um what in the industry is called a independent power producer which means that we uh originate or initiate develop build own and operate renewable generation and battery storage facilities um ipop power was uh founded in 2017 under a different name it was acquired by Blackstone one of the largest uh asset owners across real estate energy and and other Industries globally uh in in 2020 um and we have been developing utility scale uh again battery storage wind and solar energy facilities and and hybridizations of those different Technologies uh across North America since that time uh we're currently 114 uh people strong or heading headquarters are in Austin Texas and uh I'm based in in Portland uh Matt who I'll turn it over to in a in a minute um is based in Idaho um but our sort of majority headcount sits sits in Austin uh IPA is a very credible developer owner and operator of these types of facilities um most of our team came from other independent power producers and have been working in this space for 20 plus years um we're currently operating uh 150 megawatts in Texas we're under construction on another 150 megawatts in Texas 100 megawatts in Los Angeles and California uh and then we",
